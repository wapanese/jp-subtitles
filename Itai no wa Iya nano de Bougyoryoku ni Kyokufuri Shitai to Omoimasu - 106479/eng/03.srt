1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,000
"• Changed some explanation texts
and categories of the main menu's tutorial
• [Graphics Settings] now can be tuned between
five levels from the previous three"

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,660
"• Skill Revisions
Skill [Devour] has been revised as follows:
Implemented a usage limit.
Can be used a maximum of 10 times per day."

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,750
The only things that affects us
are some of the skill fixes.

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,200
They limited the number
of times you can use Devour.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,950
Yeah, it's just ten times a day!

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,040
Well, I saw it coming.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,290
A shield that eats everything
and gives you MP is way too strong.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,040
Ugh, and then there's the whole thing
about defense-piercing stuff.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,410
They just fixed it so even you take damage now.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,410
I guarantee the developers did it
as a countermeasure to Maple.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,950
And the AI improvements are to make sure
there're no more Maples to come.

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,330
It would destroy the game's balance
if everyone got Total Defense.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,950
But, hey. While on one hand
you can take damage now,

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,330
doesn't that make it cooler?

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,540
All the damage effects coming out
will make you feel even more invincible!

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,120
Take this!

17
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,410
Gah! She's not falling no matter what we do!

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,830
She's a monster!

19
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,160
It's my turn now.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,450
Hydra!

21
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,160
Well?

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,160
That sounds awesome!

23
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,160
"Defense and Reaching Second Level"
Aw, they limited me.

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,080
"Defense and Reaching Second Level"
What should we do?
Beat the dungeon to reach Level 2?

25
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
That's fine, but...

26
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,870
Since I've always just gone to the lake,
I still haven't seen much of Level 1.

27
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,200
I'd like to check out
some places I haven't seen.

28
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,700
Now that you mention it,
there's quite a few places I haven't been.

29
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,450
Then let's take a look around today!

30
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,290
We might come across something cool in a shop!

31
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,330
Right!

32
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,660
Oh! I think I'll buy this skill!

33
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,120
"Cover Move"?

34
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,620
Yup! If you're ever in a pinch,
I'll be able to shield you right away!

35
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,620
Come again!

36
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,830
Thanks for waiting!

37
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,410
Ooh, a weapon store!

38
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,330
Huh?

39
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,750
Hey, Big Sis! Shouldn't we buy
good weapons to start out with?

40
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,450
Hmm. But if we spend too much,
we won't be able to afford potions later.

41
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,660
They're so cute! They remind me
of back when I was a newbie!

42
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,370
You know, we're still only newbies ourselves.

43
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,750
Oh, right!

44
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,870
Let's buy weapons! Weapons!

45
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,040
Um, well... But...

46
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,540
C'mon, Big Sis! Decide already!

47
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,870
Maple! Still have some money?

48
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,620
Yup! Just what's left over after
paying Iz to make a new shield.

49
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,450
Then, do you wanna see what that's all about?

50
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,080
Welcome! Please have a seat!

51
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,660
You're quite the celebrity now.

52
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,290
Huh? What was that?

53
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,450
It's nothing. Pop!

54
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,910
Whoa, there's so many choices!

55
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,700
Got that right!

56
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,870
"Strawberry Tart" "The sweetness and
texture of shortbread and almonds topped
with strawberries and delicious cream."
Oh! It says this one's seasonal!

57
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,290
"Strawberry Tart" "The sweetness and
texture of shortbread and almonds topped
with strawberries and delicious cream."
I'm picking that!

58
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,700
"Strawberry Tart" "The sweetness and
texture of shortbread and almonds topped
with strawberries and delicious cream."
Then I'll go with this.

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,120
I've brought your order!

60
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,790
Ooh! It's just like the real thing!

61
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,450
Please enjoy!

62
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,120
Thank you!

63
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,160
It's chow time!

64
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,790
Delicious!

65
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,160
I bet this would be so pricey in the real world!

66
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,120
And no need to worry about the calories either!

67
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,410
So true!

68
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,330
I wonder when the next event will be?

69
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,870
Wouldn't it be great
if we could pair up together?

70
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,080
Wasn't the first event a battle royal though?

71
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,450
Yeah. And I don't really want
to fight you, either.

72
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,870
They announced a new event not long ago.

73
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,750
Huh?

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,450
You're Maple, aren't you?

75
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,620
You got third place last event.

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,200
I am, but who are you?

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,870
Come on, at least remember my name!

78
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,370
I was second place. Dread.

79
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,870
And I was fifth place. Drag.

80
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,370
I saw you talking with Frederica.
Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,200
Uh, nice to meet you.

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,250
Who's this Frederica?

83
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,620
Remember asking someone where
to fight monsters at? That's her.

84
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,790
Ahh!

85
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,950
You really surprised her good.

86
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:43,080
She never thought the newbie she
gave advice to would land third place.

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,790
Well, I mean... I was just
really lucky, that's all.

88
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh, you're right! It says the second event
will start next weekend!

89
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,580
"2nd event begins!!"
Oh, you're right! It says the second event
will start next weekend!

90
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,660
We can party, too!

91
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,910
Thank goodness! We can do it together, Sally!

92
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,160
If we ever cross paths, go easy on us, 'kay?

93
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,660
But Dread placed second
and Drag got fifth, right?

94
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,950
You two must be pretty good!

95
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,290
You know it.

96
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,660
But even with the both of us,
we're really no match for Payne.

97
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,790
Payne?

98
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,660
You don't know Payne?!

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,700
He's the one who placed first by a huge margin.

100
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,620
And he reached Level 2 faster
than anyone else. The guy's incredible.

101
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,040
Whoa! To think there's people that awesome!
It sure is a wide world!

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,500
Now then, we're off to build up some levels.

103
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,870
And you guys?

104
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,450
There's still places we haven't seen on Level 1,
so we're looking around.

105
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,500
Since we don't really have anywhere in mind,
do you have any suggestions?

106
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,120
Suggestions? Let's see...

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,370
If you have time for it,
how about the north forest?

108
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,500
After nightfall, I hear there's a quest
to get the Super Speed skill.

109
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,540
However, it might be high difficulty
for girls like you. What do you say?

110
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,910
We'll do it!

111
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,540
I wonder what he meant by
"it's high difficulty for girls?"

112
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:16,080
No idea! But when he puts it like that,
it fires me up!

113
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,290
You okay, Sally?

114
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,500
This is a game! This is a game! This is a game!

115
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,540
No worries! I'm good!

116
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,620
You don't seem good to me at all.

117
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,120
Wanna run? Let's run! Let's do it!

118
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,950
Hmm? Oh!

119
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,620
Ooh, what pretty flames!
There's even a green one!

120
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,660
What?!

121
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,080
Over there! Let's go inside!

122
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,660
Is this what he meant by it
being difficult for girls?

123
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,660
I happen to be a girl, too, by the way.

124
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,410
This place is falling apart. Want me to explore?

125
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,750
It's all you.

126
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,500
You've been scared of ghosts since forever.

127
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,250
I'll never complete the quest like this!

128
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,450
Good grief. I wonder if I should just log out?

129
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,540
I don't think they'll bother us
if we stay inside.

130
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,750
Eep! No!

131
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,000
S-Something's there! B-By the table!

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,620
The table?

133
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,370
This is...? Looks like there's a basement.

134
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,370
It hurts! It hurts!

135
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,500
He doesn't seem like he's hostile.

136
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,540
Maybe he's the quest giver?

137
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,830
What now?

138
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,500
Since he's saying he's in pain,
maybe I'll fix that.

139
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,790
Potion!

140
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,040
It hurts! It hurts!

141
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,160
Huh? That didn't work.

142
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,620
I could... try healing.

143
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,080
Okay! Go for it!

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,620
It hurts!

145
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,910
Heal!

146
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,910
It worked!

147
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,830
But I guess it's not enough
unless you keep at it.

148
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,040
Heal!

149
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
This is the last I've got!

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,950
Heal!

151
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,830
Thank you...

152
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,790
Do you think this means he's resting in peace?

153
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,250
Seems that way. Hmm? Oh! Look!

154
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,450
It's the Super Speed skill!
I think we did the quest just now!

155
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,160
It's getting late. I think I'll
log out for today after this.

156
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,500
To be honest, there's somewhere else
I wanted to go though.

157
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,080
What's this place?

158
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,450
Fireball!

159
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,950
A never-ending sunset area.

160
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,790
I hear you can come here anytime
and see this scenery.

161
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,830
Seeing the sunset after nightfall
sure is a strange feeling.

162
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,700
What's that?

163
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,160
It says [Matter Red Mother of Pearl].
Oh, there's another!

164
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,620
A souvenir, maybe? I don't know
if they're used as materials, but...

165
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,830
...maybe they're just to sell?

166
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,580
I think I'll keep it and treasure it!

167
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,870
Yeah. Seems like a waste to sell it.

168
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,200
Today was so much fun!

169
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,160
Tomorrow, it's back to leveling up
and gathering skills.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,700
Let's at least get to Level 2 before the event.

171
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,080
Oh, yeah. What's the other place
that you wanted to go?

172
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,870
Well...

173
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,370
You'll have to look forward to it.

174
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,830
Hey, what gives?! Tell me!

175
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,620
Not happening. Not till Level 2.

176
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,200
Sheesh!

177
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,660
You've done it now!

178
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,620
Take this!

179
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,250
You little...!

180
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,500
This entrance leads to the second level.

181
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,410
All right! Let's head on inside!

182
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,750
Should I go this way?

183
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,370
That's fine!

184
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,000
It's coming!

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
Leave it to me!

186
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,950
Devour!

187
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,000
Yippie!

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,450
There's more coming!

189
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,160
Devour is just way too good!

190
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,250
But I used it four times just now.

191
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,080
I've only got six more uses today!

192
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,250
Whoa! That surprised me!

193
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,080
It's a bear this time?

194
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Maple, defend us!

195
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,410
Right!

196
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,950
Mirage.

197
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,410
Huh? Wha--? What?!

198
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,830
--Where did...?! But I was holding my shield!

199
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,370
--Good luck!
--Where did...?! But I was holding my shield!

200
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,200
Huh? What was that?

201
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,370
A skill called Mirage. I wanted to
test it out before the event.

202
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,410
Oh?

203
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,410
Let's keep pushing ahead! Let's go!

204
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,950
This is...?

205
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,000
The boss room, probably.

206
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,370
Here it comes!

207
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,620
Okay!

208
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,120
Hydra!

209
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,080
Huh?!

210
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,250
My bet's on the magic circle!
There's gotta be something to it!

211
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,120
I'm gonna go investigate!
Can you keep it off of me?

212
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
All right!

213
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,450
Provocation!

214
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,870
Wind Cutter!

215
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,620
That's it! Attack those apples!

216
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,830
Hydra!

217
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,160
All the apples fell off!

218
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Wind Cutter!

219
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,700
Nice! Got him!

220
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,370
Time to pull out the big guns!

221
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,540
Maple!

222
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,200
Maple!

223
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,910
Looks like she'll be out for a while.

224
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,750
Oh, well! Guess I'll do it alone!

225
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,830
Double Slash!

226
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
Fireball!

227
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,040
Is this a bad spot?!

228
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,200
Wind Cutter!

229
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,620
Now you're finished!

230
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,410
Power Attack!

231
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,370
Sh-Shoot! I've gotta attack!

232
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,200
Huh?

233
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,950
I wrapped things up while you slept.

234
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,620
Talk about a total letdown.

235
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,870
Now, now. You'll have a chance
to redeem yourself here on Level 2.

236
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,250
Maple!

237
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,080
Huh?

238
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,410
Oh! Iz!

239
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,700
You came to the second level, too?

240
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,120
Yes, and I already have a shop here.
Is this a friend of yours?

241
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,950
Yeah, this is Sally!

242
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,330
Hello! Maple has told me
all sorts of things about you!

243
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm the crafter, Iz. Nice to meet you!

244
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,410
Oh, right! I completed the item
you asked me to make!

245
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,330
Really?!

246
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,370
Thank you so much!

247
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,620
Incredible! So pretty!

248
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,370
I'm rather proud of it myself!

249
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,120
What will you name it?

250
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,000
Snow White! I'll call it Snow White!

251
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,290
"Equipment/Armor" "Skill"
"[Body]" "Armor of the Black Rose".
"[Right Hand]" "Crescent Moon" "Hydra"
That's such a lovely name.

252
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,250
"[Left Hand]" "Snow White"
"[Legs]" "Armor of the Black Rose"
"[Accessories]" "Forest Queen Bee's Ring" "Toughness Ring"
I maxed out its vitality as much as I could.

253
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,410
All so it would better match your playstyle.

254
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,500
Lucky you to get it in time
for the second event.

255
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,540
Yeah!

256
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,410
Now, to celebrate the occasion...

257
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,580
Hmm?

258
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,080
This must be the place you were talking about!

259
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm guessing something happens once we sit.

260
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,160
Let's both sit down at the same time then!

261
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Okay!

262
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,200
Ready, go!

263
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,620
What's this?

264
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,160
Whoa! Huh?

265
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
"Today's Special
Small Piece of Sky
Please enjoy your meal."
A Small Piece of Sky...

266
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,040
It says, "Please enjoy your meal."

267
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,830
How is it, Maple?

268
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,450
Mmm! It's like eating strawberries,
oranges, and apples all at once!

269
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,830
Hmm. As for this...

270
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,580
Sally! Your hair is glowing!

271
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,540
What?! Your eye color's all weird, too!

272
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,500
Huh?

273
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,040
You think it'll go back to normal?

274
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,750
Probably. Just give it some time.

275
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,250
It's only been one month,
yet it feels like I've come so far.

276
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,870
To think you were so reluctant at first.

277
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,200
Those days are way in the past!

278
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,450
I hope we end up doing well in the second event.

279
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,660
Yeah!

280
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,950
I'm a little nervous,
this being my first event and all.

281
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,660
There're just as many people as last time!

282
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,000
I guess nearly everyone participates in events.

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,370
Oh, Kuromu!

284
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,000
Hmm? Ah, it's been a while!

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,080
You've got a new shield, huh?

286
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,250
Yeah! I'm planning to save Devour
for when I really need it!

287
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,540
Is this the rumored friend of yours?

288
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, this is Sally!

289
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,700
Huh? Rumored friend?

290
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,330
Uh, forget it! It's nothing!

291
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:38,500
Listen! With this event, we'll bolster
the reputation of the Flame Emperors!

292
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,080
I promise you. As long as you're with me,
you will taste only victory!

293
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,040
As members of the Flame Emperors,
hold pride in your heart!

294
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,750
Follow me to the ends of
the Earth and beyond the skies!

295
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,910
Will not our fierce flames scorch
whatever stands in our path?!

296
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah!

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,080
Ooh, they're pumped up!

298
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,950
That's a group called the Flame Emperors.

299
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,120
Emperors?

300
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,830
--Kingdom of the Flame Emperors.
Their leader's a powerful Fire Wizard.

301
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,290
--Take heart! We are comrades of the flame!
--Kingdom of the Flame Emperors.
Their leader's a powerful Fire Wizard.

302
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,580
--Take heart! We are comrades of the flame!
--Her name's Mii. She came in fourth,
but she's a force to be reckoned with.

303
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,790
--Harness the flame in your heart!
This event is no one's but ours to conquer!
--Her name's Mii. She came in fourth,
but she's a force to be reckoned with.

304
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,000
--Harness the flame in your heart!
This event is no one's but ours to conquer!
--Oh, Mii? That's a cute name,
but she sounds awesome!

305
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,950
--Oh, Mii? That's a cute name,
but she sounds awesome!

306
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,580
Rawr!

307
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,870
The countdown for the second event
will begin momentarily!

308
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,290
This time, the event is a treasure hunt!

309
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,120
The items to be found are 300 silver medals
scattered around the map!

310
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,540
"2nd Event Explanation Rawr!"
Collect ten of these
for a gold medal!

311
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,660
"2nd Event Explanation Rawr!"
Gold medals can be exchanged for skills
and gear after the event is over!

312
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,450
Oh. It's just like the one I got last time.

313
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,120
The top ten players from last event
already have one gold medal each.

314
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,660
Killing players for medals is A-OK!

315
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,160
You can always search for medals
if that's not for you!

316
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,120
Huh? It wasn't a commemorative medal after all!

317
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,700
I was ninth place, so I got a medal too.
Be careful it's not taken from you.

318
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,580
Right!

319
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,660
Let's start the countdown!

320
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,700
--Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

321
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,910
--Let's do our best!
--Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

322
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,910
--Yeah!
--Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

323
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,580
"The 2nd event begins!"

324
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,410
"1. The 2nd event begins!"

325
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,040
"1. The 2nd event begins!"
"2. Woo!"

326
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,540
"1. The 2nd event begins!"
"2. Woo!"
"3. Can't wait!"

327
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,950
"1. The 2nd event begins!"
"2. Woo!"
"3. Can't wait!"
"4. Good luck, Maple!"
