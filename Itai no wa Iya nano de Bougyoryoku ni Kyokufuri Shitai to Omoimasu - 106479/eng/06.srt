1
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,750
I guess I didn't get much sleep last night.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,450
Morning, Kaede!

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,700
Oh! Morning, Risa!

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,870
It feels like forever since
we've been to school.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,790
Sure does. It's only been
one night in real life though.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,580
Kaede, you best be careful today.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,000
Huh? Why?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,700
Your in-game habits might sneak up on you.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,120
This was the first time you've spent
a week in game, right?

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,910
That's a good point.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,950
Okay! I'll be careful!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,040
Kaede... Kaede?

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,580
Huh? It's my turn to keep watch?!

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,830
Kaede Honjo...

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
That's why I said to be careful.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,580
Ugh, that was so embarrassing!

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,830
Whoa!

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,450
Oh, sorry!

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,700
Kaede!

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Huh?

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,160
Never mind! Never mind!

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,000
You're just as nimble in real life!

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,910
Kaede!

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,040
Hmm?

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,750
Replica of the Dark Night!

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,830
Huh?!

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,410
You all right, Kaede?

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,580
A break from gaming might be a good idea.

29
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,120
"Defense and Reinforcements"

30
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,410
It's been three days!

31
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,160
Welcome back, Maple!

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,540
While you were away, some brand-new
features got added to the game!

33
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,160
Some brand-new features?

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,330
Yup! There's a new insect called a Bright Bug
that appears in some zones.

35
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,950
If you can catch one, you earn
the right to buy a guild house!

36
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,080
A guild house?

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,410
You know how there're buildings
you can't get into?

38
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,000
You can make one of those your own home!

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
What?! That's awesome!

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,160
We've stayed in lots of inns and huts, but...

41
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,620
...now we can have a home base!

42
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,000
L-Let's go looking for a Bright Bug then!

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,080
I thought you'd say that.

44
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,620
Ta-da!

45
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,620
I snatched one while you were on break!

46
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,330
Ooh! That's my Sally!

47
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,750
With all the gold we've got,
we can buy a house whenever!

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,000
Awesome! Sally, you're awesome!

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,700
Praise me even more!

50
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,000
It sure is tough finding the perfect house.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,910
All the good ones are too
expensive or already taken.

52
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,160
It's 'cuz there're tons of guilds
expanding lately.

53
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,410
Really?

54
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,370
Yeah. For example,
the "Flame Emperors" we saw before.

55
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,000
The guild master Mii's been recruiting
like mad with that charisma of hers,

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,700
and they're totally massive now.

57
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,750
And some winners of the first event
formed "Order of the Holy Sword."

58
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,200
Payne's the guild master,
plus Dread and Drag are in it, too.

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,160
There's also that Frederica person
Drag was talking about.

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,450
By the way, rumor has it that
Payne's already level 60!

61
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,250
Level 60?! And here I am
just barely crossing 30!

62
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm about the same.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,750
At this point, Payne's probably
the number one player by a long shot.

64
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,250
Payne, huh?

65
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,250
Hmm?

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,290
What's that?

67
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,580
I think it's still up for grabs!

68
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,910
This might be the one!

69
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,540
It kinda reminds me of a hideout.

70
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,790
It's bigger than I thought!

71
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,250
You like it, Maple?

72
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,080
Yeah! I think it's great!

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,950
Let's seal the deal!

74
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,870
As of now, this house is officially ours!

75
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,160
Woo-hoo!

76
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,950
Thank goodness! Syrup and Oboro like it, too!

77
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,910
Thing is, don't you think it's
a little big for just us?

78
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,540
This guild house lets us recruit up to
50 people! What should we do?

79
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,540
Let's invite Kasumi and Kanade!

80
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,620
I knew you'd say that.

81
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,750
I'll shoot a message their way.

82
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,950
Thanks so much, you two!

83
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,870
I really appreciate the invite.

84
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,580
Had I known you two made a guild,
I would've been asking to join it.

85
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,950
Good to know. I'm glad you're in.

86
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,950
Huh? It's Kuromu and Iz!

87
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh! If it isn't Maple and Sally!

88
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,660
Yo!

89
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,870
You on a date, perhaps?

90
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,330
Give me a break! We were out
collecting materials.

91
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,330
Hmm? Isn't that Kasumi who
placed sixth in the first event?

92
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,330
And that's...

93
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,950
Kanade, a friend of mine!

94
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,410
Nice to meet you.

95
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,620
Same here. It's a pleasure.

96
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,870
Aha! Are you guys thinking
about forming a guild?

97
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,290
Yup! Actually, we just got finished
adding them to ours!

98
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,200
I know! Kuromu and Iz!
Would you like to join, too?!

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,790
Us?

100
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,870
Hmm...

101
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,910
If it's you two running the guild,
I would love to try it out!

102
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,620
Me, too. As long as it's okay
with the other members.

103
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,910
Kasumi? Kanade? Well?

104
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,580
Sure. Fine by me.

105
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,040
Thank goodness! You don't mind either, right?

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,500
Of course not!

107
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,200
Let's get everyone registered then!

108
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,160
What a lovely house this is!

109
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Agreed! It seems so cozy in here!

110
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,540
Maple's the guild master, right?

111
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,120
M-Me?

112
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,290
Of course! You're the one who picked
the house and members after all!

113
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,290
No complaints here!

114
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,700
Introduce yourself, Guild Master!

115
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,040
Huh? Uh, um...

116
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,540
I guess this makes me your guild master, Maple!

117
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,040
I'm good at poison and defense!

118
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,910
I hope we all get along!

119
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,790
Now all that's left is picking a guild name.

120
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,250
You should decide. You're the guild master.

121
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,410
You think? In that case...

122
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,200
"Maple Tree"! The guild name
will be "Maple Tree"!

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
So this is the famous flying turtle!

124
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,790
That's right! His name is Syrup!

125
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,620
I can see why you're the talk of the town.

126
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,910
You think we're that famous?

127
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,250
You're super famous! Haven't you noticed?

128
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,120
I guess it just hasn't sunk in yet.

129
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,660
Oh! There's the mine you were talking about, Iz!

130
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,830
Thanks for the lift, Syrup!

131
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,000
We should be able to get
lots of materials in here.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,620
Yeah! We're counting on you, Kanade!

133
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,500
Leave it to me!

134
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,120
Akashic Records gave me [Mining V] to use today.

135
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,410
I'm sure we'll dig up a ton!

136
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,580
But I might not get the same skill tomorrow,

137
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,040
so let's get as much done as we can today.

138
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,870
What a neat item!

139
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,370
Getting a random skill every day
reminds me of a slot machine!

140
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,160
We've got company.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,790
Leave the defense to me!
You two focus on mining!

142
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,750
Got it!

143
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,120
It's all you, Maple!

144
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,910
Double Slash!

145
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Sally's pretty frightening, too.

146
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,080
We don't even have a chance to fight.

147
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,790
Could've left item gathering all to her.

148
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,540
Fireball!

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,950
Sweet! Got some!

150
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,830
I wonder if this is enough?

151
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,580
At any rate, this'll be great
to top off the guild fund!

152
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,620
What's that aura of yours?

153
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,700
It's the [Sword Dance] skill.

154
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,370
Dodging attacks gives me bonus strength.

155
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,080
Still can't hold a candle to Maple though.

156
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,330
Huh? Just how high is Maple's vitality anyway?

157
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,700
Why don't you ask her yourself?
I think she'd be happy to tell you!

158
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,120
Time to show what I'm made of!

159
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,040
Can you believe that's a Great Shielder?

160
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,500
I know, right?

161
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
It's the same for me.

162
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,410
I may lose sight of what's
normal being in this guild.

163
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,830
Me, too. So much for my respectable play style.

164
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,540
I think we've all been infected by Maple.

165
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,290
Let's do our duty and collect items
for the guild master!

166
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,620
'Cuz we don't wanna disappoint her!

167
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,870
--Yup!
--Yeah!

168
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,250
Without further ado, I'd like to begin
Maple Tree's first guild meeting!

169
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,000
Kuromu tells me he has a suggestion to make!

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,580
As everyone knows, the admins
made a new announcement.

171
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,370
It's about the third and fourth events
plus the upcoming third level.

172
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,080
That's a lot of stuff.

173
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,290
With the influx of people,
the admins must think it's worthwhile.

174
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,750
The third event is in one week.

175
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,200
There's gonna be a special monster
to fight and collect what it drops.

176
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,700
It seems like a simple concept.

177
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,700
The real issue is the fourth event...

178
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
The guild competition.

179
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,620
That's right. Just like the second event,
in-game time will be sped up.

180
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,080
But people who are busy that day
might not be able to log in.

181
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,790
Maple Tree only has a few members.

182
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,540
Even one of us gone
will hurt our guild's chances.

183
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,750
Here's what I suggest: We can address that
by recruiting more members.

184
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,410
You're right. It's worth thinking about.

185
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,000
The more comrades, the better.

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,160
As the guild crafter,
I'm not too swamped with work either.

187
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,660
In that case, let's go ahead
with Kuromu's suggestion!

188
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,580
I know we've gotta find more members,
but where do we even start?

189
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,410
When it comes down to it,
that's for you to decide.

190
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,040
Ugh, such responsibility!

191
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,540
There's the bulletin board. People use it
to recruit for guilds and parties.

192
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,620
"Guild Recruitment                "Guild Recruitment
Damage Spec Needed"            Healers Wanted"
"Party Recruitment
We want your damage!"

193
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,040
"Party Recruitment          "Party Recruitment
DPS only plz!"      Players needed for item hunt"
"Party Recruitment
Melee dps wanted!"

194
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,790
"Guild Recruitment
Everyone welcome to join"
Looks like damage is in popular demand.
That's always exciting!

195
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,120
"Guild Recruitment
We want high lvl tanks!"
Hmm. I'm not seeing anyone promising for us.

196
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,370
Might be tough recruiting on the second level.

197
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,830
Wanna check out the first level?

198
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,830
I doubt there's any strong players
still chilling down there.

199
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,200
It's okay if they're not!
As long as they're fun!

200
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,910
"Party Recruitment
DPS only plz!"
Shall we go then? We'll probably have
more luck than here.

201
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,660
Whoa, it's been a while!

202
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,790
We haven't had much need to come back.
Nostalgic, huh?

203
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,580
I'll go check around!

204
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,500
Okay!

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,660
Yet another party said they don't want us.

206
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,370
--Maybe maxing out was a bad idea.

207
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,250
--Hmm?
--Maybe maxing out was a bad idea.

208
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,870
Cheer up, Big Sis! Once we get
stronger, someone will want us!

209
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,000
It's those girls from before...

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,290
But it's so hard to level
with both of us maxed out!

211
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,950
Yeah... But we've already come this far,
so it's a waste to start over.

212
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,040
I know, but what else can we do?

213
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,620
Um, do you have a minute?

214
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,750
What is it?

215
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,910
Um...

216
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,950
Just so you know, we don't have any rare items!

217
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,200
Uh, no, no, no! I don't wanna fight you
for your stuff or anything! Um...

218
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Um... Oh, yeah! Would you like
to party... Party?

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,750
No, my guild! Wanna join my guild?

220
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,160
--Huh?
--Huh?

221
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,870
Um, thanks for offering, but we're
pretty weak and still only beginners.

222
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,870
It's fine, it's fine! I'm the guild master!

223
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,200
We have room for you!

224
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,410
Maple? Who are those two?

225
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,120
These are some girls I scouted!

226
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,370
Scouted?

227
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,250
I don't mind if that's who you want.

228
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,040
But what do you two think?

229
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,870
What should we do, Yui?

230
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,540
Hmm...

231
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,450
How about we sit down somewhere and talk?

232
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,330
Isn't that cafe we went to nearby?

233
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,540
Oh, yeah! Let's go there!

234
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,250
Well? Let's get to know
each other over some tea.

235
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,830
Should we go?

236
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,830
Yeah.

237
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,250
It's yummy!

238
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,330
What a nice place this is.

239
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,660
Right? It's our treat today,
so eat as much as you like!

240
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm Sally, and this is Maple.

241
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,910
What about you?

242
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,910
I'm Yui. My big sister here is--

243
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,290
It's May.

244
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,540
Um, both of you maxed something out, right?

245
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,910
Yeah. Me and my sister maxed out attack.

246
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,540
But our agility is zero and we walk so slow.

247
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,410
I get that! Zero agility
is so inconvenient, right?

248
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,910
Except in real life, we're both on
the small side and not very strong.

249
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,160
Kinda reminds me of Maple.

250
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,870
You're not caught up in min-maxing
what works the best.

251
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,000
That's true.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,580
Are you maxed out, too, Maple?

253
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,200
That's right! Vitality all the way!

254
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,290
She's famous on the second level.

255
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm not so sure about that.

256
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,120
Then maxing out can be successful after all!

257
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,120
You might not wanna use Maple
as a reference point.

258
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,290
Well, Sally? Can we add them in?

259
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,080
Yeah. Sounds good!

260
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,000
Most of the flaws with maxing strength
vanish with Maple in the mix.

261
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,330
If they level up before the event,
it'll work out!

262
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,000
So it all comes down to how they feel about it!

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,040
We would love to.

264
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,500
Sorry for shocking you,
but this way is much faster!

265
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,580
Speaking of which, I've heard rumors
about a player that flies on a turtle.

266
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,450
You'll have to get used to this kind of stuff.

267
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,120
This is just the tip of the iceberg
of Maple's wackiness.

268
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,660
This place takes me back!
I got flattened the last time though!

269
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Since we need you to come to the second level,

270
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,830
we're gonna form a group and beat the boss.

271
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,160
R-Right.

272
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
I don't know if we can.
The two of us aren't strong at all.

273
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm sorry if we get wiped.

274
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,540
Oh, you've got nothing to worry about!

275
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,410
I'll take care of it, so just take a seat.

276
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,540
Okay! Sally knows what to do
since she beat it before.

277
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,160
W-Will Sally be all right?

278
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,200
You're up against a boss!

279
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,120
It's fine, it's fine! Just watch!

280
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,700
Oboro!

281
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,250
Oboro, Shadow Clone!

282
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,870
Oboro! Look at all the things you can do!

283
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,120
Sally's way too good! How does she dodge that?!

284
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,910
And she's using clones!

285
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,410
Why is she blue?

286
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,410
That would be Sally's [Sword Dance] skill!

287
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,830
Tsk! It recovered! What a pain!

288
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,120
Maple!

289
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,830
It's okay!

290
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,750
Fireball!

291
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,580
Wind Cutter!

292
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,330
Double Slash!

293
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,250
There! All done.

294
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,290
Sh-She really beat it by herself.

295
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,410
Maple was amazing, too!

296
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,450
It's too early to get excited.
Our guild is full of awesome people.

297
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,540
I'm wondering if it's really all right
for us to join a guild like yours.

298
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,620
It's totally fine!
You'll get strong in no time, too!

299
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,500
So there you have it!

300
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,450
Please welcome our newest
guild members, May and Yui!

301
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,450
It's nice to meet you.

302
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,370
To think the two of you both maxed strength...

303
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,540
That's Maple for you. She always
picks out the strange ones.

304
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,410
The guild competition is still a ways off.

305
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,700
Starting tomorrow, let's pile the levels on you!

306
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,000
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help!

307
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,540
Sure! Thank you very much!

308
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,120
We'll do our best!

309
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,120
--Huh?
--What?

310
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,500
Oops! So sorry!

311
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,370
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

312
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,290
Um, you don't have to worry about that! Okay?

313
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,910
Whoa. That's max strength for you.
Such destructive power.

314
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,580
May and Yui, huh?

315
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,500
It's true... They do remind me
of Maple quite a bit.

316
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,910
What if those two end up becoming just like her?

317
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,660
Hmm? What's up, Sally?

318
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,450
Hmm? Oh, it's nothing!

319
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,370
Just thinking how much fun
this might turn out to be!

320
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,910
I know! I can't wait!

321
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,120
"[NWO] The Watchers of Fortress Maple thread
(Part 1) [Flying Fortress]"

322
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,500
"[NWO] The Watchers of Fortress Maple thread

"125. Yo!"

323

326
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:13,750
"128. What's the scoop? You gotta know something."
"129. Tell us as much as you're cool with."

"129. Tell us as much as you're cool with."

"129. Tell us as much as you're cool with."
"130. Feels wrong since I'm one of them now."
"131. C'mon! Out with it, bro!"

329
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,040
"132. Fine! The rumors about Risa dodging like
crazy are true. She doesn't even use a skill
either. It's just pure, insane reflexes.
Also, she has some sort of aura now."

330

"133. And who called it? I did! The untouchable
blue monster from the second event was Risa!"

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,910
"133. And who called it? I did! The untouchable
blue monster from the second event was Risa!"

blue monster from the second event was Risa!"

"135. Any other new members besides you?"

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:16,750
"136. May and Yui. They've maxed attack,
which might be cool once they're better."

334
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,250
"136. May and Yui. They've maxed attack,
which might be cool once they're better."
