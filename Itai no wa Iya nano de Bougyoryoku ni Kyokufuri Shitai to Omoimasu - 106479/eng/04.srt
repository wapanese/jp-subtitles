1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,500
Whoa! Incredible!

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,750
Yeah. It's pretty enough to give me chills.

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,660
It's just you and me for one whole week!

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,580
It's our own exciting adventure into the wild!

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,120
That's just in-game time though.
It's just two hours for real.

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,200
Well, I guess that's true.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,580
Anyways, let's aim to get 20 medals between us!

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,290
Let's get searching then!

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,620
Yeah!

10
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,660
"Defense and Second Event"

11
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,660
Easier said than done.

12
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,580
All we've found is grass and more grass.

13
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,910
Think there's any hints and stuff?

14
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,370
I wonder...

15
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,080
You usually get items from boss drops
or hidden treasures in mazes.

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,040
What do you think?

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,580
Wha... Huh?! Maple?!

18
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,910
Hey! Sally!

19
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,660
Wh-Where are you hiding?

20
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,950
Down! Down here!

21
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,370
Down?

22
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,580
What's this? A trap?

23
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,250
Sally! Hey!

24
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,750
You all right?! It looks like a big drop!
You take damage?

25
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,120
Oh, I'm totally fine! No damage!

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,790
Yeah, of course not.

27
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,660
Hey! I think this tunnel extends even further!

28
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,000
Extends?

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,790
Hold on a sec! I'm coming down!

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,370
Think it's a hidden dungeon?

31
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,700
Wanna look?

32
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Of course!

33
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,370
Whoa! We found something!

34
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,580
Are you ready? I'll open it.

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,910
Yup, okay!

36
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,790
It's empty?

37
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,540
No, there's gotta be something.

38
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,790
Cover Move!

39
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,700
Nice one, Maple!

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,330
Cover Move!

41
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,870
H-Huh?!

42
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,790
Cover Move!

43
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,250
A knockback?! You okay, Maple?!

44
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,370
"Damage"

45
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,370
Zero damage times anything is still zero!

46
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,700
It's my turn now.

47
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,160
Super Speed!

48
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,370
Double Slash!

49
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,790
Wind Cutter!

50
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,620
Power Attack!

51
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,580
Double Slash!

52
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,910
You sure you wanna be chasing me?

53
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,160
Hydra!

54
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,580
Woo-hoo!

55
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,580
That was rather quick.

56
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,870
Sure was. So? What was that weird move of yours?

57
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,160
You mean Cover Move? Cool, right?

58
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,410
You take double damage using it,
but now I can keep up with you!

59
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,290
"Cover Move"

60
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,200
I bet you're the only one
to use it as a movement skill.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,540
Huh?

62
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,290
I'll open it.

63
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,750
Okay! Go for it!

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,870
Yippie! Medals!

65
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,660
And two of them, too! Two medals!

66
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,870
It's all thanks to clumsy Maple,
who managed to fall in a hole!

67
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,500
G-Give me a break!
Nobody could've seen it coming!

68
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,200
But we might go far if we can keep this up!

69
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
Yeah!

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,700
That's gotta be a teleport circle there.

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,330
Let's head back outside.

72
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,450
Okay!

73
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,830
Now then, what to do next?

74
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,870
Let's keep marching ahead.

75
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,750
I doubt it's all grass the whole way
to that huge mountain.

76
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,910
You're right! Let's go!

77
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,790
Yup!

78
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,500
We made it!

79
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,540
This is so weird...

80
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,580
It's snow, but it's not cold at all!

81
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,750
Yeah. Only in games, right?

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,950
That's...

83
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,870
Maple! Come ove--

84
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,750
Kuromu?

85
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,450
Oh, it's Maple! Which means
you're, um.... Sally, right?

86
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,330
Yeah.

87
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,120
Ah, we have no intention of fighting.

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,330
That's right!

89
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,200
We don't wanna start anything.

90
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,830
I don't wanna fight against
people I know either.

91
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,580
If that's what Maple wants, so be it.

92
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,000
Had you posed a threat,
I would've stamped you out.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Oh, man. You're a scary one.

94
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,700
Still, lots of people think snatching medals
through PvP's the way to go.

95
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,080
Have people been giving you trouble?

96
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,580
Yeah. The first day was a total bust.

97
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,830
We were hoping to hit it hard today
and get back on track, but...

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,910
Doesn't look like more than
one party can enter that.

99
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,870
Talk about bad luck.
Figures we'd find it right after you.

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,910
Say, um... Sally?

101
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,330
Hmm?

102
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,160
Do you mind if we let them have it instead?

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,950
What?

104
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,200
Um, I don't care, but... You're fine with that?

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,830
Yeah! I mean, we already got medals yesterday.

106
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,080
And I kinda owe Kuromu one
from back when I started.

107
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,580
All right. If that's what you want.

108
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,410
It's all you, Kuromu! Go on ahead!

109
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,200
Are you sure?
Usually it's first come, first served.

110
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,250
It's fine!

111
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,330
Okay then. Thanks.

112
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,290
No complaints if we're swimming in medals!

113
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,080
I won't complain!

114
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,790
We'll take up your offer then. Let's go!

115
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,790
Yeah!

116
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,580
Goody two-shoes.

117
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,160
You know, doesn't that seem like
it'd be a boss fight?

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,500
It just might be. What should we do now?

119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,950
Climb down the mountain and look somewhere--

120
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,160
What?

121
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,040
I think it opened again.

122
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,160
Why? Can't only a single party go inside?

123
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,250
There're two possibilities.

124
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,950
One's that there's gear or medals
waiting right at the entrance,

125
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,580
and that's all there is to it.

126
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,700
Otherwise, they got completely
obliterated by a powerful monster.

127
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
What do you think?

128
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,290
Let's go.

129
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,330
All right. But there's no knowing
what waits inside.

130
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,040
Maple. Be ready to use Devour.

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
Right.

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,580
There's nobody here?

133
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,750
Yeah...

134
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,750
I can tell it's a tough one.

135
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,370
But... I refuse to lose.

136
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,410
Cover!

137
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,500
Maple!

138
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,120
Don't worry, it's non-piercing!

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,700
And I can't be using Devour for this either!

140
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,200
The attack pattern changed?

141
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,620
It's time for a counterattack!

142
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,910
Not good!

143
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,370
Cover Move!

144
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,950
Nice timing!

145
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,790
Super Speed!

146
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,790
Cover Move!

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,330
Hydra!

148
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,450
How's that?!

149
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,950
It didn't even budge!

150
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,200
No way!

151
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,250
Cover Move!

152
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,080
My Devour!

153
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
How many left?!

154
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,330
Five more!

155
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,160
That must be piercing!

156
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,660
Meditation!

157
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,500
Heal!

158
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,580
Let's go!

159
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,000
Mmm!

160
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,120
Concentrate!

161
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,910
Slash!

162
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,750
Got you!

163
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,080
Torrent!

164
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,250
Hydra!

165
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,080
Cover Move!

166
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,500
Cover!

167
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,910
Only one more Devour.

168
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,870
Yeah, I know.

169
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,700
Here it comes!

170
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,200
Cover!

171
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,580
Huh?!

172
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,200
Maple! Over here!

173
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,410
C-Cover Move!

174
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,370
Cover!

175
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,250
Maple!

176
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,790
I'm okay! Do it, Sally!

177
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,620
I won't let the chance
Maple gave me go to waste!

178
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,700
The Mirage skill.

179
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,540
How'd you like the trick up my sleeve?

180
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,450
Hydra!

181
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,830
Woo-hoo! We won!

182
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm whipped.

183
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,250
Oh, man. What happened at the end there?
I thought you were done for.

184
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,950
I got a new skill at the very last moment.

185
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,750
Um, is this it?

186
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,200
"[Stout Guardian]:
A Great Shielder exclusive skill

187
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,250
acquired when covering an ally
while having less than 10% HP.

188
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,660
Once a day, you're able to withstand
any attack and survive with 1 HP."

189
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,290
I see...

190
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,620
Y-You're saying we'd be goners
without that?! You're at 1 HP?!

191
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,660
I guess so!

192
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,040
Heal! Heal! Heal! Heal! Heal!

193
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,540
This must be crafting material!

194
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,870
Maple! Come here a sec!

195
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,080
Got it! Cover Move!

196
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,500
Whoa! There're five medals! And... eggs?

197
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,830
Yeah, but I don't think
they're from the boss bird.

198
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,120
The colors and patterns are different.

199
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,950
Can we take these with us?

200
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,370
Seems like it! Which do you want?

201
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,450
I like green, so I'll take this one!

202
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,580
All right. Then I get this one.

203
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,120
"[Monster Egg]
Hatches when it's warmed up.c

204
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,080
[Monster Egg].

205
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,120
Hatches when it's warmed up?

206
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
Not much info there.

207
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,620
You think we'll be able to tame them?!

208
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,620
They might follow us like pets!

209
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,870
Pets?! How cool!

210
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,700
Mommy's gonna hatch you soon!

211
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,870
Let's teleport out of here first.

212
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,160
I think we can pick where we wanna go.

213
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,000
Somewhere we don't have to fight would be nice.

214
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,950
I'm with you there.

215
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,290
Ah! Silverwing was beaten!

216
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,200
Silverwing? Wasn't that basically
impossible for players to beat?

217
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,040
We packed it with so many lethal skills,
it's basically an evil prank!

218
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,120
Who?! Who beat it?!

219
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,160
Look here!

220
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,620
Maple?! Seriously?!

221
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,290
Come on! Silverwing should've been impossible!

222
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,580
Unbelievable! Her mobility
should be nonexistent!

223
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,040
The eggs! You're telling me
she ran off with the Monster Eggs?

224
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,000
What's inside?!

225
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,540
The fox and turtle.

226
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,660
Well, it could've been worse.

227
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,580
Argh, unbelievable!
I can't believe Maple got 'em.

228
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,250
Everyone check the skills
she can get using medals!

229
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,330
Make sure she can't combine
any skills in weird ways!

230
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,620
Roger that!

231
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,120
This means more work for us...

232
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Sweet! I got a medal!

233
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,080
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot PvP
was an option, too!

234
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,200
PvP! A true test of one's skill
is battling other players!

235
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,080
It fires me up!

236
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Think we're doing it right?

237
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,080
Oh! Maybe it'll work better if we
warm it with more of our skin!

238
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,290
Whoa! I'll check out the bottom.

239
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,620
You wait here.

240
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,290
Sure! All right!

241
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:53,750
Um, to Maple: "I just reached the bottom.
Sorry to keep you waiting."

242
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,870
Huh? "Look out below. You might want to move"?

243
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,200
The heck is that?

244
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,700
My eyes! They won't stop spinning!

245
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,000
What'd you do?!

246
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,910
It's Venom Capsule.

247
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,540
It traps the target in a poison
capsule that it can't escape.

248
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,250
I thought it might hold up since it
traps things, so I gave it a shot.

249
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,580
Oh! It'll eat away your HP
without Poison Immunity

250
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,250
so if you go in one, be careful!

251
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,950
I will not go in one!

252
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,620
Hey, Maple. That's...

253
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,500
Hmm? Ooh, a medal!

254
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,080
Maybe it was hidden on the cliff?

255
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,830
Woo-hoo! Check it out, Sally!

256
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,250
Get away from me!

257
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,500
Turtle!

258
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,870
Turtle?

259
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,080
They're adorable!

260
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,540
A ring?

261
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,620
"[Bridge of Bonds].

262
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,750
Equipping this will allow certain
monsters to fight alongside you."

263
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,540
Let's try it on!

264
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,660
That tickles!

265
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,790
Oh! Now we're able to see
the status of these guys!

266
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,160
"Please enter a name."

267
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,160
First, we've gotta give 'em names.

268
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,620
I've got it! I'm naming this one Syrup!

269
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,370
Together, that makes us Maple Syrup!

270
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,250
Then, I'll call you Oboro. How do you like that?

271
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,660
Nice to meet you, Oboro!

272
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,580
It has 15 agility?!

273
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,620
Oh, that's faster than you.

274
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,750
Syrup! Bite!

275
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,160
Oboro! Fire Tail!

276
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,620
Ooh! Level up!

277
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,000
Only level three after all this?

278
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,080
Hmm? I think mine acquired a new skill.

279
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,910
Hibernate and Awaken?

280
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,250
Oh, Syrup did, too!

281
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,540
Hibernate lets them recover inside the ring.

282
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,620
To call it out, you use Awaken. Makes sense!

283
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,700
Now we can always be together!

284
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,450
The desert is no place for Syrup!

285
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,080
And Oboro would get covered in sand.

286
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,250
Ooh! We can take a break over there!

287
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,750
Let's hope it's not some mirage.

288
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,160
You're Maple who placed third?

289
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,790
Y-Yeah. Um, and you are?

290
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,700
Sixth place isn't worth remembering?

291
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,700
What?!

292
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,790
You have one, don't you? A gold medal.

293
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,000
"The 2nd event begins!"

294
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,000
"546. How's the event going for y'all?"

295
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,000
"547. pissed as hell i climbed that
huge mountain and found jack squat"

296
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,910
"548. There was a magic circle in front of the shrine thing that
teleported us to some bird monster that whooped our ass.
If you didn't see anything,
it means someone must have beat it."

297
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,700
"549. wat?"

298
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,700
"550. You're Kuromu, right? If you can't beat it,
no one can. Actually, on second thought..."

299
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,700
"551. i bet i can guess who did"

300
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,370
"552. lol! Well, we did run into another party at
the summit. It was Maple and that friend of hers."

301
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,370
"553. yup. i knew it"

302
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:16,870
"554. They probably went in right after us.
It's a good chance they're the ones who cleared it."

303
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,870
"555. I bet Maple steamrolled it. You thinking
maybe her friend is a monster too?"

304
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,870
"556. no chance in hell they're both that OP"

305
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,950
"557. You sure about that?
It's Maple's friend after all! lol!"

306
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,950
"558. Good point."

307
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,950
"559. u got me"
