1
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,120
Provocation!

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,410
And then... Shield Attack!
Shield Attack! Shield Attack!

3
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,870
Acquired skill [Great Shield Mastery IV],
[Evasion], [Parry].

4
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,660
Acquired skill [Savage].

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,580
If I eat those, maybe I can
build explosion resist!

6
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,290
Paralyzing Shout!

7
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,000
T-Time to dig in!

8
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,620
Ooh! It's just like candy
that pops in your mouth!

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,120
It's not so bad if I close my eyes!

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,870
Acquired skill [Bomb Eater].

11
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,700
Acquired skill [Devour].

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,290
Devour? That's an unexpected bonus!

13
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,540
I'll stick that one on my shield's skill slot!

14
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,910
I really hope Risa joins me soon!

15
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,250
"Defense and Friends"

16
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,080
I wonder what skill I should aim for next?

17
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,290
Kinda wish I could move faster somehow.

18
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,660
Then again, my plan was
to specialize in defense.

19
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,540
Yo!

20
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,330
Risa!

21
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,250
Morning, Kaede. Get used to the game yet?

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,870
Yup! I figured out eating
solves all my problems!

23
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,750
Um, Kaede? What exactly are you playing?

24
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,950
Yeah? An event?

25
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,500
Yup! I heard they're holding
the first event today!

26
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,790
It's a battle royal of players!

27
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,830
Hmm.

28
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,160
Players who get top place earn
a special, limited-edition item!

29
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,700
You know, stuff like that
is impossible to resist!

30
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,910
Oh, yeah? Looks like you're more
into the game than I thought.

31
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,750
Hmm. It's 'cuz when I hear
limited-edition, I've gotta have it.

32
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,500
Special prizes have always been your weak point.

33
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,660
Argh, jeez! I'm totally dying to log in!

34
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,330
That's why I'm gonna crush
tomorrow's proficiency test!

35
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,200
Whoa! All these people are for the event?!

36
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,700
Rawr!

37
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,870
Welcome! It's time to begin
<i>NewWorld Online</i> 's very first event!

38
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,580
It'll last three hours on a map
specially made for today!

39
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,160
By the way, I'm the game's mascot, Dorazou!

40
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,790
For you new players, nice to meet you!

41
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,870
Let's start the countdown!

42
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,950
Three! Two! One! Zero!

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,080
Good luck, everyone! Rawr!

44
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,000
This is...?

45
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,910
And here I was scared we'd
be thrown right into battle!

46
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,910
It's not like I can run and catch anyone,
so I'll just wait right here!

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,750
Hello there, Missy.

48
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,500
It's a pity, but you'll soon be
a beautiful sacrifice for me.

49
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,950
My name is Christmas Rose!
Also known as the White Rose Knight!

50
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,080
Sure...

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,040
Your lovely eyes shall be filled with tears,
but please don't think ill of me.

52
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Now, I attack!

53
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Huh?

54
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,200
Hurray!

55
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,700
Now then, back to drawing!

56
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,660
Even if you can repel the first attack...!

57
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,200
...you'll never dodge the second and third!

58
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,160
We are the Trio! People call us
the Blazing Brothers!

59
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Jet Stream--

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,580
Paralyzing Shout.

61
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,000
Shit! How dare you hit us
with a surprise attack!

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,450
You scoundrel of a--

63
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,660
You black-armored devil!

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,330
Not even our second and third
assassin were enough to--

65
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,200
Phew! Great shields might be
stronger than I thought!

66
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,410
Um, isn't that broken?

67
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,790
She's still going strong even after 100 people!

68
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,660
The shield's status effect is owning them.
Has she not been hit?

69
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,120
How is that shield even legal?

70
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,660
Huh?

71
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,540
What?!

72
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,160
How does a morning star
bounce right off her head?

73
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,790
Whoa, so many people...

74
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,080
Hydra!

75
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,410
She's a monster.

76
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,120
What could her stats possibly be?

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,330
She does nothing but counters.

78
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,580
If she can't move fast, doesn't that
mean her agility isn't much?

79
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,620
But her defense is out of this world.

80
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,200
Hey, there's one hour left!

81
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,700
Currently in first place is Payne!
Second is Dread! In third is Maple!

82
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,290
Yippie! I'm in third!

83
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,790
As of now, if you defeat a top three player,
you get 30% of their points!

84
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,700
Their positions will be marked on the map!

85
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,910
Ugh, that's annoying. Really?

86
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:15,540
Um, in other words, everyone
will be coming to hunt us down?

87
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,500
There she is!

88
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,120
Come on, surround her!

89
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,500
She's mine!

90
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,700
Hmph. She's naught but a newbie.

91
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,620
I'll teach you how fearsome the battlefield is.

92
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,660
Don't hate me for this!

93
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,500
Huh?!

94
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm sorry that didn't work.

95
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,750
Deadly Breath!

96
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,160
Shoot, it's poison!

97
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
--Crap!
--Run away!
--I need antidote!

98
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,160
Paralyzing Shout!

99
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,620
Rawr! It's over!

100
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,250
Result: There's been no change
in the top three players!

101
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,750
Woo-hoo! I'm so awesome!

102
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,370
Let's kick off the interviews with
our third-place winner, Maple!

103
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,160
Huh? Uh, um...

104
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,870
Anything to say about the event?

105
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,910
Um, uh... I took a pounding but I liked its.

106
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,540
--Did she trip over her tongue?
--She sure did.

107
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,910
Rawr! Congratulations!

108
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,200
Here's a commemorative medal!

109
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,620
Thank you very mush!

110
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,620
For crying out loud! I'm so embarrassed!

111
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,040
Huh? Third place? For real?

112
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,290
Yeah, I'm surprised myself.

113
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,450
Wait a sec. What level are you, Kaede?

114
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,160
I'm level 20.

115
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,620
And you got third? How?
What kind of character are you?

116
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,250
A great shielder focused on defense.

117
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,370
But the thing is... I wonder
if I should tell you about it?

118
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,080
Huh?! What kinda monster did you make?

119
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,250
That's Kaede for you. Always the airhead.

120
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,870
Huh? You think?

121
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,540
Of course I do!

122
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,200
It's gonna be rough trying to pass you up.

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,950
B-But if you just do the same thing as me--

124
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,790
Bzzt! You do you and I'll do me.

125
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,250
Then what are you going to do?

126
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,750
If you're being a tank, maybe I'll roll
a wizard with long-range attacks.

127
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,830
Though if I'm gonna party with you,
that's way too conventional.

128
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,450
All right, I've decided!

129
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,120
I'm gonna be a swashbuckler!

130
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
A swash... buckler?

131
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,540
Yup! They evade the enemy and
make their attacks do nothing!

132
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,830
Oh, that's cool! But I'm already a shield class.

133
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,450
What's the point of us both defending?

134
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,250
No matter what kind of fight we land in,
we'll take no damage!

135
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,040
Not even a scratch!

136
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,290
Well? Doesn't that sound cool?

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,910
Nice! Real nice!

138
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,040
I wanna party with that concept
in mind, so swashbuckler it is!

139
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,410
I'll keep raising my defense more!

140
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,370
Oh, but don't get caught up in that too much.

141
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,790
There's no point if you end up losing.

142
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,500
If it comes to it, it's better to cast down
your shield to live another day.

143
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,620
Yup! Got it!

144
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,330
But, did you get permission
from your mom to play?

145
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,040
Awesome! That means we can play together today!

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,200
"Saw a sick great shielder"

147
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,040
"435. Here're Maple's stats from the event
3rd place Deaths: 0 Damage taken: 0 Defeated: 2028"

148
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,040
"436. All hail the walking fortress"

149
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,040
"437. It's like she's simply raising vit or something"

150
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,450
"438. Basically, her defense is so high that all
attacks do nothing. People who hit her get
nailed by a status effect from that mysterious
shield that converts them to MP"

151
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,040
"439. That's insane"

152
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,040
"440. Walking fortress, no. Last boss, yes"

153
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,040
"441. So cute and strong. She's the best"

154
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,040
"442. Think she's strongest 1v1 atm? Besides Payne, obviously"

155
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Ooh! So this is what it's like!

156
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Isn't it great? I was pretty shocked
when I logged in, too!

157
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,620
I figured Kaede-- Oh, shoot!

158
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Is there a monster?

159
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,830
Not that. It's bad form to use real names.

160
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,200
So remember to call me Sally.

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,370
My real name in reverse. Sally.

162
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,000
Sally! Sally, it is! Okay, got it!

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,620
Now then, first things first!

164
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,250
"Sally"

165
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,250
Oh? You spread your points
in all sorts of stats!

166
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,450
That's normal, you know!

167
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:43,000
But I decided not to touch vitality,
HP, and MP for the time being.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
Why?

169
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,200
Because if I can evade all damage,
I don't really need HP and defense.

170
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,000
And I don't know if I'm using magic yet,
so I'm keeping MP low.

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,410
A lack of strength can be
compensated by weapons to a degree.

172
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,330
But since I want to be really fast,
I put most of mine into agility.

173
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,790
You really gave it some thought.

174
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,080
People that aren't meat shields
have a bit more to consider.

175
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,870
I hope I can get some specialized gear soon.

176
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,290
Oh, but that shield of yours, um...

177
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,790
Replica of the Dark Night.

178
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,160
Yeah! Replica of the Dark Night.

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,370
It eats up all enemy attacks, right?

180
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,580
But that means you can't acquire skills
which require you to get hit.

181
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,450
Yeah. Which is why I asked about
commissioning a shield

182
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,790
from a crafter I met the other day named Iz.

183
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,250
And she said...

184
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,700
Well, if you're able to bring
me enough materials,

185
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,450
I could make you one for around 1,000,000 gold.

186
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,000
My Replica of the Dark Night is black, so...

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,040
...I was thinking I want a white shield next.

188
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,290
In that case, you should try
the underground lake south of the city.

189
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,160
I'll need scales from the white fish
that swim in the lake for materials.

190
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,870
So she said.

191
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,660
Okay! Let's go check out this underground lake!

192
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,080
What? Really?

193
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,830
Of course! Oh, but first, we gotta
buy fishing rods somewhere.

194
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,200
Hey, wait up! You're too fast!

195
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,660
Whoops, sorry.

196
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,790
That's too fast for her?

197
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,040
In that case...

198
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,620
So fast! That's 60 agility for you!

199
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,500
Hold on tight! If we run into monsters,
it's all you!

200
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,370
All right!

201
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,120
Uh-oh! Three wolves straight ahead!

202
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,870
Paralyzing Shout!

203
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,410
Devour!

204
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,580
That's my third-place champ!

205
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,540
Whoa! That was super quick!

206
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,700
You may worship me.

207
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,200
As you wish, Master Sally!

208
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,870
"2 hours later"

209
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,200
Finally got a third.

210
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,410
Ooh, I caught another!

211
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,540
I only got three. Meanwhile,
you're on your 12th...

212
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,370
What did you expect with zero dex?

213
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,200
And I just started playing, so...

214
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,580
...just skinning these little fish
I catch is giving level after level.

215
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,660
What are you at?

216
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,540
Six.

217
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,950
Acquired skill [Fishing].

218
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,580
My first skill is fishing?
So much for calling you the strange one.

219
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,450
You have a bunch of stat points, right?
You're not using 'em?

220
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,000
Maybe once I get some more skills.

221
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,410
'Cuz skills might steer
what fighting style I use.

222
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,870
You sound like such a veteran!

223
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,540
I've played a lot more games than you, at least.

224
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,750
Whoa! I think I hooked a big one!

225
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,830
Gah, come to Mama!

226
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,500
Twenty-five in total, huh?

227
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,790
Well? Is it enough?

228
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,040
Can we go another hour?

229
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,200
Sure!

230
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,750
But I wanna try something out,
so do you care if I free dive?

231
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,370
I'm good at swimming in real life.

232
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,500
Does that matter here?

233
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,080
Yup! If you're a good swimmer
in real life, good at climbing trees,

234
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,870
or even just have good reflexes,
it makes a difference in-game.

235
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,200
It's all a part of player skill.

236
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,580
Be back soon!

237
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,080
Good luck!

238
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,040
I wonder if she's okay?

239
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,830
She's been down there for like ten minutes.

240
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Welcome back! How was it?

241
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,750
Got some! A big haul!

242
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,410
Whoa! You're letting me have all these?

243
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,790
I don't need 'em. You can just
help me out sometime in exchange.

244
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,750
All right! Whenever you need!

245
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,200
Say, Maple...

246
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,500
Hmm?

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,790
I found a small cave at the bottom of the lake.

248
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,250
What? You mean...?!

249
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,200
I wonder if I can get down there?

250
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,250
With zero agility, I doubt you can swim.

251
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,790
Guess I'll just have to do it alone.

252
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,790
Right now?

253
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,450
Not quite. Once I raise my level
and swimming skill a bit.

254
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,830
Which is why...

255
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,620
Okay! Let's come back here every day then!

256
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,120
That's how I'll pay you back!

257
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,160
I knew you would say that! That's my Maple!

258
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,620
Oh, please!

259
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,750
How long was I under?

260
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,870
A whole 40 minutes!

261
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,410
Great! I mapped out the area,
so I think I might be ready!

262
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,160
Seeing as how I advanced
to [Swimming X] and [Diving X],

263
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,410
that's probably the highest I can get for now.

264
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,200
It'll get ugly if I can't beat the boss
within 20 minutes.

265
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,910
What if I message you using
the friend function after 20 minutes?

266
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,410
So you know the time.

267
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,870
Nice idea, Maple! Could you?

268
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,160
Leave it to me!

269
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,620
I'm counting on you!

270
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,910
There's air! Lucky me!

271
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,950
Wha...?!

272
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,290
Oh? Now that's what I'm talking about!

273
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,750
Bring it on!

274
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,660
Slash!

275
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,870
Wind Cutter!

276
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
Water Ball!

277
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,910
Power Attack!

278
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,660
So much for air.

279
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,200
Will I make it?

280
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,370
She's not answering.

281
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,000
Will she be okay?

282
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,200
Calm down! Focus!

283
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,620
C'mon, let's do this!

284
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,500
Wind Cutter!

285
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,040
Take another!

286
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,580
Final one!

287
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,790
Man, having to play serious
really takes it out of me!

288
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,540
I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort
to my serious mode, but...

289
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,290
Well, I won, so whatever!

290
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,160
Now then, let's have a peek at what's inside!

291
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,500
Open up, baby!

292
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,750
You look totally awesome!

293
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,000
Right?!

294
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You had me worried there!

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,290
I thought you lost and got
sent to the starting zone!

296
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm sorry!

297
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,790
Now that I've got a bunch of skills,
I can party with you at the next event!

298
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,830
Yeah! Let's enter together!

299
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,040
An announcement!

300
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,000
We'll soon release the second level of content!

301
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,160
In order to reach it, you must
clear an exclusive dungeon!

302
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,450
For further details,
read the announcement on the site!

303
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,830
That's all for now!

304
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,950
What's "second level" mean?

305
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,000
The level we're on right now is level one.

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,330
It means there's another world
to come just as big as this one.

307
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,500
You mean there're more
incredible monsters out there?!

308
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,700
Oh, yeah! So exciting!

309
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,660
And swashbuckler's the hardest class to play!

310
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,290
But that's exactly why it fires me up!

311
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,160
You've gone full gamer on me.

312
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Huh?

313
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,120
What? Sally?!

314
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,450
I didn't get any boots,
so I need to go buy some!

315
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,250
Let's get back to the city, Maple!

316
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,160
"Saw a sick great shielder"

317
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,540
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"543. It showed Maple was partied
in my friend menu today"

318
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:42,950
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"543. It showed Maple was partied
in my friend menu today"
"544. I think I saw 'em"

319
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,290
"543. It showed Maple was partied
in my friend menu today"
"544. I think I saw 'em"
"545. What could you tell?"

320
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:43,750
"546. Don't know her name, but she was with
someone in starting gear and they got along well
so I'm thinking they're friends IRL"

321
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,950
"546. Don't know her name, but she was with
someone in starting gear and they got along well
so I'm thinking they're friends IRL"
"547. But what gear?"

322
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,120
"547. But what gear?"
"548. Short sword I think"

323
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,410
"547. But what gear?"
"548. Short sword I think""
549. That's unexpected"

324
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:44,910
"547. But what gear?"
"548. Short sword I think"
"549. That's unexpected"
"550. One would think wizard or archer"

325
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,580
"550. One would think wizard or archer"
"551. Not a great combo if they're fighting together"

326
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:45,950
"550. One would think wizard or archer"
"551. Not a great combo if they're fighting together"
"552. If it's Maple's friend,
maybe she's just a newbie too"

327
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,370
"552. If it's Maple's friend,
maybe she's just a newbie too"
"553. A newbie? Maple's 'just' a newbie"

328
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,790
"552. If it's Maple's friend,
maybe she's just a newbie too"
"553. A newbie? Maple's 'just' a newbie"
"554. That's a good point"

329
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,290
"554. That's a good point"
"555. Two Maples grouped up sounds terrifying"

330
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:47,750
"554. That's a good point"
"555. Two Maples grouped up sounds terrifying"
"556. But short sword
means she specced agi, right?"

331
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,200
"555. Two Maples grouped up sounds terrifying"
"556. But short sword
means she specced agi, right?"
"557. Doesn't sound OP to me"

332
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,580
"558. I'm sure we'll hear more about her eventually.
Should be another event soon enough"

333
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,160
"558. I'm sure we'll hear more about her eventually.
Should be another event soon enough"
"559. True. We can find out her play style then"

334
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
"558. I'm sure we'll hear more about her eventually.
Should be another event soon enough"
"559. True. We can find out her play style then"
"560. Can't wait for the next event! I wanna see what she's got!"
