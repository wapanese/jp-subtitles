00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,700
[Flame]!

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,250
Mii!

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,830
Go figure.

4
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,700
I can't say I'm surprised.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,750
So you're this Maple I've heard of?

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,410
And you're Mii from Flame Emperors, right?

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,410
"Defense and Mighty Foe"

8
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,620
"Defense and Mighty Foe"
Here we go!

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,370
[Aftershock]!

10
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,160
[Flare Accel]!

11
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,370
[Flame]!

12
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,040
[Inferno]!

13
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,830
A knockback?!

14
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,620
If she doesn't come back...!

15
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,040
[Fire Lance]!

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,330
She won't make it!

17
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,580
We're done for!

18
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,120
[Cover Move]!

19
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,830
Are you two all right?!

20
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,750
Th-Thanks for the help!

21
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,700
I see how it is.

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,580
I'll take out those two first. Back me up.

23
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,580
--Got it.
--Roger that.

24
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,120
[Inferno]!

25
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,500
N-Not again!

26
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,250
[Remote Trap - Snare]!

27
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,290
Huh? Wh-What?!

28
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,040

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
Not this time! [Inferno]!

[Predator]!

31
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,370
[Holy Javelin]!

32
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,330
May, Yui! This way!

33
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,250
I've never seen that skill before.
To think she had more to hide...

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,500
Such a troublesome opponent.

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
[Fire Lance]!

36
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
We can't even get close!

37
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,410
And that's where we shine the most!

38
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,750
May, Yui! Back out for a minute!

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,540
B-But...!

40
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,250
And what about you?

41
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,120
We've gotta save you guys as our secret weapon!

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,290
All right.

43
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,160
Be careful!

44
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,250
Get back here!

45
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,080
Not on my watch!

46
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,370
I can use [Devour] if I get close! Let's go!

47
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,790
[Predator]!

48
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,540
You're too slow! [Inferno]!

49
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,330
Change of plans! Hit her with
a chain of piercing attacks!

50
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,040
Don't give her room to breathe!

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,580
Okay!

52
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,290
[Remote Trap - Phalanx]!

53
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,790
[Flame]!

54
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,410
[Holy Javelin]!

55
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,700
[Inferno]!

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,370
Whoa! It used up a bunch!

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,200
This is way too far to use [Hydra]...

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,500
Ugh! Talk about incredibly beefy!

59
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,870
Even our piercing attacks are barely
scratching her.

60
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,660
We'll be fighting forever at this rate.

61
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,250
Maple's getting pushed back.

62
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,910
What's wrong?

63
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,000
Mii! We're here to help!

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,660
Even Maple can't beat all of us!

65
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,370
Don't just rush right in!

66
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,870
You asked for it! [Spirit Cannon]!

67
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,750
Turtle!

68
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,370
[Flame]!

69
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,620
She's got even more skills?

70
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,160
All right! Close enough!

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,700
[Hydra]!

72
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,870
[Antidote]!

73
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,950
You need to let us fight her.

74
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,120
Stay back until I give orders!

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,450

Argh, what a waste!

[Fire Lance]!

83
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,540
No matter who we're up against...

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,660
As long as we've got Mii...

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,410
[Flame]!

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,660
I never turn back.

87
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,790
My only thought is destroying those in my way!

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,750
You monster.

Not happening! [Inferno]!

Gah! If this keeps up...!

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,830
The strongest shield versus strongest lance.

93
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,830
At this rate, the fight will never end.

94
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,290
What do we do, Mii?

95
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,040
Misery... Markus...

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,540
--Yes?
--What?

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,370
I'm using "that."
Buy me some time until it's ready.

98
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,450
Use all your traps and magic if you must.

99
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,910
Very well.

100
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,410
I'll do my best!

101
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,160

102
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,620

125

Whoa! My [Devour]!

126
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm taking damage over time?

127
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,700
Just in the nick of time.

128
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,580
Thank goodness. I was freaking out.

129
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,620
To think I was forced
to use [Prison of Flame]...

130
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,290
I know. Let's hope it takes her out.

131
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,040
Well, I'm out of traps, so it better.

132
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,950
Maple's in a pinch!

133
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,040
It's okay. Maple will pull through.

134
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,410
Yeah.

135
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:47,540
What to do? I'm not sure how
to escape and I'm out of [Devour]...

136
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,120
I didn't want to show this off,
but I've got no choice!

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,080
That's...!

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,750
Mii!

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,500
Let's retreat!

151
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,410
There's no way! We can't beat that!

152
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,540
I'm thinking the same thing.

153
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,330
For now, let's consider seeing
her trump card a win for us.

154
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,660
[Flare Accel]!

155
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,660
So be it. We've lost.

156
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,950
However...

157
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,250
To Shin?

158
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,290
I see! What a brilliant plan!

159
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,330
You won't get away!

160
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,370

This time, you're going down!

174
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,700
Phew! Didn't see that coming!

175
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,790
Ugh! And here I was told
to keep [Machine God] a secret!

176

Thank goodness! You had us so worried!

180
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,660
But we believed in you the whole time!

181
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, that's that!

182
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,160
Let's go and fetch the orb!

183
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,500
Right!

184
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,410
Eh?!

185
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,620
The orb is... gone!

186
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,080
Do you think they took it and ran off?

187
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Can they do that?

188
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,540
It's not against the rules, but they
can't earn points if it's not in base.

189
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,120
Ugh... What to do...?

190
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,870
Wanna chase 'em?

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,160
Um, we actually had another idea.

192
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,330
What's that?

193
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,160
According to Sally's map,
there're a ton of guilds in this area.

194
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,660
And thanks to you, we're still
in perfect fighting shape, so...!

195
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,370
Let's take a bunch of orbs from all the guilds!

196
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,950
All right! Ready to run around
and grab us some orbs?!

197
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,370
Yeah!

198
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,160
Aww! She beat me!

199
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,120
Jeez! What the hell was that?! Huh?!

200
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh. Looks like Mii revived, too.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,620
What a total monster that was.

202
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,410
Yeah. But at least I--

203
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,370
Can you believe she even
survived Mii's [Self-Destruct]?

204
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,660
Huh?

205
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,040
According to Shin's report,
Maple seems to be just fine.

206
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,750
Eh?

207
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,540
--But they've secured our orb,
so no need to worry.

208
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,950
--Eh? Eh?!
--But they've secured our orb,
so no need to worry.

209
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,700
Eh?!

210
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,040
Mii, wait!

211
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,000
I swear! I'm gonna get her next time!

212
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,830
That's gotta be Maple.

213
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,330
Sounds like she's going all out.

214
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,950
It's almost time for us to meet up.
Let's hurry and get to the spot.

215
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,040
I'm sorry, Sally!

216
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,290
We searched all over for their orb,
but we just couldn't find it!

217
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,700
It's fine. You did plenty.

218
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,330
Now the Flame Emperors
will have to go on the move.

219
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,500
Having said that,
our pace has fallen quite a bit.

220
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,410
It's tough to compete with their numbers.

221
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,200
We just can't keep up with the large guilds.

222
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,160
We've been fighting the hard fight, but...

223
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,450
"Order of the Holy Sword"
"Kingdom of the Flame Emperors"
...we're barely holding on to 10th.

224
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,790
"Wizard Hideout"
"Rainbow Wings"
To be honest, we're in a risky position.

225
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,660
"Rapid Fire"
"Shambhala"
It's only a matter of time until
the lower ranked guilds come after us.

226
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,370
"Bulletin Board Bros"
"Rose Stars Brigade"
"Maple Tree"
There's not many small guilds anymore.

227
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,410
So tonight, Iz and Kanade can hold the base...

228
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,620
...while we go on the attack.

229
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,250
Day two and it's already do-or-die.

230
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,200
Maple and Kasumi should go with Kuromu.

231
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,700
May and Yui can come with me.

232
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,830
Got it!

233
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,040
All right! Let's go!

234
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,830
[Aftershock]!

235
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,660
Wh-What the...?!

236
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,870
I need to go faster!

237
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,830
I need to get more!

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,870
[Illusion]!

239
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,370
It's a fake attack!

240
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,910
It didn't even hurt! Huh?!

241
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,870
Wh-What the hell's that?!

242
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,040
[Disintegrate]!

243
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,000
They're counting on us to protect it!

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,540
Nobody's getting our orb!

245
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,200
Are we seriously doing this?

246
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,500
I agree. They won't expect us from above, but...

247
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,290
Here we go!

248
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,750
[Loving Sacrifice]!

249
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,200
D-Don't you think this is a bit crazy?!

250
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,120
I wouldn't do this in real life,
but here, it's not gonna hurt a bit!

251
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,410
That doesn't make it a good idea!

252
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,540
Whew! Guess I'm dead!

253
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,950
Welcome to the afterlife.
Now you can watch with the rest of us.

254
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,540
You think most of the guilds
are gonna get wiped out?

255
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,450
It's possible! Lots of the small ones
are crumbling already.

256
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,330
Oh! Not sure about Maple Tree though.

257
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,870
"Order of the Holy Sword"
"Kingdom of the Flame Emperors"
"Rainbow Wings"
Those Maple Tree guys are doing their best.

258
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,660
"Shambhala"
"Rapid Fire"
Flame Emperors is in a tough spot, too.

259
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,410
"Revolution"
"thunder storm"
"Maple Tree"
Even the big guilds vary more than you'd think.

260
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,540
Still, Holy Sword is sitting pretty at top.

261
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,290
Anyone else kinda hope
Maple Tree goes all the way?

262
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,040
Yeah. I'm sick and tired of all
the big guilds on the board.

263
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,910
You think they can? What if they do?!

264
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,790
It's Maple after all!

265
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,250
Did you guys gather any orbs, Maple?

266
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,700
Uh, not really.

267
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,450
There were lots of guilds without one.

268
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,080
That's a shame.

269
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,700
In the end, we only came back with two.

270
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,660
This is progressing faster than I thought.

271
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,040
It's not just small guilds.
The medium ones are nearly gone, too.

272
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,700
I think it's time we moved on to the next stage.

273
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,830
Mmm.

274
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,040
It's chaos out there.

275
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,080
The guilds are getting desperate.

276
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,750
That includes Maple Tree.

277
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,790
Maple Tree, huh?

278
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,250
They've got a nice collection of orbs.

279
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,080
Then let's take 'em off their hands.

280
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,790
Agreed!

281
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,500
I have one worry though: Holy Sword.

282
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
Agreed.

283
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,910
He did say he'd come back.

284
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,200
Yup. They'll want to settle the score.

285
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,160
I don't want to end the event
without paying them back.

286
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
It would be nice to fight
under ideal conditions, but...

287
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,870
But on the other hand,

288
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,000
seeing how we're both exhausted
and Maple's [Devour] is used up,

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,330
it's very likely they'll attack us tonight.

290
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,660
Still, Maple Tree has little reason
to meet us in battle.

291
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,120
In which case...

292
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,830
We need to take our orb
and leave before they come.

293
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,450
A big guild like that can't move very fast,
so they'll take a while to get here.

294
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,580
Are we ready?

295
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,660
You still wanna fight after saying all that?

296
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,200
I want to conquer this Maple.

297
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,950
And I don't think I'm the only one
who's excited by the thought.

298
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,580
We'll go as soon as we're ready.

299
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,750
Okay!

300
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,580
It's too early! Don't tell me...!

301
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,790
Just four of 'em?!

302
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,200
A small party of their top players
moves a lot faster than an army.

303
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,500
But to throw away their main advantage...

304
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,580
...and not overrun us with sheer numbers?

305
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,750
I figured we'd be more
than enough to defeat you.

306
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,160
They're taking us lightly.

307
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,870
Now that it's come to this,
let's duke it out already.

308
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,750
Howdy, Sally!

309
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,330
You won't be tricking me this time.

310
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,790
Come on and show us what you've got!

311
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,870
Hello, girls. It's time for round two.

312
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,410
Maple. I've always wanted to fight you.

313
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,660
Payne... I've heard you're
the strongest player there is, but...

314
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,580
...I will not lose!

315
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,950
Fight me!

316
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,950
[Loving Sacrifice]!

317
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,330
Don't think so!

318
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,750
Outta the way!

319
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,370
You okay?

320
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,250
Yeah! But what about Maple?

321
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,870
I'm afraid you'll have to fight me.

322
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,660
[Aftershock]!

323
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,540

324
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,370
A knockback?! I've gotta get back!

326
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,870
You're mine!

327
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,200
Not in a million years!

328
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,700
Are you two all right?

329
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,120
Y-Yeah!

330
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,450
You better be careful or I'll snatch it up!

331
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,410
Iz! Kanade! Protect the orb!

332
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,500

333
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,950
[Dispel Magic]!

334
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,950
Whew! Got some tough cookies here!

335
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
H-He's incredibly strong!

336
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,370
Told you, didn't I?
We're more than enough to win!

J-Jeez!

340
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,910
Maple! You should cancel it!

341
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,870
G-Got it!

342
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,120
Your head's mine!

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,910
"[NWO] The Watchers of Maple Tree thread

"772. Hey! Payne's finally on the move!"

350
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,040
"[NWO] The Watchers of Maple Tree thread

"773. What now?! What's gonna happen?!"
