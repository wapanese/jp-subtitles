1
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,750
May, Yui! I need you guys to attack it!

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,950
Got it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,580
Great! Hydra!

4
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,870
Woo-hoo!

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,500
Did a new magic circle appear
'cuz it's your second time through?

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,450
Yup! This one takes you back to the city...

7
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,700
...and this one back to the entrance!

8
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,000
Come on! Let's go back and do it again!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,950
Okay!

10
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,620
"Defense and Upgrades"
A time trial?

11
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,200
Yeah! Because it gets pretty boring
doing the same thing every time.

12
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,250
I was thinking we should see
how fast we can clear it!

13
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,250
The shorter it takes, the quicker
we'll be able to level up, but...

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,540
How's that gonna work when
all three of us have zero agility?

15
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,660
I've got an idea! Drink this!

16
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,660
What's this?

17
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,870
A poison resist potion?

18
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,790
See!? Having zero agility
doesn't matter anymore!

19
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,250
Y-Yeah, but...!

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,830
My head's spinning!

21
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,830
Go for it, you two!

22
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,580
R-Right!

23
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,120
Hurry up with Hydra!

24
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,660
This time we're doing it different!

25
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,750
Huh? We won?

26
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,040
Quick, through the magic circle!

27
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,750
Three minutes two seconds! So close!
We almost broke three minutes!

28
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,500
Um, Maple?

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,950
How did you just...?

30
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,910
A skill called [Devour].

31
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,790
We beat the boss way faster, right?

32
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,200
Yeah...

33
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,500
Thing is, I can only use it ten times a day.

34
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,410
Let's try to beat our time
with the other nine I've got left!

35
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,410
A-All right.

36
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,620
I'll try not to get dizzy!

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,120
In that case, let's go!

38
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,700
Yay!

39
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,660
As of today, May and Yui have
officially reached level 20!

40
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,370
That's wonderful! You guys worked hard!

41
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,910
You sure gained a lot in one day!

42
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,500
Thank you!

43
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,910
But there's more than just that!

44
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,910
Did something else happen?

45
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,660
Our last run cleared it faster
than 2:30. And so...

46
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,950
...we got this skill!

47
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,450
[Conqueror] and [Destroyer]?

48
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,910
"Conqueror"
"Having this skill gives the user 2x STR.
[VIT], [AGI], [INT] require 3x the points to increase."
Conqueror gives the user twice the strength!

49
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,330
"Destroyer"
"Allows two-handed weapons
to be equipped in one hand."
Conqueror gives the user twice the strength!

50
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,330
To get it, you have to beat the boss
a number of times within a time frame.

51
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,250
Destroyer lets you take weapons
that are usually two handed...

52
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,790
...and equip them as one-handed weapons!

53
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,000
You need to clear a dungeon
within a certain time to get it!

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,620
Huh? You're saying you guys have
two times the strength now?

55
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,200
And you can hold two-handed weapons
in one hand now?!

56
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,160
Yup!

57
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,700
And it's perfect for them
'cuz they're maxing out attack!

58
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,000
Uh, you guys awake?

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,160
It's just, being with you and all, I figured
they'd find some weird skills, but...

60
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,620
This blows my expectations away.

61
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,830
Now May and Yui have some legit firepower.

62
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,120
Firepower!

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,660
You think so?!

64
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,160
Sounds like you need new weapons!

65
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,870
Hold on a sec. The best thing
I've got on hand is...

66
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,160
This! Crystal Hammer!

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
"Crystal Hammer"
"[STR +25] [Size Boost]" "Increases the target's size.
Lasts 30 seconds. 1-minute cooldown."
Awesome!

68
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,540
You sure we can have these?

69
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
Of course! I'd love if you used them!

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,250
Thank you so much!

71
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,660
I hope we can help you guys out!

72
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,750
Hey, guys! Good morning!

73
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,250
Huh? It's just you two?

74
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,540
Everyone else left already.

75
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,250
Kanade's at the library.

76
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,250
There's apparently some quest
that needed doing today.

77
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,660
Kasumi's out collecting materials
for me as a favor.

78
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,370
Sally's with May and Yui
hunting monsters and such.

79
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,620
She wanted to teach them how to
dodge attacks even with low agility.

80
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,200
Yeah? Everyone's going all out!

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,580
I was just about to leave as well.

82
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,950
Unless I get new skills or something,
I feel like my worth will dive-bomb.

83
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,700
Oh! In that case...!

84
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Hmm?

85
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,660
Never thought she'd lend me her little partner.

86
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,660
Sure, I'm grateful, but your master
trusts people a bit too much.

87
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,080
If I felt like it, I could easily
steal you and ditch the guild.

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,910
Turtle!

89
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,160
No, no, no. I'm not really going to, all right?

90
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,120
Still, there're a lot of jerks in the world.

91
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,910
Being a game veteran,
I've gotta watch over those guys.

92
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want 'em to enjoy the game, that's all.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,540
Turtle!

94
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,700
Hmm?

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,160
A hidden dungeon?

96
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,500
Size Boost!

97
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,250
Whoa! Just one attack...!

98
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,410
We really can hold two!

99
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,450
But we've gotta work on
your evasion though!

100
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,540
You're awesome, Sally!

101
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,000
You cut it so close!

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,290
Even with low agility, you can dodge
attacks if you see 'em coming.

103
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,790
I'll teach you everything I know!

104
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay!

105
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,620
Now for the last piece.

106
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,910
Is it another new staff?

107
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,200
It's the same type as the one I've got.

108
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,700
Huh? Whoa...

109
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,330
They merged into one!

110
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,830
Let's try it out.

111
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,660
Spell Stash!

112
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,080
Whoa! That's pretty cool!

113
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,040
I can store spells or skills
that take MP in the Spell Stash,

114
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,250
and use them whenever I want!

115
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,580
Should I give it a shot?

116
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,410
Store Fireball in the Spell Stash!

117
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,790
It takes 30 minutes to be stored, huh?

118
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,830
Guess I'll just wait.

119
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,250
Oh?

120
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,450
Hmm, hmm. It takes twice the MP.

121
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,080
Fireball!

122
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,250
That time didn't take MP
and it's instant cast, too.

123
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,450
Basically, you pay MP in advance
to use a skill instantly.

124
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,080
Which means if I use Akashic Records,

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,290
I can store any skill I get
as long as it takes MP!

126
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,950
I am such a lucky duck!

127
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,250
If I botch this attack, it'll run away.

128
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,080
Skill [Shear]!

129
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,000
Success.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,830
Having said that, I only got one.

131
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,540
Hmm?

132
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,500
"Maple"       "Sure could use your sword."
"I'd appreciate it if you"
"came quickly."

133
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,620
Maple's here, too?

134
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,410
U-Um, Maple?

135
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,040
Thank goodness you came!

136
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,790
What are you doing?

137
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,620
I was thinking I'd help collect materials...

138
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,330
...and I learned a new skill
while playing with all the sheep!

139
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,000
Uh, I get the picture. Just a sec...

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,290
Shear!

141
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,290
You saved me!

142
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,950
What skill did you get exactly?

143
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,450
Um, it's called [Wooly]!
Watch, I'll do it again!

144
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,950
Wooly!

145
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,450
Now we can collect as much
sheep wool as we want!

146
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,450
And I thought of this, too!
If I combine it with poison magic...

147
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,450
...enemies can't get close! Isn't it smart?!

148
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,040
But I can't get close either now.

149
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,450
Huh? Wha...? Help me!
I can't get rid of this on my own!

150
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,080
Someone's gotta clip all this fur!

151
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,410
Sorry, but I can't till the poison ends.

152
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,950
You're kidding!

153
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,540
My goodness. I could just watch this forever.

154
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Shield Attack!

155
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,500
So this dungeon's called "Grave of the Dead"?

156
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,040
In order to enter, you have to have died
and revived at least four times. Hmm.

157
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm pretty much the top player
as far as dying goes.

158
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,080
But hey, mastering
the great shield is a tough job.

159
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,200
"Spirit Cannon"
"Can only be used with [Megamorph].
A long-range frontal attack."
Turtle!

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,120
"Spirit Cannon"
"Can only be used with [Megamorph].
A long-range frontal attack."
Hmm? Did you learn a skill?

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,790
"Mother Nature"
"Calls upon earth, vine,
and tree to attack and defend."
Hmm? Did you learn a skill?

162
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,620
"Mother Nature"
"Calls upon earth, vine,
and tree to attack and defend."
Turtle!

163
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,500
Oh? Those seem quite powerful.

164
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,910
I should get something for clearing it, too.

165
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,160
"One-of-a-kind equipment awarded to the first
player who defeats a dungeon boss
solo on their first encounter."

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,580
"One-of-a-kind equipment awarded to the first
player who defeats a dungeon boss
solo on their first encounter."
"Unique Series"...

167
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,580
It's good! It'd be perfect if it didn't
seem like it's gonna curse me.

168
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,830
Maybe it's about time I start
getting a little crazy myself.

169
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,290
Turtle!

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,700
Everyone's out leveling today!
I wonder what I should do?

171
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,370
It's been a while since I went on my own,
so let's go somewhere new today!

172
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,500
Huh?

173
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,040
You okay?

174
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,870
I'm sorry I can't do anything for you.

175
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,200
What's that? An NPC that
gives out a quest maybe?

176
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,660
--Um...!
--Uh...

177
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,620
Are you a knight?

178
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,160
Uh, er... I dunno?

179
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,580
Miss Knight! Please, help my daughter!

180
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,580
We have no way to repay you,
but please! Please!

181
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,540
"Quest [Benevolent Knight]"

182
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,500
"Quest [Benevolent Knight]"
I knew it.

183
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,410
I'd feel awful if I didn't, so...

184
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,450
Thank you so much!

185
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,750
My daughter needs medicine,
but I don't think I can get there myself!

186
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,450
I can guide you there, so take me with you!

187
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,500
All right! I can be your escort!

188
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,580
To complete this, the mother has to reach
the destination without dying.

189
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,620
Should we start by heading outside the city?

190
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,370
Yes! The Spring of Purification
is to the northwest!

191
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,700
If you could just take me there...

192
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,660
This forest is full of dreadful monsters.

193
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,120
Please be careful, Miss Knight!

194
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,660
All right!

195
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,830
I get the feeling it won't
matter much if we're flying.

196
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,950
Thank you so much!

197
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,290
Now I can save my daughter!

198
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,160
Thank goodness! Let's head back!

199
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,330
Whoa!

200
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,830
Thank you for protecting me!

201
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,580
I was so close to dying back there!

202
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,200
Huh? What's wrong?!

203
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,040
If not for you, those dreadful monsters
would've gotten me for sure!

204
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,080
How can I ever repay you?!

205
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,910
Ah, I get it. Escaping the forest
was supposed to be kinda difficult.

206
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,160
That's why her dialogue seems so weird.

207
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,620
You risked your life for strangers like us!

208
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,370
You're such an incredibly kind knight!

209
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,450
Uh, I feel like I should apologize.

210
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,830
Well?

211
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,410
Yeah. It's a little better.

212
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,700
But your cough is still awful.

213
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,120
Dear me, what to do?

214
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,580
Hmm?

215
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,290
"Quest [Benevolent Knight 2]"

216
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,750
Oh, I see. This must be
one of those quest chains.

217
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,700
Miss Knight! You'll help us again?!

218
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,120
I can't just give up now. What do we do next?

219
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,700
I've heard there's a ring
that heals the body,

220
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,250
and it's found near a large
city in a distant land.

221
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,290
If you could just find that for me...

222
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,540
A large city? Could she mean
the city on the First Level?

223
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,500
"Acquired [Forest Queen Bee's Ring]."
Which means the ring might be...

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,040
Which means the ring might be...

225
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,620
Miss Knight! You actually found it!

226
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,370
So fast!

227
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,910
Oh! How could I ever thank you enough?!

228
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,200
Huh? That's all there is to it?

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,450
I can't imagine all the trouble
you went through to get this!

230
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,750
Thank you so much!

231
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,290
Uh, I really didn't do anything.

232
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,450
Let's put this on your finger.

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,870
Huh? What's wrong?!

234
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,870
Oh, no! What happened to her?!

235
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,250
Huh? Oh... Go figure, right?

236
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,370
"Quest [Benevolent Knight 3]"
Huh? Oh... Go figure, right?

237
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,910
Miss Knight! You're going to
lend us your help again?!

238
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,870
Well, since I've come this far...
What should we do now?

239
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,870
I believe she went to the Temple of Darkness.

240
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,540
There she is!

241
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,410
Careful!

242
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,790
Cover Move! Cover!

243
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,950
Hydra!

244
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,160
What now? I can't use Venom Capsule
while protecting the mother!

245
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,290
And there're too many to Devour!

246
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,290
Huh? What?

247
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,910
The holy water she drank
must have taken effect!

248
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,910
You mean from that spring?

249
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,290
Yes!

250
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,330
My daughter must have been
possessed by a demon!

251
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,790
Um, let's figure this out.

252
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:21,450
Regardless if you fail the first quest or not,
maybe you get the next quest.

253
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,830
But since I finished it no problem,
the girl could drink the holy water,

254
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,580
so the ghosts all got wiped out.

255
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,540
How could I possibly thank you enough?

256
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,750
But now my daughter won't open her eyes!

257
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,830
I haven't the slightest idea what to do!

258
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,950
In other words, I bet there's
another quest coming up.

259
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,330
"Begin quest [Benevolent Knight 4].
OR
Begin extra quest [Loving Sacrifice]."
Extra quest? Loving Sacrifice?

260
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,700
"Benevolent Knight 4" "Loving Sacrifice"

261
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,040
A church in ruins...?

262
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,620
There's an old church in the south forest.

263
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,830
It might mean that one!

264
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,700
All right, wait here!

265
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,700
Hmm?

266
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,450
What's this?

267
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,580
"Long ago, an archangel who fought monsters had
their wing stolen and turned into a monster
themselves. This is a piece of their stolen
wing. Return it to revive the archangel."

268
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,790
Miss Knight, what's that?

269
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,910
I don't know, but I'll try it out!

270
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,410
Whoa!

271
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,450
Miss Knight! What's this?!

272
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,500
Thank you. I was protecting
this child from monsters,

273
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,700
but I had my power stolen and
was unable to leave the child.

274
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,250
R-Right...

275
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,580
It almost cost this poor child their life.

276
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,870
As thanks, I will bestow you
with a part of my power.

277
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,660
Huh? Mom?

278
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,200
That was a weird way to end things,
but I guess this means case closed.

279
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,540
"Acquired skill [Loving Sacrifice]."

280
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,410
"Acquired skill [Loving Sacrifice]."
Acquired skill [Loving Sacrifice].

281
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,200
What?

282
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,160
Hey, Iz! Do you think you could
make me a new set of gear?!

283
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,660
Sure, but...

284
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,830
Ta-da!

285
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,910
Ooh! That's the new gear Iz made for you?

286
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,910
It looks great on you!

287
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,200
It's like a whole new you!

288
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,160
You look lovely, Maple!

289
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,870
So pretty!

290
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,500
There's more to it than this, right?

291
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,200
You could've just showed off
your new gear at the guild house.

292
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,080
You know me so well!

293
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Actually, I wanted everyone
to see a new skill of mine!

294
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,000
A new skill?

295
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,910
Loving Sacrifice!

296
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,410
I had the same sort of reaction.

297
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,870
Here they come!

298
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,290
What's going on?

299
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,750
This is her new skill.

300
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,000
Every party member within [Loving Sacrifice]
is protected by [Cover].

301
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,330
Um, then as long as we're
standing in this light,

302
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,500
we essentially have
the same defense as Maple?

303
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,700
Yup! I take a good hit of HP initially though!

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,120
This is way overpowered.

305
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,200
As long as Maple's alive, it means
the rest of us are practically invincible.

306
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,910
Plus, downing Maple herself
is a feat that's next to impossible.

307
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,160
As long as we're with Maple...

308
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,750
...you're saying we're kinda immortal?

309
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,450
By the way, what's your vitality at?

310
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,330
Um, I'm not sure.
I know I went over 1,000 though.

311
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Maple is truly our guardian angel!

312
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,450
Now then, about the guild competition...

313
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,250
Besides Flame Emperors,
there's another guild that concerns me.

314
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,620
Maple Tree.

315
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,660
Maple's guild, right?

316
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,000
Never thought that one lost newbie
would end up being this strong.

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,410
Isn't that blue-armored girl from
the second event in Maple Tree, too?

318
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,660
She seems pretty dangerous.

319
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,200
It all depends what the event is.

320
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,950
We can crush 'em with our resources.

321
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,870
At worst, Payne can always do something.

322
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,750
Everyone in our guild is powerful
in their own right.

323
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,250
We won't have problems if we get poison resist.

324
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,250
What scares me most is the unknown.

325
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,660
We need to research our enemy.

326
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,000
You're such a worry-wart.

327
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,040
There's a third event scheduled
before the guild competition.

328
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,700
Which is why we'll keep an eye
on Maple and her Maple Tree...

329
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,830
...and see how they fare.

330
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,160
"[NWO] The Watchers of Fortress Maple thread
(Part 1) [Flying Fortress]"

331
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,660
"[NWO] The Watchers of Fortress Maple thread
(Part 1) [Flying Fortress]"
"158. Guys, Maple is an angel."

332
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,120
"[NWO] The Watchers of Fortress Maple thread
(Part 1) [Flying Fortress]"
"158. Guys, Maple is an angel."
"159. Yeah, we all know."

333
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,540
"160. u must be new here"

334
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,200
"160. u must be new here"
"161. Maple's our angel and always will be."

335
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,830
"162. Lemme try this again. Maple got a skill
that turns her into a blue-eyed blonde-haired
angel with halo, wings, and the whole shebang."

336
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,160
"162. Lemme try this again. Maple got a skill
that turns her into a blue-eyed blonde-haired
angel with halo, wings, and the whole shebang."
"163. Wat?"

337
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,450
"164. HOW?! Where did she get that skill?!"

338
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,200
"165. No clue. She always ends up finding weird
skills the second I take my eyes off her."

339
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,540
"165. No clue. She always ends up finding weird
skills the second I take my eyes off her."
"166. SHE'S ALREADY GONE
2ND FORM ON US?!"

340
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,870
