1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,790
Enemies! They got our orb!

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,700
Chase 'em! Get it back!

3
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,620
Over there!

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,370
--He's cornered!
--Nice one!

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,160
Cut 'em off from that side!

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,700
[Wind Cutter]!

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,290
Impressive as ever.

8
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,830
Didn't even need skills or magic
going up against that many.

9
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,580
Drag? You should've lent me
a hand if you were here.

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,540
I didn't exactly have time for it.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,120
How many you get?

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,580
Who knows? It was a pain to keep track.

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,000
Maybe around 20 or so?

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,750
If you felt like it, couldn't you just
wipe out all the guilds on your own?

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,540
I'm not sure. One of them
might actually put up a fight.

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,660
Maple Tree, huh?

17
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,120
"Defense and Attack"

18
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,120
Whoa!

19
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,910
--Ten orbs, guys! Ten! What a big haul! Woo-hoo!

20
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,250
--It's only the first day and we're on a roll.
--Ten orbs, guys! Ten! What a big haul! Woo-hoo!

21
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,080
--It's only the first day and we're on a roll.
--Splish splash hurray!

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,200
They disappeared!

23
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,200
They returned since it's been three hours.

24
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,620
That's more points on the board!

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,200
It's too early to celebrate.
We're aiming for top ten.

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,620
Thing is, we're 17th place.

27
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,950
Well then, guess I'll head out again.

28
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,620
Huh? Already?

29
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,910
It'll get harder to ambush when it's light out.

30
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,290
Keep it safe.

31
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,540
Take care!

32
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,580
Good luck!

33
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,830
Be careful!

34
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,700
Will she be all right?

35
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,250
She should have rested a bit longer.

36
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,410
She wants to get as many orbs
as she can while she's able.

37
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,790
There's a high chance for small guilds
to get wiped out early on.

38
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,040
But if their orbs vanish,
we can't get any points from them.

39
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,120
So while guilds like that are still around,

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
she's raising our rank as much as possible.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,450
Otherwise, there's no way
we can compete with the big guilds.

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,000
Even so, I feel like she's
pushing herself way too hard.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,410
It's Sally we're talking about.
Maybe she has a reason for it.

44
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,330
I think I'll go and gather orbs, too.

45
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,580
Huh? What made you say that?

46
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,000
'Cuz I've been stuck inside
since the event started.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,700
I wanna sightsee.

48
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,950
So you say. But really you wanna
lighten the load for Sally, right?

49
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,250
Lemme know if something happens. Later!

50
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,120
Kanade has such a kind side.

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,910
[Spell Stash].

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,830
[Titan Arm].

53
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,160
What the--?!

54
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,870
Enemy attack! After 'em!

55
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,330
There they are! Over here!

56
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,040
[Flare Accel]!

57
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,200
Wonder if I should snatch a few more?

58
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,410
With all the orbs we've got, won't
more people come to take them back?

59
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,450
We don't have to sit pretty and wait.
Wanna set up an ambush?

60
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,200
I'll come too.

61
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,370
I think we've got defense covered
with Maple, May, and Yui here.

62
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,410
All right! Go for it!

63
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,660
Be careful!

64
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Just like I thought.
They're swarming in from all sides.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
I'll take the ones on the right. You go left.

66
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,620
All right.

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
[Super Speed]!

68
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,450
She got through!

69
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,160
Don't let her get away!

70
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,660
Oboro, [Fire Tail]!

71
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,540
That sure took it out of me.

72
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,750
Ten orbs, huh?

73
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,660
Not sure if it'll get us top ten though.

74
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,950
I'm worn out. Wanna head back, Oboro?

75
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,450
We're surrounded!

76
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,160
Iz! Any more bombs?

77
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,700
Don't worry! I've got more
where that came from!

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,450
This many's gonna be rough!

79
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,410
Kuromu!

80
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,160
It's my lucky day!

81
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,330
I thought you were a goner! Was that a skill?

82
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,200
[Dead or Alive]. I get a 50% chance
to stay alive when I reach zero HP.

83
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,620
You're a god of death now.
So you gave up being human, too?

84
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,290
Seriously?

85
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,410
[Fourth of Sword - Whirlwind]!

86
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,410
You're there, aren't you? Come out.

87
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,660
Yo! You sure went all out, Kasumi.

88
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,700
Split-Sword Shin. Long time no see.

89
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,160
Since the first event, right?

90
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,160
You know, I was gonna invite you
into Flame Emperors.

91
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Sorry about that. Maple got to me first.

92
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,290
I still can't believe you beat me last time.

93
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,200
But this time, I'm gonna win!

94
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,950
[Split-Sword]!

95
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,370
I can't shake 'em off! These guys are good!

96
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,040
Oho? Is that Sally?

97
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,700
Frederica?!

98
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,040
I came to see what was going on.

99
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,660
Our recon squad said there was
a solo player causing trouble.

100
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,910
Looks like you've been pretty busy.

101
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,830
Sorry, but we'll be taking
those orbs you've gathered!

102
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,910
It's from Sally.

103
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,290
"Might die. Sorry."

104
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,370
"Might die. Sorry."

105
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,370
What?

106
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,000
[Cascade]!

107
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,200
Magic attack!

108
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,200
[Coax Attack]!

109
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,250
[Cascade] lets you repel attacks
with a physical body.

110
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,660
[Coax Attack] lets you bend
an attack's trajectory.

111
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,540
Both of them should have a long cooldown.

112
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,870
A cooldown...?

113
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,750
They're not... skills?!

114
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,450
Those're just her normal reflexes?!

115
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,120
[Multi-Firebolt]!

116
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Oboro! [Shadow Clone]!

117
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,870
What was that?!

118
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,950
This might be bad!

119
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,450
Frederica!

120
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,290
Reinforcements!

121
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,120
You made it in time! Thank you!

122
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,910
You really fooled me good!

123
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,000
To think you managed
to fake a skill like that!

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,250
Still, you're in no shape to fight
this many people, right?

125
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,950
[Multi-Barrier]!

126
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,910
Next time, I won't lose!

127
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm sorry, Maple...

128
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,790
[Multi-Fire--

129
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,160
Sally!

130
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,580
Maple?!

131
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,620
I won't allow it! Never!

132
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,160
M-Maple?!

133
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,870
M-Magic attack!

134
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,540
Syrup, [Bastion]!

135
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,500
Turtle!

136
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,080
Maple?! How'd you get here so quick?!

137
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,870
I'll explain later! Hold on to me!

138
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,290
R-Right!

139
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,200
[Deploy Cannon]!

140
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,540
[Deploy Armaments]! [Commence Attack]!

141
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,160
[Hydra]!

142
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,500
Huh?!

143
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,330
What is that?!

144
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,040
This isn't over just yet.

145
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,160
Dread! It's an emergency!

146
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,040
I wonder if Maple made it in time?

147
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,450
I really hope she comes back soon.

148
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,410
Hmm?

149
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,580
Huh?!

150
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,700
I see. Then it's true that both
Maple and Sally are gone.

151
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,660
It's just you two holding the fort?

152
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,620
Well then. It's a pity,
but I won't be holding back.

153
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,750
We gotta tell the others!

154
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,790
But will they come in time?!

155
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,370
From May? What?

156
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,700
You don't have time to look away!

157
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,910
Our base is under attack!

158
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,410
Talk about terrible timing!

159
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,750
I'm ten minutes away from base!
I hope someone gets there!

160
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,290
[Aftershock]!

161
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,580
[Double Stamp]!

162
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,830
Sis, fall back!

163
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,290
Right!

164
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,080
You're too slow!

165
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,620
Sis!

166
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,160
[Aftershock]!

167
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,580
We're not much on our own,

168
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,290
but together...

169
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,870
...we're enough to beat even you!

170
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,790
Couldn't dodge that. You know,
you guys are starting to annoy me!

171
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,750
First, one...

172
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,040
...and two!

173
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,330
Maple!

174
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,160
We're sorry!

175
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,080
Messing with this guild
sure takes it outta you.

176
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,290
Maple?!

177
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,160
[Loving Sacrifice]!

178
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,290
AoE defense?

179
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,910
[Predator]!

180
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,540
Syrup, [Mother Nature]!

181
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,790
Turtle!

182
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,120
Turtle!

183
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,660
Okay, you've beat me this time.

184
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,750
But I'll soon be back!
And with my comrades, too!

185
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,250
We'll beat you as many times as it takes!

186
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,540
[Split-Sword] breaks a sword
into ten parts you control.

187
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,200
You're much better at it this time!

188
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,370
How come you haven't gotten serious yet?

189
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,620
Show me your techniques already!

190
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,040
[First of Sword - Heat Haze]!

191
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,910
That skill would be tough
to fend off without a shield!

192
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,830
[Seventh of Sword - Shatter]!

193
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,250
You've really upped your attack power!

194
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,120
But I have too! [Split-Sword]!

195
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,580
They doubled?!

196
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,790
This time, victory is mine!

197
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,950
[Origin of Sword - Void]!

198
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,910
Where is she?!

199
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,410
Right here.

200
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Good grief, I lost again?

201
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,410
But I've only died once! I'll be back soon!

202
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,830
May we meet again during the event!

203
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,410
Maple made it in time?

204
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,580
Maple! Guys!

205
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,540
May, Yui! Sorry I was late!

206
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,450
You two did a great job!

207
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,660
Thanks to you, our orb is safe.

208
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,450
Thank goodness!

209
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,250
Maple. Did you take damage
for Syrup back there?

210
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,040
Uh, yeah. I guess piercing attacks
get through the defense.

211
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,500
All the damage gets passed on to me.

212
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,830
I'm just glad the orbs are safe.

213
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,450
Sorry I wasn't back in time.

214
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,910
It's okay! We only died once!

215
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,120
We're just glad to be useful!

216
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,870
I actually got saved by Maple, too.

217
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,910
Luckily, my bluff came in handy.

218
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,950
Oh.

219
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,910
Here. I got more orbs.

220
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,950
Me, too. Not as many as Sally though.

221
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,080
We've stolen 22 orbs.

222
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,160
If we can protect these for three hours,
we'll go way up in rank.

223
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,080
We wiped out everyone
who's come for their orb so far.

224
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,290
If people know we're dangerous,
fewer should try to attack.

225
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,580
I know it's a little early, but I think
it's time to proceed with Plan B.

226
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,620
Look!

227
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,160
Whoa!

228
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,450
I get it! So this is why you
were outside so long!

229
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,870
I've mapped all the terrain and
the location of pretty much every guild.

230
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,700
This will be perfect to execute Plan B.

231
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,370
Plan B--the big reveal of Maple.

232
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:45,290
Yup. Instead of Maple defending the base,
she'll go out and take orbs.

233
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:51,080
We can't use third level machines for
this event, but Maple can already fly.

234
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,410
You guys join her.

235
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,250
Okay!

236
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,790
We'll stir up the big guilds and cause
battles to give ourselves a chance.

237
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,290
I planned an attack order,
so the rest is all you.

238
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,450
As for me, I think I'll rest.

239
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,910
Sally?!

240
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,080
She's completely worn herself out.

241
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,450
We should let her sleep.

242
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,910
Maple!

243
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,250
Let's go!

244
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,120
Mmm!

245
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,540
Enemy attack! It's just one!

246
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,250
H-Hey, is that...?!

247
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,700
It's Maple!

248
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,120
W-We've got this! P-Protect the orb!

249
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,660
[Predator]!

250
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,500
We've come for your orb!

251
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,790
Gotcha!

252
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,870
What's the next one?

253
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,410
It'll be number ten!

254
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,370
We're on a good pace!

255
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,580
Who do we attack next?

256
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,160
According to Sally's plan, it's Flame
Emperors! The ones in second place!

257
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,040
All right, let's go!

258
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
Misery, have you heard?

259
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,160
Maple Tree is attacking
guilds one after another.

260
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,500
I know.

261
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,580
Seeing how Shin died and all,
I don't want to butt heads with that guild.

262
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,000
Maple, huh? Let's hope she doesn't come.

263
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,580
Markus! Misery!
There's a turtle flying this way!

264
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,910
Turtle? Which means...

265
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,000
She's come after all.

266
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,540
Have you told Mii?

267
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,160
Yeah. She said she'll hurry back.

268
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,660
Thank goodness. We just need
to buy her some time.

269
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,580
Now then, how many of my traps
will actually work on her?

270
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,750
I guess that was a bust.

271
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,120
That's Maple and her AoE defense for you.

272
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,830
But you prepared special traps
just for Maple, didn't you?

273
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,450
It got her!

274
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,870
Oh?

275
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,080
What?!

276
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,250
Seriously?!

277
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,500
--Markus.
--Huh?

278
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,750
How many traps are there that will work on her?

279
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,250
Three. But at this rate,
she'll break through 'em all.

280
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,200
So be it. Everyone head back.

281
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,540
Are you sure?

282
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,000
Misery and I will hold her off.

283
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,700
We'll try to keep her occupied for a while.

284
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,500
Go protect the orb.

285
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,540
Understood.

286
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,040
Good luck!

287
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,250
[Hydra]!

288
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,870
[Antidote]!

289
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,290
[Remote Trap - Stone Wall]!

290
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,700
[Remote Trap - Wind Strike]!

291
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
May, Yui! It's all you!

292
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,910
Got it!

293
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,580
[Aftershock]!

294
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,250
I guess this is the end of the road.

295
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,500
Mii!

296
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,200
"[NWO] The 4th event begins! (Part 7)"

297
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
"[NWO] The 4th event begins! (Part 7)"

298
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
"872. It's begun! The main event
we've all been waiting for!"

299
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,950
"[NWO] The 4th event begins! (Part 7)"

300
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,950
"872. It's begun! The main event
we've all been waiting for!"
"873. NWO PRESENTS: Maple VS Mii!"

301
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,830
"874. Bring on the guild master showdown!"

302
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,250
"874. Bring on the guild master showdown!"
"875. They're both high ranked atm!
Flame Emperors is 2nd and Maple Tree is 7th!"

303
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,700
"876. Can Mii's fire attacks scorch

304
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,540

Mii and the Flame Emperors?!"

305
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,040
"877. Can max-defense Maple conquer
Mii and the Flame Emperors?!"
"878. SO PUMPED!! qwerty FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"
