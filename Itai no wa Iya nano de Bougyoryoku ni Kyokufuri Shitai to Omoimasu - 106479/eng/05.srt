1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,410
You have one, don't you? A gold medal.

2
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,830
Huh?

3
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,910
What?!

4
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,160
Two against one is bad odds.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,660
Think we'll let you escape
after picking a fight?

6
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,950
Super Speed!

7
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,200
Super Speed!

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,580
Huh?

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,950
What?! W-Wait for me!

10
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,160
"Defense and Spoils of War"

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,830
How do you have Super Speed?

12
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,330
Perhaps you're underestimating me?

13
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,870
I withdrew because I'm certainly not.

14
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,290
First of Sword - Heat Haze!

15
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,540
What?

16
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Everyone has that reaction the first time.

17
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,750
I can't stop!

18
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,450
M-Maple?!

19
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,790
Huh?

20
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,580
What the--?!

21
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,950
Maple!

22
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
Where are we?

23
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,040
What was that about?

24
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,160
Huh?

25
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,790
"Cursed chains linking three people together.
Those bound by the chains share the same
fate--all dying should one of them perish."

26
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,790
"[Binding Chains]"...

27
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,870
If anyone dies while bound
by the chains, everyone does.

28
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,410
And it's unbreakable.

29
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,700
Ugh, that's rough.

30
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,580
Don't worry! I'll protect you no matter what!

31
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,660
Yup. I'm counting on you.

32
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,500
I feel out of place here.

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,370
Let's call a truce for now.

34
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,830
That's right! We all have to work together!

35
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,830
Let's all just get along!

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,160
My name's Sally.

37
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,830
I guess we're in this together. I'm Kasumi.

38
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,950
Maple here!

39
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,040
We may need to clear the dungeon
in order to break the chains.

40
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,790
Ugh! Depending on the boss, we might be doomed.

41
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,250
Wh-Whoa!

42
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,120
S-Sorry.

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,410
Sorry, Maple. You okay?

44
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,450
I'm fine! Hmm?

45
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,500
It's a medal! Yippie!

46
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,450
Uh...

47
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,370
Maple's the one who found it,
so it's fine if Maple keeps it.

48
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,450
But we're all together...

49
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,200
You're surprisingly kind.
But whoever finds something should keep it.

50
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,910
That's right. No hard feelings.

51
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,700
Okay, got it!

52
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,040
I wonder if this is an exploration-type
dungeon since we found a medal?

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,410
Hmm. If you ask me, I prefer dungeons where

54
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,290
you beat the boss
and that's all there is to it.

55
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,120
Uh-huh! Me, too!

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,080
Yeah. I'm better at fighting anyway.

57
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,000
As long as it's nothing like that big bird!

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,160
Big bird?

59
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,660
Oh, well you see...

60
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,200
Two days ago, we fought this boss
with crazy HP and it really took...

61
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,160
Which way do you think we go?

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,910
Hmm? What's wrong?

63
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,790
Shh!

64
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,870
I don't think it's a monster.

65
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,290
Huh? Why not?

66
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,620
I tried to check its HP bar,
but it wouldn't come up.

67
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,660
Which means it can't be killed.

68
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,830
It must be a mechanic
you have to stay away from.

69
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,410
Not good.

70
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,370
We'll be trapped!

71
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,450
Hmm?

72
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,160
Super Speed!

73
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,870
What? Wait!

74
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,290
Huh? What's the problem?

75
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,330
Now there's nowhere to run.

76
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,500
Look! There!

77
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,540
But it's way up there...

78
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,500
What do we do?!

79
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,200
Sally, use Leap!

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,620
But it's too high!

81
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,540
I've got an idea! Hurry!

82
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,950
Leap!

83
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,660
I knew I wouldn't reach it!

84
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,120
Third of Sword - Lonely Moon!

85
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,250
I'm really glad that worked.

86
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,540
Thanks, Kasumi. I couldn't have
reached it with my Leap alone.

87
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,410
Well, same goes for my Lonely Moon.

88
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,950
It only worked because of your Leap.

89
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,580
Now then...

90
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,750
Oh! Hey, look at that!

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,080
Guess this means we cleared it.

92
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
We made it in one piece!

93
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,410
Yeah.

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,790
Ready? I'm opening it.

95
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,790
Sure.

96
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,120
Oof!

97
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,540
Whoa!

98
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,910
What now?

99
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,290
I have no use for shields.
You can have it, Maple.

100
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,870
Then you take the staff and
spear since we won't use 'em.

101
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,790
Yeah, those are all yours.

102
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,660
Thanks.

103
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,870
The skill scrolls are all the same thing,
so we can split those evenly.

104
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,830
That leaves...

105
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,330
May I, Maple?

106
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,700
Yeah! Of course!

107
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,200
I figured.

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,410
Here! This one's yours!

109
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,870
Are you sure?

110
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,950
I already picked one up in the cave,
so now we have one a piece!

111
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,830
Thank you.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Whoa, it's already nighttime outside!

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,200
I knew we were in there a while,
but day four's already over?

114
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,750
I'm sorry, Maple. Sally.

115
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,700
Huh?

116
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,450
For challenging you like I did earlier.

117
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,000
If you wish, you can do as you please with--

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,950
D-Don't worry about it!
PvP isn't against the rules!

119
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,200
If Maple doesn't mind, I don't either.
I'm not in the mood to fight.

120
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
But...

121
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,080
Oh! Let's add each other as friends then!
Since we know each other now!

122
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,660
All right. May we meet again.

123
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, good luck with the rest of the event!

124
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,330
Yeah, and you too!

125
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,450
Nine more medals in three days?

126
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,790
Is it doable?

127
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,790
If we target players with medals maybe.

128
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,000
I see...

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,830
Well, just keep that in mind
as one of our options.

130
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,660
Yeah! Plus, I think I'll be fine with it
if we can't collect enough!

131
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,950
"Day 5 - Morning"
"Medal"
"Medals"

132
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,750
"Day 5 - Afternoon"
"Medal"
"Medals"

133
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,410
"Day 5 - Afternoon"
"Medal"
"Medals"

134
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,540
"Day 5 - Evening"
"Medal"
"Medals"

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,370
"Day 5 - Night"
"Medal"
"Medals"

136
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,410
"Day 6 - Morning"
"Medal"
"Medals"

137
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,250
What has she done?

138
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,790
No! Anything but that!

139
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,910
There! Perfect game!

140
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,370
I lost yet again!

141
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,410
Hmm?

142
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh! Welcome back, Sally!

143
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Uh, yeah.

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
Um, who's this?

145
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,870
I'm Kanade. Maple and I just finished
making a sandcastle together.

146
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,540
That was fun, right?

147
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,500
Right?

148
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,160
Isn't this a bad idea?

149
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Hmm? I think it's fine.

150
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,080
Yeah. Because I'm still only level five.

151
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not proud of it, but I'm weak.
Don't care about medals either.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,160
Oh, really?

153
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,620
I'm happy as long as I have this.

154
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
What's that?

155
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,910
Something I got after finishing
a puzzle in an old library.

156
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,870
Took four whole days.

157
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,120
This staff comes with a skill.

158
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,160
Huh? Staff? That cube is...?

159
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
That's rare! What skill?

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,660
It's called Akashic Records. When it's used...

161
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,620
What? What?

162
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,750
It's a secret!

163
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,000
Aw, shucks!

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,950
Of course it is.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,540
Let's play again when the event's over.

166
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,790
Can I add you as a friend, Sally?

167
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,120
Uh, sure!

168
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,040
And as a token of our friendship... Here.

169
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,870
This is?

170
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,410
A book I found that might be
a hint for the event.

171
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,330
"Heart of ancient days.

172
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,950
To gushing well ye shall converge.
In light dim it shan't emerge.

173
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,790
If hero conquers, foe decays.
In tranquil waters ye submerge."

174
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,450
I wonder what it means?

175
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,080
Have you figured it out?

176
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,700
Yeah, right away.

177
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,040
Huh? Tell us!

178
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,540
No way. You've gotta think and figure it out.

179
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
The whole fun of puzzles is solving 'em!

180
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,830
At least Kanade told us these ruins
have something to do with it.

181
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,620
Heart of ancient days. To gushing well
ye shall converge. Hmm...

182
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,580
Gushing well... Gushing well...

183
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,330
What if we filled the fountain
with water? With your skill.

184
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,870
But just using Torrent would
only fill one fountain at best.

185
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,750
Torrent isn't all we've got to make water!

186
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,540
Don't tell me you mean...?

187
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,450
Torrent!

188
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,950
Hydra!

189
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,660
Well, I guess it's a liquid of sorts. Hmm?

190
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,700
Did that work?

191
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,700
It's so bright!

192
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,410
It's like we're in the middle of the ocean!

193
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,700
I can't see a boss yet,
but given the situation...

194
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,250
It's coming!

195
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,330
Yeah!

196
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,660
Maple!

197
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,160
Leave it to me!

198
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,290
Huh?

199
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,790
Something's off!

200
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,000
It didn't take any damage!

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Huh? Why not?!

202
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,700
We might have to hit the main body itself!

203
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,540
I see...

204
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,500
But you know I can't swim or dive!

205
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,580
I couldn't attack even if I wanted to!

206
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,700
Oh, I know!

207
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,250
Hydra!

208
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,290
Hydra!

209
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,500
Hydra!

210
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,580
Let's make the pretty sea into a poison sea!

211
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,410
Oh, did we beat it?

212
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,580
Well, that was easy, so whatever.

213
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,290
We teleported into water?!

214
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,290
O-Oh, no! I'm drowning!

215
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm not? Huh? I can breathe here!

216
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,330
What a neat place!

217
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,160
I wonder if this must be the "tranquil waters"?

218
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,200
Yeah. It's so peaceful and calming here!

219
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,370
Woo-hoo! A medal!

220
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,580
Hey.

221
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,790
Man, Mii from the Flame Emperors
is something else! So charismatic!

222
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,000
Her group's grinding medals like it's their job!

223
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,830
Hey!

224
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,080
But if we're talking solo players,
Payne's where it's at!

225
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,620
He's so used to fighting,
PvP's a piece of cake for him!

226
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,660
Hey, would you guys face reality?
Yet again, Maple just--

227
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,580
Stop! I don't wanna hear!

228
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,790
She beat Sea King this time?
She's out of control, guys!

229
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,370
She's becoming more of a last boss
than the last boss itself!

230
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,120
Just one more day. What are we at?

231
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,660
Two more medals to reach our goal. Seems tough.

232
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,290
Hmm. It's not much time, so we might
end up having to target players.

233
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,500
I guess we don't have a choice.

234
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,160
Maple, listen...

235
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,620
Hmm?

236
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,290
I'll do it alone.

237
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,410
They'll be less cautious with just me
since everyone knows your face.

238
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,040
Um, but...

239
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,080
Meanwhile, I need you to protect our medals.

240
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,450
It would stink if both of us died.

241
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,830
Oh, yeah! Sure! Leave it to me!

242
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,660
I'll leave Oboro to keep watch with you.

243
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,790
Thanks! You be careful!

244
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,700
Well, I'll be back!

245
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,790
Good luck!

246
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,620
It's been so long--I think I'll let loose.

247
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,290
Oh? There's someone.

248
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,700
Let's do this!

249
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,500
You got it, Sis!

250
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,200
Squall Strike!

251
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,120
Double Slash!

252
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,080
Y-You little...!

253
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,790
No way!

254
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,160
Sis!

255
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,950
Shit!

256
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,160
What the--? What are you?!

257
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,370
Goodnight.

258
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,950
Aww, not even a single medal.

259
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Onto the next one!

260
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,540
Come on! Keep it up!

261
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,200
That's it! Bite him good!

262
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,250
I'm done for!

263
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,870
Good work! Good work!

264
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,620
You'll be strong in no time!

265
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,120
I wonder if Sally's doing all right.

266
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,580
Just two from that?

267
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,330
I guess not many people have 'em.

268
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,160
Maybe we just had really good luck?

269
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,750
Now then, let's head back!

270
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,700
Awesome! We hit our goal of 20 medals!

271
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,620
We can spend the rest
of the day just hiding here.

272
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,580
Okay! Oh, yeah!

273
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,370
I raised their levels by fighting
weak enemies in the cave!

274
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,290
Oh, that's sweet!

275
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,500
Thanks!

276
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,370
Kasumi?!

277
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,750
I heard voices coming from in here.

278
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,910
What brings you to this place?

279
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,370
Being the last day and all,
there's widespread PvP.

280
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,580
I thought I'd hide for a while.

281
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,080
In that case, come and hide with us! This way!

282
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,500
O-Okay.

283
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,200
Hydra!

284
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,370
Now no one will step foot in here!

285
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,660
That's true.

286
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,410
Yeah.

287
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,040
Ugh, the hell's this?

288
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,250
No way we're going in. It's a poison cave.

289
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,620
But you know there's gotta be
medals and treasure in there!

290
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,080
We're not high enough for that.
Let's not push our luck.

291
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,330
I wonder what kind of boss is hiding back there?

292
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,000
Woo-hoo! I win again!

293
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Huh, what? How are you so good?

294
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,620
Let's switch! I'll win this time!

295
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,120
Play me if you dare!

296
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,620
Rawr! Rawr! Good work, everyone!
That's the end of the second event!

297
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,790
Players with more than 10 medals
will be given a choice to choose a skill,

298
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,790
Whew! It's over!

299
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,580
so don't anyone log out just yet!

300
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,830
It sure is.

301
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,580
It's finally over.

302
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,540
"Medals Held"
"Medal"
"Medals"

303
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,080
Impressive!

304
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,160
Yup! It's all thanks to grouping with Sally!

305
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,870
But more importantly...

306
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,700
Hmm?

307
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,250
We went all sorts of places!
We met all sorts of people!

308
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,290
We fought big bosses! We even solved a puzzle!

309
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,700
It was a super-duper jam-packed week!

310
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,000
We did so much more than ever before!

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,660
In other words?

312
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,910
I had a blast!

313
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,200
"Event Complete"
"Medal"
"Medals"

314
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,620
It's the new Megamorph skill Syrup learned!

315
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,540
Come on, please work!

316
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,290
Psychokinesis!

317
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,410
Turtle!

318
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,450
What?

319
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,660
Yippie! It worked after all!

320
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,120
Um, so... The skill you earned
from gathering all those medals is...

321
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah! Psychokinesis! I wanted to
fly through the sky with Syrup!

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,750
Oh... Hold on a sec!

323
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,540
Acid Rain!

324
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,160
"The 2nd event (Part 2)"

325
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
"563. Apparently there was a massacre on the 6th night of the event.
Some think it was a roaming monster with short swords and blue
armor. Or maybe it's a player? In any case, tons of people died."

326
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,450
"564. I heard about it from my friend
who was there. He ded."

327
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,450
"565. Short swords and blue armor rings a bell.
You know what comes to mind? Maple's one friend."

328
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,120
"566. Yeah, but people can't just dodge swords
like that. Then again, part of me thinks if
they're friends with Maple, anything's possible."

329
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,500
"567. It'll come kill you in your sleep...
THE NIGHTMARE OF DAY 6!"

330
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,450
"658. One of the medal skills got me thinking.
[Fortress] gives 1.5x VIT so Maple probably
stacked skills like that for insane defense."

331
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:16,830
"569. I bet she picked that one up too.
It's right up her alley. She's beefing up even more."

332
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,620
"570. Get this. I was in an empty desert and what do I see?
Maple and friends riding on the back of a
gigantic turtle... Through the sky...
Raining acid hellfire everywhere..."

333
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,790
"571. Error. Does not compute."

334
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,790
"572. I dunno either. You know what's weird?
Turtle. Flying. Acid Rain. That's wack."

335
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,000
"573. You know how Maple's
got the nickname 'walking fortress?'
I say we change it to 'flying fortress.'"
