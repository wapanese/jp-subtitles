1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
It'll be great! It'll be awesome!
It'll be the best, so try it!

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,330
Wha...? Like, right now?

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,200
Of course! Didn't all your stuff arrive?

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,580
I mean, it's all here, but...
You aren't able to play, right?

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,790
Well, my mom's telling me
I gotta focus on the next test.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,790
So just go ahead and play without me for now!

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,750
I'll pass you up in a jiffy.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,040
Risa! The water's ready, so take a bath!

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,790
Okay!

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,040
She's calling me. Anyways, just give it a go!

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,870
It's the best! You're totally gonna love it!

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,830
"Risa"

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,120
H-Hey, Risa!

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,660
Jeez!

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,870
And here I've basically
never played a game in my life...

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,870
I only bought this because
Risa talked me into it.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,370
I mean, how can I say no
to those sparkling eyes of hers?

18
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh, well. I'll just set things up.

19
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,450
"Defense and First Battle"

20
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,580
"Please enter your name."
First thing is a name, huh? Hmm...

21
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,250
First thing is a name, huh? Hmm...

22
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,120
I could always use my name as is,
but I wonder...?

23
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,000
I've got it! Since my name is Kaede,
I'll go with Maple!

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,250
Yup! That settles it!

25
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,080
Next up is starting equipment?

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,580
Great sword, one-handed sword, mace, staff...

27
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,000
Hmm. I've never been that great
at moving around and stuff.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,540
Besides, I'd like to avoid getting
hit since I don't wanna get hurt.

29
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,200
Should I just pick
the staff and be a wizard?

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,500
Huh?

31
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,500
"Great Shield" "Short Sword"

32
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,000
"Great Shield" "Short Sword"
"Suitable for a tank.
Offensively lacking, but number one in defense.
Taking no damage won't be a pipe dream."

33
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,750
Offensively lacking,
but number one in defense?

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,660
Huh?! If I raise defense enough,
I won't take damage?!

35
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,910
Sweet! I'm going with that!

36
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,660
Now to distribute status points?

37
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,250
Everything I've got goes into defense!

38
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,080
Okay! I think we're good now!

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
"Now being taken to starting area."

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,500
"Now being taken to starting area."
Great!

41
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,330
Jeez, VRMMOs sure are
something else these days!

42
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,290
I'm slow! Why?!

43
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,370
Oh, yeah!

44
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,870
Hmm? Vitality was defense, right?

45
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,080
Strength is power, agility is speed...

46
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,250
Oh! I can't walk fast
because my agility is zero!

47
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,700
Whoops! I goofed up big time!

48
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,120
What now? Should I log out
and redo it since Risa's not here?

49
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,410
"5 minutes later"

50
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,040
Oh, well! Let's fight some monsters
since I finally made a character!

51
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,910
Um, which way to go?

52
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,700
Oh... Um, excuse me?

53
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,450
Huh?

54
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,080
Excuse me! Um!

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,200
Hmm? What is it?

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,540
Um, I wanna fight some monsters,
but I don't really know where I should go.

57
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,410
Oh! You must be a newbie!

58
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,250
There's monsters in the forest to the west.

59
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,410
It's a good spot to raise levels at the start.

60
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,910
You can just stand around
and they'll come right to you.

61
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,290
Thank you so much! I'll check it out!

62
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,000
Good luck!

63
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,290
What's up, Frederica?

64
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,040
Oh, Drag!

65
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,660
I was just telling some newbie girl
a good spot to get levels.

66
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,080
Hmm?

67
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,080
There's sure a lot of people around these days.

68
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,660
Come on, let's get moving too.

69
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,250
Payne's already here.

70
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,370
Right on time, just as expected.

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,830
Everyone else walks so fast!

72
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,830
It's gotta be my agility.

73
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,750
Oh! This must be it!

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay! I wonder if this is a good spot?

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,450
Hey monsters! Come at me if you dare!

76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,000
It's adorable!

77
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,660
Wha...?! I'm sorry!

78
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,000
Ouch!

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,830
Wait, no?

80
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,620
Whoa, cool! That didn't hurt!

81
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,500
That's 128 vitality for you!

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,870
Well, Mr. Bunny? Like these abs?

83
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,660
This doesn't hurt one bit!
Come on, what's the matter? Bring it!

84
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,950
Go on, keep at it! Hit me! I'm right here!

85
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,450
Fight me!

86
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,000
"1 hour later"

87
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,370
Come on! Put your back into it!

88
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,790
Wait a sec, Mr. Bunny.

89
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,660
"Acquired [Total Defense]."

90
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,700
"Total Defense"
"Having this skill gives the user 2x VIT.
[STR], [AGI], [INT] require 3x the points to increase."

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,200
"Total Defense"
"Having this skill gives the user 2x VIT.
[STR], [AGI], [INT] require 3x the points to increase."
Two times the vitality.

92
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,250
In other words, I've got 256 vitality?

93
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,160
And all I did was play with Mr. Bunny!

94
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,040
Okay! Sorry to keep you, Mr. Bunny!

95
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,080
Mr. Bunny?

96
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,000
Mr. Bunny!

97
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,290
"Level has increased to 2."

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,700
Mr. Bunny!

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,410
I wasn't even trying to beat him either!

100
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,500
Oh. I can assign five more status points now.

101
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,370
At this point, why raise anything but defense?

102
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,080
That settles it! More defense!

103
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,290
'Cuz I don't wanna get hurt!

104
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,330
I wonder what kind of monsters are around here?

105
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,660
I don't want to fight anything cute again,
so let's hope the next one isn't.

106
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,000
You're kidding me!

107
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,450
That didn't hurt!

108
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,080
That tickles!

109
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,750
It burns!

110
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,410
I can't defend against poison!

111
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,540
Tactical retreat!

112
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,700
"Acquired [Poison Resist - Weak]."

113
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,000
"Acquired [Poison Resist - Weak]."
Huh?

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,410
I've got it! Getting hit by attacks
builds up resistance!

115
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,950
In that case...!

116
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,580
I think I'm done for!

117
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,040
Ugh!

118
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,910
"[Poison Resist - Weak] advances to
[Poison Resist - Moderate]."

119
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,910
Woo-hoo! I'm getting stronger
against poison just like I thought!

120
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,540
It got me!

121
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,910
Oof!

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,540
You fell for it!

123
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,830
Woo-hoo! That was a tough fight,
but I finally won!

124
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,120
Talk about a fearsome opponent!

125
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,000
But wicked monsters are simply
no match against my wits and bravery!

126
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,330
"Acquired [Giant Killing]."

127
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,200
"Level has increased to 8."

128
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,790
"Acquired [Forest Queen Bee's Ring]."

129
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,700
"Forest Queen Bee's Ring"
"[VIT +6]
Self-Recovery: Restores 10% Max HP in 10 minutes."

130
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,290
"Forest Queen Bee's Ring"
"[VIT +6]
Self-Recovery: Restores 10% Max HP in 10 minutes."
Oh? It's a rare item!

131
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,790
"Forest Queen Bee's Ring"
"[VIT +6]
Self-Recovery: Restores 10% Max HP in 10 minutes."
Gives plus six to vitality...

132
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,330
Oh! It recovers HP while you wear it too!

133
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,450
And um, let's see...

134
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:26,290
I got 15 more status points,
so let's throw that into vitality too.

135
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,500
Giant Killing, huh? Um...

136
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,790
Hmm. I guess it'll be active all the time.

137
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,250
Which means, together with total
defense from earlier... Four times?!

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,750
What a day!

139
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,660
Huh?

140
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,700
What the heck's going on there?

141
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,040
"Acquired [Meditation]."

142
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,790
"When used, restores one percent
of Max HP in 10 seconds.

143
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,290
Effect lasts 10 minutes."

144
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,080
Under requirements it says:
"While being under attack"...

145
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,830
While being... under attack?!

146
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,500
"Level has increased to 11."

147
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,700
"Acquired [Provocation]."

148
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,950
"Provocation"
"Draws enemy attention to a certain area.
Cooldown is 3 minutes."
"Hold aggro from 10 or more monsters at once."

149
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,580
That was a rush. But I did learn a new skill,
so I guess it's worth it.

150
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:06,660
Oh, yeah. Since I got 10 more status points,
I'll put them into vitality again.

151
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,790
I think I did pretty good for my first day!

152
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,000
Yup! I'll call it quits for today!

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,250
"Do you wish to log out?"

154
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,040
That was so much fun!

155
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,410
No way! It's already that late?!

156
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,870
Oh crap! I had homework to do!

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,160
"Saw a sick great shielder"

158
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,450
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"1. So sick"

159
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,870
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"1. So sick"
"2. Wut?"

160
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,500
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"1. So sick"
"2. Wut?"
"3. Sick how?"

161
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,200
"4. They were fast asleep in the west forest
with giant centipedes, caterpillars,
and wolves all around 'em"

162
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,450
"4. They were fast asleep in the west forest
with giant centipedes, caterpillars,
and wolves all around 'em"
"5. ??"

163
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:33,870
"6. That would kill anyone,
great shielders included"

164
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,370
"6. That would kill anyone,
great shielders included"
"7. They have wicked gear or something?"

165
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:34,870
"8. Looked like starting equipment to me.
How can u sleep with poisonous bugs all over you?
Makes me sick just to think about it"

166
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,410
"9. Isn't total damage negation
the only way to live through that?"

167
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,790
"10. Who was it?"

168
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,200
"11. Some cute girl not even 150cm tall.
Prolly low AGI by how slow she walked.
By the way, I tried what she did
and melted instantly"

169
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,620
"12. She max out defense or something?"

170
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,120
"12. She max out defense or something?"
"13. Maybe she unlocked a hidden skill"

171
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,580
"14. We'll have to keep digging for info.
If she's a top player, we'll find out
her name eventually"

172
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,080
"15. Report back if you find out anything"

173
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
"16. Thanks for the info!"

174
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,950
I'm back for more today!

175
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,830
If Risa won't play,
I'll just have fun all on my own!

176
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,910
Everyone looks so stylish.

177
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,910
And here I am still in starting equipment.

178
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,450
Oh! He's a great shielder, too!

179
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,250
Um!

180
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,120
Excuse me! Um...

181
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,450
Hmm? Wha...?!

182
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,370
Um!

183
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,290
Where can I get a cool shield
like the one you've got?

184
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,700
Oh, this?

185
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,120
Yeah! Your great shield is so cool!

186
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,830
Well, thanks.

187
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,750
This one was made to order.

188
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,370
I had a crafter make it for me
in exchange for money.

189
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,700
Oh, I see.

190
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,080
Shall I introduce you to one?

191
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,040
Please do!

192
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,250
So she's a newbie after all.

193
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,080
Never thought she'd straight up talk to me.

194
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,200
"Iz' Workshop
Welcome"

195
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,700
Oh? Welcome, Kuromu!

196
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,950
Who's this?

197
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,410
Um, hello!

198
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,910
I couldn't help but kidnap her
when I saw she's a great shielder newbie.

199
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,410
She's very cute.

200
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,080
Kuromu, you say you kidnapped the girl?

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,830
Huh?

202
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,950
Perhaps I'll report you then.

203
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,290
H-Hold your horses!
That was just a figure of speech!

204
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,000
I know that. I'm only joking with you.

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,540
It's bad for my heart, so please don't.

206
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,080
And you should know better than
to follow suspicious people!

207
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,700
Um, all right.

208
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm not suspicious, you know!

209
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,910
So? What brings you here?

210
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,120
This girl was saying how she
wants a cool great shield,

211
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,200
so I thought I'd introduce her to you at least.

212
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,790
I see. My name is Iz.

213
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,580
As you can see, I'm a crafter.
But I mostly specialize in smithing.

214
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,870
I do synthesis and such, too.

215
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,830
Oh! Um, I'm Maple!

216
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,500
Maple, huh? Why is it you picked a great shield?

217
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,580
Um, I don't want to get hurt,
so I thought I should raise my defense.

218
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,700
I see, I see. Well, vitality gear
sounds right up your alley.

219
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,040
It would take 1,000,000 gold
at the least though.

220
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,620
What do you have on you?

221
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,450
U-Uh, only about 3,000.

222
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,660
That won't quite be enough.

223
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,500
But it'll add up before you know it.

224
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,660
So much for looking cool, I guess.

225
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,660
The "Poison Dragon's Labyrinth" is to the East.

226
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,500
There's all sorts of treasure you can get there.

227
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
The monsters are a bit strong though.

228
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,410
Check it out sometime.

229
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,160
If you're lucky, you might be able
to loot some good equipment.

230
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,830
All right! Thank you very much!

231
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,370
Let me add you as a friend
since we know each other now.

232
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,870
That way we can talk anytime.

233
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,870
Thank you so much! Can I get you too, Kuromu?

234
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,330
Sure. I'll split some of
my potions with you, too.

235
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,330
A gift for a fellow great shielder.

236
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,330
"Kuromu" "Remove"
"Iz"          "Remove"

237
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,750
You don't think she'll head to
that dungeon all on her own, do you?

238
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,830
No way, that's absurd.

239
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,580
Finally, it's dungeon time!
It's starting to feel like a real adventure!

240
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,830
I wonder if there's a poison dragon
in the "Poison Dragon's Labyrinth"?

241
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm sure I'll be just fine!
I've got poison resist and potions!

242
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,290
Is this the entrance?

243
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,950
Here come slimes!

244
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,620
You're asking for it! Eat this!

245
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,160
I managed that somehow!

246
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,870
"Acquired [Shield Attack]."

247
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,540
I would've preferred
an actual attack skill, but...

248
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,790
Seems like the boss should show up soon.

249
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
Is this the poison dragon?!

250
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,910
My shield and sword!

251
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,870
I can't defend that?!

252
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,540
In that case...!

253
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,000
I've gotta time it!

254
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,040
Again!

255
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,250
If I can just keep this up...!

256
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,500
"[Poison Resist - Moderate]
advances to [Poison Resist - Strong]."

257
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,540
It's still not good enough!

258
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,910
Will this work or will I
run out of potions first?!

259
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,910
This is my last potion.

260
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,330
"[Poison Resist - Strong]
advances to [Poison Immunity]."

261
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,370
I did it!

262
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,870
Your attacks are useless on me, poison dragon!

263
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,620
Oh, but I can't exactly attack you either.
What now?

264
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,290
I told you, it's useless on me!

265
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,660
Hey, take this!

266
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,450
Shoot, it doesn't do anything!

267
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,910
It worked!

268
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,790
This is not tasty at all.

269
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,330
Oh, thanks for using your breath!

270
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,540
It gave it some spice and
toned down the pepper flavor!

271
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,660
Woo-hoo! I'm victorious!

272
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,370
"Acquired [Hydra Eater].
[Poison Immunity] advances to [Hydra]."

273
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,910
"Level has increased to 18."

274
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,160
I got 20 status points!
Let's put all those into defense too!

275
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,160
This hydra eater skill lets me use
all of the poison dragon's magic?

276
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,000
In other words, I finally have
my first real attack skill!

277
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,660
And poison is perfect for me!

278
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,370
If I poison my opponent,
I just have to outlast them!

279
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,790
Oh, right! What'd I get?!

280
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,500
"Acquired [Replica of the Dark Night].
Acquired [Armor of the Black Rose].
Acquired [Crescent Moon]."

281
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,410
If it's broken, it gets stronger and
goes back to normal! And it's one of a kind!

282
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,910
Which means I'm the only person to have this!

283
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,750
This is awesome! So cool!

284
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,410
Nice! I'm gonna keep playing
and specialize in defense!

285
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,790
'Cuz I don't wanna get hurt!

286
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,200
"Do you wish to log out?"

287
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,370
Right?! Isn't it awesome?!

288
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah! But I'm not that good
since it's only my second day!

289
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,580
Hey, hurry up and play with me, Risa!

290
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,660
It won't be long now!
Once proficiency tests are over, I can log in!

291
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,290
Oh, but make sure you study
for the tests too, Kaede!

292
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,370
So that you're not the one
banned from games next!

293
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,040
Ah, good point!

294
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,700
I know, right?

295
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,700
Man, seems like she's having fun.

296
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,000
"Risa Shiramine"

297
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,160
"Saw a sick great shielder"

298
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,580
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"241. I ran into her today.
In fact, I added her as a friend"

299
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:12,870
"Saw a sick great shielder"
"241. I ran into her today.
In fact, I added her as a friend"
"242. Huh?"

300
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,500
"241. I ran into her today.
In fact, I added her as a friend"
"242. Huh?"
"243. How?"

301
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,200
"244. I logged in and was wandering around when
she just ran over and talked to me lol"

302
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,450
"245. Shield girl has max social skills"

303
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:14,870
"246. And?"

304
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,250
"247. She said I had a cool shield so I said I'd
take her to a crafter and she followed me"

305
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,870
"248. Did you form a party?"

306
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,410
"249. Max defense? Any hidden skills?"

307
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:16,790
"250. Here's what I know atm
Said she picked great shield and is raising defense
Basically, she's a super nice girl We oughta watch over her
My name's Kuromu by the way"

308
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,200
"251. You're Kuromu?!
We've got a top player, boyz!"

309
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,620
"252. There's a famous one among us!"

310
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,120
"253. I'll chime in if I see her around"

311
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,660
"254. Can everyone help keep an eye on her?"

312
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:18,870
"254. Can everyone help keep an eye on her?"
"255. Aye aye!"

313
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,000
"254. Can everyone help keep an eye on her?"
"255. Aye aye!"
"256. Aye aye!"

314
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,160
"256. Aye aye!"
"257. Aye aye!"

315
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,000
"256. Aye aye!"
"257. Aye aye!"
"258. Aye aye!"
