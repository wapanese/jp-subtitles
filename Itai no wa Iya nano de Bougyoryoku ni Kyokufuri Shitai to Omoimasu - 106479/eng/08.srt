1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,500
It's finally time for the third event?!
I hope this cowvent is fun!

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,750
What's that again? "Cowvent"?

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,580
It's an event to defeat cows and collect
their bells, right? So, cowvent!

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,040
I hear the more bells we get,
the better the reward.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,830
Seems pretty normal as far as events go.

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,370
Listen up! Attention, please!

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,830
Thanks to all the wool everyone
gathered, I'm finally done!

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,330
Ta-da!

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,910
It's adorable!

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,250
Yeah! Not to mention warm!

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,160
There's a bonus on event drops
depending on how much wool you use!

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,080
--B-But...
--Hmm?

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,000
This is simply too cute!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,040
C-Couldn't you have picked out
a different design or something?

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,370
I'm afraid not!

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,580
'Cuz I wanted to see you guys
dressed in fluffy gear!

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,750
You're looking good, Kanade!

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,910
This is nice! Thanks, Iz! I really like it!

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,040
We're gonna use the hammers Iz gave us...

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,330
...and lay waste to the cows!

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,000
--Yay!

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,540
--Everyone sure is cute....
--Yay!

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,450
--Turtle... Turtle! Turtle!

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,000
--Hmm?
--Turtle... Turtle! Turtle!

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,160
Tur... tle?

26
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,910
Hydra!

27
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,250
"Cow"
That's one for me!

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,870
"Defense and Third Event"
It sure is a pain searching
for cows with low agility!

29
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:07,950
"Cow"

30
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,370
Whew! I'm off to a pretty good start.

31
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,790
Hmm? From Sally? Let's see...

32
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,500
"To be honest, I'm a little
concerned about Maple."

33
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,580
"Yeah. Maple's not exactly suited
for this kind of event."

34
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,580
--"I'm worried she'll do something weird
if she's all on her own."
--Wait up, cow! It's too fast!
--Come back, cow!

35
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,790
In that case, let's all send Maple
some advice for the event!

36
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,950
--Agreed!
--Agreed!

37
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,500
That was fast!

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,200
Ugh! There's so much competition! Hmm?

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,950
It's hard to collect 'em,
but stay focused and do your best!

40
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,910
It's tough with all the people in the fields.

41
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,910
Just relax and have fun.

42
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,080
There's too big a crowd to get much done.

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,370
Still, keep at it till the cows come home!

44
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,500
Mm-hmm, I see!

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,450
In that case...!

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,290
Thanks for the advice, everyone!
I'll do my best!

47
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,450
All right! Let's head for that mountain!

48
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
"Cow"

49
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,040
"Cow"
Woo-hoo! My plan worked!

50
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,290
I can rack 'em up if no one else is around!

51
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,700
"Cow"
I can rack 'em up if no one else is around!

52
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,290
--Turtle... Turtle... Turtle... Turtle...

53
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,080
--Huh? Syrup? Wait up!
--Turtle... Turtle... Turtle... Turtle...

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,080
M-My head's spinning!

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,330
Turtle?

56
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,370
I'm okay, but thanks for your concern!

57
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,540
H-Huh?! Since when did all
my devours get used up?!

58
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,370
Did I do that? I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! I'm so...

59
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,410
Huh?

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,910
I wonder how this ended up here?

61
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,910
Hmm? Isn't that...?

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,330
I knew it! It's the church from before!

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,950
I was so caught up in the quest,
I never explored this place.

64
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,040
Is there anything here?

65
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,700
Huh? Wh-What?!

66
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,500
Hmm?

67
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,370
So my meal has come?

68
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,330
Huh? Meal?

69
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,290
Once I defeat you, I will consume your body...

70
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,330
...and feast upon your power!

71
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,450
Well, I'll eat you, too!

72
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,620
That doesn't do a thing! Huh?

73
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,040
Wh-What's this?!

74
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,500
Whoa! There's more!

75
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Fine! In that case...!

76
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,040
Wooly!

77
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,620
You're not so scary if I'm in here!

78
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,410
Um, these chains apply... [Hex]?

79
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,950
Never heard of that status effect. Anyways...!

80
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,370
You're up, Syrup! [Awaken]! And [Megamorph]!

81
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,910
Turtle!

82
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,330
Topped with [Psychokinesis]!

83
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,620
Oh, yeah! Syrup, let's try the new skill
of yours! [Mother Nature]!

84
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,700
Turtle!

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,580
Whoa, awesome!
Next up, gimme a [Spirit Cannon]!

86
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,790
Tur...

87
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,750
...tle!

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,120
--...tle!
--That's it, Syrup! Give 'em hell!

89
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,450
C-Curse you!

90
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,370
Unforgivable!

91
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,950
--...tle!
--What?

92
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,830
Geh! Th-That's disgusting!

93
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,620
Eep! I'm on fire now?!

94
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,700
"Cow"

95
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,200
I wonder how Maple's doing?

96
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Well, I'm sure she's not anywhere too crazy.

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,290
It's cramped! And dark!

98
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,580
Am I in its belly?
Whoa! My armor's melting!

99
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,160
I'm not taking damage though,
so I guess I'll just beat it and escape!

100
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,120
It's so sour! So tangy! And so...!

101
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,750
So bitter!

102
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,790
And that's that! Burp!

103
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,250
Turtle!

104
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,450
I'm back! Huh?

105
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,910
"Seeping Chaos"
"Acquired skill [Predator],
[Seeping Chaos], [Atrocity]."
Woo-hoo! I got new skills!

106
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,700
It's called [Seeping Chaos], huh?

107
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,080
That sounds pretty cool!
I'll throw that on my armor set!

108
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,290
The others will be so surprised!

109
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,750
Nice work! Let's do this!

110
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,870
Yeah!

111
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,870
Heal!

112
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,200
Thanks so much, Misery!

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,790
Of course. Good work.

114
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,620
"Cow"

115
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,620
You and your traps are impressive
as always, Markus.

116
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,830
I don't know about that.

117
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,250
All I did was set a few traps.
She, on the other hand...

118
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,160
[Flame]!

119
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,750
"Cow"

120
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,950
The mission was a success!

121
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,700
It's all thanks to your hard work and bravery!

122
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,500
--You've put your faith in me, followed me,
and for that, I thank you!

123
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,910
--She really has a presence when she speaks.
--You've put your faith in me, followed me,
and for that, I thank you!

124
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,870
--No wonder people follow her.
--I'm glad to call you my comrades
and proud to fight beside you!

125
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,250
--Indeed. I suppose that's what
you'd call her charisma.
--I'm glad to call you my comrades
and proud to fight beside you!

126
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,540
--Long live Mii!
--We'll follow you anywhere!
--Leader!

127
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
So it ended without a hitch?

128
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,910
Yeah. Being the third time and all,
we've hit our stride.

129
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,790
We're opening up Level 3 now, right?

130
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,620
So much work! I wanna lie in my bath...

131
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,120
What about "her"?

132
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,660
"Her," huh?

133
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,950
We've gotta keep a close watch on Maple.

134
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,580
She's got her wacky blimp, her [Wooly],

135
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,200
she ate Hydra, became an angel...
and now a demon?!

136
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,160
What do you guys think?

137
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,250
She can't possibly defy logic again, can she?

138
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,910
Yeah. There's just no way.

139
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,080
If it was that easy to get powerful,
we'd be in a real pickle!

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,660
I'm sure it'll be fine!

141
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,290
--Maybe...
--Maybe...

142
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,040
Good work, everyone!

143
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,370
"Holy Sword" and "Flame Emperors."
It's no surprise they're at the top.

144
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,080
And I heard both of 'em went to Level 3 already.

145
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,580
It just opened, too. Talk about fast.

146
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,290
Sorry, guys. I didn't contribute
very much this time.

147
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,870
But still, you got a reward, right?

148
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,830
Oh, yeah! I got the [Counter] skill!

149
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,620
You helped out plenty!

150
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,290
This event was geared towards
people with high agility!

151
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,160
"Cow"
Besides, there's no need to fret.

152
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,290
We all gathered enough to earn
a fantastic guild reward.

153
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,500
We all did...

154
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,950
...the best we could!

155
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,870
That gives everyone in the guild
three percent more strength, right?

156
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,660
It'll stack up before you know it.

157
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,410
It doesn't really matter to Maple, though.

158
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,410
Zero times anything is still zero.

159
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
That's what you think!

160
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,830
Did you do something crazy again?

161
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,120
Come on! Onward to Level 3!

162
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,250
We've gotta beat this guy to reach Level 3?

163
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,040
It doesn't look like some pushover either.

165
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,290
Um, it's all you.

166
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,910
Leave it to me!

167
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,950
Shall we get started?

168
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,290
[Predator]!

169
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,580
Wha...?

170
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,250
[Seeping Chaos]!

171
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,250
I see. So that's how it is...

172
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,500
She has more appendages every time I see her.

173
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,120
Let's not fool ourselves.
She's basically a monster.

174
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,410
That's fine... As long as she's a friend.

175
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,660
Watching Maple never gets old!

176
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,830
You're amazing, Maple!

177
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,040
And now for the finisher! [Atrocity]!

178
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,540
This is harder to control than I thought!

179
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,080
Um, is that you in there, Maple?

180
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,500
Yup! Hold on a sec!

181
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,250
What... was that?

182
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,660
Um, it's called [Atrocity]!

183
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,250
"Atrocity"
"Maximum HP set to 1,000."
"[STR], [AGI] increased by 50."
Um, it's called [Atrocity]!

184
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,040
"When HP reaches 0, skill is canceled
and user returns to original state."
It gives 50 strength and agility,
and though equipment effects don't work,

185
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,910
"Can only be used once per in-game day.
While in use, equipment effects are ignored."
you get 1,000 HP, and
even if it runs out, you go back to normal!

186
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,370
Is she done being human then?

187
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,580
Yeah, she's given up. Entirely.

188
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,950
At this point, there's no use
trying to make sense of Maple.

189
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,410
Mm-hmm.

190
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,250
Now I can protect everyone
even better than before!

191
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,620
So this is Level 3!

192
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,330
It feels completely different
than Levels 1 and 2!

193
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,620
How cool! It's a machine world!

194
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,410
Let's go separate ways and check out
what kind of zones are around.

195
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,500
All split up?

196
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,250
We don't know much since we just got here.
Lets us cover more area.

197
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,000
All right. We'll meet up in two hours.

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,950
Roger!

199
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,870
Whoa! There's so much stuff!

200
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Huh?!

201
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,870
A-Are you okay?!

202
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,160
Water...

203
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,870
Could you please spare some?
And food, possibly?

204
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,330
Sure! Here!

205
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,040
Thank you.

206
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,370
As a token of thanks, I'll tell you a story.

207
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,870
Huh? O-Okay!

208
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,040
Think it's a quest or something?

209
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,620
Turtle!

210
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,620
In the center of this city
towers a grand building.

211
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,500
That is where the Machine God lives.

212
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,200
He's the one who created our
flying machines and such.

213
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,620
But not a single person understands
how any of his machines work.

214
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,160
People have torn them apart to learn,
but there's nothing at all inside.

215
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,540
Not even a single screw, gear,
or spring to speak of.

216
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,580
Th-That sounds kinda scary in a way!

217
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,200
The real story starts now.

218
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,620
You see, the Second Generation
is the one there now.

219
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,000
The Second Generation?

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,580
Yeah. This city was once brimming
with normal machines.

221
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,660
To us, who knew nothing of machines,
the First bestowed us hopes and dreams.

222
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,080
But one day, something happened
while I was out of town.

223
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,160
When I saw a pale light erupting
from the city, I hurried back at once.

224
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,250
But the city was filled with all-new machines,

225
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,080
and everyone had completely
forgotten the First.

226
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,040
What's more, the old machines
were nowhere to be found.

227
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,540
That's the end of my story.

228
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,200
Nobody remembers the First anymore.

229
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Hmm. Do you think it means
the Second hates the First then?

230
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,790
That's the end of my story.

231
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,000
Nobody remembers the First anymore.

232
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,370
I guess that's all he'll say for the quest.

233
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,700
Thanks for telling me that wonderful story!

234
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,540
Think it's a rare quest or something?

235
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,200
I should run it by Sally and the others... Huh?!

236
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,250
Watch where you're flying
that turtle! Turtle...?!

237
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,790
I'm sorry!

238
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,950
Let's go to a less-crowded area, Syrup!

239
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,410
Turtle!

240
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,870
Look at all this fog! Um...

241
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,540
Huh? Where are we?!

242
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,700
What?!

243
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,250
[Atrocity]!

244
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,870
Thought I was dead there!

245
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,200
Where is this anyways?

246
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,410
"Graveyard of Dreams"

247
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,620
"Graveyard of Dreams"
Graveyard of Dreams?

248
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,870
Syrup! Thank goodness!

249
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,450
Whoa!

250
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,580
I am... king of machines.

251
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,870
Of great wisdom... and faraway dreams.

252
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,330
Huh? I think I started something!

253
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,620
I am... king. A once upon... king.

254
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,120
He who was weeded out.

255
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,250
Wh-What happened?

256
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,200
--I am the... king of junk.

257
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,330
--Whoa!
--I am the... king of junk.

258
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,500
He who sleeps among scrap.

259
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,040
Making dreams and miracles... into rubbish.

260
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,950
I'll make you... rubbish, too.

261
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,660
Are you broken?
Let's knock some sense into you!

262
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,290
Syrup! [Mother Nature]!

263
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,450
Turtle!

264
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,450
This glowing part's the problem!

265
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,500
[Seeping Chaos]!

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
In this moment my thoughts are mine...

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,200
...I bestow you this, brave soul...

268
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,450
Using my power, defeat he...
who I... once was.

269
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,330
Huh?

270
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,500
Put me... to... sleep.

271
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,750
B-Bestow me what?! Hold up!

272
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,080
It is futile.

273
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,500
Wh-What?!

274
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,830
Huh?!

275
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,950
Shoot!

276
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,410
What the heck's that?!

277
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,410
Huh?

278
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,250
[Machine God]?

279
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,410
All right!

280
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,040
[Machine God]!

281
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,790
[Deploy Armaments]!

282
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,040
[Commence Attack]!

283
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,330
Take this!

284
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,040
Whew!

285
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,000
Huh?

286
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,700
Wha...?!

287
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,660
What the heck is this?!

288
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:41,750
"[NWO] Third Level Released!!"

289
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,250
"[NWO] Third Level Released!!"
"129. Cleared much of Level 3 yet?"

290
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,830
"[NWO] Third Level Released!!"
"129. Cleared much of Level 3 yet?"
"130. Not even close.
Did find a good dungeon for loot though."

291
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,370
"131. The west cliffs, right?
The place is legit."

292
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,620
"131. The west cliffs, right?
The place is legit."
"132. These damn flying machines
are too rich for my blood."

293
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:43,910
"133. True dat"

294
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,160
"133. True dat"
"134. Every guild needs one asap. You can
cover so much ground, it's not even funny."

295
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,660
"133. True dat"
"134. Every guild needs one asap. You can
cover so much ground, it's not even funny."
"135. True dat"

296
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,040
"136. Anyone else get wrecked flying today?"

297
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,330
"136. Anyone else get wrecked flying today?"
"137. Wrecked?"

298
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:45,910
"136. Anyone else get wrecked flying today?"
"137. Wrecked?"
"138. ????"

299
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,580
"139. Was flying around and got pwned by
a big fat beam out of nowhere. RIP me"

300
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,950
"139. Was flying around and got pwned by
a big fat beam out of nowhere. RIP me"
"140. Seriously? Hit a trap, maybe?"

301
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,330
"141. Something the devs put in
to block off-limits areas?"

302
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:47,750
"141. Something the devs put in
to block off-limits areas?"
"142. Dunno. No clue."

303
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,200
"143. Just gonna put this out there...
Anyone else thinking what I'm thinking?"

304
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,910
"143. Just gonna put this out there...
Anyone else thinking what I'm thinking?"
"144. On it. I'll see what I can find out."
