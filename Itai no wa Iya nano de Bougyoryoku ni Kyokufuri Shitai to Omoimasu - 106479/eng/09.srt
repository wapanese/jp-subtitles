1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,040
She's got something to show us,
but it can't be what I'm thinking, right?

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,370
At this point, nothing will surprise me.

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,500
Same here.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,620
Can't wait!

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,160
So excited!

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,040
I don't wanna draw too much attention,
so I'll hold back a bit!

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,120
[Deploy]! Left Arm!

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,540
Here we go!

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,870
Whoa! That's cool!

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,500
That was wonderful, Maple!

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,750
Okay then. That just happened.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,120
It's yet another new appendage.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,040
This time she's a mecha?

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,620
I guess it's okay...
As long as she's a friend...

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,200
How was that?

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,450
Nice! You're our secret weapon!

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,660
Aw, shucks! Ouch!

18
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,250
"Defense and Fourth Event"

19
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,080
You're really getting into it.

20
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah. The guild competition isn't far off now.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,370
Not that we need to level up
any more than we have. Huh?

22
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,000
Where's Frederica?

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,410
She's out scouting Maple Tree.

24
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,620
And not Flame Emperors?

25
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,330
Like I said before,
her guild has too many unknowns.

26
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,160
I think you're worrying a lot over nothing.

27
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,040
Take this!

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
Splash!

29
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, you asked for it!

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,950
Don't forget us! Splash!

31
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,120
Sorry!

32
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,040
It's all right!

33
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,910
These swimsuits Iz made
for us are so wonderful!

34
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,370
Not to mention they give
a little bonus to swimming.

35
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,910
I wonder what kind of event
the guild competition will be?

36
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,370
The event's still not for a while.

37
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,410
It's a good chance to refresh our skills.

38
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,620
It's a good chance to do
some leveling up, too, yeah?

39
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,250
My preparations are complete
and I'm all set to go.

40
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,330
Oh, my!

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't mind if I do!

42
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,040
I wonder if this will be enough?

43
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,290
Hmm?

44
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,500
I like it! And they all even
come with [Unbreakable], too!

45
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,080
"Reverse Alchemy"
"Magic Workshop"
"Cutting Edge"

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,830
"Reverse Alchemy"
"Magic Workshop"
"Cutting Edge"

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,830
Wow! This lets me make items anywhere!

48
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,660
"Reverse Alchemy"
"Magic Workshop"
"Cutting Edge"

49
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,660
Perfect for me!

50
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,330
Whew! That was so much fun!

51
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,160
Is something wrong?

52
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,540
Now then...

53
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,410
Hey! You over there!
How about you come out already?!

54
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,750
You noticed?

55
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,160
With you staring at us for so long,
it's no surprise.

56
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,700
H-Huh?! Staring at us?!

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,750
Sheesh, it's not like that!

58
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,500
W-Wait a sec. Aren't you Frederica?

59
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,540
Howdy. Been a while.

60
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,160
Why'd you come here?
Oh! To play with us?!

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,330
Not a bad idea!

62
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,790
To scout us, right?

63
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,370
You're gathering information
to prep for the guild competition.

64
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,370
Well, I have a proposition for you.

65
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,000
What's that?

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,700
Would you like to have a little duel?

67
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,500
And what would be the point of me doing that?

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,200
How about the loser has to
give up guild information?

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,290
I need info about Flame Emperors
and your Order of the Holy Sword.

70
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,700
I can't just let you walk away
after spotting you.

71
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,330
Seems like a better option
than fighting four of us.

72
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,200
All right. You're on.

73
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,660
But if I lose, I'm only telling you
about Flame Emperors. Got it?

74
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,910
Okay.

75
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,750
"Request a duel?"

76
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,790
There. It's done.

77
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,580
I'll see you soon.

78
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,700
Whoa! Wh-Where'd they go?!

79
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,580
It's a duel, Maple.

80
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,660
I think there's some sort of system for that.

81
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,830
She'll probably come back once they're done.

82
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,660
All right then! Let's fish
or something while we wait!

83
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,160
Okay!

84
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,700
[Firebolt]!

85
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,910
Hmm. She won't be easy to hit,
but it's not as if I can't.

86
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,910
I'll finish her off once I learn
a little more! [Firebolt]!

87
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,330
Lucky break! [Firebolt]!

88
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,250
[Super Speed]!

89
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,040
She's coming at me?!

90
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,870
[Multi-Barrier]!

91
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,040
[Multi-Firebolt]!

92
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,660
[Coax Attack]!

93
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Huh?!

94
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,540
She made me use it.

95
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,540
[Coax Attack]? Never heard of it.

96
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,250
In that case... [Multi-Waterbolt]!

97
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,580
[Coax Attack] must have a cooldown.

98
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,200
Evading all attacks is
an insanely powerful skill.

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,660
No way she can use it back to back!

100
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,620
[Multi-Stonebolt]!

101
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,290
Have I got her?

102
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,790
[Cascade]!

103
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,040
I see how it is.

104
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,540
I can't believe she made me
resort to [Cascade].

105
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,580
All right! I surrender!

106
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,950
Huh?

107
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,080
Um, okay.

108
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,160
Just like I promised, I'll talk
a bit about Flame Emperors.

109
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,750
Markus the Trapper, Misery the Cleric,
and Shin the Split-Sword?

110
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,080
Mm-hmm!

111
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,500
Flame Emperors has plenty of other
good players besides Mii, you know.

112
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,040
And seeing how I kept my promise, bye now!

113
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,160
Ugh. I never should've let her
force out [Multi-Barrier].

114
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,290
Still, if we fought any longer,
I'd have revealed too much about myself.

115
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,700
Besides, I got to see her secret skills.

116
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,660
And I told her about Flame Emperors, too.

117
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,790
Let's hope they go at it
and crush each other!

118
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,160
He who controls information
controls the battle!

119
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,870
Huh? Fake skills?

120
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,910
Yup. [Coax Attack] lets you manipulate
enemy attacks to your will.

121
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,200
And [Cascade] lets you repel
every attack for a while.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,700
That's easy enough to say, but pulling it off
with your own skill is absurd.

123
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,370
Why would you do that anyway?

124
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,120
Having false info hurts 'em
more than having none.

125
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Isn't Frederica one of the top-rankers?

126
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,290
Yet you pulled off a bluff while fighting her.

127
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,660
Well, it's easy to pretend you're
the underdog when you're way better.

128
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, it's about time.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Rawr! Thanks for your patience!

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,160
It's time to explain the rules for
the guild competition, so listen up!

131
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,370
As I mentioned before,
in-game time will be sped up.

132
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,290
There's no joining or breaks
while the event is ongoing!

133
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,660
This time, the event will last five days!

134
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,040
It's a little shorter now.

135
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,790
Guilds will be classified
as large, medium, or small.

136
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,870
"Large"  "Medium"  "Small"

137
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,870
Guilds will be classified
as large, medium, or small.

138
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,700
"Large"  "Medium"  "Small"

139
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,700
Each group earns points
a little differently.

140
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,080
Each group earns points
a little differently.

141
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,700
It looks like we're classified as a small guild.

142
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,080
Each guild will be given a base and
must protect an orb placed within.

143
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,870
"Point"

144
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,870
Each guild will be given a base and
must protect an orb placed within.

145
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,250
"Point"

146
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,250
If you bring an enemy orb back to your
own base, you can earn more points.

147
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,370
If you bring an enemy orb back to your
own base, you can earn more points.

148
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,950
"Point"

149
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,950
If you bring an enemy orb back to your
own base, you can earn more points.

150
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,200
For every six hours you hold
your own orb, you get a single point.

151
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,290
"1 Point"

152
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,290
For every six hours you hold
your own orb, you get a single point.

153
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,580
But small guilds will get two.

154
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,750
"2 Points"

155
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,750
But small guilds will get two.

156
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,450
Taking an enemy orb and defending it
for two hours earns you two points.

157
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,200
"2 Points"

158
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,200
Taking an enemy orb and defending it
for two hours earns you two points.

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,790
"2 Points"

160
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,790
The guild you took it from
will lose one point.

161
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,290
The guild you took it from
will lose one point.

162
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,500
"-1 Point"

163
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,500
The guild you took it from
will lose one point.

164
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,290
Essentially, it's a battle for orbs.

165
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,200
Um, so that's one point to hold
your own orb for six hours.

166
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,660
Uh, but two points for small guilds.

167
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,660
And if you keep a stolen orb
for three hours, it's two points.

168
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,000
The other guild loses one point.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,660
Basically, whoever defends well
and can snag orbs the best wins!

170
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,830
An orb that's stolen returns back
to base once any points are earned!

171
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,750
"Point"

172
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,750
An orb that's stolen returns back
to base once any points are earned!

173
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,750
An orb that's stolen returns back
to base once any points are earned!

174
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,950
But if it's taken back within the three hours,

175
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,370
there's no gain or loss of points!

176
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,200
Oh? If your orb's stolen,
it will come back automatically.

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,580
Looks like you can see where
your orb's at with the map.

178
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,450
Guess it means if you steal an orb,
you've gotta watch out.

179
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,330
It's all about defense.

180
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,950
"[Death Penalty]
1st time: Stats decrease 5%
2nd time: Stats decrease 10%"

181
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,950
By the way, there's a death penalty.

182
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,950
"3rd time: Stats decrease 15%
4th time: Stats decrease 20%
5th time: Eliminated"

183
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,950
I see. Five deaths and you're out?

184
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,660
"Orb will no longer spawn for guilds
with no remaining members."

185
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,660
\It gets harder the more people you lose.

186
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
"You cannot steal the same guild's orb
more than once per day."

187
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Especially for small guilds like ours.

188
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,620
That's it for the rules!

189
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,120
Whew! I'm tired from talking so much!

190
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,620
If you don't understand,
just pull up the menu again!

191
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,000
Best of luck, everyone! Rawr!

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,290
We probably need to keep
more people on defense,

193
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,910
but it's gonna be tough for us.

194
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,660
What's the problem?

195
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,790
We lack enough people for offense.
Same goes for defense.

196
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,660
The problem for small guilds
is that we get no rest.

197
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,330
Enemies can attack at any point,
including at night.

198
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,620
Oh, right. 'Cuz it's an all-out war this time.

199
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,200
As it goes on, they'll learn our secrets.

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,910
We're in trouble if they ever find
out your skill's usage limits.

201
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,000
Gah! Good point!

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,700
It's a matter of how long
we can preserve Maple for.

203
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,750
On defense, let's have Maple, Yui, and Mai.

204
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,830
Okay!

205
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,500
You too, Kanade.

206
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,160
Whatever you want.

207
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,250
Our attackers will be me,
Kasumi, and Kuromu.

208
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,330
And we'll have Iz as backup at the base?

209
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,370
Yeah! Let's do that!

210
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,950
We've got time before the event,
so let's go level up!

211
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,620
Yeah!

212
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,950
"[NWO] The 4th event begins! (Part 2)"

213
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,660
"[NWO] The 4th event begins! (Part 2)"

214
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,660
"489. The bigger issue is
dealing with Mii, their guild master."

215
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,040
"490. Can't do squat when she's with
the damn MP battery known as Misery.
Gotta split 'em up somehow."

216
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
"491. Holy Sword is too high level to
deal with. Just avoid 'em at all costs."

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,830
"491. Holy Sword is too high level to
deal with. Just avoid 'em at all costs."
"492. What about Maple?
How do you beat that?"

218
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,830
"493. You don't. But luckily,
she can't catch you."

219
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,660
"493. You don't. But luckily,
she can't catch you."
"494. And if she attacks?"

220
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,620
"495. It'll be a slaughter like
the last boss in a starting zone."

221
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,620
"495. It'll be a slaughter like
the last boss in a starting zone."
"496. Gotcha."

222
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,830
All right! Let's do our best!

223
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's aim for the top! Top ten!

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,620
Let's do it!

225
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,950
Now then! It's time for
the guild competition to begin!

226
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,160
So this place is our base?

227
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,370
We'll head out and go attack.

228
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,830
Right. Let's follow the plan.

229
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,660
Take care now!

230
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,450
What the hell?

231
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,910
You little...!

232
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,120
Eep!

233
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,330
Eek! No!

234
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,910
It's a disaster!

235
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,290
What's wrong?!

236
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,580
It's...! It's...!

237
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,410
Thanks for showing us the way.

238
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,750
Guys! Get 'em!

239
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,700
Come on, bring it!

240
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,250
She's as agile as ever.

241
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,120
If only I could do that, too!

242
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,080
All of our girls are scary as hell!

243
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,750
What... the hell... is happening?!

244
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,870
What the--?!

245
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,000
That's one down for us.

246
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,160
Kasumi, could you carry this back to base?

247
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,540
Roger that.

248
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm gonna go scout out the area!

249
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,910
Be careful.

250
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,250
Yup!

251
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,450
Maple's obviously a given,
but Sally's quite a monster herself.

252
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,790
Yeah.

253
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,660
I'm grateful we're comrades with all my heart.

254
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,910
Yo!

255
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,330
Huh? Invaders!

256
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,330
It's okay! They're alone!

257
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,580
[Mirage]! [Leap]!

258
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,540
Up above!

259
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,200
[Super Speed]!

260
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,870
What are you doing?! Find her!

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Our orb!

262
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,580
Where'd she go?!

263
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,830
O-Over there!

264
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,160
That's it. Right this way.

265
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
--What the--?!
--There she goes!

266
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,450
Ooh! Look at her go!

267
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,540
I'm having fun just watching this.

268
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,040
[Vanish].

269
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,080
E-Enemies!

270
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,790
It's a huge attack!

271
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,750
Meet 'em head on!

272
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Give us back our orb!

273
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,540
You've got some nerves, thief!
You're the ones who came to steal ours!

274
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,450
Where's the woman in robes?!

275
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,830
Our guild doesn't have any women!

276
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,870
Thanks for number two!

277
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,910
Faster...

278
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,200
I've gotta hurry up!

279
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,410
I think one of the bigger guilds is gonna win.

280
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,250
There's no chance in hell for a small guild.

281
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,450
By bigger guild, you mean Order of
the Holy Sword or Flame Emperors?

282
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,410
I'm cheering for Holy Sword all the way.

283
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,290
Oh, look. Here they come.

284
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,000
Shall we get to it?

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,790
Have at 'em!

286
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,370
[Fissure]!

287
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,200
[Stampede]!

288
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,160
[Burn Axe]!

289
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,120
[Ground Lance]!

290
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,700
[Multi-Sunbeam]!

291
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,950
Whew! We sure made a mess!

292
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,660
A flawless defense. Now we just wait
for the others to come back.

293
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,620
Hmm?

294
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,250
Hey, guys. Change of plans.

295
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,290
Take the orb and head on back.

296
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,660
B-But...!

297
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,620
Hurry up.

298
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,250
Y-Yes sir!

299
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,330
It's been a while.
You've gotten a lot stronger.

300
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,830
How do you figure?

301
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,700
I trust what my instincts say.

302
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,200
[Super Speed]!

303
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,700
Heh! I see you got it, too! However...!

304
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,290
Hmph.

305
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,750
Was that... a hunch?

306
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,870
If I start doubting myself, I'm done for.

307
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,330
[Godspeed]!

308
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,950
[Cascade]!

309
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,750
He's gone.

310
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,080
Was that him just saying hello?

311
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,500
Well, I showed him [Cascade], so it's all good.

312
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,790
Will we be all right?

313
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,620
You think they'll get past the traps?

314
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sure it'll be fine, Markus.

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,700
Besides, we have trusty guildmates here
even if they manage to.

316
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,330
I'm still worried. She'll get mad
at me if we lose the orb.

317
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,750
See? More attackers fell for
your traps and got blown away.

318
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,580
That's Markus the "Trapper" for you.

319
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,000
But still... All I've done is
set my traps and wait.

320
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,080
No need to worry. Mii is snatching orbs
enough for the both of us!

321
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,580
[Flame]!

322
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,500
[Eruption]!

323
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,540
[Inferno]!

324
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,250
Here's an MP potion.

325
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,700
Thank you. Go and fetch the orb.

326
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,830
Ma'am.

327
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,540
I'll go after them.

328
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,580
Take our orbs and return to base.

329
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,040
[Flare Accel]!

330
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,620
[Vanish].

331
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
[Flame]! [Flame]! [Flame]!

332
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,660
[Fire Lance]! [Fire Lance]!
[Fire Lance]! [Flame]!

333
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,870
They got away...!

334
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm sorry, everyone!

335
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,410
I'm so not cut out to be a leader!
I've had enough!

336
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,580
Ugh! The next time we meet,
you won't get away!

337
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,040
So this is that woman's base?

338
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,660
It has to be. This is where my...
This is where our orb is!

339
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,540
Let's head on in!

340
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,870
By the way, isn't this the first time
we've fought together as eight?

341
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,870
Now that you mention it, yeah.

342
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,080
Maple, if you please.

343
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,700
Roger!

344
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,120
Get our orb!

345
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,620
For our pride and our orb! Attack!

346
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,580
Did we get 'em?

347
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,540
