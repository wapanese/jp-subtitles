1
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,620
[Sword of Judgment]!

2
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,870
[Stout Guardian], huh?

3
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,870
But how long can you really last
with only one HP?

4
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,750
[Predator]! [Hydra]!

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,160
That's nothing!

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,950
Maple!

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,080
Protect the orb!

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,450
[Multi-Firebolt]!

9
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,910
Maple! Use [Cover Move]!

10
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,620
Right! [Cover Mo--

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,250
[Super Speed]!

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,620
Iz!

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,950
"I Don't Want to Get Hurt,
so I'll Max Out My Defense."

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,620
"Defense and Bonds"

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,580
"Defense and Bonds"

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,580
I can't use [Cover Move] and
drag the others into this!

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,000
You've got bigger concerns
than others right now!

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Syrup! [Mother Nature]!

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,410
Turtle!

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,160
Such a useless struggle!

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,080
May, Yui! Stay close to my side!

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,700
Right!

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,120
Got time to worry about others?

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,330
[Power Axe]!

25
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,200
Kuromu!

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,750
Hmph. You've got a skill like Maple's?

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,370
I'm pretty tenacious in my own special way.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Wanna try your clone thing?

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,750
You're no match for my speed though.

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,250
Let me handle this. Go and help Maple.

31
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,660
Got it.

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,160
[Multi-Stonebolt]!

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,040
Kasumi!

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't always expect to see it coming.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,870
[Multi-Barrier]!

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,120
Shoot!

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,540
It doesn't matter how fast you are
if you can't move.

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,450
Oboro, [Awaken]!

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,910
Not happening!

40
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,040
Oboro!

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,750
Frederica! Keep her pinned down!

42
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,080
You've got it!

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,450
You're going nowhere!

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,080
[Arm of Steel]!

45
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,370
Well, ain't that cute!

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,700
[Smoke Screen]!

47
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,870
Kanade!

48
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,660
Dread, fetch the orbs.

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,330
On it!

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,750
Syrup! [Spirit Cannon]!

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,080
--Tur... tle!

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,290
--[Predator]! [Hydra]!
--Tur... tle!

53
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,450
I'm going to end this with everything I've got!

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,370
[Sword of Destruction]!

55
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,450
Maple!

56
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,580
[Counter]!

57
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,660
She threw down her shield?

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Payne!

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,540
Maple!

60
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,950
He took the full brunt of Maple's
[Counter] right in the face.

61
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,000
I know it's Payne, but still...

62
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,200
Still here.

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,160
You're kidding!

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,410
You're not the only one with [Stout Guardian]!

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,700
[Sword of Vanquishing]!

66
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,580
[Atrocity]!

67
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,910
I shouldn't have panicked. Oh, well...

68
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,620
For real?!

69
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,160
You're shitting me!

70
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,910
I guess this isn't a bad way to go.
Yeah, yeah, you win.

71
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,250
[Multi-Barrier]!

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,500
As if that would work!

73
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,620
We won!

74
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,000
We actually... won?

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,870
That was rough.

76
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,200
You took down <i>the</i> Payne!

77
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,910
You're incredible!

78
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,410
When you threw down your shield,
I thought you lost your mind.

79
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,000
Sally actually gave me the idea.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,200
She said it might come in handy someday.

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
--Kanade!
--Iz!

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,250
Sorry for dying on you.

83
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,910
How'd the fight go?

84
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,450
Just fine! Maple gave 'em a beat down!

85
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,910
We did it, Kanade! Iz!

86
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,080
Huh?

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,830
Um, Maple?

88
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,410
Aren't you gonna go back to normal?

89
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:55,120
Oh... I can only transform once a day,
so it's kind of a waste if I do.

90
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,500
All our plans went out the window.

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,870
Day two is barely behind us, yet...

92
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,450
...we've already showed off
[Machine God] and [Atrocity].

93
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,580
All of our trump cards are out in the open now.

94
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,540
Which is why I'm thinking
we move to the next stage.

95
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,080
It works out since Maple used [Atrocity], too.

96
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,830
It's perfect timing to make her debut.

97
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,910
Since the other orbs returned to their base,

98
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,500
there's no need for us to hang out in ours.

99
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,290
Right now, Maple Tree is in sixth,
but there's still three more days.

100
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,120
At this rate, I can see the big guilds
eventually passing us up.

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,790
For us not to fall out of the top ten,

102
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,080
we need to make it hard for
the other guilds to gain points, right?

103
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,330
In that case, we just have to remove
orbs from the equation.

104
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,620
But for that, we'd need to--

105
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,120
Trim down the number of guilds!

106
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,910
All right! Let's go!

107
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,500
Looks like guilds are dropping like flies.

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,790
Yeah. Wouldn't be surprised
if some huge guild raided us.

109
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,830
Let's go.

110
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,660
Yeah. Let's check it out.

111
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,950
Guys, let's go!

112
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,450
Yeah!

113
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,700
Hey! Who let the boss out?!

114
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,830
I don't know! Don't ask me!

115
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,040
Turtle!

116
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,450
Don't let anyone escape!

117
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,330
We've gotta wipe 'em out
and get rid of their orb!

118
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,450
Maple Tree might actually be a top finisher.

119
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,450
There's hardly any orbs left.

120
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,290
Looks like they gave up on gathering orbs,

121
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,290
and plan to prevent anyone
from building any points.

122
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,040
Won't the other top guilds hop
on the bandwagon, too?

123
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,160
It'll be easier for them to secure a spot.

124
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,250
Still, I can't believe it!

125
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,160
Ever think you'd see Payne get beat?

126
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,160
So much for being an angel.
At this point, she's more like a devil.

127
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,660
It's so frustrating getting beat
by that little guild over and over!

128
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,540
And what was that thing Maple turned into?!

129
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,790
That thing is unfair, I say! Unfair!

130
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,250
It's not unfair. I imagine she earned it
fair and square in some event.

131
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,500
Well, sure, but...

132
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,620
You don't seem that upset for someone
who just got beat, Payne.

133
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,870
I wouldn't say that. I'll settle
the score someday.

134
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,200
But it can wait until later.

135
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,290
Yup. It's not like anyone stole our orb.

136
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,290
We're pretty much a given for first, too.

137
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,330
There's nothin' to fret about.

138
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,620
Th-That's true. Yeah.

139
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,830
We haven't really been beat! We didn't lose!

140
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,080
Even so, it is a little frustrating.

141
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,750
Payne!

142
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,660
I see... Understood. Thank you.

143
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,330
It's about to get interesting again.

144
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,080
What's that?

145
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,250
Seems like there's an all-out war over there.

146
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,830
That's over by Flame Emperors.

147
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,410
Huh? I wonder what's happening?

148
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,500
So that's how it is...

149
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,370
Maple! Head towards Flame Emperors!

150
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,580
[Inferno]!

151
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,540
Hold the line! Get healed by
Misery if you take damage!

152
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,830
That's Mii for you.

153
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,200
She collected so many orbs
that we're back in the running.

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,910
But she also made us that many more enemies.

155
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,200
Now we have less than half of our army.

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,330
They're trying to wipe us out in hopes
of their own guilds going up in rank.

157
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,950
But if anyone else joins the fray...

158
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,580
Shin, you're up!

159
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,750
Got it!

160
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,200
[Split-Sword]!

161
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,450
Come on, give me a break! No, no, no!

162
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,540
What's the matter, Mii?

163
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,830
It's a report from the scouts.

164
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,370
A monster thought to be Maple
is heading this way.

165
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,250
Maple?

166
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,700
All it took was Kasumi to beat me though.

167
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,370
What awful news.

168
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,870
We're already in over our heads with enemies.

169
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,580
And if you add Maple Tree on top of that...

170
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,790
If we're going down, let's take
as many of them with us as we can!

171
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,910
Agreed!

172
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,120
We pledged to follow Mii to whatever end!

173
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,700
Let's show 'em what we're made of!

174
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,910
Leave all the healing to me.

175
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,080
Come on! Didn't you hear our leader?

176
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,540
All right, all right...

177
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,330
Let's do this!

178
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,120
[Flare Accel]!

179
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,080
[Inferno]!

180
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,910
I've spent almost all my MP.

181
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,620
I guess this is it.

182
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,870
Wha...?

183
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,250
What the hell's going on?

184
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,250
I don't know, but it seems Maple Tree
is attacking our enemies.

185
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,120
Do you think they came to save us?

186
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,290
Like as in an apology for last time?

187
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,950
I doubt they're that soft-hearted.

188
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,080
They must have some other motive.

189
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,620
In any case, this is our chance!
We counterattack!

190
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
Mmm!

191
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,250
Phew, that was close!

192
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,500
I almost ended up killing Mii by mistake.

193
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,910
We didn't want to hurt
the Flame Emperors, right?

194
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:37,790
Yup! Our goal is to make sure as many
guilds get wiped out as possible.

195
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,830
Flame Emperors can help us out with that.

196
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,000
Yup!

197
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,830
Huh?

198
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,290
It's Payne and them!

199
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,700
They must've had the same idea!

200
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,870
Kanade, it's time to roll!

201
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,790
We're doing our plan?

202
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,330
Oboro, [Shadow Clone]!

203
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,330
[Phantom World]!

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,790
There're seven Maples?

205
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,160
What sort of skill is that?!

206
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm grateful that she saved us, but...

207
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,910
Man, I don't even know what to say.

208
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,370
What the hell am I looking at?

209
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,660
The more I watch it, the more my brain melts.

210
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,160
That's why I said that thing is unfair.

211
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,540
I need to step up my game and
get myself some new skills, too.

212
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,200
It's only the third day,
but this thing is practically over.

213
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:14,250
True. There's just six guilds left
and all of 'em fall in the top ten.

214
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:20,790
And every guild in the top ten gets
exactly the same reward anyways.

215
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,120
There's really no point in fighting anymore.

216
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,910
Never thought it'd be such a brawl
that two whole days went to waste.

217
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,910
I think it's because Maple Tree
got everyone riled up.

218
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:39,330
All that's left now is to pick out some
highlights and put together a video.

219
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,870
Thing is, over half of 'em have Maple in it.

220
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,790
If only we could predict
what she would do next...

221
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:52,160
What's the plan? Should we nerf Maple
again so she's not as powerful?

222
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,750
I considered that,
but I'm thinking we leave her be.

223
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,910
Why's that?

224
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,830
Maple's basically the face
of the game at the moment.

225
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,330
She's drawn a ton of players into the game.

226
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:11,410
Not to mention people who grind and
build levels in hopes of fighting her.

227
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,620
If we make her weaker at this point,
nobody's gonna like it.

228
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,370
So we're taking a hands-off approach?

229
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,620
Yup! She's actually quite a cute player
if you're not busy trying to nerf her.

230
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,700
Who wants to take a guess?

231
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,290
What kind of craziness is Maple up to right now?

232
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,500
I bet she's chilling at base!
And playing board games with her guild!

233
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,290
Practicing how to fly with [Machine God]!

234
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,200
Sitting inside her giant turtle's mouth!

235
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,040
Munching on a weapon to see
if she learns a skill!

236
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,410
No, munching on her turtle!

237
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,450
All right, here it comes!

238
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,950
The answer is...!

239
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,250
Do it! Do it!

240
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,370
--Up you go!
--Whee!

241
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,410
Whew! It's finally over!

242
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,700
We got third place, too!
We beat our goal by a ton! Woo-hoo!

243
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,750
We placed higher than I thought we would.

244
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,700
But now we're gonna be a big target
when the next event rolls around.

245
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,410
Don't worry about next time! It'll all work out!

246
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,120
Seriously, I'm so glad you
told me about this game!

247
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,620
I think it changed my life!

248
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,500
But in a good way!

249
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,910
Keep up with your studies though.

250
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,500
If you get grounded from games,
we'll lose our guild master.

251
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,700
Oh, shoot! I forgot I've got
English tomorrow! I better review!

252
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,580
Without further ado, it's time to kick off
the party to celebrate the fourth event!

253
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,450
Maple Tree placed an awesome third place!

254
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,410
"3rd Place"

255
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,410
We all get five silver medals a piece!

256
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:08,290
What's more, we're all rewarded with
a five percent bonus to all stats!

257
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,580
Yeah, that's great and all, but...

258
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,790
Why are the rest of these guys here?

259
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,330
That's what I'd like to know.

260
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,660
We were on our way to go hunting as usual...

261
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,580
...when Maple here saw us
in town and insisted we come.

262
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,700
She was kind enough to invite us.
It would be rude to refuse.

263
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,580
It's the same for us.

264
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,500
Plus, we wanted to see what kind
of place Maple Tree was.

265
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,250
I've never been to an enemy guild before,
so I'm kinda nervous.

266
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,870
There's no sides when the fighting stops.

267
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,500
And we've already added them as friends.

268
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,370
True.

269
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,200
Well, if that's what our guild master wants,
we've got no complaints.

270
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,040
All right, everyone!
Let's toast for a job well done!

271
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,120
Cheers!

272
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,330
"3rd Place"

273
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,330
Cheers!

274
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,200
Rawr!

275
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,950
Now then, we've got some highlights
from the fourth event!

276
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,950
Volume One: "Maple Tree's Fierce Battle!"

277
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,330
"4th Event"
"Highlights"
"Maple Tree's Fierce Battle!"

278
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,870
"3rd Place"
"4th Event"
"Highlights"
"Maple Tree's Fierce Battle!"

279
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,870
Oh! That's the night I botched everything up!

280
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,370
I thought [Self-Destruct] would be
enough to get some payback.

281
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,540
You picked on the wrong person.

282
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,040
Maple, what's your vitality now?

283
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,160
Um, I think it broke five digits?

284
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,700
Well that explains a lot.

285
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,750
We didn't stand a chance.

286
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,410
Next time, we'll win.

287
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,580
Now we know the extent of Maple's skills.

288
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,660
It's Maple we're talking about.

289
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,290
By next time, she'll uncover
even weirder skills.

290
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,000
Take your eyes off her for a second,

291
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,040
and she'll turn into a furball
or monster or something.

292
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,250
I'm just playing the game normally, you know.

293
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,500
As if!

294
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Huh?!

295
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,080
"[NWO] Saw a sick great shielder
(Part 23) [5-Digit Defense]"

296
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,870
"[NWO] Saw a sick great shielder
(Part 23) [5-Digit Defense]"

297
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,870
"978. Cheers, all!"

298
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,870
"[NWO] Saw a sick great shielder
(Part 23) [5-Digit Defense]"

299
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,870
"978. Cheers, all!"
"979. Good work!"

300
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,660
"980. Saw the video. Hot damn, that was dope!"

301
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,200
"980. Saw the video. Hot damn, that was dope!"
"981. If you thought the highlights were sick,
you should have seen the party."

302
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,750
"982. Maple, Payne, and Mii
under one roof sounds insane!"

303
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,620
"982. Maple, Payne, and Mii
under one roof sounds insane!"
"983. What's really insane is
how freakishly strong they are."

304
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,330
"984. Dude, don't fool yourself.
You're well into freakish territory yourself."

305
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,870
"984. Dude, don't fool yourself.
You're well into freakish territory yourself."
"985. Hell, everyone in Maple Tree is nuts.
The only one who's relatively normal is Kasumi."

306
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,660
"986. There must be a [Maple]
skill that makes them weird."

307
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,370
"986. There must be a [Maple]
skill that makes them weird."
"987. You've been infected by [Maple].
Acquired skill [Maple]."

308
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,250
"988. By the way, You Know Who
broke 5-digits in VIT."

309
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,790
"988. By the way, You Know Who
broke 5-digits in VIT."
"989. That's like 100x my STR!
ONE FREAKING HUNDRED!"

310
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,500
"990. 10 bucks says Maple already
found some new monster to turn into."

311
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,290
"990. 10 bucks says Maple already
found some new monster to turn into."
"991. Probably. She always manages to
pick up skills when no one's looking."

312
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,910
"992. Welp, boys. Guess we'll just
have to watch over her for eternity."

313
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,370
"993. Watch? No... Cheer her on? SIGN ME UP!"

314
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,830
"993. Watch? No... Cheer her on? SIGN ME UP!"
"994. Agreed!"

315
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,200
"993. Watch? No... Cheer her on? SIGN ME UP!"
"994. Agreed!"
"995. Me too!"

316
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,830
"993. Watch? No... Cheer her on? SIGN ME UP!"
"994. Agreed!"
"995. Me too!"
"996. Me 2! Me 2!"

317
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,450
"997. Aren't they announcing
another event soon?"

318
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,000
"997. Aren't they announcing
another event soon?"
"998. At this rate, we won't be able
to take our eyes off Maple."

319
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,830
"999. Works for me. She's cute."

320
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,950
"999. Works for me. She's cute."
"1000. Max out that defense, baby!"

321
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,950
"I Don't Want to Get Hurt,
so I'll Max Out My Defense."
