1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,110
I'll be joining you all in 
Control Division One starting today.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,190
My name is Amon Koutarou.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,710
I look forward to working with all of you!

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,060
The new guys this year are quite serious, huh?

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,280
S-Special Investigator Arima!

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,630
Your teachers have told me 
all about you. It's a pleasure, Amon.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,530
L-Likewise!

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll be placing you under the care of Mado-san.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,670
Mado-san? You're only a newbie. Man, you have it tough.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,240
He gets a little excited sometimes, 
so make sure you don't get caught up in his flow.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,300
Mado-san, this man will be 
your partner from today onward.

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,690
All right.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,860
Mado Kureo. Nice to meet you, Amon-kun.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,530
I look forward to working with you.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,700
Applehead, was it?

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,240
Yes. That ghoul has claimed fifty 
predatory kills in the last year alone.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,880
Have you narrowed it down to any suspects?

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,800
There is one.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,510
Specifically, a woman who's in the area 
every evening. Muramatsu Kie, age sixty-eight.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,630
Is it really that surprising? You think ghouls 
old enough to be your grandparents don't exist?

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,080
Er, no...

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,940
I'm quite convinced that this woman is Applehead.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,640
What makes you so sure?

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,350
My instincts.

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,780
I-Instincts?

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,590
Instincts are nothing to sneeze at, Amon-kun.

28
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,910
In fact, I'm rather confident in my instincts.

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,660
<i>Is this guy right in the head?</i>

30
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,630
Good afternoon, Muramatsu-san.

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,630
My, good afternoon. Nice weather, isn't it?

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,550
I see you've brought a handsome 
young man with you today.

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,550
This is Amon, my new partner.

34
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,850
Pleased to meet you.

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,310
<i>This harmless, old woman is a ghoul?</i>

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,350
Thank you very much for sending me that doctor's certificate.

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,120
If we take a look at your RC levels, 
it'll be obvious whether you're a ghoul or not.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,740
You have an RC count of 231. 
Such a number would be impossible for a ghoul.

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm terribly sorry for casting my suspicion upon you.

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,590
Why didn't you tell me that 
you had a doctor's certificate from her!?

41
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,700
It's easy to forge a document like this.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,920
It doesn't prove anything.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,970
But even so...

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,970
It's all part of my plan. 
She's going to end up giving herself away.

45
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,460
You should watch what I'm doing and take notes.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,860
You're still a fledgling after all.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,520
Very well.

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,160
Oh, right! Amon-kun, 
do you mind showing me your Quinque?

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,030
I'm rather curious about the type of 
Quinques they hand out to newbies these days.

50
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,990
With all due respect, Senior Investigator Mado,

51
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,380
I take my job seriously.

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,380
I'd like to refrain from any action that is not conducive to the investigation!

53
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,320
Now if you'll excuse me.

54
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,310
For God's sake...

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,470
What does that man think he's doing?

56
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,810
Why is someone like him stationed at Headquarters?

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,690
Muramatsu-san?

58
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,020
Thanks for going out of your way to help me.

59
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,820
Not at all.

60
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,040
If only my own son were as kind as you.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,410
You flatter me.

62
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,920
I really am grateful.

63
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,130
<i>Suspecting a woman like her... He must be out of his mind.</i>

64
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,550
I must say, this is rather heavy.

65
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,430
I'm surprised you were able to haul it this far yourself.

66
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,520
Don't treat me like some helpless old lady, you little brat!

67
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,700
Is this it?

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,670
That's no good, Amon-kun.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,920
You can't drop your guard in front of scum like her.

70
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,930
Mado-san.

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm sorry. I...

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,680
No harm done. 
I took your inexperience into account for my plan.

73
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,160
I highly admire that passion of yours.

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
But keep this in mind:

75
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,850
if the foe is before you, even if it costs you your arms and legs, you fight.

76
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,490
That's what it means to be an Investigator.

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,740
Yes, sir!

78
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,920
Hey, crybaby Amon!

79
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,530
Shinohara-san!

80
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,630
Hey there. Back from the grind?

81
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,500
What are you doing in the 20th Ward?

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,440
I needed to see you for something.

83
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,100
What's that?

84
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,640
I was going to visit Mado-san.

85
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,520
Ah, that's right. It's been fourty-nine days, huh?

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,690
Yes.

87
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,370
To think that he's no longer with us...

88
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,070
I still can't believe it.

89
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,680
Anyway, what did you need?

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,160
Oh, it can wait. I'll be back tomorrow.

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,400
But...

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,880
It's fine. Go on.

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,140
Say, Amon.

94
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,200
He...

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,420
was really proud of you.

96
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,430
Right. It's the same for me.

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,340
Mado Kureo was my pride.

98
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,760
Multiple bodies were found on the streets of the 11th Ward last night.

99
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,650
The CCG are curently investigating this as a criminal ghoul offense—

100
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,910
Onii-chan!

101
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,340
Uh, H-Hinami-chan?

102
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,210
That's my name!

103
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,670
What's up with the outfit?

104
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,160
I borrowed some of Touka-oneechan's stuff.

105
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm about to go out with Yomo-san.

106
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,250
Go out?

107
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,330
We're going to buy a home for Loser.

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,550
Loser! Loser!

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,350
All right, Yomo-kun. Take care of Hinami-chan, okay?

110
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,770
I'm a cat. Loser!

111
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,730
Off we go!

112
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,840
<i>After things settled down, 
Hinami-chan moved in with Touka-chan.</i>

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,490
<i>She's slowly reverting back to her usual self, one step at a time.</i>

114
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,640
T-Touka-chan.

115
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
Where's Loser?

116
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,600
The manager took him inside.

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,780
There's no way I'm keeping that bird at home.

118
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,750
<i>Touka-chan likes to space out sometimes.</i>

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,750
What are you looking at? I'll kill you!

120
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,240
Er, sorry.

121
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,180
<i>It really feels like everything's gone back to normal.</i>

122
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,470
<i>However, something like that just isn't possible.</i>

123
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,940
<i>Everyone's gotten over the tragedy.</i>

124
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,120
<i>It may be painful,</i>

125
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,450
<i>but we must live on.</i>

126
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,130
<i>And so we desperately tried to salvage what we could of our previous lives.</i>

127
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,850
What are you doing, you damn woman!?

128
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,630
Is that any way to speak to your senior, damn Nishiki!?

129
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,180
You, my senior, at this damn useless job!?

130
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,450
Ah, the future looks damn bleak indeed!

131
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,020
Having a damn sickening college boy with a damn smart mouth as my damn junior

132
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,050
makes me pretty damn discouraged as well!

133
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,890
Why don't you just hurry up and quit?

134
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,940
It's not your place to ask things like that, you damn woman!

135
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,940
Um, we're in the service trade,

136
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,040
What's your problem, damn Nishiki!?

137
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,040
so would the two of you keep the "damns" to a minimum?

138
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,930
Damn you Touka!

139
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,050
Damn you Nishiki!

140
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,270
What <i>is</i> it with you? Can't you come up with a better comeback instead of parroting me, damn Touka!?

141
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm about ready to get angry myself.

142
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,990
Comparing me to a bird—

143
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,370
Of all things! Damn you Nishiki!

144
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,870
You guys <i>do</i> know the legend of the Devil Ape, right?

145
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,890
Damn you Touka!

146
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,040
Damn you Nishiki!

147
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,820
There it is again! That's all an idiot like you knows!

148
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,400
You're not going to pass any exams with that brain!

149
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,500
That's none of your business, damn Nishiki!

150
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,800
<i>I'm sorry, Mado-san. If only I had arrived sooner...</i>

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,270
<i>I will kill Rabbit with my own two hands. I swear it.</i>

152
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,400
So you're telling me that Rize was somehow controlling you?

153
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,830
Well, no. I'm not sure how to describe it.

154
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,630
My memories aren't too clear on what happened during those moments.

155
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,960
When I came around, I had attacked Yomo-san.

156
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,640
Impressive. You actually pierced 
through Ren-chan's sturdy body.

157
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,480
You're pretty strong aren't you, Kanekicchi?

158
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Itori-san!

159
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,730
I'm just joking!

160
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,220
Kanekicchi, the only person who's worse than you at recognizing my jokes is Ren-chan!

161
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,940
Sorry.

162
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,070
Something like this had happened before.

163
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,320
Back then, it felt like Rize-san had overwhelmed me too.

164
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,580
So you decided to call me for any information I had about Rize?

165
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,410
Yes.

166
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,500
Good choice, Kanekicchi. You can always rely on me.

167
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,750
Rize, huh?

168
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,310
Well, Kanekicchi, the truth is...

169
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,430
Yes?

170
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,310
I can honestly say that there's not much I know about Rize.

171
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,020
You see, she just showed up out of the blue one day.

172
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,480
Just showed up?

173
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,880
Nobody knows why she came here, 
or what she was doing before that.

174
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,580
But even then, it's not like Rize 
just appeared out of thin air.

175
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,490
If you search hard enough, 
you should be able to find some leads.

176
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,240
I guess.

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,840
Why don't you start by visiting the 11th Ward?

178
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,680
The 11th Ward?

179
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,090
Rize was in the 11th Ward before she moved here.

180
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,630
That, I'm certain of.

181
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,730
The 11th Ward...

182
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,060
<i>Maybe I'll take a look on my next day off.</i>

183
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,950
Oh, excuse me!

184
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,460
No, excuse <i>me</i>.

185
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,290
I spaced out for a second there.

186
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,360
Well then, off I go!

187
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,440
<i>There's something about him.</i>

188
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,240
Must be going!

189
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,070
<i>It smells really good.</i>

190
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,960
Insurance card, library card,

191
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,790
and here we have...

192
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,710
His student ID! Kaneki Ken, 
age nineteen. Oh, we're the same age!

193
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,920
And the real jackpot...

194
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,970
What a shame.

195
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,080
Pickpocketed?

196
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Do you remember their face?

197
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,140
I never got a good look.

198
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,140
Did you file a report?

199
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,190
I didn't have that much in it.

200
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,980
Jeez, you're pathetic.

201
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,410
If you paid more attention to your surroundings, creeps like that wouldn't be coming after you.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,990
We've just received some breaking news.

203
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,990
Well, I guess so.

204
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,440
Following Chairman Washu Tsuneyoshi's decision,

205
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,760
the CCG has increased the number of investigators 
allocated to both the 11th and 20th Wards.

206
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,670
This decision was made in order to reduce ghoul activity,

207
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,670
Is the 20th Ward really that much of a riot?

208
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,670
Beats me.

209
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,220
which has been increasing as of late. The 11th Ward—

210
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,840
I wonder if the balance has been tipped.

211
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,870
Oh, I thought that maybe there was some 
ghoul organization here in the 20th Ward.

212
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,890
Wh-What makes you say that?

213
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,360
If you look at other Wards, there's a noticeable 
difference in the amount of predatory cases here.

214
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,330
I figured the ghouls in the 
20th Ward were working together.

215
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,980
Both the binge eater and Gourmet suddenly disappeared as soon as they started actively preying on people.

216
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,220
Which means it's possible that this ghoul organization cleaned up their mess before the CCG could step in.

217
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,750
You look kinda pale, Kaneki.

218
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,630
N-Nah, I'm fine.

219
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,760
Hide, you're pretty interested in ghouls, huh?

220
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,600
Yeah.

221
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,330
The thing is...

222
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,850
This book is <i>super</i> fascinating!

223
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,900
It's about a gang of ghouls in the 
3rd Ward who wear clown masks,

224
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,660
and about how Matsubara, the ghoul from Wakayama, came to Tokyo.

225
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,910
It also has stuff about how ghouls grow hair!

226
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,700
See ya later, Kaneki.

227
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,550
Amon-san, the reassignments from 
Headquarters are waiting for you.

228
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,010
Understood. I'll be right there.

229
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
<i>I wonder who they're assigning.</i>

230
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,220
<i>There wouldn't be any openings among the veteran force.</i>

231
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,140
Yo!

232
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,300
Shinohara-san! Don't tell me you're coming down to the 20th Ward.

233
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,120
Nah, I've been assigned on something else.

234
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,060
These two will be overseeing the 20th Ward.

235
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,190
Houji-san!

236
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,800
It's been a while, Koutarou.

237
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,530
A very long while indeed.

238
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,120
A-Amon-san!

239
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,830
P-Pleased to meet you!

240
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,290
Second Grade Investigator Takizawa Seido, Headquarters Control Division One!

241
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,610
Quite the fan of yours, apparently. He's been very anxious.

242
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,630
A-Assistant Special Investigator Houji! Well, I mean...

243
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,130
Nice to meet you, Investigator Takizawa.

244
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,500
It's a pleasure meeting you!

245
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,230
Amon, the 20th Ward is going to have these two on hand for the time being.

246
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,040
You're being assigned to a special task force.

247
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,020
Special task force?

248
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,240
Yup. Maru told me.

249
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,160
You'll be at the 11th Ward with me.

250
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,120
The 11th Ward...

251
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,870
Oh, really? So things are that 
bad in the 11th Ward now, huh?

252
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:12,350
From what Yomo-kun said, the ghouls are 
working together to hunt Investigators down.

253
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,680
It sounds like a real mess.

254
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,920
Is that so?

255
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,660
If this keeps up, we could be in for some big trouble.

256
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,470
What sort of big trouble?

257
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,970
A war, perhaps.

258
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,590
The day where I get called the 
Devil Ape again may be fast approaching.

259
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,590
Anyway, where's Touka?

260
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,020
I think she's looking after Loser.

261
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,720
I thought she wasn't very good with birds.

262
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,780
That's true. I'll go have a quick look, then.

263
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,500
<i>He had a family too.</i>

264
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,590
Touka-chan?

265
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,980
I wonder where this guy's family is.

266
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,400
Everyone has a family, right?

267
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,090
Ayato!

268
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,540
What is it, onee-chan?

269
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,590
Poor guy. He looks pretty hurt.

270
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,950
Dad...

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,620
How about we take him home?

272
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,540
Yeah!

273
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,080
I found a worm!

274
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,580
Don't be a baby! Man up!

275
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,670
But...

276
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,990
This is for Chunta.

277
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,350
You caught this many?

278
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,970
Touka, you're as boyish as your mother.

279
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,730
What about me? What about me?

280
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,370
I can't stand worms either.

281
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,920
You're just like your dad, Ayato.

282
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,110
You two need to take a bath.

283
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,200
Give me a hug first!

284
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,610
Me too!

285
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,580
All right.

286
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,000
You two just keep getting bigger.

287
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,660
Touka, you're the older sister,

288
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,900
so you have teach Ayato all sorts of things.

289
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,140
Ayato, you're the boy, so you have to protect your sister.

290
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,290
Promise me.

291
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,060
What kind of people did you have in your family?

292
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,810
Oh, well...

293
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,570
My dad passed away before I even had any memories of him.

294
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,400
Same with my mom, too.

295
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,640
I was still in elementary school.

296
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,410
I see.

297
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,990
Loser, it's dinner time!

298
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
Onii-chan!

299
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,390
Hinami-chan! You got a haircut, huh?

300
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,790
Yup! Does it look good?

301
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,240
Very good. Did you go to a salon?

302
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,420
Nope. Actually, I had Onee-chan do it for me!

303
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,370
What?

304
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,620
Oh, nothing.

305
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,850
You think it's out of my character, don't you?

306
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,370
I'm just surprised at how good you are.

307
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,640
I-Is that so?

308
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,960
Loser! Stupid scum!

309
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,630
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

310
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,400
Hey, you! You've got a filthy mouth, you stupid cockatiel!

311
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
I'll deep-fry you in oil, you—

312
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,290
Loser!

313
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,920
It's bitter.

314
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,000
Haven't you met her before?

315
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,190
Rize?

316
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,010
Well, my memories of her aren't the fondest.

317
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,340
She won't get away this time.

318
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,560
The 20th Ward.

319
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,650
It's my first time here.

320
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,520
It feels like time passes by slowly around here.

321
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,730
Idiots. Don't let your guard down.

322
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,080
Let's hurry and get to work.

323
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,580
Are you sure she's here, Banjou-san?

324
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,330
There's a coffee shop called Anteiku. 
It's run by a rather odd old ghoul.

325
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,630
Let's get going. Rize-san must've gone there.

326
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,930
Not even the least bit of a fight in them.

327
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
Any news from that airhead Banjo?

328
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,320
None.

329
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,120
Damn that clown. At this rate,

330
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,150
Yamori and that fairy are going to get the jump on him.

331
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,540
All right, we're heading for the 20th Ward as well.

332
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,670
Our objective is to secure Rize.

333
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,530
Yes!

334
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,450
Come to think of it, you're from 
the 20th Ward, right, Ayato-san?

335
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,110
I don't remember much.

336
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,290
It's basically just a cesspool of peace-addled wimps.

337
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,970
Now that I think about it, 
a relative of mine still lives there.

338
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,980
One of the peace-addled wimps.

339
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,050
What's happening here, a showdown?

340
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,320
That new ghoul and Uta-san are gonna go at it.

341
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,360
Are you the one who's been 
making a fuss around here lately?

342
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,660
What's with those stupid glasses?

343
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,650
Hey guys, wanna see me beat him to tears?

344
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,050
Uta-san means business!

345
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,030
They're going to make a mess of the 4th Ward like this!

346
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,000
He's pretty strong, huh?
