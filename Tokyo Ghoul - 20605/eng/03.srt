1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,980
Yes.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,270
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,540
Take care.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,570
Next patient, please!

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,450
Help...

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,410
Knock, knock...

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,070
I've finally found you.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,410
Yamori...

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,370
I seem to have misplaced that 
nifty little toy you made for me.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,960
I want you to prepare a replacement.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,170
Of course...

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,640
Splendid. I'll be back.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,010
Dear...

14
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,400
Slowly, now.

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,730
There's no need to rush. Just keep up those spirals.

16
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,820
R-Right.

17
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,740
How is it?

18
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,420
If I were to compare it to yours, 
this cup doesn't quite hit the mark.

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,270
Each cup of coffee is unique in that 
it reflects the amount of effort poured into it.

20
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,870
Like when dealing with people, 
coffee doesn't like to be rushed.

21
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,360
I see.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,880
There's something you need to consider.

23
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,720
Anteiku isn't just your average coffee house.

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,390
It's also a place where the ghouls of 
the 20th Ward can interact and feel at home.

25
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,710
Of course, we also gladly serve human customers here.

26
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,640
Just as we once did for you, right?

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,690
But if ghouls are trying their 
hardest to blend in with society,

28
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,640
why would you go out of your way to serve human customers as well?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,110
It's critical to understand human behavior in order to inhabit the world they live in.

30
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,490
Humans are living, breathing textbooks for ghouls like us.

31
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,760
Besides, I like them.

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
Humans, that is.

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,720
All right, I think it's about time I send you down to give Touka-chan a hand.

34
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,880
R-Right.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,840
<i>He likes humans? What part of them, exactly?</i>

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,110
Okay, some other time—

37
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,300
Hey, Kaneki!

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,890
H-Hide! What are you doing here?

39
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,640
Silly, I came here to thank Touka-chan, of course!

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Thank her?

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,090
She helped us out when we got 
caught up in that mess, remember?

42
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,400
Huh?

43
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,570
Poor guy, looks like he hasn't fully recovered yet.

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,320
You okay?

45
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,320
Yeah.

46
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,580
That's good.

47
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,580
I hear Nishio-senpai is still recovering at the hospital since he had it pretty rough.

48
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,330
We were lucky to get away with just
 a few scratches thanks to you, Touka-chan.

49
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,120
All right Kaneki, I'll catch you later.

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,840
Yeah, sure.

51
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,840
Thank you very much.

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,300
Make sure he doesn't find out about your ghoul situation.

53
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,300
I know.

54
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,780
If he catches even the slightest wind about us...

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,310
I'll slaughter him on the spot.

56
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,900
What!? But that's...

57
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,020
If you don't want that to happen, keep your damn mouth shut.

58
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,770
Welcome!

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,030
Touka-chan...

60
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,330
Ryouko-san!

61
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,290
Kaneki, towels!

62
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,740
Yes!

63
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

64
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,740
Don't worry, it's nothing.

65
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,970
Hinami, it's been a while.

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,960
Hinami...

67
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,790
Where is Yoshimura-san?

68
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,510
Inside.

69
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,210
Kaneki!

70
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,080
Hand her a new one.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,420
Oh, here you go.

72
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,880
Thank you very much.

73
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,700
They're ghouls, right?

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,230
That's Fueguchi-san. 
We'll be taking care of her from now on.

75
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,940
Taking care of?

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,730
Yeah, it's a bit of a long story.

77
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,660
Story? What happened?

78
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,890
Seriously, I've almost had it with you!

79
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,280
You're not even good for anything!

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm well aware of that...

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,790
Oh, right. Did the manager tell you anything?

82
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,670
Huh?

83
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,160
About the Suits?

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,040
Suits?

85
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,250
The guys who walk around with those big suitcases.

86
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,260
This is the current status of the 11th Ward.

87
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,390
These patterns clearly indicate 
the start of organized movements.

88
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,890
At this rate, it'll only be a 
matter of time until a war is waged.

89
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,420
That concludes my report. 
Does anyone else have anything further?

90
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,630
Amon Koutarou, First Class Investigator.

91
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,440
I'll start with this.

92
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,160
I believe everyone is aware 
of the incident that happened three months ago,

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,200
where Jason from the 13th Ward initiated contact 
with an S-rated ghoul from the 20th Ward, a binge eater.

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,410
The following piece of evidence 
was left behind at the crime scene.

95
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,500
And that is?

96
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,670
A pair of medical pliers, 
tailored for ghouls, supposedly.

97
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,890
Upon further analysis, 
we have identified it as a Quinque weapon.

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,230
Jason's objective is currently unknown.

99
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,910
However, I'd like to direct your attention

100
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,220
towards the abrupt decline in binge predation lately.

101
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,690
In short, those ghouls might 
be planning something in the 20th Ward.

102
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,230
I expected nothing less from the Academy's top student.

103
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,130
Good for you, Mado.

104
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,420
Having such a reliable partner gives you 
more time to play with your toys, no?

105
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,110
Fortunately so.

106
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,290
Now, if you could just get this meeting over and done with,

107
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,200
I'd be spending my time on 
something far more productive.

108
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,840
Blunt as ever, I see.

109
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,850
All right, I want you guys to stay on top of things in the 20th Ward. Got it?

110
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,460
Yes, sir.

111
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,490
With the quietest ward's sudden flare in ghoul activity,

112
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,050
something tells me that this 
is a glimpse of things to come.

113
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,930
But our purpose here at the CCG

114
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,030
is to eradicate every last ghoul from Tokyo!

115
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,090
This is the one and only responsibility that we've been entrusted with!

116
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,690
Even now, that fact remains the same!

117
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,230
All right, let's stay focused and get right to it!

118
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,690
Yes, sir!

119
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,070
This meeting is now adjourned. Dismissed!

120
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,360
In any case, we're free to investigate the 
20th Ward without any restrictions now.

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

122
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,960
Or so we say, but we only have this one lead.

123
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,460
It's enough. We've grasped the end of the thread.

124
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,210
Now we just have to reel it in, 
until we reach the catch at the other end.

125
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,350
Right.

126
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,750
The 20th Ward...

127
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,750
Mado-san?

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,020
The Gourmet, the binge eater, and Jason...

129
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,150
Give it a try.

130
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,440
M-Manager, I'm sorry but this is just...

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,240
Are you all right?

132
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,860
This bread tastes like a dried-up sponge

133
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,140
and the cheese smells like 
my socks after an intense workout.

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,090
Well, that's quite the vivid imagination.

135
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,800
The trick to this is swallowing it whole without chewing.

136
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,290
Pretend to chew it about ten times for good measure.

137
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,690
You should also make chewing 
noises for a more convincing act.

138
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,320
Then, be sure to throw it back up 
before your body starts to digest it.

139
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,700
It'll be bad for your health otherwise.

140
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,450
Kaneki-kun,

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,780
with a little practice, I'm sure you can eat with your friend again when the time comes.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,260
I'll do my best.

143
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,910
I have a present for you.

144
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,370
Sugar cubes?

145
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,280
They're a bit different on the inside.

146
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,630
If you dissolve them in coffee and drink it, 
they'll keep your hunger at bay for a little while.

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,140
What exactly do they contain?

148
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,890
Some things are probably best left unsaid.

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,890
Still, if I have these...

150
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,390
Listen, Kaneki-kun.

151
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,420
Can I trouble you to stay late today?

152
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,400
Oh, of course. I don't mind.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,680
I'd usually ask Touka-chan,

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,420
but she's busy studying for a test.

155
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,040
I'd like you to go procure some food in her stead.

156
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,290
P-Procure some food?

157
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,930
I-I can't kill anyone!

158
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,540
Worry not, you won't be harming anyone.

159
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,740
Anteiku provides food for our friends who don't wish to hurt people.

160
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,650
You understand the necessity for that, yes?

161
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,550
Yes.

162
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,900
But if we're not hurting anyone...

163
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,090
<i>Then, would you mind taking it up with Yomo-kun for me?</i>

164
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,210
U-Um, Yomo-san?

165
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,710
What exactly does "food procurement" mean?

166
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,770
<i>For ghouls who don't wish to hurt people...</i>

167
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,450
<i>I wonder if that lady and her daughter from this morning are the same.</i>

168
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,000
Get out.

169
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,990
Whoa, this is pretty high up.

170
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,180
What are we—

171
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,180
Don't do that.

172
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,490
Huh?

173
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,300
You'll fall.

174
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,050
I'm alive...

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,700
A lot of people die here.

176
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Many of them come to throw their lives away.

177
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,300
So the people of Anteiku 
choose to eat suicide victims...

178
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,970
Pack him in.

179
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,170
E-Excuse me?

180
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,970
I'm sorry, Mado-san. I was a second too slow.

181
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,990
Amon-kun, it's all about your senses. 
Use your five senses.

182
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,630
Now then...

183
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,800
You there, any idea what this is?

184
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,730
Wh-What?

185
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,780
I'll ask you one more time.

186
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,310
Have you ever seen anything like this?

187
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,880
H-Hell if I know. What is it?

188
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
What do you wa—

189
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,860
A mask, you say?

190
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,710
That's right. I think it's time you had your own.

191
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,530
I see...

192
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,610
Touka-chan.

193
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,470
Yes?

194
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,960
Would you mind helping Kaneki-kun out with his mask tomorrow?

195
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,170
What!?

196
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,100
Just when I finally landed a day off, too.

197
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,210
Why should I have to spend it with this guy!?

198
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,220
Kaneki-kun would probably get lost if he went alone.

199
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,480
Not to mention, it's pretty dangerous around those parts.

200
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,890
That may be true, but he doesn't need one yet, does he?

201
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,640
Touka-chan...

202
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,650
There are Investigators 
sniffing around the 20th Ward.

203
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,650
Doves!?

204
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,060
Doves?

205
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,580
They've already inflicted damage.

206
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,910
I'd like to prepare one for him right away, just in case.

207
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,240
All right.

208
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,110
Hey, Eyepatch.

209
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,870
Meet me in front of the train station tomorrow, 2:30.

210
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,620
Miss it by a minute and you're dead to me.

211
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,370
R-Right!

212
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,650
J-Jeez, what?

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,500
We've got some nice girls here!

214
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,460
Screw you, jerk!

215
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,600
Uta-san!

216
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,690
Hello?

217
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,100
Jeez, maybe he's asleep?

218
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,860
Boo.

219
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,730
What are you doing, Uta-san?

220
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,570
I went out of my way to pleasantly surprise you.

221
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,290
This is Uta-san. He'll make a mask for you.

222
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,330
That's me.

223
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,910
I'm K-Kaneki. It's nice to meet you—

224
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,200
You smell... different.

225
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,330
Touka-san, I understand the Doves are on the prowl.

226
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,010
Yes.

227
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,230
The 20th Ward is nice and quiet, 
no one ever bothers to check us out.

228
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,260
I assume this is Rize-san's impact.

229
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,900
Tsukiyama seems to be pushing his luck lately too.

230
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,260
Ah yes, that guy...

231
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,020
Um, is the 20th Ward known for 
being reasonably quiet? I wouldn't know.

232
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,430
Live somewhere else for a bit, 
and the difference will be clear as day.

233
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,570
If you're up to it, you can stay over for the night.

234
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,650
If you're lucky, you'll get to experience 
some cannibalism. That's always fun.

235
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,690
I-I'm fine, thanks.

236
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,650
Having a place like Anteiku must be pretty great for you.

237
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,660
Sit over there. I'll take your measurements.

238
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,960
Do you have any allergies?

239
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,600
No...

240
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,940
What about rubber or metal?

241
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,530
They're fine—

242
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,090
You want a full mask?

243
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,490
Uh...

244
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,200
Well, it<i> is</i> your first time. 
Maybe a half-mask instead.

245
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,120
S-Sure...

246
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,300
Cute eyepatch. Are you a fan of it?

247
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,840
When I get hungry, this eye turns red 
regardless of whether or not I want it to.

248
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,720
You could always just fill up, you know.

249
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,600
Care for a snack?

250
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,720
I-I'm good.

251
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,890
Kaneki-kun, do you have anyone special?

252
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,230
Huh? I guess not.

253
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,380
You're like one of those, how do I say it...

254
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,950
Those guys who get pampered more 
by older ladies than girls their own age.

255
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,170
U-Um, are these questions relevant to anything at all?

256
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,660
Yes. I feel more motivated if I get to know you better.

257
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,330
What about Touka-san?

258
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,710
Her? She's kind of scary.

259
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,010
Scary? You think so?

260
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,420
She looks like a dedicated hard worker to me.

261
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,300
A hard worker?

262
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,070
In order for us to blend into human society,

263
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,550
we need a mask that should never be taken off.

264
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,920
If someone catches onto us 
for even a moment, we're all done for.

265
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,560
That's why we have to carry ourselves in 
day-to-day life without getting too involved.

266
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,060
She lives her life accepting that risk.

267
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,400
Her job at Anteiku, and even going to school...

268
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,400
Is the risk really worth it?

269
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,130
That's a good question.

270
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,120
But you know, whenever the occasional human customer walks in, I get a different feeling.

271
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,120
My pulse races. It's hard to explain,

272
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,920
but it's a good feeling.

273
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,420
<i>A hard worker, huh?</i>

274
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,500
<i>While I'm... nothing...</i>

275
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,490
Touka-chan!

276
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,540
What?

277
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,560
What exactly is Hinami-chan's situation like?

278
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,100
Is there any use in you knowing something like that?

279
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,110
I want to know!

280
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,440
I want to know...

281
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380
If there's anything that I can do...

282
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,000
She has to live away from her father now, 
so she must be anxious.

283
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
She isn't usually like this.

284
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,230
So that's how it is...

285
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,450
A-Anyway, Touka-chan, what are those masks used for?

286
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,140
Huh? You came without even knowing what they're for?

287
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,140
Uh, yeah.

288
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,220
Jeez, that manager...

289
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,220
If you ever bump into a couple of Doves, and by that I mean Investigators,

290
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,110
you don't want them catching even a glimpse of your face.

291
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,190
That's why we have Uta-san making a mask for you.

292
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,950
Screw those damned shitheads.

293
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,240
You filth...

294
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,020
Hey, shitbags, ever seen this before?

295
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,580
Huh? No, you piece of—

296
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,730
What about you?

297
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,950
I-I dunno jack shi— 
I mean, no, no I haven't!

298
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,980
For sure?

299
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,840
Yes, I'm sure—

300
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,960
Thank you for your cooperation.

301
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,140
Let's go, Amon-kun.

302
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,240
Maybe we'll have better luck somewhere else.

303
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,920
Yes, you're right.

304
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,150
All right...

305
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,490
Um, I... T-Take your time!

306
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,250
You saw her eating, then?

307
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,540
That's no good, Kaneki-kun.

308
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,990
Girls are sensitive when it comes to that stuff.

309
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,190
I see...

310
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,010
Here.

311
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,260
You can bring this up and apologize as well.

312
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,830
Hinami-chan, may I come in?

313
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,390
Yes.

314
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,780
Sorry about earlier.

315
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,730
Here, as an apology.

316
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,320
Go ahead, at your leisure.

317
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,130
U-Um...

318
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,290
Yes?

319
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,330
Um, Onii-san, I...

320
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,390
Well, which one are you?

321
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,830
I'm sorry. You're completely different from everyone else.

322
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,590
If you were one of us, 
I'd be able to tell from miles away.

323
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,590
I've been through some pretty hard times, you see.

324
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,290
My body has the tendencies of a ghoul,

325
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,600
so if I had to say, I think I'm closer to what you are.

326
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,660
I suppose you could say I have the 
mind of a human and the body of a ghoul.

327
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,410
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

328
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,010
I-It's no big deal.

329
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,730
Hey, that's a pretty cute drawing.

330
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,650
What kind of animal is it?

331
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,700
Um, it's my father.

332
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,110
Y-You did a really good job on him!

333
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,800
Your father, huh?

334
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,670
I hope you'll be able to see him again soon.

335
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,510
That's <i>Monochrome of Rainbows</i>, isn't it?

336
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,860
Huh? Oh, yeah.

337
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,270
Hinami-chan, you read Takatsuki's books?

338
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,550
That's impressive, given how tough they are to read.

339
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,010
Oh, but those are short stories so I guess they're relatively easier.

340
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,980
Hinami-chan, which story is your favorite?

341
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,150
U-Um, Small Rain... Night Time...

342
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,670
Small Rain Night Time?

343
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,630
Oh, you mean <i>Showers at Sunset</i>.

344
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,450
That was the prototype for <i>Egg of the Black Goat</i>.

345
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,730
Pro-type? Showers at Sunset? U-Um...

346
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,480
How do you read this?

347
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,540
That's "hydrangea."

348
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,450
Hydrangea? Like the flower?

349
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,180
Yes.

350
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,440
Th-Then, what about this one?

351
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,920
That's written like "thin ice," 
but pronounced "black ice."

352
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,670
"Black ice..."

353
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,240
But at other times, it can also be read as
 "lackluster" in more sophisticated terms.

354
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,430
There's a pretty ring to it, don't you think?

355
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,680
Yes!

356
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,430
Hydrangea...

357
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,430
That's admirable of you.

358
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,430
<i>Showers at Sunset...</i>

359
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,640
You're even diligently taking notes.

360
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,650
I-I don't go to school, 
so I write down the things I learn in here.

361
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,630
I see. I have an idea, Hinami-chan.

362
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,710
How about I teach you new words like this every now and then?

363
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,660
You mean it?

364
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,620
Yeah.

365
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,120
Onii-chan, thank you!

366
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,070
Okay, then how about this one?

367
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,130
That one is...

368
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,120
Seriously? Suits in the 20th Ward?

369
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,000
Definitely not your lucky day, huh?

370
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,540
Yeah. The 20th Ward is nowhere near safe anymore.

371
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,010
Damn, this stings!

372
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,940
That Gourmet guy has been on a rampage lately.

373
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,850
He must've grabbed their attention.

374
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,480
Did a Dove do that to you?

375
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,190
Nah, this is from something else.

376
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,120
Man, this is seriously killing me!

377
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,450
Man up, will you?

378
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,430
Get Doctor Fueguchi to have a look at you or some—

379
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,150
I guess what they say about shit 
sticking together is true, after all.

380
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,050
Yes.

381
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,620
N-No way...

382
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,480
Now then, I'm curious...

383
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,200
What kind of scum is <i>this</i> piece of shit going to cling to next time?

384
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,460
Good morning, everyone!

385
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:18,960
Morning!

386
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,460
N-No, there's no need to...

387
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,460
Morning!

388
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,880
Morning, Onii-chan!

389
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,540
Morning, Hinami-chan.

390
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,380
What are you smiling about, dummy?

391
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,720
Get back to work.

392
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,110
Welcome!

393
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,010
A most delightful aroma.

394
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,460
I really do feel more...

395
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,630
composed here.

396
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,840
Onee-chan, there's a bird on the veranda!

397
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,020
It must be lost.

398
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,630
It looks wounded.

399
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,190
We have to treat it!

400
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,480
Onee-chan!

401
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,420
Why are you running away!?

402
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,810
Wait up!

403
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,860
Onee-chan! Wait up!

404
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,230
I'm afraid of birds!

405
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,650
Maybe I should give it a name.

406
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,340
Its owner will probably show up soon.

407
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,490
But...

408
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,570
Fine then, we'll deep fry it.

409
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,760
Onee-chan...
