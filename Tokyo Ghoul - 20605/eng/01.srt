1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,940
CCG Base to 203,

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,860
we have reports of intruders in the 
Aqua Building located in the 20th Ward.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,900
Intruders are believed to be ghouls—I repeat, ghouls.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,920
All units are to proceed on-site immediately.

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,670
More! Give me more!

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,880
Delicious.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,520
I guess they weren't exaggerating 
when they called you a binge eater.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,860
You know, I hate it when 
people interrupt me during a meal.

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,110
I suppose you haven't heard of me then?

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,590
Of course I have.

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,780
You're a hopelessly dull person with abhorrent tastes.

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,790
I have my orders.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,820
I've been told to take you back alive.

14
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,890
But you know...

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,440
Before I do that, I think I'll help myself to

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,840
a couple of fingers, an arm, or maybe even a leg or two...

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,550
You don't mind, do you?

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,060
Such a small toy for such a big boy. I bet you like playing house.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,350
How adorable.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,230
Allow me...

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,980
to remove them for you.

22
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,450
Give them back...

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,670
Those are mine!

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,170
Give them back!

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm not going to play with you.

26
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,940
Several unidentified male bodies were discovered

27
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,400
early this morning in the Aqua Building,

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,900
a commercial facility located in Tokyo's 20th Ward.

29
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,690
What is assumed to be ghoul saliva was retrieved from the bodies.

30
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,410
The incident is being investigated as a criminal ghoul offense—

31
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,150
Is it actually that funny to you?

32
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,470
Come on. You can't be serious about 
going to a bookstore for your first date.

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,590
Why not? She might be thrilled, you know!

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,550
For your information,
 that's never going to happen. Period.

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,500
What? Fine then, how about I take her 
out to Big Grill instead, just the two of us,

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,520
and grab some burgers?

37
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,150
I'm being completely serious here!

38
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,880
No, no, it's great! That's so like you!

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,770
But when it actually happens, it'll be a total flop.

40
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,030
What, you don't think I can handle it?

41
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,780
What would <i>you</i> do then, Hide?

42
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,770
Listen up. When it comes to dates, 
you have to pick a place that <i>excites</i> the girl.

43
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,710
Right. Such as?

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,920
Huh? S-Such as...

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,750
You don't even know!

46
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,110
If I knew, I wouldn't be wasting my
 afternoon here having a date with <i>you</i>.

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,890
Predatory ghoul attacks in the 20th Ward 
have been on the rise these last few days,

48
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,890
I suppose that's true.

49
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,920
with CCG's 20th Ward Branch announcing an investigation

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,370
into the possibility of a single 
culprit for every incident so far.

51
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,430
That's pretty close, huh?

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,260
In other news...

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,190
So, what else have you got?

54
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,960
Who's the lucky girl?
 The cutie you were talking about?

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,730
Oh?

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,990
It's gotta be her, right?

57
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,730
No, it's not!

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,080
I mean, she's pretty cute too...

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,730
Excuse me!

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,190
One cappuccino, please!

61
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,200
And you, Kaneki?

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,860
I still haven't finished this.

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,860
One cappuccino.

64
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,550
While we're at it, what's your name?

65
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,740
Hide!

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,450
It's Kirishima Touka.

67
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,660
Touka-san! Are you seeing anyone?

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,390
Stop that, you idiot!

69
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,000
She's so cute.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,810
What'll I do if I end up getting kicked out!?

71
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,420
This shop is the only place where she and I both—

72
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,680
She's... the one.

73
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,260
Don't even go there.

74
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,290
It'd be just like Beauty and whatever with you guys.

75
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,700
The Beast!

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,400
Well then...

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Now that I've seen you lovelorn,

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,700
I think it's time for me to head off.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,210
Wait— Hide...

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,980
See you later, Touka-chan.

81
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,030
Keep your head in the clouds, Kaneki!

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,670
I guess you struck the jackpot this time.

83
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,630
Yeah. Who would've thought that
 she'd like the same novelist as I do?

84
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,190
Uh, what's-his-face, right? Takasaki Sen?

85
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,090
It's Takatsuki Sen!

86
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,600
We're going to hit the bookstore together this coming Sunday.

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,810
Oh, yeah? I'm still not convinced 
on the whole bookstore thing,

88
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,050
but you go and have a good time.

89
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,910
Yeah.

90
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,730
I have to say though. This sure is getting ugly.

91
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,710
That's for sure.

92
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,610
Rumors say that they'll be fine 
with eating just one person a month,

93
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,780
but these binge eaters are something else.

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,790
They're like a bunch of wild animals, eating everything in sight.

95
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,170
Ghouls as animals, huh?

96
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,790
On second thought, they're <i>worse</i> than livestock.

97
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,320
That's true.

98
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,140
Kaneki-san, what's your favorite work by Takatsuki?

99
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,250
It would have to be his debut book.

100
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,600
It was an instant bestseller after all.

101
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,100
A refreshing delicacy amidst all the clutter, you might say.

102
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,570
Y-Yes, exactly. To be blessed with that much writing talent, releasing a bestseller whilst still in his teens—

103
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,250
Are you all right?

104
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,070
I-I'm fine...

105
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,730
Er, I mean... That's...

106
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,040
Rize-san, you don't eat very much, do you?

107
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,540
Actually, um, I'm currently on a strict diet...

108
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,640
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

109
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,930
She's so refined...

110
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,150
Thank you very much for accompanying me today.

111
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,140
No, thank <i>you</i>. I-I had a great time.

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,690
Actually, I kind of live near the recent 
incidents that have been occurring lately...

113
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,400
Oh, you mean the ghouls?

114
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm quite squeamish when 
it comes to these sorts of things.

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,290
I can't stop myself from trembling 
whenever I think about it.

116
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,790
You'll be okay.

117
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,140
Please, rest assured. 
I'll make sure to see you home safely.

118
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:37,100
Right, so then Hide asked me,
 "Which do you like better, me or the novels?"

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,930
He sounds like quite the joker.

120
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,820
He sure is.

121
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,730
What was it that sparked your passion for books?

122
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,650
My dad left a lot of his books behind.

123
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,190
I lost him before I could barely even walk. 
I enjoyed the books he left behind,

124
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,170
so I spent a lot of my days reading 
while waiting for my mom to come home.

125
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,500
Then, ever since she passed away...

126
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,610
You know, Hide is the only one I've ever told this to.

127
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,260
Is that right?

128
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
It's this way.

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,580
Oh, okay.

130
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,940
Touka-chan, what's up?

131
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,270
No, it's nothing.

132
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,900
Well, we're pretty close now, so...

133
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,320
Rize-san...

134
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,280
Um, if you wouldn't mind, can we go out again?

135
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,540
Well, we <i>do</i> have similar tastes in books, and we share the same age...

136
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,940
There's a lot we have in common, huh?

137
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,260
Kaneki-san...

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,740
Y-Yes?

139
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,260
The truth is, you caught my eye.

140
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,030
I noticed you, the way you were looking at me...

141
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,880
Huh? Then, you're saying...

142
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,230
Yes.

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,900
I, too...

144
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,770
happen to have fallen head over heels...

145
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,150
for you.

146
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,260
Ah, how delightfully exquisite!

147
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,470
Kaneki-san,

148
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,970
there's something I like even <i>more</i> 
than reading. Would you like to know?

149
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,480
Tearing apart the luscious organs of someone 
who isn't trying to escape from me is <i>most</i> enjoyable.

150
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,680
Yes, that marvelous expression!

151
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,070
Would you kindly allow me to...

152
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,200
thrill myself even more!?

153
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,450
<i>No way! This can't be happening!</i>

154
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,330
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

155
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,640
Tag, you're it!

156
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,010
Kaneki-san!

157
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,640
I'm going to gently scramble up 
your intestines for you now, okay?

158
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,790
Oh, dead already?

159
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,790
What a shame. I really did like you.

160
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,920
You have just the right amount of fat on you...

161
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,420
All nice and soft. A pleasure to eat!

162
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,350
How... could...

163
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,160
this...

164
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,470
His abdominal organs are ruptured.

165
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,160
<i>What's going on?</i>

166
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,130
Commence operating immediately!

167
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,410
<i>Where... am I?</i>

168
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,960
<i>I thought I was on a date with Rize-san...</i>

169
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,170
Prepare for an organ transplant!

170
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,170
Without consent from his family!?

171
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,540
<i>Organ? Family?</i>

172
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,610
<i>What exactly are they talking about?</i>

173
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,640
Doctor Kano!

174
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,680
I will accept full responsibility!

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
Transfer her organs into him at once!

176
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,910
<i>It's warm...</i>

177
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,070
<i>Is this...?</i>

178
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,290
Something's not right... 
What the hell is going on?

179
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,640
Kaneki-san!

180
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,890
Is that all you're going to eat?

181
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,240
Oh, right. Your friend visited you again today.

182
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,490
Ah, Doctor Kano...

183
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,700
How are we feeling, Kaneki-kun?

184
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,720
I hear you haven't been eating 
much ever since your admission,

185
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,100
but there doesn't seem to be 
anything particularly wrong.

186
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,720
Um...

187
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,220
My tastebuds... don't seem quite right.

188
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,790
Tastebuds?

189
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,690
Everything just tastes like ash...

190
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,730
That might be a psychological problem in itself.

191
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,440
It was a serious accident after all.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,440
There's no rush.

193
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,360
Take all the time you need to recover.

194
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,760
I'll stop by again later.

195
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,600
<i>Nothing particularly wrong, huh?</i>

196
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,630
<i>It almost feels like the time I spent together with Rize-san</i>

197
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,640
<i>was only the product of some whimsical dream of mine.</i>

198
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,850
<i>But if nothing else, there's one thing I'm certain of...</i>

199
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,370
<i>Ever since then, something has been...</i>

200
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,100
<i>Something has been eating away at me.</i>

201
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,480
<i>Kaneki!</i>

202
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,540
<i>Congratulations on your discharge!</i>

203
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,620
<i>I present you with the finest leftovers my house 
has to offer, along with your favorite hamburger.</i>

204
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,300
<i>You better be grateful!</i>

205
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,570
<i>P.S. When you're up to it, come on back to school.</i>

206
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,360
<i>It's rough here on my own.</i>

207
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,410
Hide...

208
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,560
<i>Thanks,</i>

209
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,900
<i>but I'm sorry.</i>

210
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,670
Well, in the first place, a ghoul has no need for 
an appetite this large within such a short period of time.

211
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,680
Just a single dead body would ensure their survival for a month or two.

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,520
But Ogura-san, wouldn't the normal food that we eat suffice for ghouls as well?

213
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Absolutely not, as ghouls are only able 
to derive their nutrition from human organs.

214
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,730
Not to mention, their tongues 
function in a way different from ours, too.

215
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,910
Should they attempt to consume human food, 
they'd just be left with an incredibly awful aftertaste.

216
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,640
<i>Their tongues function in a way different from ours...</i>

217
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,410
<i>They'd just be left with an incredibly awful aftertaste...</i>

218
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,730
<i>No way...</i>

219
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,460
<i>I present you with your favorite hamburger!</i>

220
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,460
Hide...

221
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,650
Did you go out and buy this just for me?

222
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,830
This can't be happening...

223
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,570
A friend of yours?

224
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,280
Yeah.

225
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,070
He was supposed to be discharged today, 
but he isn't picking up his phone.

226
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,310
I even went to his place several times,

227
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,060
but he wouldn't answer the door.

228
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,750
I wouldn't even bother anymore 
with a rude brat like that.

229
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,670
Kaneki and I have been best friends since we were kids.

230
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,920
Best friends, huh?

231
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,190
Hey, Kaneki? How are you doing?

232
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,450
I was in front of the station 
and saw Takatsuki what's-his-face

233
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,740
signing autographs at the bookstore, so I thought I'd hit you up.

234
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,440
Anyway, give me a call when you're feeling better.

235
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,860
<i>People... So many people...</i>

236
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,800
<i>People... These are people...</i>

237
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,300
<i>Children...</i>

238
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,220
<i>People, more people...</i>

239
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,260
<i>Woman...</i>

240
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,260
<i>Flesh...</i>

241
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>Girl...</i>

242
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>Flesh...</i>

243
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,900
<i>Man...</i>

244
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,520
<i>Flesh... Flesh... Flesh...</i>

245
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,180
<i>Family...</i>

246
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,140
<i>Children...</i>

247
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,520
<i>Boy...</i>

248
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,350
<i>Flesh, more flesh...</i>

249
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,810
<i>Woman...</i>

250
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,650
<i>Child...</i>

251
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,690
<i>Flesh, I want flesh...</i>

252
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,690
<i>Boy...</i>

253
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,860
<i>Flesh, I need flesh...</i>

254
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,070
<i>Flesh, so much flesh...</i>

255
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,010
<i>Flesh!</i>

256
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,720
Hey, that man...

257
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,950
Don't get involved, idiot!

258
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,860
What the hell is this!?

259
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,880
I know what's happening!

260
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,350
<i>Transfer her organs into him at once...</i>

261
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,410
<i>Blades such as knives or kitchenware cannot hurt them...</i>

262
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,870
<i>If that's true...</i>

263
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,200
<i>If that's true...</i>

264
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,220
<i>If this is really true...</i>

265
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,430
<i>Then surely, this will...</i>

266
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,440
<i>What am I supposed to do now?</i>

267
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,630
Flesh...

268
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,030
Murder a human... and devour their flesh!

269
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,280
What am I— 
It's almost as if...

270
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,490
That scent...

271
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,080
<i>It's something I've never smelled before, but it seems so welcoming...</i>

272
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,920
<i>A sweet aroma, like Mom's home cooking...</i>

273
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,220
<i>There's something over there that awaits me, 
something that even I can eat!</i>

274
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,420
<i>Where is it?</i>

275
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,930
<i>Where is it!?</i>

276
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,270
It's close...

277
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,040
<i>A ghoul...</i>

278
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,580
<i>And a human!</i>

279
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,580
<i>How could I have been enticed here by the scent of a mangled corpse!?</i>

280
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,850
You're a ghoul... right?

281
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,840
What's the matter? Are you all right?

282
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,480
My name's Kazuo.

283
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,510
I haven't eaten for a while,

284
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,810
so I can't share too much with you, 
but here, help yourse—

285
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,730
Seriously,

286
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,110
how about you leeches back 
away from my hunting grounds?

287
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,990
Well, you're a face I haven't seen around here.

288
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,990
More importantly, where's your 
other red eye? That's kinda gross.

289
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,460
You know what happens when you get 
caught on someone else's territory, right?

290
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,960
N-No, I wasn't— I didn't know...

291
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,410
I just happened to be passing by...

292
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,840
Okay, imagine this.

293
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,220
Your girlfriend is naked and lying on the ground.

294
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,200
There's a guy there with his pants down, he turns around and says to you,

295
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,980
"I wasn't doing anything. I just happened to be here."

296
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,980
That's exactly what I'm getting from you right now.

297
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,980
If it were up to me, I'd blow his damned brains out.

298
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,190
That's why I'm going to kill you,

299
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,050
because you trespassed on my hunting grounds—

300
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,940
Whose hunting grounds did you say?

301
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,200
Since when were these <i>your</i> hunting grounds,

302
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,160
Nishiki?

303
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,000
Touka...

304
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,170
She's dead, right? That binge eating woman?

305
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,930
And that gives you an automatic claim to this area?

306
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,420
Now that Rize's gone, 
the responsibility of allocating hunting grounds

307
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,930
to the weaker ghouls and those at the 20th Ward

308
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,930
falls on Anteiku's shoulders.

309
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,590
Are you serious?

310
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,440
A bunch of fence-sitters like those of you at Anteiku have no right to make decisions for others!

311
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,400
This was <i>my</i> hunting ground before Rize came—

312
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Because you were too weak.

313
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,570
Getting told off by some younger, 
overconfident little punk really pisses me off.

314
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Does it now?

315
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,330
Enough is enough!

316
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,740
You'll have to cut deeper than that!

317
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,530
Are you sure?

318
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,220
Should I cut a little deeper next time?

319
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,580
Take your corpse with you, coward.

320
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,360
You want this?

321
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,660
You're not gonna eat?

322
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,170
Then again, only one of your eyes is like that...

323
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,420
You're the one who was with Rize.

324
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,670
Why weren't you eaten? Wait...

325
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,170
That eye...

326
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,180
Please, help me!

327
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,570
I know you're not going to believe this, 
but I swear I'm human!

328
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,680
And yet...

329
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,890
I desperately want to eat that...

330
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,550
I want to devour it so badly that it aches...

331
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,900
But if I do...

332
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,610
I won't be human anymore!

333
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,610
If you're in that much pain, then eat.

334
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,080
No way in hell!

335
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll never do it! No way!

336
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,080
There's no way I can eat something like that, right?

337
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,340
What is this? What is it to be a ghoul?

338
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,260
Killing people, killing each other...

339
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,220
I'm not like that!

340
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,350
I'm... human!

341
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,490
This is ridiculous.

342
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,810
Why don't you just give in?

343
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,980
If you don't have the nerve to eat...

344
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,900
then I'll give you a hand!

345
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,670
Yoshida Kazuo, 41-year-old ghoul.

346
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,680
Occupation: Fitness Club Staff.

347
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,510
On one of my days off, I received a hunting ground from Anteiku's Yoshimura-san.

348
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,980
So while I was at home, I sat my eyes on a target,

349
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,310
killed it,

350
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,690
and was about to eat it.

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,950
