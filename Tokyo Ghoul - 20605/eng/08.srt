1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,310
We're going to split up?

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,850
Yes. The waterway is rather extensive.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,410
Rabbit and Number 745.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,870
Nothing would be better than 
disposing of the both of them.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,950
Are you certain they'll show up?

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,030
My instincts say so.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,860
Very well.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,290
Let's head off then.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,500
Mado-san, what are those?

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,220
Some things are better left unsaid.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,460
Mom?

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,490
Touka-chan.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,780
Where have you been?

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,900
None of your business.

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,670
If there's anything that I can do...

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,880
There's probably nothing you can do at this point.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,800
Hinami?

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,710
Hinami!

19
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,970
Why?

20
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,290
Hinami...

21
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,940
Touka-chan!

22
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,970
No good. She's not here either.

23
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,930
Anything on your end?

24
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,950
Where could she be?

25
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,490
You don't suppose...

26
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,030
Where are we?

27
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,420
This is where Ryouko-san...

28
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,850
Hinami-chan.

29
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,970
Please, no more...

30
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,700
She's close!

31
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,760
Where is she?

32
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,670
Touka-chan?

33
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,750
That's...

34
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,050
The man from before!

35
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,090
This is bad!

36
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,380
Hinami!

37
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,430
That speed.

38
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,760
It's Rabbit, all right!

39
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,480
Who are you?

40
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,030
Hinami.

41
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,920
Hinami, what's that?

42
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,380
Mom...

43
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's get out of here, Hinami!

44
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,950
It's too dangerous to stay.

45
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,380
No!

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,390
Is it wrong for ghouls to live?

47
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,590
I want to be with Mom.

48
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,640
Take me there. Take me to where Mom is.

49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,020
I'm begging you...

50
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,780
Hinami.

51
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,250
I miss...

52
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,360
I miss Mom.

53
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
A friend of the Rabbit's?

54
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,020
I don't have time to entertain you. 
Why don't you step aside?

55
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,440
I won't let you pass!

56
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,780
How is that wound of yours doing, Rabbit?

57
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,540
Attempting to lead us out here with false stories is a pitifully cheap ploy.

58
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,340
Childish indeed.

59
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,800
Oh, that's right! Did you like the present I left you?

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,210
You must miss your dear mother.

61
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,510
You bastard!

62
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,890
Don't make light of me!

63
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,610
<i>I can't let him go.</i>

64
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,360
<i>I can't let this man get to them.</i>

65
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,740
<i>That is my...</i>

66
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,030
Going to take me seriously, are you?

67
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,500
In that case...

68
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,270
You're on a different level compared to the other small fry, aren't you?

69
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,440
Bounce around! Keep bouncing around,

70
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,780
you little gnat!

71
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,910
You can't use your weapon efficiently around here.

72
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,950
I've always had a question for you freaks.

73
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,430
You casually prey on innocent people and compulsively devour them.

74
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,890
Why does your kind exist?

75
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,880
The children whose parents have been killed...

76
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,850
The grief of those left behind...

77
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,770
The loneliness...

78
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,320
Have their feelings crossed your mind even once?

79
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,940
Answer me!

80
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,120
The terror of realizing that your life is being mindlessly preyed on...

81
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
Do you understand how that feels?

82
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,090
Having the people dear to you 
crushed like insects beneath your feet...

83
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,740
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,630
You piece of shit...

85
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,710
Rabbit murdered one of my friends.

86
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,760
Why was he killed?

87
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,300
Because he was an investigator?

88
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,320
Because he was a human?

89
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,600
Don't kid yourselves!

90
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,640
What reason did she have to take his life away?

91
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,230
Why don't you tell me the reason for Ryouko-san's senseless death!?

92
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,150
There's a lot of wrong in this world.

93
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,230
And scum like you are the reason for it all!

94
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,530
If it weren't for people like you...

95
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,500
Die!

96
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,590
Well? You know what this is, don't you?

97
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,350
It's your...

98
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,680
dearly beloved...

99
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,430
mother!

100
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,320
Quinques are made from a ghoul's kagune, after all!

101
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,030
You fucking bastard!

102
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,950
<i>Ghouls are stirring up trouble in this world...</i>

103
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,870
<i>Is that really true?</i>

104
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,790
<i>Was there a deeper meaning as 
to why Ryouko-san was killed?</i>

105
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,310
<i>What about Hinami-chan?</i>

106
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,640
<i>Hinami-chan also had the lives of 
those dear to her taken away, didn't she?</i>

107
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,350
<i>Ghouls have feelings too.</i>

108
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,520
<i>Just like humans.</i>

109
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,110
<i>Why can't humans see that part of us?</i>

110
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,490
<i>Why don't they try to understand?</i>

111
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,490
I'm not done yet!

112
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,110
<i>It's something so obvious.</i>

113
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,200
<i>It's something so simple.</i>

114
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,200
Tough nut to crack, aren't you?

115
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,110
<i>I'm the only one...</i>

116
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,690
<i>who realizes it.</i>

117
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,600
<i>The only one who can reach out to it...</i>

118
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
<i>Only me, the ghoul...</i>

119
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,990
<i>Only me, the human...</i>

120
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,440
<i>I'm the only one.</i>

121
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,180
No.

122
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,930
It's not the world that's wrong.

123
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,400
Sure, there are misguided ghouls 
who have chosen the wrong path.

124
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,790
But that doesn't mean it's the same for all of us.

125
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,510
We should learn more from each other.

126
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,930
Both humans,

127
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,970
and ghouls.

128
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,140
Ghouls aren't the only things wrong with this world...

129
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,670
It's you too.

130
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,110
What are you talking about?

131
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,980
You won't even try to understand?

132
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,480
In that case...

133
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,980
I'll <i>make</i> you understand.

134
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,820
You should make a fine tool indeed.

135
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,750
But really, the combination of these 
two parents make for a wonderful pair.

136
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,130
It was a pleasure to put both your mother and father down!

137
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,550
Stop it...

138
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,670
Now then, which one should I finish you off with?

139
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you filthy geezer!

140
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,470
What a dirty little mouth you have.

141
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,690
I said stop!

142
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,610
<i>What can I do to get through to him?</i>

143
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,640
<i>What can I do to make us see eye-to-eye?</i>

144
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,040
<i>We can't compete with each other.</i>

145
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,820
<i>We can't keep taking from each other.</i>

146
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,890
<i>Both humans,</i>

147
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,730
<i>and ghouls.</i>

148
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,700
<i>We have to break it.</i>

149
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,200
<i>This cycle of grief.</i>

150
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,200
<i>What should I do?</i>

151
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,160
That's enough!

152
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,580
I don't have time to waste on you.

153
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,590
Why, you...

154
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,090
<i>I mustn't let him pass.</i>

155
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,420
<i>If I can just do something about that...</i>

156
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,010
<i>But I don't have nearly enough strength.</i>

157
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,770
<i>That's right...</i>

158
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,050
<i>There's no way around it, is there?</i>

159
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,740
<i>If that's how it's going to be, then just this once...</i>

160
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,930
<i>I'll embrace you, the person within me...</i>

161
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,710
Rize-san!

162
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,510
<i>I feel like my appetite is going to consume me.</i>

163
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,240
<i>I'm slipping into an indulgent rampage...</i>

164
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
<i>But I won't lose sight...</i>

165
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,490
<i>of the person I am!</i>

166
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,010
<i>He's aiming for the Quinque!?</i>

167
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,340
<i>If I have this much strength...</i>

168
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,760
Don't take me for a fool!

169
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,610
<i>Now...</i>

170
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,080
<i>Now he can no longer fight.</i>

171
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,020
There's nothing I can do without my Quinque...

172
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,030
No!

173
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,820
If the foe is before you, even if it costs you your arms and legs...

174
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,490
Please, run away.

175
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,750
If this keeps up for any longer, I'm going to kill you.

176
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,910
Please...

177
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,670
Run away!

178
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,030
Don't you mock me! I would never run from a ghoul!

179
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,880
Hurry!

180
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,010
Go!

181
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,190
Please...

182
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,520
Don't make me a murderer.

183
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,780
Would you say the same thing if you were a ghoul?

184
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,490
What's so wrong about having the will to live?

185
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,000
If people are all we can eat, 
then what other choice do we have?

186
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,350
How are we supposed to lead 
a proper life with bodies like these!?

187
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,950
Tell me, how!?

188
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,920
Just die!

189
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,510
Die, die, die, die!

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,760
You can all fucking die!

191
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,220
All I want...

192
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,260
All I want is to live, just like you.

193
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,770
I can't bear to hear any more.

194
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,840
It's the end of the line for you!

195
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,560
No!

196
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,320
My Quinque...

197
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,490
is gone?

198
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,620
Or rather...

199
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,370
what's gone is my right hand.

200
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,380
Hinami?

201
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,390
Stop hurting Onee-chan.

202
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,680
Don't use Mom and Dad for something like that!

203
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Incredible!

204
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,130
Simply superb!

205
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,780
You've inherited only the best 
traits from your mother and father!

206
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
I want it!

207
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,990
Give it to me!

208
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,810
Hinami.

209
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,620
Finish him off.

210
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,690
I can't.

211
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,270
He killed your parents.

212
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,990
I don't care about that.

213
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,870
I don't care about revenge.

214
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,890
I'm just sad, that's all.

215
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,060
I miss Mom and Dad.

216
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm just really sad.

217
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,640
Mom... Dad...

218
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,920
It's lonely all by myself!

219
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,310
Outstanding.

220
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,210
Yes...

221
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,990
She belongs with the rest of her family.

222
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,050
She can belong to me as my Quinque!

223
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,330
Well, you've done it now...

224
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:34,300
Scum of the earth like you aren't even worthy of living...

225
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,970
Don't make me laugh.

226
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,080
I still have a score to settle.

227
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,560
Not until I catch him,

228
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,270
that one-eyed... And bury him myself...

229
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,350
I can't die yet...

230
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,240
<i>That ghoul...</i>

231
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,340
<i>Why did he let me go?</i>

232
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,020
<i>He was crying.</i>

233
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,730
It's hopeless. I can't control it!

234
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,310
God, no! Somebody help me!

235
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,930
Flesh! I need flesh!

236
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,330
If I don't do something...

237
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,110
Is there someone there?

238
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm awfully hungry right now.

239
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,820
You know?

240
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,190
I understand why Yoshimura-san has taken such an interest in you.

241
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,760
Now I, too, wish to see what 
you'll go on to do from here on out.

242
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,510
Come home, Ken.

243
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,150
Yomo-san...

244
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,510
What have I done?

245
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,270
Eat this.

246
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,550
You'll feel better.

247
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,150
You even wore gloves.
 Does the idea of touching us...

248
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,070
disgust you that much!?

249
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,300
Hinami-chan!

250
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,270
Touka-chan?

251
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,220
Is it okay to live?

252
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,680
Is it really okay for me to stay alive?

253
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,190
Hinami-chan.

254
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,290
Back then, I believe Ryouko-san

255
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,630
told you to live.

256
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,680
Good grief, I can't believe 
I actually kicked the bucket back there.

257
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,520
Amon-kun must be in a worrisome situation.

258
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,440
I wonder what kind of eternal rewards I'll get in the afterlife.

259
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,730
Man, this bathwater is great.

260
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,510
It sure hits the spot.

261
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,280
It feels so good, I might lose my head.

262
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,500
My head!

263
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,480
Sounds like someone's making a racket.

264
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,960
It's just your imagination.
