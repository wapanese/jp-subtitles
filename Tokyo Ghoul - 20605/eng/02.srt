1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,530
I said eat!

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,200
Why would you do something like that!?

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,760
How could I eat a fellow human's flesh!?

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,380
I'm human!

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,170
I'm not like you damn monsters!

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,390
Really, now? So if I'm a monster, then what does that make you?

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,430
Please, I'm begging you. 
Tell me, what am I supposed to do from now on?

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,700
Ever since that day, my life has been complete hell!

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,320
Hell, huh?

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,150
I want you to tell <i>me</i> something instead.

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,770
Tell me. What does cake really taste like?

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,330
I can't tell since I gag every time I look at it,

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,960
but it's something that humans enjoy eating, right?

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,460
Why don't you tell me what it's like to live a peaceful life?

15
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,470
One where you didn't need to live in fear of the CCG and other ghouls?

16
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,080
Your life has been hell?

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,690
Get over yourself.

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,770
Does that mean my entire life has been hell!?

19
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,230
Hey, answer me!

20
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm...

21
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,220
I'm human!

22
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,270
You're not a ghoul, that's for sure.

23
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,270
But then again, you're not a human either.

24
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,440
A half-breed like you has no place in this world.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,510
I'm... I'm...

26
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,720
If you're so hung up on being a human,

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
why don't you test how long you can go without eating?

28
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,070
I'm warning you.

29
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,200
Being a hungry ghoul feels <i>worse</i> than hell.

30
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,960
Touka-chan, I think that's quite enough.

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,480
Manager...

32
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,760
It's been rough for you, right?

33
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,210
Come with me.

34
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,890
But Manager, why?

35
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,970
Touka-chan...

36
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,720
It's our policy to lend a helping hand to ghouls in need.

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,440
Thank you for waiting.

38
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,310
Enjoy.

39
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,180
Do you not like coffee?

40
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,200
It's not that, but...

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,700
Kaneki-kun, take a good look at that coffee.

42
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,800
Any thoughts?

43
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,410
It looks quite inviting.

44
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,620
It's just a regular cup of coffee.

45
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,160
It's really good...

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,460
This is great!

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,950
But when it comes to food, 
I'm always left with a terrible taste in my mouth...

48
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,580
Through history, coffee has proven to be the only 
thing that we ghouls can enjoy alongside humans.

49
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,850
However, drinking coffee isn't 
enough to keep our hunger in check.

50
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,500
Which is why...

51
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,960
What is that?

52
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,580
If you run out, don't be afraid to ask for more. 
You're always welcome here.

53
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,710
Manager... 
Why did you help him?

54
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,600
Touka-chan,

55
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,060
do you remember the story about an organ
 transplant that's been on the news recently?

56
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,250
The one where two students were 
 crushed underneath some steel beams.

57
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,090
The doctor riskily decided to transplant the deceased girl's organs into the young man's body, who was barely alive.

58
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,280
But the girl that died in that accident was...

59
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,660
It was Rize-chan.

60
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,460
Wait. You couldn't possibly mean...

61
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,650
Yes. He is that very young man.

62
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,710
The doctor transplanted the organs of a ghoul into him.

63
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,460
But that's just absurd!

64
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,530
I've never seen anything like it before,

65
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,640
but he may be turning into one of us.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,860
Flesh...

67
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,550
<i>You're neither ghoul, nor human.</i>

68
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>A half-breed like you has no place in this world.</i>

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,750
Who cares if you're sitting on both sides of the fence?

70
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,710
Neither human, nor ghoul...

71
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,210
You're still you.

72
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,110
Cherish this life as a half-breed.

73
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,380
An appetizing meal of flesh awaits you, after all.

74
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,010
That lusciously alluring taste...

75
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,260
Just one taste, and you'll be instantly hooked.

76
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,580
It'll give any steak...

77
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,690
a run for its money.

78
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,020
Now, go on. Feast yourself on this flesh.

79
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,900
It's been prepared extra rare, just for you.

80
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,880
Hide...

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,190
Have you ever been to the sweets shop in front of the station?

82
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,900
That place has some good stuff, right?

83
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,800
Hey, Kaneki!

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,820
How long are you gonna skip classes for, you jerk!?

85
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,380
Pay more attention to me!

86
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,770
I'm hanging out on a limb here!

87
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,620
Hide, I'm sorry.

88
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,250
Anyway, what's with the eyepatch? You making a fashion statement?

89
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,600
I was so bored while you were gone that I ended up joining the school's festival committee...

90
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,860
<i>Wait, "I'm sorry"? When did I...</i>

91
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,630
<i>This all seems so familiar...</i>

92
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,560
Hey, Kaneki! 
How long are you gonna stay cooped up in your house?

93
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,480
Do you know how rough it is 
for me when you shut yourself in!?

94
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,800
Hello, earth to Kaneki?

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,210
Oh, sorry. What'd you say?

96
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,560
Anyway, I've gotta go see that arrogant 
upperclassman of mine to borrow some class material.

97
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,760
Wanna tag along?

98
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,910
Sure.

99
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,250
Kaneki, are you eating all your meals properly?

100
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,040
Huh?

101
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,640
You're looking pretty pale.

102
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,720
You better be eating, or else you'll fall sick.

103
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,390
<i>Hide's always been that type of person.</i>

104
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,000
<i>He has a strange way of noticing the small things.</i>

105
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,160
<i>He knows all too well how people feel on the inside,</i>

106
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,230
<i>but acts like he doesn't know instead.</i>

107
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,320
<i>If I were to throw away my humanity,</i>

108
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,530
<i>would I ever be able to walk next to him again?</i>

109
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,160
I've been meaning to introduce him to you, Kaneki.

110
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,350
You mean Nishio-san?

111
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,040
Yeah, him.

112
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,600
I wouldn't say that he's super rude or anything like that.

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,630
He's just a little difficult to be around.

114
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,010
Don't...

115
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
Here we are.

116
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,660
We're coming in!

117
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,970
Hide, at least knock.

118
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,670
Nagachika, ever heard of knocking?

119
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,850
Sorry, Nishio-san.

120
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,360
You know, nothing ticks me off 
more than a violation of territory.

121
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,040
Right...

122
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,490
Oh, this is Kaneki, the good friend I mentioned before.

123
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,990
I see.

124
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,540
I'm Nishio Nishiki, a second year in the School of Pharmacy.

125
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,960
Nice to meet you, Kaneki.

126
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,820
You wanted last year's material, right?

127
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,470
Yeah, I need to see the retail data.

128
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,970
Man, where'd it go?

129
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,030
Yeah, I think it's at home.

130
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,240
Are you for real?

131
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,510
Nagachika, why don't you come with me to grab it?

132
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,320
What, to your house?

133
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,190
Yeah.

134
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,130
Well, I guess.

135
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,590
Sorry, Kaneki, but you'll have to go home without me since I'll be with Nishio-san.

136
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,030
<i>Hide...</i>

137
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,760
Um, can I come with you guys as well?

138
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,940
What's up with you all of a sudden?

139
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,910
Sure, why not?

140
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,610
It's not like I plan on letting you guys in anyway.

141
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,230
Oh, that's fine then.

142
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,040
Let me just deal with this before we go.

143
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
So what's your deal today?

144
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,010
It's nothing.

145
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,320
Nagachika...

146
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,280
Yeah, what's up?

147
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,710
How much did you see earlier?

148
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,900
<i>Why do I keep running into ghouls wherever I go?</i>

149
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
Oh, er, just her shoulders.

150
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,900
Just your shoulders, he says.

151
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,480
They were very pretty.

152
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,650
<i>No, it's not that. They were always there to begin with.</i>

153
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,650
<i>I'm the one who wound up in this mess.</i>

154
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,540
Want one?

155
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,870
How nice of you.

156
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,830
Yes, step right up! These are freshly baked daily!

157
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,040
Here.

158
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,500
<i>Ugh, it's making me feel nauseous.</i>

159
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,320
Here's yours.

160
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,530
Thanks a lot.

161
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,630
Kaneki, are you in any clubs?

162
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,670
No. I'm not too good around 
large groups of people like that.

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
The exact opposite of Nagachika, huh?

164
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,600
<i>How can a ghoul eat something like this?</i>

165
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,090
This is really good.

166
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,380
All nice and crispy, too.

167
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,470
Kaneki, you're not gonna eat?

168
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,860
I'll save it for later.

169
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,880
<i>He blends in perfectly with human society,</i>

170
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,000
<i>carrying out his part as a normal college student.</i>

171
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,440
<i>That's pretty impressive.</i>

172
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,290
<i></i><i>I think it's safe to say that nobody suspects him of being a ghoul.</i>

173
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,090
It'd be pretty messy if anyone were to see this.

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Hide!

175
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,050
What are the chances of having a fellow ghoul on campus?

176
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,430
You sure do reek.

177
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,640
You smell just like a female ghoul!

178
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,060
You were going to have Nagachika for dinner, weren't you?

179
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,960
There's nothing quite like the look of pure anguish

180
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,200
that dances across their face as you betray the genuine trust they placed in you,

181
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
right, Kaneki!?

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm not like you...

183
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,040
Is that so?

184
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,050
Bratty little kids who talk back to their 
superiors happen to be a pet peeve of mine.

185
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,970
Actually, did you know?

186
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,680
You have an awfully squishy body.

187
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,220
I almost mistook you for a piece of tofu.

188
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,220
Man, this is gross.

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,190
Seriously, how do humans tolerate that crap?

190
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,020
I might as well be eating horse shit.

191
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,600
My bad, Kaneki.

192
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,620
I made a mess all over your mouthwatering meal.

193
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,080
You've known this guy for a long time, right?

194
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,580
You guys are best buds, right?

195
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,920
When were you planning to eat him?

196
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,560
Humor me, Kaneki.

197
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,800
Which part were you going to dine on first?

198
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,650
Hide... isn't something to eat.

199
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,970
Your foot... Remove it.

200
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,930
What foot?

201
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,480
Leave him alone!

202
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,690
Seriously?

203
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,360
What's that bag gonna do for you, 
you little girl? Bop me over the head?

204
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,560
You just don't get it, do you?

205
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,680
Humans are nothing but livestock, 
the same things as cows and pigs, no?

206
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,650
Do you enjoy befriending these 
bags of meat before you do them in?

207
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,800
I won't kill them...

208
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,110
I see. Then again, I think 
Nagachika is a pretty risky choice.

209
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,060
The guy is no idiot.

210
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,620
Even someone like <i>you</i> should realize 
his smarts are a threat to your secret intentions.

211
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,430
And this...

212
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,770
You can't even control your own eyes.

213
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,360
Come on, get up. Or should I kill Nagachika first?

214
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,160
Whoa, what's this now?

215
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,620
Here, try and dodge this!

216
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,200
All right, I guess the fun's over.

217
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
My kagune would've made short work of him too.

218
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,300
<i>There's no way... I can win.</i>

219
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,420
<i>Hide...</i>

220
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,680
Hide!

221
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,630
Oh? Great, you're up. Now that's more like it.

222
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,050
Better get a move on now, or I'll crush his skull.

223
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,890
Isn't he unconscious?

224
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,940
<i>Even now you're trying to save me, huh?</i>

225
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,440
See ya, Nagachika.

226
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,760
<i>No...</i>

227
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,700
<i>No!</i>

228
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,610
Hey. You're the one who's always 
alone with a book at school, right?

229
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,800
I-Is that a bad thing?

230
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,410
That's not what I meant.

231
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,720
I don't have any friends since I just moved here.

232
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,620
So, wanna be friends?

233
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,370
Sure, I don't mind.

234
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,550
All right! I'm Nagachika Hideyoshi.

235
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,630
You can call me Hide. Nice to meet you!

236
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,590
Y-Yeah. It's nice to meet you too, Hide.

237
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,510
<i>Even back then,</i>

238
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>Hide reached out to me when no one else in class would.</i>

239
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,390
<i>No...</i>

240
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,570
<i>I don't want Hide...</i>

241
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,770
<i>to die!</i>

242
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,740
That's... something I won't allow!

243
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,580
Damn you!

244
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,090
Stop! Stop that, you bastard!

245
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,260
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna fucking die!

246
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,130
That was... Rize's...

247
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,540
Damn it all to hell...

248
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,280
Hide...

249
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,740
Mm, he sure looks tasty.

250
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,500
Such a fragrant aroma. I'm getting hungry myself.

251
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,270
Here, do you see him?

252
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,790
Take a good look. Isn't he just scrumptious?

253
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,630
Stop it! Hide isn't food!

254
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,540
Are you sure about that? Take a closer look.

255
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,630
See? You understand, right?

256
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,670
Yeah. I understand.

257
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,260
He looks <i>really</i> appetizing!

258
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,080
No, stop it!

259
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,200
What are you talking about?

260
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,560
You want it so much that you can't stand it, right?

261
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,030
There's no need to hold back. 
You're not doing anything wrong.

262
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,620
Quickly, now. You should let loose with your desires.

263
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,660
My desires?

264
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,130
He's <i>all</i> yours.

265
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,760
All of him?

266
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,270
Go on now.

267
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,310
You're right. This is my special treat, isn't it?

268
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,680
I... I have to eat him...

269
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,980
Hide is my...

270
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,390
friend!

271
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,320
That's right! He is my friend, so I <i>have</i> to eat him!

272
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,030
Guess you didn't hold out long, huh, half-breed?

273
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,360
Your head's completely given way to your stomach, right?

274
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,790
Out of the way!

275
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,790
Not even your friend's life has value to you anymore.

276
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,960
Wanna know something?

277
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,120
Gobble this guy right up and you'll regret it later,

278
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,010
while drowning in a sea of blood and entrails.

279
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,720
Such is a ghoul's hunger, and our destiny.

280
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,290
You really are a hassle to deal with.

281
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,520
I'll play nice with you just this one time,

282
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,530
so make sure you go down nice and easy!

283
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,500
Touka-chan brought you back here.

284
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,090
Where's Hide!?

285
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,990
Come with me.

286
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,410
Hide!

287
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,380
I've been... consumed by my hunger this entire time.

288
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,140
At that moment especially,

289
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,280
I was so hungry I thought I might die.

290
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,390
I wasn't even aware of what I was doing.

291
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,140
And then, I went after Hide...

292
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,980
But right now, that's completely gone.

293
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,150
That blood that was in my mouth...

294
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,840
Please, give me an honest answer.

295
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,280
What did you do while I was asleep?

296
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,550
There is only one way to satisfy a ghoul's hunger.

297
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,240
You know what that is, right?

298
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,060
If you had starved for any longer,
 you would've pounced on your friend there.

299
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,800
You have to accept what you are.

300
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I don't want to hurt my friend.

301
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,260
That's why I can't be around Hide anymore.

302
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,660
But I can't enter the world of ghouls, either.

303
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:17,140
As someone who's neither 
human nor ghoul, I... am all alone.

304
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,540
There's nowhere I can call home now!

305
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,000
You're wrong.

306
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,000
You are both ghoul and human.

307
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,330
You are the one and only person who holds a place in both of these worlds.

308
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,950
Come over to Anteiku.

309
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,090
I'm certain that it'll lead you to
 a path where you can hold your own.

310
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,500
I also want you to understand us better.

311
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,550
To see whether or not we're just ravenous monsters.

312
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,430
How about it?

313
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,400
Why don't we start off by learning 
how to brew a delicious cup of coffee?

314
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,270
Well, um...

315
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Do you have faith in someone like me?

316
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,220
Great weather, huh?

317
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,520
The rain dulls their senses.

318
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
These working conditions are just right.

319
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,860
According to the 20th Ward's report,

320
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,860
there was an incident three months ago

321
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,530
concerning a binge eater in this very building,

322
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,090
as well as eyewitness accounts of Jason.

323
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,580
A binge eater and Jason, huh?

324
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,660
Interaction between two S-rated subjects?

325
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,850
Who knows? 
I doubt they were cordially sharing a meal though.

326
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,090
Mado-san?

327
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,930
Mado-san!

328
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,160
Amon-kun!

329
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,410
You see? I knew it!

330
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,620
If I had to come up with a drawback to this weather,

331
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,500
it'd be that I can't hear those shitbags' dying screams over the howling rain.

332
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,030
This tastes like horse shit.

333
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,270
Nishio-senpai, you know what horse manure tastes like?

334
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,910
What are you, Kaneki, a fool!? Of course not!

335
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,690
It's a simile! A figure of speech!

336
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,690
Oh, yeah?

337
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
What!? Nishio-senpai has eaten horse crap!?

338
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,050
Cow manure too!?

339
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,840
And every other kind of feces, it seems.

340
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,990
For real?

341
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,530
K-Kaneki?

342
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,010
Hey, Nishiki! How's that poo taste?

343
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,850
Nishiki-kun, you smell like poo!

344
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,350
You're a disgrace as a ghoul.
