1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,190
Help! Somebody!

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,400
Tsukiyama-san!

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,870
Thank God you're here!

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,650
Tsukiyama-san, help—

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,160
Kaneki-kun.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,360
Nice to eat you!

7
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,100
I heard there's another Dove prowling around these parts.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,930
How many have they sent out now?

9
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,590
I'm too scared to go out on my own.

10
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,470
The 20th Ward isn't going to be safe for much longer.

11
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,230
Kaneki-kun, I'm letting you off for today.

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,040
I've asked Kaya-chan to take over.

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,570
Oh, sure.

14
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,530
Where's Touka-chan?

15
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,510
She's feeling a bit under the weather today.

16
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,940
Kaneki-kun, why don't you pay her a visit?

17
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,450
Oh, but...

18
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,620
Touka-chan just lives a floor above us, after all.

19
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,000
Kirishima... Ayato?

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,450
Touka-chan, keep an eye on Hinami for me, all right?

21
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,200
Hinami! Play nice with your Onee-chan, okay?

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,680
Hello.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,990
Well?

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,440
To what do I owe the pleasure?

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,360
Um, I heard you weren't feeling 
well so I came to check up on you.

26
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,760
No "get well soon" gifts?

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,780
Uh, well...

28
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,140
Onii-chan, how do you read this?

29
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,410
Which one?

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,190
Let's see...

31
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,760
That's "sweet olive."

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,920
Is that a flower, too?

33
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,800
Yep.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,830
I'll put on some coffee.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,130
Oh, Touka-chan, I can do th—

36
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,210
It's fine.

37
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,410
You're helping Hinami out with her vocabulary, right?

38
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,380
But if you're not feeling too good...

39
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,550
I just ate too much.

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,430
You... ate too much?

41
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,250
<i> She wouldn't...</i>

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,950
No!

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,770
No!

44
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,710
No!

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,070
<i>Yoriko!?</i>

46
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,580
<i>What's she doing here?</i>

47
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,330
Yoriko, what's up?

48
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,850
Sorry for suddenly showing up like this.

49
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,780
I was worried since you missed school today, Touka-chan.

50
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,660
Oh, so you came to see me?

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,600
That, and...

52
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,900
No way!

53
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,530
Touka-chan, you couldn't possibly be...

54
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,050
Um, this is Kaneki, and he's...

55
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,140
Touka-chan, I made this for you.

56
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,430
Share it with him!

57
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,810
Hold on, you've got this all wrong.

58
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,610
Hey, Yoriko!

59
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,030
Er, have I done something I shouldn't have?

60
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,010
What are you going to do with all that?

61
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,930
Eat it, obviously!

62
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,300
Yoriko made it for me, after all.

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,770
But that's just going to worsen your condition...

64
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,050
Thanks for the food.

65
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,760
<i>She must be someone precious to her.</i>

66
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,520
<i>Oh, what to do?</i>

67
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,200
<i>What to do?</i>

68
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,030
<i>How best to prepare delectable Kaneki-kun?</i>

69
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,530
I've got it!

70
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,340
This transcendent feast...

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,820
requires third-party intervention...

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,780
in a maestoso venue,

73
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,290
with Kaneki-kun reaching a crescendo...

74
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,800
until at last, I arrive...

75
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,660
with a fortissimo!

76
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,310
Oh, Kaneki-kun...

77
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,550
<i>He got me good.</i>

78
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,750
<i>Yomo-san can really pack a punch.</i>

79
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,410
<i>Nishio-senpai!</i>

80
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,360
Why don't we kick things off by snapping his arms in two?

81
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,080
<i>After what he did to Hide and me...</i>

82
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,210
U-Um, excuse me...

83
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,680
Don't you think he's had enough?

84
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,750
K-Kaneki Ken...

85
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,270
Is this piece of shit called Nishiki a friend of yours or something?

86
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,920
Uh, I wouldn't exactly say that...

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,440
Oh, cool. So can you do us a favor and get lost?

88
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,070
We're about to cannibalize him, you see.

89
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,820
C-Cannibalize?

90
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,330
You wanna take me on, boy?

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
<i>He's a snail compared to Yomo-san.</i>

92
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,250
<i>Maybe all that training is starting to pay off.</i>

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,340
You little shi—

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
I hit him...

95
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,480
Screw you...

96
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,490
Playing the knight in shining armor...

97
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,800
Is this the place?

98
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,390
Nishiki-kun!

99
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,990
Where have you been!?

100
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,860
You're all beaten up again!

101
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,020
I'm so hungry it's driving me insane.

102
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,570
Let it go, Kimi.

103
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,980
But this guy is...

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,910
I know...

105
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,660
The shitty little brat who turned my insides out...

106
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,630
Kimi-san.

107
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,970
You're a human, right?

108
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,070
What are you doing with a ghoul?

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,430
I want him by my side.

110
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,740
Even though he takes the lives of other people?

111
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,040
As long as he doesn't harm my parents or siblings, I'm sure...

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,440
I'm sure that my feelings won't change.

113
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,230
He needs to eat, after all.

114
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,120
I... see.

115
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,620
Kaneki-kun, is there anything 
I can do to help Nishiki-kun!?

116
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,030
If he doesn't eat any flesh, then he'll most likely...

117
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,010
But what am I supposed to do about that?

118
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,390
Kimi-san, let me...

119
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,390
see what I can do.

120
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,260
Thank you.

121
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,930
<i>I must do everything in my power to help him.</i>

122
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,960
<i>I'll have to trust Kaneki-kun with the rest.</i>

123
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,670
Good evening, mademoiselle.

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,770
Now, if you would kindly lend me 
your assistance with a little something.

125
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,420
<i>It's locked tight.</i>

126
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,980
<i>I guess there really are humans who 
choose to stay with ghouls, despite the risks.</i>

127
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,460
<i>A rose and a note?</i>

128
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,230
<i>There's only one person who'd do such a thing...</i>

129
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,190
<i>Dear Kaneki-kun, let us share a 
most enjoyable dinner at midnight.</i>

130
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,670
<i>The woman you were speaking with 
earlier will certainly delight in your company.</i>

131
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,330
<i>How does a pleasant evening 
with just the three of us sound?</i>

132
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,780
Kimi-san!

133
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,550
Nishio-san!

134
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,320
Kimi still hasn't come home...

135
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,180
Damn it!

136
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,370
Why would Tsukiyama...

137
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,710
This is the worst.

138
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,220
Why did this have to happen?

139
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,140
Why!?

140
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm the one Tsukiyama-san is after.

141
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,830
I'll accept his invitation and bring Kimi-san back with me.

142
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,910
I'm coming with you.

143
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,850
In <i>this</i> state!?

144
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,050
What are you even saying!?

145
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,240
Don't be ridiculous!

146
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,740
You expect me to laze about at home 
when Kimi is caught up in this mess!?

147
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,850
I have to go.

148
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,800
Kaneki-kun,

149
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,900
are you perhaps a fan of Beethoven?

150
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,610
Tsukiyama!

151
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,260
Nishio-kun, I don't recall ever inviting you.

152
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,390
Give Kimi back to me!

153
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,410
Unfortunately, that's not going to be possible.

154
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,900
She shall add a dynamic spice, here at tonight's banquet.

155
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,960
I want Kaneki-kun to devour her 
tender flesh at its absolute prime!

156
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,460
What!?

157
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,720
To be more precise,

158
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,460
I'd like to delight in Kaneki-kun's 
flesh as he ravages her intestines!

159
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,470
Yes, that's what I want!

160
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,100
You queer piece of shit...

161
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,680
You're sick.

162
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,690
Sick? I must say, this is quite a shock.

163
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,810
Well, if that's how you really feel...

164
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,070
Kaneki-kun, everything I do is entirely your fault.

165
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,280
Take responsibility for your actions.

166
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,360
Do you realize just how deliciously tempting you are?

167
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,490
Nishio-san!

168
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,950
You can take it nice and easy over there.

169
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,740
Still horribly clumsy, I see.

170
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,290
You remind me of a newborn chick, waddling about.

171
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,560
Let me show you.

172
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,550
This...

173
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,260
is what you call a punch.

174
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,320
And this...

175
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,770
is what you call a kick.

176
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,890
Let's see, now.

177
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,860
What kind of attack would you like to stomach next?

178
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,480
How about <i>this</i> one?

179
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,950
Your plain, old, sneak attack.

180
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,450
Touka-chan!

181
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,170
My, my.

182
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,990
Things are certainly taking a turn for the worst.

183
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,490
Oh, how it's been so long...

184
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,960
since I've gotten a scratch.

185
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,250
I'm gonna put my foot so far up your ass 
that you won't be eating for a week, Tsukiyama.

186
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,510
What a dirty mouth you have there, Kirishima-san.

187
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,350
He's not hurt!

188
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,240
You used to be as sharp as a knife.

189
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,780
But you're just a dull blade now, it seems.

190
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,260
Otherwise, this injury would've 
taken longer than ten seconds to heal.

191
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,760
That was just a friendly greeting.

192
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,270
Instantly crushing you to a pulp 
would be extremely boring, right?

193
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,770
My goodness, you sure are a handful.

194
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,820
Though...

195
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,770
I suppose that's what makes you so cute.

196
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,960
Your reactions are as speedy as ever.

197
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,370
You were only fourteen back then,

198
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,420
and I was eighteen.

199
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,010
Those cold, piercing eyes of yours, 
like a pair of crystal shards...

200
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,160
are something I can never forget.

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,310
You sicken me.

202
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,430
I'm about ready to throw up here!

203
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,390
Yes, back in those days where 
I fell head over heels for you.

204
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,190
I refuse to be eaten as someone's fancy meal.

205
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,700
I'll be taking Kimi-san with me.

206
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,200
A splendid kick, Kaneki-kun.

207
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, deary me...

208
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,730
If memory serves me correctly...

209
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,580
Like <i>this</i>, no?

210
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,800
Well, then. I'll help myself to a sample...

211
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,270
Absolutely outstanding!

212
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,310
What a divine flavor this is!

213
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,320
Coalescing so passionately over 
my tongue, this profound harmony!

214
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,570
Oh, God! It exceeds even my wildest dreams!

215
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,070
But alas, now I seek even greater pleasures!

216
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,890
I refuse to let the curtains close 
on the luxury that is Kaneki-kun!

217
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,660
Finally, the time has come for me 
to play the part of a most gracious host!

218
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,020
The raw intensity you possessed 
back then was truly breathtaking.

219
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,620
But now, you're just a flickering flame.

220
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,590
Something has ignited the heat in your eyes.

221
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,510
What a shame, Kirishima-san.

222
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,390
That affection...

223
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,510
was something you really didn't need.

224
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,770
Touka-chan!

225
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,340
It's rude to interrupt one's dinner!

226
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,480
Stop it!

227
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,190
I'm the one you want to eat!

228
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,350
Have you forgotten?

229
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,040
I only want to devour you as you eat someone else.

230
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,790
How can you take the lives of other people so easily?

231
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,010
People's lives?

232
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,460
I'm an equal-opportunity carnivore.

233
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,530
Rather, when looking at life as a whole,

234
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,510
humans take far more than we do.

235
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,220
But unlike them, humans are the only things we kill.

236
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,980
What is this unflattering scar?

237
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,440
Kimi...

238
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,400
Nishiki...

239
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,450
No...

240
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,160
I really don't want to eat a person.

241
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,260
There's nothing we can do about it.

242
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,920
It's the same thing when humans eat cows or pigs.

243
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,170
But I feel bad for them.

244
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,660
Everything's going to be okay. I'll take care of you.

245
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,220
Work?

246
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,510
That's right.

247
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,230
We can't keep living like stray cats forever, right?

248
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,400
But still...

249
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,350
Don't worry! No one's going to find out.

250
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,620
Okay, I'm heading out!

251
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,850
Have a safe trip.

252
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,870
I'll be going, now.

253
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,000
See you later.

254
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,040
Well, I got fired again.

255
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,610
Not <i>again</i>.

256
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,370
What is it?

257
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,310
You've grown quite a bit, Nishiki.

258
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,790
You look just like Dad.

259
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,210
Who was that?

260
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,210
The manager at my workplace.

261
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,740
Which way did they go!?

262
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,150
Search the area over there!

263
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,640
Sis! Sis!

264
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,980
Stay with me, Sis!

265
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,100
Nishiki...

266
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,190
Keep on living, by yourself...

267
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,760
No! Don't you die, Sis!

268
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Don't you dare die on me!

269
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,910
Live...

270
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,710
So you're the one who turned her in, after all.

271
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,760
I-I beg you, spare me...

272
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,040
You reap what you sow.

273
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,380
For both you and Sis.

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,350
<i>There's no way I'll ever place my trust in someone.</i>

275
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,520
Hey, you.

276
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,610
Did you forget your change?

277
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,970
Huh? Oh...

278
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,400
Here you go.

279
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,530
Thank you very much.

280
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,950
<i>She was a pale-looking girl.</i>

281
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,610
<i>But who knows? Maybe she'll be useful in the long run.</i>

282
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,360
It's a pretty nice name.

283
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,290
Huh?

284
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,710
"Kimi," meaning "noble future."

285
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,420
Was it your mom or dad who gave you that name?

286
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,610
Hm? Hey...

287
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,880
<i>What? I just don't get it.</i>

288
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,620
Kaneki, you shitty little punk!

289
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,270
This wound isn't healing!

290
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,680
Flesh...

291
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,020
I need to eat some flesh!

292
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,380
Nishiki-kun?

293
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,780
Nishiki-kun! What happened!?

294
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,200
Is this blood!?

295
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,990
Boy, am I glad I reached out to you!

296
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,460
Flesh, let me feed on your flesh!

297
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,460
<i>Forget it... I don't have the strength.</i>

298
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,740
Nishiki-kun... You're a ghoul?

299
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,660
<i>It's all over now...</i>

300
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,360
<i>I'll get reported, and then it's lights out for me...</i>

301
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,600
<i>A death just like my sister's...</i>

302
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,970
<i>God, what a shitty life it's been.</i>

303
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,190
Nishiki-kun.

304
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,910
Did you know?

305
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,120
When I heard your voice calling out for me that day,

306
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,580
I had lost my mom, dad, and little brother to a fiery wreck.

307
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,500
I was so devastated, I thought I would rather be dead.

308
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,550
But you were there for me, Nishiki-kun. You saved me.

309
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,270
That's why...

310
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,110
it's okay. Live on.

311
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,910
I don't need any more.

312
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,540
What are you, stupid?

313
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,250
<i>I find it hard to place faith in the humanity of others.</i>

314
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,280
<i>But if it's someone like you...</i>

315
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,300
<i>then maybe being betrayed wouldn't be so bad.</i>

316
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,060
What <i>is</i> your deal, for God's sake?

317
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,270
You don't stand a chance 
against me without your kagune!

318
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,780
The strength of a ghoul largely depends on their kagune.

319
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,650
If your kagune is the engine, 
then a human's flesh is the gasoline!

320
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,960
A poor diet can only lead 
to an unsatisfactory performance.

321
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,030
It's... exactly as he says.

322
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,380
Touka-chan...

323
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,550
I didn't expect Yoriko's food to let me down here...

324
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,930
Now then, enough of the idle talk.

325
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,790
A persistent pest, aren't you?

326
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,960
Shut the hell up!

327
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,940
Stop bothering me! Stop bothering me! Stop bothering me!

328
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,780
Stop bothering me! Stop bothering me! Stop bothering me!

329
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,830
Let's get along, all right, Nishio-kun?

330
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,830
Nothing...

331
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,540
There's nothing else...

332
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,990
Kimi is all I have.

333
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,570
Nothing else...

334
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,300
If you ever lay a hand on her, I'll kill you...

335
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,710
Even if it costs me my life,

336
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,280
I'll fucking kill you!

337
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,650
At this rate...

338
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,930
A human's flesh is the gasoline...

339
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Fuel...

340
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,450
Touka-chan.

341
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,620
Who's stronger at full strength, you or Tsukiyama?

342
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,150
We were about even, a long time ago.

343
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,280
I have an idea, Touka-chan.

344
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,320
You're gone, now.

345
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,410
I'm just about this close to pulverizing you.

346
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,090
Tsukiyama!

347
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,130
Here I go.

348
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,670
Don't look.

349
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,070
He belongs to <i>me</i>!

350
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,770
He <i>belongs</i> to you?

351
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,230
Don't make me laugh.

352
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,660
There's not a single thing here...

353
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,000
that belongs to you.
