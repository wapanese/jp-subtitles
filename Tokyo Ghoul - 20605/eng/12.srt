1
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,970
Mom...

2
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,550
Mom...

3
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,560
Rize-san.

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,690
It's been a while, Kaneki-kun.

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,190
What's wrong?

6
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,820
You're all beaten up.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,900
How amusing.

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,330
The master has arrived.

9
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,850
How far have you counted?

10
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,020
Five hundred... and fifty-nine...

11
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,950
Five hundred... and fifty-two...

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,950
I'm going to fill this bucket up to the brim.

13
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,660
<i>Yamori had ordered me to count down in seven second intervals, starting from one thousand.</i>

14
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,660
Five hundred... and thirty...

15
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,210
<i>I didn't understand this order at first,</i>

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,210
Eight...

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,130
<i>but I now realize that it was 
an attempt to retain my sanity.</i>

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,590
<i>I held onto those numbers for dear life.</i>

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,590
Five hundred...

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,930
and twenty-four...

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,930
<i>And while Yamori took my fingers and toes,</i>

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>over and over, and over, and over,</i>

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,230
<i>and over, and over, and over, 
and over, and over, and over,</i>

24
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,440
<i>and over...</i>

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,230
Five hundred...

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,230
<i>and over...</i>

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,440
and ten...

28
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,360
<i>Each time my fingers and toes grew back,</i>

29
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,370
Five hundred...

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,030
<i>I knew that I had become a monster.</i>

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,290
Good morning.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,210
Rize-san? You're alive?

33
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,170
Things like that don't really matter now, do they?

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,090
Tell me, Kaneki-kun. 
What kind of person was your mother?

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,010
You called me "Mom" a moment ago.

36
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,930
Is that her?

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm home!

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,960
Welcome back.

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,170
Is that you, Kaneki-kun?

40
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,420
Come look at this, Mom.

41
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,300
Well, aren't you adorable?

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,340
What does this say?

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,930
What's that you're doing over there?

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,010
She would always help me out with kanji I couldn't read,

45
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,890
and carefully write down the pronunciation for me.

46
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,400
Where is she going?

47
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,450
To work.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,620
Whose room is this?

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,370
It was my dad's reading room.

50
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,580
What was he like?

51
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,750
I don't know.

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,880
He passed away before I could even remember.

53
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,340
All I know is that my love for literature came about

54
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,390
because of the books he left behind.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,680
Wasn't it lonely for you, being all by yourself?

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,060
Well, I had my dad's books and my mom's kindness.

57
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,030
She was an amazing person.

58
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,530
She did all the housework and 
always managed to put food on the table.

59
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,780
She always wore a smile and 
never caused trouble for others.

60
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,040
She treated everyone with kindness.

61
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,580
My mom was my pride.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,090
Ken. It's okay to feel pain.

63
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,170
Nice boys like you can find happiness despite all that.

64
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,100
It's better to be hurt than to hurt others.

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,770
Kind people are able to find happiness with just that.

66
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,310
That's what she taught me.

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,900
She was a kind and wonderful person, huh?

68
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,610
That's why you're caught up in this mess.

69
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,990
You're a fine one, Kaneki-kun.

70
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,330
Would you like to know why 
I'm so... personal toward you?

71
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,670
I don't know if you've realized this or not,

72
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,340
but you have remarkable regenerative abilities.

73
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,300
And it's all thanks to Kanou's experiment.

74
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,100
He turned you into a ghoul using Rize.

75
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,930
One-eyed.

76
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,480
Rize's scent.

77
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,270
That's who you are, Kaneki-kun.

78
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,650
Have you heard of the red-headed Chinese centipede?

79
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,700
I feel like letting it wriggle around in your ear.

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,830
You don't mind, do you?

81
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,830
N-No... Don't... Please, I beg you.

82
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,750
No... I don't want it! Don't!

83
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,790
Stop... Stop!

84
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,970
Oh, no! How fascinating!

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,050
I want to kill you! I want to eat you!

86
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,810
Kill you... I'm gonna fucking kill you!

87
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,350
It's okay if I kill you now, right? Am I allowed to eat you now?

88
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,270
You want me to kill you!?

89
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,900
You want me to eat you!?

90
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,870
Kill me... Please, kill me...

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,830
It's better to be hurt than to hurt others.

92
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,090
Have you been living your entire life believing that lie?

93
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,550
That's what my mom taught me. That's why...

94
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,010
So you thoughtlessly hung onto her every word?

95
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,970
You can't be serious.

96
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,430
How dull.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,310
Don't you want him to burn in Hell?

98
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,810
Are you sure your mother was the kind 
and wonderful person you thought she was?

99
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,610
What's that over there?

100
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,450
An allowance.

101
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,950
For who?

102
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,330
My mom's sister.

103
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,870
She would always whine about financial difficulties,

104
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,620
and ask my mom for money.

105
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,090
Laboring part-time during the day, collecting garbage by night,

106
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,710
and working at home during her free time.

107
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,300
Mom never stopped working.

108
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,470
Mom?

109
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,390
Are you okay?

110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm fine.

111
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,020
And then?

112
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,280
And then...

113
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,330
She overworked herself.

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,870
And I was left all alone.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,960
There wasn't a place I could call home anymore.

116
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,670
Hey, Kaneki! How long are you 
gonna stay in that house of yours?

117
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,300
Do you know how rough it is for me when you shut yourself in!?

118
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,300
<i>Oh, right... There was just one.</i>

119
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,970
<i>There was just one place I could go.</i>

120
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,770
Kaneki, if you were a ghoul,
would you eat Yoshikawa from Class 2?

121
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,980
The one you like so much?

122
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,100
N-No, I wouldn't!

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,770
And I don't like her <i>that</i>  much.

124
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,360
Hide was the only moral support I had.

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,530
He's a dear friend, isn't he?

126
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,120
But you're going to lose him too, aren't you?

127
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,410
And it'll all be your fault.

128
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,220
"All suffering in this world is born 
from an individual's incompetence."

129
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,720
The person who told me that was a real piece of shit.

130
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,310
But right now, I'm grateful to him.

131
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,270
I've come to understand something 
rather well these last few days, Kaneki-kun.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,150
Never mind your physical capabilities,

133
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,950
your mental fortitude is unexpectedly tough as well.

134
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,910
So I came up with a little plan to test that resolve.

135
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,580
A man and woman,

136
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,630
who love each other very much!

137
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,220
You'll decide which one of them dies!

138
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,680
Up until now, I've let these two look after you.

139
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,020
You were hanging onto that sliver of hope that help was coming, right?

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,770
You saw these two as your saviors, right?

141
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Which one will it be?

142
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,070
If you don't choose, I'll kill them both.

143
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,450
Wait, let me rephrase that.

144
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,120
Which one do you want to save?

145
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,960
Why... me?

146
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,510
Why do I have to be the one that decides?

147
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,050
Come on now. Hurry up and choose.

148
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,180
I can't be the one that decides something like that!

149
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,020
Wouldn't that just be the same as me murdering them!?

150
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,650
Pick one! Pick one! Pick one! Pick one!

151
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,780
The man? Or the woman?

152
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,650
Right? Or is it left?

153
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,610
Pick one!

154
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,290
There's no way I can pick one! 
If you have to kill someone, kill me!

155
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,080
I see. Very well.

156
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,550
Watch closely, now.

157
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,470
This one? How about this one!? No?

158
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,140
Come on! Pick one! I said pick one!

159
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,690
She's gonna die! Well, Kaneki?

160
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,690
Come on! Come on! Pick one! Pick one!

161
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,200
Well!? How about it!?

162
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,450
Well!?

163
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,700
Pick me, Kaneki-san!

164
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Haru... Haru's going to die!

165
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,960
Pick me! Me! Pick me, Kaneki!

166
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,270
She broke, didn't she?

167
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,360
It's all <i>your</i>  fault.

168
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,440
I-It's not my...

169
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,920
No... It's all my fault.

170
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,660
It took you that long to realize it?

171
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,600
You'll just sit there and blame yourself over and over,

172
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,940
but that won't change anything.

173
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,110
You don't try to change. It's<i> all</i>  your fault.

174
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,400
That's only to be expected, right?

175
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,070
Whose fault is it that things ended up like this?

176
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,620
Coincidence? An accident? Fate?

177
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,600
There's no such thing as fate.

178
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,710
It's simply a combination 
of one circumstance and the next.

179
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,840
And who is it that creates those circumstances?

180
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,920
Who is it?

181
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,090
It's you.

182
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,180
"All suffering in this world is born 
from an individual's incompetence."

183
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,640
He's right, isn't he?

184
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,940
This mayhem began because you were 
foolishly naive to the ways of the world.

185
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,570
You were a fool, and I easily tricked you.

186
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,740
The doctor played around for a bit, 
and now we're one and the same.

187
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,580
It's <i>all</i>  because of you.

188
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,790
It's better to be hurt than to hurt others.

189
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,290
That's why you're caught up in this mess.

190
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,800
If only you were strong enough to kill Yamori,

191
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,920
those two would have been spared.

192
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,890
If only you had chosen the man, 
the woman would have been spared.

193
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,350
If only you had been strong at that moment.

194
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,940
Ryouko-san.

195
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,360
S-Stop it!

196
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,910
But there's more to come...

197
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,620
Touka-chan...

198
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Hinami-chan...

199
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,630
The one you hold most dear...

200
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,300
Hide!

201
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,220
You're a monster.

202
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,560
N-No... I'm...

203
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,480
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,070
You failed to choose, like you always do. That's why...

205
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,240
this... happens.

206
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,330
You see? This is the path that you chose.

207
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,290
It's the future that you chose.

208
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,330
Why are you crying?

209
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,250
Why are you sobbing?

210
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,130
You chose to be hurt rather than to hurt others, right?

211
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,380
You're kind and wonderful.

212
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,060
It may seem like you're choosing both, but, really, you're forsaking both.

213
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,230
Your mother was the same.

214
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,230
If only she had turned her insufferable sister away,

215
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,610
she wouldn't have died from wearing herself out.

216
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,270
Stop.

217
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,320
What a foolish mother.

218
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
If she truly loved you,

219
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,860
then she should've abandoned her worthless sister.

220
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,700
Stop it.

221
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,910
Deep inside, that's what you truly wished for, right?

222
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,130
Mom...

223
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,470
Why?

224
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,760
Why did you leave me all alone?

225
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,310
I miss you... I don't want to be on my own.

226
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,270
I wish... I wish you would have chosen me!

227
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,440
I wish you had lived for my sake!

228
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,360
Even if it meant forsaking your aunt?

229
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,690
Even if it meant that!

230
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,570
Even if it meant hurting someone?

231
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,820
Even if it meant that!

232
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,320
Even if it meant taking her life?

233
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,620
Even if it meant that!

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,330
Good boy.

235
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,670
That's right, Kaneki-kun.

236
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,760
There comes a time when you have to forsake something in order to preserve the other.

237
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Your mother couldn't do that.

238
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,550
That's not kindness.

239
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,100
That's just being weak.

240
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,270
She didn't have the strength—the resolve to turn her back.

241
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,480
Will you allow yourself to be hurt any longer?

242
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,050
Are you going to let Yamori get his way?

243
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,030
No... I won't!

244
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,620
As soon as Aogiri strengthens their ranks,

245
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,250
they'll wreak havoc in the 20th Ward sooner or later.

246
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,170
I won't allow that to happen.

247
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,260
Your dear friend Hide, and your companions at Anteiku

248
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,680
might be exposed to the 
same tragedy that happened here.

249
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,020
I'll spare no mercy for anyone who tries to take my home from me.

250
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,360
Do you have that kind of strength?

251
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Yes.

252
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,120
Are you saying you accept me?

253
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,540
No. I'm not saying that.

254
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,130
I can surpass you at any time.

255
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,810
Are you sure you're not making the wrong choice?

256
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,980
I'm not the one who's wrong.

257
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,610
What's wrong...

258
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,070
is this world!

259
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,820
That will do...

260
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,280
Kaneki-kun.

261
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,370
To live is to devour others.

262
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,170
Eat.

263
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,940
<i>I am... a ghoul.</i>

264
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,520
Kaneki-kun.

265
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,360
Our special time together has nearly come to an end.

266
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,110
The Doves are closing in.

267
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,360
It's my job to take care of them, you see.

268
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,120
It's Aogiri's goal to eliminate 
anyone standing in their way.

269
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,330
Not only does that include humans, but ghouls, as well.

270
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,380
The ghouls who stand against Aogiri's cause...

271
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,550
are the very ones you work with—Anteiku, was it?

272
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,050
They are also one of Aogiri's...

273
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,770
targets for elimination.

274
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,270
Kaneki! Let me take more from you!

275
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,400
Now that we're at the end of the line, let me devour you!

276
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,700
How amusing.

277
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,200
You really are a trivial man.

278
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,300
Exceptional until the very end!

279
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,720
Let me remove them for you!

280
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,180
Fuck you.

281
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,610
That's foul.

282
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,780
Wh—

283
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,110
Y-You...

284
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,530
bit me?

285
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,950
Almost like the intestines of
a fish on the verge of spoiling.

286
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,380
I'm not letting go!

287
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,890
You think something like that would hurt, 
after all I've been through?

288
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,350
Kill you... I'll kill you!

289
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,980
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

290
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,900
I'll devour you! I'll make a sloppy mess out of you!

291
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,570
I'll kill you!

292
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,360
I'll tear you apart, limb from limb!

293
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,330
Kaneki!

294
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,830
Now...

295
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,620
it's my turn.

296
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,600
Count backwards from one thousand by sevens.

297
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,110
I'll ask again.

298
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,740
Count backwards from one thousand by sevens.

299
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,780
Count backwards from one thousand by sevens.

300
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,590
N-Nine hundred... and ninety-three...

301
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:33,510
N-Nine hundred... and eighty-six...

302
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:42,060
Nine hundred... and seventy-nine...

303
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,730
Nine hundred and seventy-two...

304
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,110
Nine hundred and sixty-five...

305
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,230
You tried to devour me.

306
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,990
So you won't mind

307
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,740
if I eat you, will you?
