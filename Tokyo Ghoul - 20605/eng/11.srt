1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,070
<i>I can't afford to lose here!</i>

2
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

3
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,180
I don't want him here. 
He has no intention of helping Kaneki!

4
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,850
Our chances of successfully rescuing 
Kaneki-kun will increase if we bring him along.

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,650
We would have less to worry about with him around.

6
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,150
How the hell are you even alive?

7
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,740
"Eat yourself." 
I simply followed the advice you gave me.

8
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,950
As you can see, that turned out rather well.

9
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,290
And, unexpectedly enough,

10
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,920
I happen to taste pretty good.

11
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,170
Whatever the case, I'm still against this.

12
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,380
This guy just wants to eat Kaneki!

13
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,920
You need not worry about that.

14
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,930
I'll look after him. 
He won't try anything under my watch.

15
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,850
Yomo-kun, any movement from the CCG?

16
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,100
It seems like they're ready to mount 
an attack once all civilians have been evacuated.

17
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,940
We will rescue Kaneki-kun 
by using the CCG's attack as cover.

18
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,440
Are there any objections?

19
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,030
Kaneki...

20
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,580
Finally awake?

21
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,460
Isn't my room nice?

22
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,090
Tatara-san said he had no use for you,

23
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,640
so I went ahead and claimed you for myself.

24
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,770
I couldn't be happier.

25
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,980
I've been dying to have you as company...

26
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,020
Right from the moment we met.

27
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,320
No.

28
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,150
Since before we even met.

29
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,660
So please, try not to disappoint me.

30
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,330
RC inhibition fluid.

31
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,090
When it enters a ghoul's body,

32
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,300
all kagune activity is suppressed.

33
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:08,640
As soon as that happens, their body becomes vulnerable and my scalpel can slice through them with ease.

34
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,640
Almost as if...

35
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,770
they were a mere human.

36
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,230
While ghouls are immune to 
hypodermic needles for the most part,

37
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,190
there <i>is</i> one place a needle will pass through.

38
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,110
And that...

39
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,160
is the mucosa!

40
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,040
Here's our current situation:

41
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,920
It's been two months since 
the shopping mall was first occupied.

42
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,920
From what we've gathered, 
there are about five hundred ghouls within the premises.

43
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,380
Their forces have substantially 
increased within the past week.

44
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,010
Once the first mission starts...

45
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,010
<i>Mado-san.</i>

46
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,220
Here.

47
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,640
What's inside?

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,760
A present from Mado.

49
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,060
He wanted you to use it.

50
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,730
Team A will rendezvous at the main entrance.

51
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,600
Take it.

52
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,270
Next, Teams B and C will proceed to the annex.

53
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,270
<i>I'll treasure it.</i>

54
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,320
Units are to move in at their own discretion as soon as ground conditions have been verified.

55
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,200
Civilian evacuation has been completed.

56
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,830
All units, move out!

57
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,490
Yes, sir!

58
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,130
The CCG and the police are 
preparing to raid the 11th Ward

59
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,090
with a total of over a thousand men.

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,350
The leader on-scene is Special Investigator Marude ltsuki,

61
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,020
the same man who located the ghoul organization's base.

62
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,980
Ninety-nine percent of our force will be devoted to ensuring the safety of everyone's lives.

63
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,990
The remaining one percent shall be made up from everyone's support and cooperation.

64
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,570
Let us unite!

65
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,320
We shall take back the peace in the 11th Ward!

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,200
That was Special Investigator Marude.

67
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,990
Now, back to the studio.

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,410
<i>Kaneki...</i>

69
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,830
Where are you in the count now?

70
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,630
Five hundred and fifty-nine...

71
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,470
I'll be back after they regrow.

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,090
Five hundred and fifty-two...

73
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,390
Five hundred and forty-five...

74
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,390
Clean that mess up.

75
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,390
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,810
Kaneki.

77
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,440
Banjou... san?

78
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,400
I promise I'll find a way to get you out of here.

79
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,410
Just hang in there.

80
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,910
Why... me?

81
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,620
I heard that Rize-san is dead.

82
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,420
You didn't tell me in order to spare my feelings, right?

83
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,050
You're a good guy.

84
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,380
Shu and Haru will be taking over for me. 
You can trust them.

85
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,010
If anything happens, you tell them.

86
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,600
Kaneki, hang in there.

87
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,500
Is everything ready?

88
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,160
Uta-san! You're coming with us?

89
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,170
Of course.

90
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,920
Kaneki-kun is a valued customer of mine, after all.

91
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,050
I assume we're all here?

92
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,220
Let's go.

93
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,140
Is there something wrong?

94
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,230
What were your thoughts after 
going up against this guy, Amon?

95
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,150
He's not like any ghoul I've met before.

96
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,910
He had a distinct sort of vibe.

97
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,620
This was before they started calling him Jason.

98
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,460
He was arrested by the CCG and detained at the Cochlea Ghoul Internment Center.

99
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,090
While there, a certainâ€” 
Well, how should I say this?

100
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,550
A rather conflicted Investigator was assigned to him, you see.

101
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,340
Five hundred and fifty-nine...

102
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,600
Five hundred and fifty-two...

103
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Let me take more!

104
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,060
Five hundred and forty-five...

105
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,310
Allow me to remove them all for you!

106
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,030
He was the subject of intense torture,

107
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,030
which led him to create another personality within himself.

108
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,280
For the sake of his survival.

109
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,490
And soon after that,

110
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,830
he broke out.

111
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,300
Ever since then, acts of savagery have been something he takes delight in.

112
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,760
It reflects the torture that he personally withstood.

113
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,100
The name "Jason" came around soon after that as well.

114
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,570
That was sooner than we thought, huh?

115
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,980
Yeah.

116
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,150
Bin Brothers, you're in the main building.

117
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,990
Understood.

118
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
Kirishima, the annex.

119
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,950
Right.

120
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,910
We're going, Eto. 
Take it from here, Noro.

121
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,290
Where's Yamori?

122
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,410
Beats me.

123
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,500
Who knows where he's wandered off to?

124
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,170
That bastard. At a time like this, too.

125
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,050
The weak are trampled upon,

126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,430
overrun,

127
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,430
violated,

128
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,010
and afflicted.

129
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,270
Stop... D-Don't...

130
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,310
It's unusually quiet.

131
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,530
Two hundred and twenty-three...

132
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,990
Two hundred...

133
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,090
How are we being outgunned!?

134
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,300
The enemy is using kagune shields and scopes!

135
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,890
Former soldiers, huh?

136
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,930
Damn it! 
You've gotta be kidding me!

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,520
Give me that!

138
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,110
Take out that insidious sniper nest immediately!

139
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,070
Here.

140
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,110
Amazing...

141
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,280
What's that?

142
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,910
Your motorcyle, Marude-san.

143
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,160
Hold up! 
What are you doing with my bike!?

144
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,870
I'll be borrowing this!

145
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,670
Hold it!

146
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,010
Hey... Hey, now. You can't be serious.

147
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,850
W-Wait a second. W-W-Wait!

148
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,020
Yahoo!

149
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,680
Good evening!

150
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,690
Good evening!

151
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,400
Good evening!

152
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,120
Move in!

153
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,430
Hey, which team are you with!?

154
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,060
Anteiku.

155
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,520
Incoming at three o'clock.

156
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
Ten of them!

157
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,730
Hitting them with the Emerio!

158
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,030
Ten at nine o'clock!

159
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,370
Hirako.

160
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,000
South entrance block secured!

161
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,260
Keep an eye on our perimeter.

162
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,970
This is Shinohara.

163
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,380
We've secured the main building and second-floor entrance.

164
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,390
Awaiting instructions.

165
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,970
Divide into three units. 
Take the interior and the parking lot from below.

166
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,230
You should be able to rendezvous on the top floor.

167
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,600
Copy. Also, I don't see Suzuya around.

168
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,320
I can't let him die until he reimburses me for my bike.

169
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,610
Send somebody to find him.

170
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,360
Copy.

171
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,780
Hang in there!

172
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,410
Hang in there, hang in there, hang in there!

173
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,030
Hang in there, hang in there, hang in there!

174
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,040
Hang in there, hang in there, hang in there!

175
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,370
You can do it!

176
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,580
Don't die on me now...

177
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,680
It's too cruel.

178
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,650
Thank... you.

179
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,070
Kaneki-san. Banjou-san told us to bring you a message.

180
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,160
"I promise we'll save you, so don't give up."

181
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,960
All right, Kaneki-san. We'll be back later.

182
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,540
We'll definitely get you out of here.

183
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,100
<i>Kaneki, where are you?</i>

184
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,690
Is that...?

185
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,980
Hold it!

186
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,820
What are you doing here,

187
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,120
Rabbit!?

188
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,040
<i>Is he the guy from back then?</i>

189
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,700
Mado-san...

190
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,080
Fire! Fire!

191
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,250
What!?

192
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,590
Fire! Fire!

193
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,980
Up there!

194
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,200
It's no use!

195
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,290
It's not working!

196
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,000
They're closing in faster than I thought.

197
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,790
Their footsteps are...

198
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,500
It's all right.

199
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,130
It sounds like they all made it in successfully.

200
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,130
That's amazing, Irimi-san.

201
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,550
I'm sure you'll be able to do it one day, Hinami-chan.

202
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,520
Kaya-chan, how are the CCG's movements?

203
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,900
They've split into three forces. CCG has the upper hand.

204
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,320
It looks like there's no other choice.

205
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,030
We'll need to buy them a little time.

206
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,030
Kaya-chan. I'm leaving Hinami-chan in your hands.

207
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,870
Right.

208
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,500
You! At last!

209
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,500
<i>Was he really this strong?</i>

210
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,630
<i>Why is he going to such lengths?</i>

211
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,680
<i>Is it because of me?</i>

212
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,980
<i>I don't have time for him right now!</i>

213
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,440
You won't get away!

214
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,070
Who was that other one just now?

215
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,700
Hey.

216
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,830
That was combo number three.

217
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,830
He's pretty tough.

218
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,580
The S-rated... Bin Brothers.

219
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,250
Who are you?

220
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:19,260
Following my nose, the strongest aroma 
seems to have brought me to you, Mr. High C.

221
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,720
Keep your guard up.

222
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,060
This is no ordinary ghoul.

223
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,060
What a charming mouth.

224
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,440
Allow me to give you a passionate kiss.

225
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,610
Let's go!

226
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,330
<i>Fighting solo against two S-rated?</i>

227
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,960
<i>Can I take on something like this, Mado-san?</i>

228
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,050
Amon-kun, how do you think a human of inferior physique

229
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,680
can win in a fight against a ghoul?

230
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,560
I'd say that a solid buildup of strength and stamina would be vital.

231
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,190
That's true.

232
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,070
But in a face-to-face encounter, 
you won't be able to overpower them.

233
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,120
What can you do in order to bridge that gap and win?

234
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,460
Any ideas?

235
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,210
No.

236
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,750
Combo number one!

237
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,380
Right!

238
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,840
Be sly, Amon-kun.

239
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,560
As long as it's for the right cause,

240
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,060
there's nothing wrong with playing dirty.

241
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,150
I have a Quinque named Kura among my collection.

242
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,160
It complements you nicely.

243
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Should I die...

244
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,960
I want you to use it, Amon-kun.

245
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,380
<i>Mado-san!</i>

246
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,150
<i>I can't afford to lose here.</i>

247
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,530
<i>Not until I have avenged you!</i>

248
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,580
<i>Kaneki...</i>

249
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,090
Pay more attention to your surroundings, moron.

250
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,300
Nishiki!

251
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,140
Yo, Sis.

252
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,890
What are you doing here?

253
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,070
Ayato...

254
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,740
Team one has taken control of the annex's third-floor north exit.

255
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,790
Team two has taken control of the 
main building's second-floor west exit.

256
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,080
Shinohara, how are things on your end?

257
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,500
We've secured the fifth floor and parking lot.

258
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,130
We're heading for the roof.

259
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,040
Copy that.

260
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,550
Just like the good old days, huh?

261
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,670
Yeah.

262
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,930
They were all good men.

263
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,850
This is Shinohara. We've arrived on the roof.

264
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,310
There are no Aogiri here.

265
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,520
Something's not right.

266
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,110
Shinohara-san!

267
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,070
Amon! Are you all right?

268
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,070
Actually, Shinohara-sanâ€”

269
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,790
What's going on?

270
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,790
Maru, it's him.

271
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,340
The One-Eyed Owl.

272
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,890
Shinohara. Take only distinguished men

273
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,310
who don't mind dying with you.

274
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,230
If you guys can't handle him, then nobody can.

275
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,190
Dropping dead for no reason won't buy us any time.

276
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,070
Challenge him with as few men as possible.

277
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,030
That is all.

278
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,640
<i>Even when I'm depressed, 
riding you clears my mind in no time.</i>

279
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,810
<i>On days when my good-for-nothing subordinates</i>

280
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,400
<i>or pressure from above brings me down,</i>

281
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,440
<i>riding you like this invigorates me completely!</i>

282
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,150
<i>You're the best partner ever!</i>

283
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,030
Hm? My keys...

284
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,370
Yahoo!

285
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,160
Impossible!
