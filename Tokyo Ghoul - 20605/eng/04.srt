1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,980
Tsukiyama!

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,980
It's been a while, Kirishima-san.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,990
What do you want?

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,640
Friendly as always, I see.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,050
Though I suppose that's just part of your charm.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,530
You're sickening, you pig.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,500
The man with the eyepatch over there...

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,700
You're new, right?

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,880
U-Um...

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,670
What's your name?

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,000
K-Kaneki.

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,880
What a marvelous aroma.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,490
Hey, you.

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,870
You're being a nuisance, not to mention gross. 
Take a hike already.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,330
A bit harsh, aren't we?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,820
I'll be back some other time for a cup of coffee.

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,480
Yoshimura should be around then.

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,440
O-Okay...

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,760
Charmed to meet you.

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,360
Farewell, Kaneki-kun.

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,320
Until we meet again...

22
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,480
Who was that guy?

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,830
You'd better keep an eye out for him.

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,500
He's the scourge of the 20th Ward.

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,430
And here we have a national specialty, the eyes of virgins.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,170
Thank you.

27
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,590
Kaneki-kun, was it?

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,330
How utterly captivating...

29
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,970
that scent of his.

30
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,260
What?

31
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,060
Another jam bun today?

32
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,380
It's fine. This is as good as cafeteria food gets.

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,520
That's not good enough!

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,060
You're still a growing girl, you know.

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,400
Which one shall we choose?

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,030
Fried chicken!

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,710
Say "ahh!"

38
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,990
Huh? It's fine.

39
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,490
There's no way I'm gonna let you off with just bread.

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,620
Now open up!

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,270
Fine...

42
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,880
I fiddled around a bit with the seasoning.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,820
What do you think?

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,630
What is it?

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,320
Ow!

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,810
Well, it's pretty good.

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,760
You're just saying that.

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,170
No, I mean it.

49
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,050
Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit, damn it!

50
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,900
Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit, damn it!

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,600
Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit, damn it!

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,280
Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit, damn it!

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,300
Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit, damn it!

54
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,310
Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit! Don't vomit, damn it!

55
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,280
Don't vomit...

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,620
Thanks for the food.

57
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,260
I ate it, Yoriko.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,960
Kaneki-kun.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,510
Hi there.

60
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,230
Oh, hi, uh...

61
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,140
Tsukiyama Shuu.

62
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,310
May I?

63
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,920
Oh, of course.

64
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,040
Many thanks.

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,100
Tsukiyama-san, what brings you to Kamii University?

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
What if I were to say...

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,610
that I came here to see you?

68
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,610
Huh? Uh, well, I don't know.

69
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,030
<i>This man is the Gourmet, the scourge of the 20th Ward...</i>

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,540
You seem to be quite the intellectual savant.

71
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,040
Or so I've heard from a regular of Anteiku.

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,380
I wouldn't say that. You flatter me, really.

73
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,880
Books are wonderful, aren't they?

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,370
A single sentence can whisk you 
away into the wildest of fantasies.

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,160
I believe that by immersing yourself in a literary work,

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,220
you gain a clearer view of the author's vision.

77
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,770
By that point, you are truly free to roam 
through the author's radiant macrocosm.

78
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,900
As soon as your soul enamors 
itself with those wonders within,

79
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,700
you can let go of your real self along with the rest of reality.

80
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,280
You're an avid reader, aren't you?

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,120
It was during the worst moments of my life

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,070
that I found refuge in literature.

83
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,360
<i>He and I... We're awfully alike.</i>

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,630
What a pleasant surprise.

85
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,260
You read Takatsuki too?

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,140
Oh, yes.

87
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,030
Though ingenuous at first, 
there's a profoundness to be discovered in his words.

88
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,580
I can't help but gravitate towards the subtlety of his writing style.

89
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,060
I, too, adore his style of writing.

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,840
I see. Takatsuki, huh?

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,910
Listen, Kaneki-kun.

92
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,950
I know of a great cafÃ© that's run by a passionate reader.

93
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,420
If you'd like, how about accompanying me sometime?

94
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,720
Rumor has it that Takatsuki Sen stops by from time to time.

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,790
He does?

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,790
Actually, on second thought...

97
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,790
Kirishima-san must have said something about me.

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,670
No, it's just...

99
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,220
Oh no, it's fine. 
I've always been easily misunderstood.

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,260
I've been lonely ever since 
Kamishiro-san passed away, too.

101
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,770
Kamishiro? You mean Kamishiro Rize-san?

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,060
You remind me of the person she once was.

103
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,030
It's rare to see fellow ghouls 
with a burning passion for books.

104
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:32,240
I merely wish to find someone 
who'll share a like-minded conversation with me.

105
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,120
H-Hey...

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,440
If you're fine with me, then...

107
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,710
Well then, I'll see you this Sunday at three o'clock.

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,130
He didn't seem like such a bad person...

109
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,630
Kaneki-kun, you're done for the day.

110
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,720
Oh, right.

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,570
Have a nice evening.

112
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,760
Oh, and Kaneki-kun...

113
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,390
Yomo-kun told me he was waiting for you downstairs.

114
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,410
Yomo-san? Downstairs?

115
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,510
Um, where are we going?

116
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,320
<i>Silent as always.</i>

117
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,910
Doves have entered the 20th Ward.

118
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,200
Huh? And by that you mean...

119
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,700
If it comes down to it, you'll have 
to take matters into your own hands.

120
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,680
Let's go!

121
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,340
H-Hold on!

122
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,870
Dodging seems to be your strongest suit, 
but that's all you can do right now.

123
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,850
R-Right.

124
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,490
Meet me here every day after work. I'll train you.

125
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,190
All right.

126
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,700
Would you like to come with me?

127
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,200
There's someone who wants to meet you.

128
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,040
So you're the infamous Kaneki-kun, are you?

129
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm so glad you came to see me.

130
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,460
Ren-chan and Uta told me all sorts of things about you.

131
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm Itori, the bar owner.

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,340
Nice to meet you.

133
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Th-The pleasure is all mine.

134
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,610
Oh relax, no need to be so formal! Loosen up, Kanekicchi!

135
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,470
U-Um... How long have you all known each other for?

136
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,070
Well, we've always been a rotten bunch.

137
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,400
Back in the days, Ren and Uta 
rarely played nice with each other.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,570
In fact, they turned the entire 4th Ward upside down with their crazy antics.

139
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,110
But we're the best of friends now, am I right?

140
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,160
Whatever.

141
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,230
Ren-chan was pretty much an untamed beast, back then.

142
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,910
Th-That bad?

143
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,030
Yep. Kinda like the male version of an angry Touka-san.

144
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,940
Spot on, right?

145
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,090
That <i>is</i> pretty terrifying.

146
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,540
Enough talk about me.

147
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,550
Itori, didn't you have something to say to him?

148
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,010
Ah, that's right!

149
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,920
Here, drink up.

150
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,020
Oh no, I'm still underage.

151
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,430
It's not wine, silly!

152
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,570
This is amazing! 
I've never seen a one-eyed ghoul before!

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,350
Sorry, sorry.

154
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,570
Don't worry. We're all ghouls, right?

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,780
Here, a token of my apology.

156
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,340
I wonder if the other one-eye is like him too.

157
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,290
Who knows?

158
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,750
U-Um, is there someone else 
besides me with only one, uh...

159
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,040
Oh, did that pique your interest?

160
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,190
Yes.

161
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,000
All right.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,320
You see Kanekicchi, when a human 
and ghoul love each other very much,

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,600
what do you think happens when they get busy?

164
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,980
A human and a ghoul's baby?

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,140
It dies.

166
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,050
Biological impotence.

167
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,450
The chances of getting pregnant itself are pretty low to begin with.

168
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,370
But in extremely rare cases, one is born.

169
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,410
A half-ghoul, half-human baby.

170
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,550
A half-ghoul, half-human...

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,540
The abilities of a hybrid ghoul far exceed those of a pure one.

172
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,840
And this baby...

173
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,590
only had the red eye on one side.

174
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,670
But then again, these stories are just urban myths.

175
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,560
A one-eyed ghoul...

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,040
U-Um...

177
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,850
Oh? What is it? Ask me anything.

178
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,770
About Rize-san...

179
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,400
Do you know anything about Kamishiro Rize-san?

180
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,490
And why exactly do you ask?

181
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,650
This whole mess with my body 
began when I got involved with her.

182
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,620
And yet, I know next to nothing about her...

183
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,900
So that's how it is. Rize, huh?

184
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,460
She was a troublemaker, her death shrouded in mystery.

185
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,650
Indeed, her so-called death has spawned 
nothing but rumors over these last few months.

186
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,600
"So-called death"? But the accident...

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Think about it. Was that really just your regular, old accident, Kaneki Ken-kun?

188
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,600
Itori...

189
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,860
You see, I heard someone was standing on top of the building when the accident took place on that fateful day.

190
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,870
Huh? S-So you're saying it wasn't a coincidence?

191
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,270
Somebody killed Rize...

192
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,620
Or something.

193
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,620
Itori!

194
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,570
I'm just saying!

195
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,630
It's nothing but a rumor, all right? A rumor!

196
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,830
<i>Who...</i>

197
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,300
<i>Who would do something like that?</i>

198
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,510
Kaneki-kun.

199
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,900
Kaneki-kun?

200
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,260
Oh, yes?

201
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,970
Is something the matter?

202
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,060
Oh, not at all.

203
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,270
Um, Tsukiyama-san.

204
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,370
Hm? What is it?

205
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,130
What kind of things did you talk about with Rize-san?

206
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,500
Oh, Kamishiro-san?

207
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,630
We conversed about things such as literature...

208
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,240
and of course, we also discussed fine dining.

209
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,480
Tsukiyama-kun, I appreciate the thought,

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,870
but I have absolutely no interest 
in joining your exclusive gourmet club.

211
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,530
W-Why not?

212
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,710
Are you not in pursuit of the 
finest tastesâof even greater heights!?

213
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,210
Well, don't you see? 
Anything you manage to serve me just won't be enough.

214
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,470
Of course, the exquisite flavor sampled whilst eating is an immense pleasure.

215
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,430
But for a ghoul to think so highly of himself by simply claiming he has "taste?"

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,530
I find your cute little human pretense 
quite absurd, don't you, Tsukiyama-kun?

217
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,570
<i>That contemptuous harlot...</i>

218
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,140
<i>A crude sow like her dares to make a mockery of my culinary refinement!</i>

219
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,910
U-Um, Tsukiyama-san?

220
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,320
Ow!

221
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,760
Goodness, how could I have allowed that to happen?

222
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,290
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,580
I'm fine. It's just a little cut.

224
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,040
L-Let me make it up to you, Kaneki-kun.

225
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,650
It's not much, but there's a place that Kamishiro-san used to visit regularly.

226
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,460
Would you like to go there together?

227
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,580
A place that Rize-san visited regularly?

228
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,800
Yes, I'd like that very much.

229
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,930
Well, then.

230
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,940
Now that it's settled, let's head there right now.

231
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,650
How is your cut doing?

232
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,630
Oh, it's fine. 
The bleeding seems to have stopped.

233
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,900
I'll wash this later andâ

234
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,020
O-Oh, er, no it's fine. Don't worry about it.

235
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,030
I'll wash it myself.

236
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,490
That was too close for my liking.

237
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,180
I can't believe I lost it for a second there and startled him.

238
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,490
Be cool. Keep it smooth, all right?

239
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,840
Tsukiyama Shuu, it won't be long now...

240
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,970
This sweet essence...

241
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,130
Such tranquil harmony...

242
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,670
Finding this novel delicacy...

243
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,400
Delights me more so than the discovery of a new star!

244
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,700
Oh, Monsieur Savarin...

245
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,990
You were absolutely right...

246
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,180
<i>Why am I taking a shower, anyway?</i>

247
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,760
Kaneki-sama.

248
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,400
Oh, yes?

249
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,720
I have prepared some clothes here for you. 
Feel free to take your time.

250
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,710
Okay, thanks.

251
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,520
So this is Rize-san's favorite place.

252
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,660
I brought you a cup of coffee.

253
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,090
Enjoy.

254
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,650
Excuse me, where is Tsukiyama-san?

255
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,800
What's going on!?

256
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,900
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the moment you've all been waiting for!

257
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Without further ado, today's main dish!

258
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,500
Our entrÃ©e for today is an unusual cut of meat.

259
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,120
A ghoul, of all things!

260
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,150
Ghoul?

261
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,170
Cannibalism doesn't quite appeal to me.

262
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,040
Brought to you by Mr. MM!

263
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,550
Oh, Mr. MM!

264
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,050
It's Mr. MM!

265
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,150
My fellow esteemed diners.

266
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,650
The flesh of a ghoul has a crass flavor not worthy of devouring.

267
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,020
Of course, those of you with refined palates will regard this as nothing new.

268
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,980
Tsu-Tsukiyama-san!

269
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,020
W-Why?

270
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,560
My attention was instantly 
riveted on this man's alluring scent.

271
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,080
Though he is a ghoul, the rich aroma 
of human blood still runs through his veins.

272
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,790
Oh, he's right!

273
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,330
How delightfully grand!

274
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,030
Magnificent!

275
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,710
Ah, I can't take it!

276
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,080
Are you not enthralled?

277
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,810
A ghoul with a human scent.

278
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,920
How does that sound!?

279
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,070
<i>I've been set up.</i>

280
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,560
<i>This whole thing was just an elaborate ploy.</i>

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,270
We shall venture into the unknown in the pursuit of new smells and tastes...

282
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,340
Now!

283
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,770
Let us bask in the ultimate epicurean delight!

284
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,490
And now, the scrapper 
who will be serving today's main dish!

285
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,430
Say, Madame A...

286
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,070
Yes, PG-sama?

287
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,960
Which scrapper have you brought with you today?

288
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,230
Today it's my all-time favorite, Taro-chan.

289
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,020
'Tis a pleasure to meet ya.

290
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,620
Don't let him get away!

291
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,210
Whuh? W-Wait up now!

292
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,220
I said wait up!

293
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,050
Run Taro-chan, run!

294
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,810
Mama!

295
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,930
His owner, Madame A, 
offers a few words of encouragement!

296
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,350
<i>I've gotta get out of here! How do I get out!?</i>

297
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
<i>I-I gotta do something!</i>

298
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,020
Where d'ya think ya going?

299
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,350
Crush him to a pulp!

300
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,000
<i>Shit, I have no way out!</i>

301
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,640
<i>It's no use. He didn't even flinch.</i>

302
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,550
Is something the matter, Kaneki-kun?

303
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,380
Why don't you release your kagune?

304
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,350
The clock is ticking.

305
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,810
<i>There's gotta be some way out of here! 
Think Kaneki, think!</i>

306
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,860
Shoot!

307
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,590
What happened there?

308
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,850
Did his legs cramp up?

309
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,960
Ladies and gentlemen, it appears the drug is starting to take effect.

310
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,290
<i>Don't tell me that coffee was...</i>

311
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,860
A-All right! I g-gotchu now!

312
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,200
Hell yeah! Wring his damn neck!

313
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,340
Rip his guts out!

314
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,450
Fun! This is so much fun!

315
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,930
Bye-bye, Kaneki-kun.

316
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,250
Huh? What's <i>that</i>?

317
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,110
Could he be...

318
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,690
A... A one-eyed ghoul!

319
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,710
One-eyed!?

320
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,350
One-eyed? For real?

321
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,060
Walk it off, Taro-chan! Get up!

322
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,850
Hurting! It hurts! Hurts!

323
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,010
One-eyed... How incredibly rare!

324
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,400
MM-sama?

325
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,360
Are you all right?

326
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,740
What an absolute luxury!

327
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,020
Get up! Taro-chan!

328
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,660
Mama!

329
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,080
It's no good...

330
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,830
That's it! Who's a good boy? You are!

331
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,550
Who's Mama's little boy? You are!

332
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,820
Mama is so excited!

333
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,060
That hurts!

334
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,540
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I'm terribly sorry for all the commotion.

335
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,480
Never would I have imagined 
him to be a fabled one-eyed ghoul.

336
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:07,110
However, I don't intend 
to spoil the banquet we all came for.

337
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,950
How does this sound?

338
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,700
It hurts!

339
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,320
Why don't we dine on Madame A's 
pet boy instead, the scrapper?

340
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,690
Taro-chan! Taro-chan!

341
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,720
It hurts...

342
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,830
Taro-chan, you...

343
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,680
Useless sack of meat!

344
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,470
Embarrass me, will you!?

345
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,550
I hope you get eaten quickly, damn you!

346
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,480
Mama...

347
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,860
Did you have fun, Kaneki-kun?

348
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,490
This was only supposed to be a joke between the two of us.

349
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,190
I may have been a bit hard on you. Can we move on?

350
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>This unique treasure...</i>

351
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,000

352
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,460
Yes, that's it!

353
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,970
Yes, Tsukiyama-kun! That's the face I want! Nice feeling!

354
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,830
More! Express yourself even more! There it is!

355
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,230
Absolutely fantastic. 
This is great, Tsukiyama-kun! I can't praise you enough!

356
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,880
Um... What's going on here?

357
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,890
Oh, well, you know.

358
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,060
Apparently, I'll be making a guest appearance on the upcoming cover for a comic book.

359
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,380
Kaneki-kun, care to join me?

360
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,820
Well?

361
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,960
Huh? Uh, I think I'll pass.
