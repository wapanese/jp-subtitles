1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,170
Yes, this is Control.

2
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,860
Marude here! Give me a situation report!

3
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,760
The branch is being attacked by a band of ghouls we believe to be Aogiri Tree—

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,170
What happened!?

5
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,300
<i>He was the last one.</i>

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,850
Who the hell are you?

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,320
All done?

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,360
Yeah.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,030
Ready, Eto?

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,780
Yes, Tatara-san.

11
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,970
This is terrible.

12
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,470
What do we know about them?

13
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,560
They're a band of ghouls who go by the name Aogiri Tree.

14
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,120
We have no way of knowing their exact numbers,

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,480
but their leader is...

16
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
the One-Eyed King.

17
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,070
One-Eyed, you say?

18
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,120
Let's make our way back, Yomo-kun.

19
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,040
The shop feels a bit empty nowadays, doesn't it?

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,150
There have been more Doves around recently.

21
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,000
Everyone's wary of going outside during a time like this.

22
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,090
Welcome.

23
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,800
Is your manager here?

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,260
U-Um...

25
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,980
I asked you if your manager was here!

26
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,580
Th-The manager has stepped out for a bit.

27
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,480
Then where did he go!?

28
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,730
Hey, you.

29
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,020
What do you think you're doing?

30
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,190
If you've got business here, 
the least you could do is order a cup of coffee.

31
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,700
What was that!?

32
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,830
If you have something to tell the manager, I can relay it for you.

33
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,670
I have something I want to ask you guys as well.

34
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,300
Do you know Kamishiro Rize?

35
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,220
My name is Banjou Kazuichi. 
I'm here from the 11th Ward.

36
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,850
I was acquainted with Rize-san 
back when she was still there.

37
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,850
And what makes you think she's here?

38
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,640
When Rize-san left the 11th Ward,

39
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,770
she said something about a coffee shop—

40
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,820
That's...

41
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,400
Why do you have Rize-san's scent on you!?

42
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,910
Hey!

43
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
No roughhousing in here!

44
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,490
Banjou-san!

45
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,660
Are you him?

46
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,290
Are you Rize-san's man?

47
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,960
N-No, we're nothing like th—

48
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,630
"We're"!?

49
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,460
Y-You've got it all wrong!

50
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,050
It's a misunderstanding!

51
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,350
Banjou-san! Get a grip on yourself!

52
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm so sorry!

53
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,940
He's out like a light.

54
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,320
I knew it.

55
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,880
Sorry about our leader here.

56
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,860
What a wimp.

57
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,990
Shinohara and Amon, coming in.

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,770
<i>Assistant Special Investigator Chino 
and Senior Investigator Tainaka.</i>

59
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,340
<i>Not to mention Special Investigator Arima's old partner,</i>

60
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
<i>Senior Investigator Hirako.</i>

61
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,970
<i>Special Investigator Kuroiwa is involved too?</i>

62
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,680
Have a seat, everyone.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,860
As some of you may already know, 
the 11th Ward Branch has been hit.

64
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,900
Despite the enemy's relatively short occupation,

65
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,410
on-site police reports indicate 
that the number of survivors...

66
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,910
is zero.

67
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,460
Ah, he's finally awake.

68
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,920
Are you all right?

69
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,340
I'm sorry about earlier.

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,850
What's your name?

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,310
Kaneki.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,400
Kaneki, huh? You're tougher than you look.

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,860
Oh, not at all...

74
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,610
It's the reason why Rize-san chose you, right?

75
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,410
You've got it wrong, Banjou-san. 
Rize-san and I didn't have that type of relationship.

76
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,910
So I was mistaken!?

77
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,870
Yes.

78
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,200
Sorry! It was my fault! I sincerely apologize!

79
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
It's fine, lift up your head—

80
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,960
No! If I don't do this, I won't be able to live with myself.

81
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,470
So where is Rize-san now?

82
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,550
Rize-san is...

83
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,390
She's no longer...

84
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,400
She isn't here anymore.

85
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,900
I-I see.

86
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,410
She never was one to stay in a place for too long.

87
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

88
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,910
Listen, Kaneki. I have a favor to ask you.

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,250
A favor?

90
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,210
Yeah. If you ever see her again, I want you to tell her this:

91
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,670
Run.

92
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,260
A few months ago, a band of ghouls named Aogiri Tree

93
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,980
carved their way through the 11th Ward.

94
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:48,400
They set their sights on the Doves in order 
to overthrow the rest of us in the same ward.

95
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,070
They're strong.

96
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,530
By now, it's likely that every single Dove 
in the 11th Ward has been hunted down.

97
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,910
Even though I'm just an underling of theirs,

98
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,850
I can tell you that they're all after Rize-san.

99
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,660
I don't know why.

100
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,160
But it can't be anything good, that's for sure.

101
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,910
Rize-san?

102
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,290
They'll eventually start wreaking 
havoc in the 20th Ward as well.

103
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,470
You should get out of here too. 
Nobody's gonna blame you.

104
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,550
Otherwise...

105
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,640
Banjou-san!

106
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,980
What are you screwing around here for, Banjou?

107
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,060
Want me to mess you up until 
you can't spit out any more blood?

108
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,020
A-Ayato...

109
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,150
H-Hey!

110
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,570
Touka-chan!

111
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,160
Ayato.

112
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,160
<i>So that's Touka-chan's...</i>

113
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,890
Yo. It's been a while, Sis.

114
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,670
Where have you been, moron?

115
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,570
Out and about, observing society.

116
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,840
Unlike you, a dweller of complacent peace.

117
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,800
You arrogant little brat!

118
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,050
<i>You're</i> the brat.

119
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,760
It's time to face reality, fool.

120
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,640
Are you finished yet, Ayato-kun? May we come in?

121
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,360
What are <i>they</i> doing here?

122
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,770
Pardon the intrusion.

123
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,240
Oh, whatever shall I do? Where on earth could I be?

124
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,790
Well, look at that! I've located a police box!

125
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,000
It's my lucky day!

126
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,050
They call themselves Aogiri Tree.

127
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,050
We currently have information 
on over two hundred members.

128
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,550
There has never been an 
incident of this magnitude before.

129
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,520
What could their objective be?

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,100
Does it look like I'd have an idea?

131
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,020
However, we have lost control over the 11th Ward.

132
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,570
That much is certain.

133
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,030
As soon as that gets around,

134
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,530
it's expected that the ghouls 
who've been acting on their own

135
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,370
will join Aogiri Tree.

136
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,790
This will be a war between humans and ghouls.

137
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,630
That's why you must surrender your lives to me!

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,460
That's an order! You have no right to refuse me!

139
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,260
From here on out, the 11th Ward special task force—

140
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,270
Excuse me!

141
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,470
I'm Shinohara-san's protégé, Suzuya Juuzou!

142
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,480
I'm terribly sorry for being late. I got lost along the way.

143
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,190
Oh, jeez...

144
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,610
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

145
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,110
Hey, Ayato-kun.

146
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,950
Oh, my.

147
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,080
I did hear about your older sister being here.

148
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,450
Aren't you both just gorgeous!

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,870
I'm so jealous.

150
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,630
I'm impressed you found me, Yamori.

151
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,590
I only had to follow Banjou-kun.

152
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,590
Your men sure are first-rate, huh?

153
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,180
R-Rize-san isn't here!

154
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,060
It stinks in here.

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,700
It reeks of an odor I absolutely despise.

156
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,660
Hey, Nico. Will this one do?

157
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,120
Fine by me. Let's hurry up and kidnap him.

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
Right?

159
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,080
Kidnap? Don't think you can do as you please!

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,670
As I please?

161
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,050
Those with power are always free to do as they please.

162
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,430
Kaneki!

163
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,230
Fight or surrender? Which will it be?

164
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,650
Behave yourself and you'll get 
through this without a scratch.

165
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,240
But right now, it seems...

166
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,080
Oh, dear.

167
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,830
One-eyed, huh?

168
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,550
You asshole!

169
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,100
You're weak, Touka.

170
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,230
Just like your dad.

171
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,730
Dad... fought for our sake.

172
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,030
What would someone like you know!?

173
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,910
You're the one who doesn't understand, Touka.

174
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,410
Mom and Dad are both dead.

175
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,660
Their lives were in vain and were lost in an instant.

176
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,000
But I'm different!

177
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,750
I'm gonna teach everyone the difference 
between insects like them and ghouls like us.

178
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,640
You can't fly anywhere with that wing of yours.

179
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,640
Go ahead. Crawl like the insect you are.

180
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,390
You're so cool, Ayato-chan.

181
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,100
Touka-chan!

182
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,110
Still some fight left in you, it seems.

183
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,320
You really do remind me of her.

184
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,950
I'm getting a little jealous.

185
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,910
Tough little nut, aren't you? 
In that case, how do you like <i>this</i>?

186
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,210
And <i>this</i>? What about...

187
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,590
<i>this</i>?

188
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,550
All right then, how's <i>this</i>?

189
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,760
<i>This</i>?

190
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,680
What about <i>this</i>?

191
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,690
You like <i>this</i>?

192
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,690
K-Kaneki...

193
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,690
How's <i>this</i>? And <i>this</i>!?

194
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,400
What about <i>this</i>? How do you like <i>this</i>!?

195
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,150
Amazing! I can't break him at all!

196
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,410
Y-Yamori-san! W-We should be on our way—

197
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,870
Macho-beard is right.

198
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,410
Nico...

199
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,500
Ooh, splat! Very nice!

200
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,550
Let's continue this at home, Yamori.

201
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,340
Thank you, Nico.

202
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,430
No problem.

203
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,310
Banjou, stuff that one-eyed guy 
in the bag. We're heading back.

204
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,670
How are you feeling?

205
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,010
They took him away, didn't they?

206
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,300
Yomo-kun, round everyone up for me.

207
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,980
Anteiku will be closing up shop for a little while.

208
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,360
It's clear that signs of an organized 
movement are starting to appear.

209
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,120
That's all we know about Aogiri Tree.

210
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,240
I'd like to pursue them immediately, 
but we have to be patient for the time being.

211
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,080
We will engage them in one week.

212
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,830
Until then, the 11th Ward is under mandatory evacuation.

213
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,540
The police are at your disposal.

214
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,380
I will deal with the media. That is all.

215
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,670
Dismissed!

216
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,630
Yes, sir!

217
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:01,060
So you're Suzuya, huh? Awfully skinny, aren't you?

218
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,060
Oh, boy.

219
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,020
You're eating properly, right?

220
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,270
Is your coin purse empty?

221
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,980
Now, now, Maru-chan.

222
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,360
Suzuya just got here and I'm sure he's tired.

223
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,740
Cut him some slack, okay?

224
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,530
What gives? I was just making small talk.

225
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,080
Yeah, yeah. Save it for tomorrow, all right?

226
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,460
Suzuya is the only Third Class Investigator?

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,710
Maru will use anything that's at his disposal.

228
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,380
He must have decided that 
using Juuzou would be a good idea.

229
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,430
In any case, Chairman Washuu personally admitted this kid.

230
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,850
Right after Arima.

231
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,970
I see.

232
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,640
However, the enemy has a trump card of their own.

233
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,480
You mean Jason?

234
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,230
Yeah. The 13th Ward's S-rated troublemaker.

235
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,150
He's a sadistic bastard, one who 
murders for fun rather than food.

236
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,490
Not someone I'd want to go up against, that's for sure.

237
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,660
Oh, right. You fought him before, didn't you?

238
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,250
Yes. Together with Mado-san.

239
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,000
Right.

240
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,420
<i>What's with that kid with the eyepatch from before?</i>

241
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,970
Don't make me a murderer.

242
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,930
<i>His words, his expression...</i>

243
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,720
<i>They're dredging up memories I don't want to remember.</i>

244
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,320
Koutarou, who said you could come in?

245
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,740
Amon.

246
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,120
Amon!

247
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,080
Sorry. Could you repeat that, please?

248
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,920
I said your Quinque got broken, right?

249
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,960
Oh, yes.

250
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,130
In that case, choose one from Mado's effects.

251
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,210
It's in his will.

252
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,470
Well, see you later.

253
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,930
<i>Mado-san.</i>

254
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,440
Rei-chan, apparently there are 
heaps of ghouls in the 11th Ward.

255
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,900
I might be able to get a new Quinque.

256
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
I can't wait!

257
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,870
I have to be a good boy or else 
Mama will be cross with me again.

258
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,540
We're acting accordingly to increase

259
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,210
Investigator presence in the 11th Ward,

260
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,540
as well as pinpointing the base of this ghoul organization.

261
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,800
I can state that it's only a matter 
of time before this case is closed.

262
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,510
But isn't this full-scale evacuation 
of citizens in the area a little overboard?

263
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,020
That is ultimately for everyone's safety.

264
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,520
The CCG is on everyone's side.

265
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,530
Please avoid entering any areas that are marked as off-limits.

266
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,530
You could at least text me, Kaneki.

267
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,040
Hinami.

268
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,500
Onee-chan.

269
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,000
He's not as soft as he looks.

270
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,960
Nishiki...

271
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,590
Looks like everyone is here.

272
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,260
There will be a few more coming later,

273
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,770
but we'll start without them.

274
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,190
This concerns the issues surrounding the 11th Ward,

275
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,110
and the actions Anteiku is to take.

276
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,280
But before we get to that, I have something to say

277
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,200
about the kidnapped Kaneki-kun.

278
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,540
It's probable that we'll never see Kaneki-kun again.

279
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,670
Hey, gramps! What the hell are you talking about?

280
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,880
Stop!

281
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,380
Stop.

282
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,010
We're going, right? We're going to save him, aren't we?

283
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,390
Aogiri Tree is made up of ghouls who 
bank their entire existence on fighting.

284
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,770
Sneaking into the base to rescue 
Kaneki-kun won't be an easy task.

285
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
No way...

286
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Not to mention that we can't 
afford to ignore the CCG's movements.

287
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,700
They'll probably deploy 
a detachment into the 11th Ward

288
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,910
to take out Aogiri Tree soon.

289
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,330
If we do attempt a rescue,

290
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,090
there's a good chance that we'll 
be the ones exterminated instead.

291
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,380
What? You're not thinking of abandoning him, are you?

292
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,720
I'm going.

293
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,140
What was our policy, again?

294
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,350
Manager, if you're not going...

295
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,390
then I'll go alone.

296
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,770
I'm going too.

297
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,610
I owe him after all.

298
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,320
I want to help too.

299
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,530
Onii-chan is always helping me out, so...

300
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,870
If there's anything I can do, I'll do it!

301
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,910
Hinami.

302
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,410
Let me say this, so there's no misunderstanding:

303
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,000
I planned to rescue Kaneki-kun from the start.

304
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,340
However, I wanted to let you all know that 
I can't guarantee the safety of anyone here.

305
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,010
I understand how you all feel.

306
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,020
Know that if you wish to save Kaneki-kun, 
you must place your lives on the line for him.

307
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,650
And in return, Yomo-kun and I 
will protect you with all our might.

308
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,360
It <i>is</i> Anteiku's policy to help each other out, after all.

309
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,740
There is one more thing.

310
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,110
You may enter.

311
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,990
You! Why!?

312
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,620
Amore!

313
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,290
Heartbreak!

314
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,040
Just imagine, my best friend Kaneki-kun facing danger

315
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,000
at the hands of an uncouth bunch!

316
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,460
No kidding!

317
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,850
Jiro, how do you think Rize-san feels about me?

318
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,690
Where's this coming from all of a sudden?

319
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,610
If you want to get in her good books, why not give her a present?

320
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,070
A present? Oh, but I could never ask her directly.

321
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,110
It would ruin the surprise.

322
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,070
<i>He's going to get me to ask her instead.</i>

323
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,660
<i>What a wimp.</i>

324
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,950
Rize-san, Rize-san! I have a question for you.

325
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,790
She says she likes any and all internal organs.

326
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,000
I see. Thanks.
