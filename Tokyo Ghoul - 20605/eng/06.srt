1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,150
Here I go.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,660
He belongs to <i>me</i>!

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,950
He <i>belongs</i> to you?

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,210
Don't make me laugh.

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,130
There's not a single thing here...

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,380
that belongs to you.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,270
Calmato.

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,010
Amazing...

9
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,950
So that's Touka-chan's kagune.

10
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,830
I'm delighted, Kirishima-san!

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,500
To think that I'd sustain this much damage

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
from a kagune so equally-matched to mine!

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,510
I didn't think I'd get to see this side of you again.

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,040
It's as if the smoldering passion from way back then...

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,930
is being rekindled anew!

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,390
Allow me to garnish Kaneki-kun...

17
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,730
with your organs as trimmings!

18
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,060
This unexpected hors d'oeuvre!

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,650
I'm truly grateful.

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,710
Not bad, Kirishima-san.

21
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,680
It seems I have no other choice.

22
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,640
It's absolutely not what I'd hoped for...

23
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,260
but tactically speaking,

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
I need a bite!

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,110
Nishiki-kun...

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,110
What are you,

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,320
a zombie!?

28
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,600
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Let go of me!

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,210
Kimi...

31
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,710
I've had enough out of y—

32
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,560
The show mustn't end here, no?

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,110
This is going to take...

34
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,380
an awfully long time to heal.

35
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,360
Kaneki-kun, for God's sake...

36
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,720
Just one bite...

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,370
Just one—

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,580
bite.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,830
Why don't you just keel over and eat your own damn flesh?

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,470
You shitty Gourmet.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
Kimi...

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,810
Nishiki-kun?

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Just you wait...

44
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,510
I'm coming to help you now.

45
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,420
Nishiki...

46
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,110
Stand aside.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,450
Touka-chan?

48
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,010
She knows about both you and Kaneki, right?

49
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,700
I can't let such a dangerous woman

50
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,750
escape with her life.

51
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,590
Touka-chan!

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,360
You can't!

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,310
She's the equivalent of what Hide is to me, 
or what Yoriko-chan is to you.

54
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,820
What if it was Yoriko-chan up there instead of Kimi-san?

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Would you be able to kill Yoriko-chan?

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,490
Shut up!

57
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,240
I <i>have</i> to get rid of her...

58
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,160
To make sure that never happens!

59
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,650
Nishiki-kun?

60
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,620
How beautiful...

61
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,640
Oh, um...

62
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,500
What's with that?

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,190
Nishiki-kun?

64
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,900
Nishiki-kun!

65
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Thank God...

66
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,230
How am I...

67
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,700
beautiful?

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,140
<i>After that incident we had at the church,</i>

69
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,960
All right, it's perfect!

70
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,900
<i>there were a number of changes made around Anteiku.</i>

71
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,080
Good work.

72
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,900
We're still just gettting ready to open, you know.

73
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,300
Don't sweat the small details.

74
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,400
What are you doing!?

75
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,420
N-Nishio-senpai!?

76
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,180
Hey, Nagachika.

77
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,410
I see that rotten look on your face is the same as ever.

78
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,620
<i>For one, Nishio-san joined us at Anteiku.</i>

79
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,930
For Kimi-san's sake as well,

80
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,070
I think you should stop taking the lives of others for food.

81
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,000
With the food that we provide,

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,510
you'd be able to live a rather guilt-free life as a ghoul.

83
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,870
However, we make sure each person earns his keep.

84
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,150
We'll have you work here from now on, Nishio-kun.

85
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,110
Well, Nishio-san, I gotta say...

86
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,930
The longer I stare at you, the less you fit in with Anteiku's classy atmosphere.

87
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,250
I'll kick you out.

88
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,210
We're only getting ready to open right now.

89
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,740
Why did you decide to work at Anteiku anyway?

90
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,070
Stop poking around. I have my reasons.

91
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,440
Don't tell me you're after Touka-chan!

92
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
Like I'd have any interest in that witless girl!

93
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,580
Speaking of Touka-chan, is she still not feeling well?

94
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,930
Yeah.

95
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,090
<i>Ever since that day, Touka-chan has refused to come in for work.</i>

96
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,050
I... I...

97
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,010
I want to be with Dad!

98
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,340
What was <i>that</i> about?

99
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,560
Who knows?

100
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,610
There's all sorts of mysteries to life.

101
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,610
Oh, crap! I've got class!

102
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,610
Thanks for everything!

103
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,370
Hinami-chan?

104
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,180
It's all my fault.

105
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,430
Without her dad here, I have to handle things for the both of us.

106
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,330
If I may ask, why is Hinami-chan so upset?

107
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,670
We haven't heard anything from him for some time now.

108
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,900
So she insists on going to see him.

109
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,780
Where is her father right now?

110
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,700
Yamori...

111
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,880
It's nice and quiet here today, huh?

112
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,300
Take this and get going already.

113
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,040
Very nice.

114
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,020
You do some fine craftsmanship.

115
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,030
I'll catch that woman with this...

116
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,480
W-Would you mind not coming around here anymore?

117
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,840
It seems like I've made a bad name for myself.

118
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,530
I just want to live in peace.

119
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,880
Please.

120
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,120
I understand.

121
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,370
Hinami...

122
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,040
Ryouko...

123
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,040
I'll see you soon.

124
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,300
But before that, I wish you'd tell me something first.

125
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,630
Since when were you a human's puppet on a string?

126
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,850
He...

127
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,430
He was apparently caught up in some dangerous business back in the 13th Ward.

128
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,860
But once Hinami was born, he cut all those ties for us.

129
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,920
He really is a good man.

130
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,980
To Hinami and me, he really is...

131
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,780
All right, then.

132
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,870
U-Um...

133
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,670
It'll be fine. I'm her mother, after all.

134
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,330
If I don't spoil Hinami, then who will?

135
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,380
A Suit...

136
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,430
What are Doves doing here?

137
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,010
It looks like our gamble paid off, didn't it, Amon-kun?

138
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,400
Using small fry to lure the monsters out.

139
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,290
Then again, this one seems to be a monster right to its very core.

140
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,980
Mado-san, that's...

141
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,040
Jason.

142
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,440
What's the big fish of the 13th Ward doing swimming around here?

143
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,190
Well, why don't we hear it from the horse's mouth itself?

144
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,450
S-rated... Jason of the 13th Ward.

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
Hinami?

146
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,290
It's Mom. Can you open up for me?

147
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,240
No! I don't want to talk to you!

148
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,930
Hinami, this is your—

149
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,730
I want to see <i>Dad</i>!

150
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,870
Why!? Why won't you let me?

151
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,630
I hate you, Mom!

152
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,930
Enough, Hinami!

153
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,620
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,210
I shouldn't have raised my voice.

155
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,920
You miss him, don't you?

156
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,940
I'm sure Dad misses you too, Hinami.

157
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,990
But you know, we'll only make things difficult for him if we go see him now.

158
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,730
I'm sorry I've put you through all this.

159
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,330
Jason!

160
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,670
Jason! Jason!

161
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,130
Jason!

162
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,550
Those are some good moves.

163
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,260
I'll play with you for two minutes.

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,820
My apologies.

165
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,200
I didn't step in close enough.

166
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,110
Don't worry. You can nail him with the next one.

167
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,690
Yes.

168
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,520
You seem...

169
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,040
awfully fragile.

170
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,920
Are you okay, Amon-kun?

171
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,750
Yes!

172
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,200
Catch your breath.

173
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,880
What a shame.

174
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,050
A shame indeed.

175
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,500
Nice, nice.

176
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,310
Feeling sleepy?

177
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,230
Not on my watch!

178
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,880
Time's up.

179
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,370
Let's play again sometime.

180
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,120
Damn him.

181
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,290
Mado-san?

182
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,740
Hm. My Quinque broke.

183
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,910
Let's see now...

184
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,920
what use might this scum have in store for us?

185
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,210
Hinami...

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,010
Mom misses your dad too.

187
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,180
Oh?

188
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,480
Mom...

189
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,540
Hinami!

190
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,940
Good grief...

191
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,490
Hinami, I'm so sorry.

192
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,450
It's okay. Don't cry, Mom.

193
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,280
I won't cry anymore. Thank you, Hinami.

194
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,580
Let's wait together...

195
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,170
for Dad to come home.

196
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,830
So Jason managed to escape?

197
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,330
My Quinque broke. 
We couldn't have stopped him either way.

198
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,340
Even so...

199
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,780
As long as we keep picking them off one by one,

200
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,130
I'm sure another opportunity will present itself.

201
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,130
You're right.

202
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,850
We can definitely use this.

203
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,190
All right. Since you've held up all this time,

204
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,360
I want to buy you a present to show you I'm sorry.

205
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
Is there anything you want?

206
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,030
Okay, you think long and hard about it.

207
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,130
Thanks, Mom!

208
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,350
No, thank <i>you</i>.

209
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,090
What do you want?

210
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,840
U-Um... About tomorrow's shift...

211
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,030
Pass.

212
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,640
Y-You know—

213
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,140
That woman... I couldn't kill her.

214
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,640
Earlier,

215
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,230
Hinami-chan and Ryouko-san were fighting...

216
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,650
but they were able to patch things up in the end.

217
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,160
I saw the two of them and thought, "Families sure are nice."

218
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,620
I realized that the affection between mother and child doesn't depend on whether they're ghoul or human.

219
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,210
That shouldn't be a surprise.

220
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,930
But before this all happened to me,

221
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,330
I didn't have a clue.

222
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,350
If we could all come to terms with that...

223
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,310
Then Nishio-senpai and Kimi-san's relationship

224
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,180
could serve as a beacon that guides the way

225
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,920
for how things between a human and ghoul could be.

226
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,150
And what did you want, again?

227
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,550
Oh, uh, nothing...

228
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,010
I shouldn't have senselessly opened my mouth back there,

229
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,730
without knowing the relationship between you and Yoriko-chan.

230
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,740
Okay then, I'll let the manager know.

232
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,720
<i>When she was first accepted into society,</i>

233
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,900
<i>I'm sure Touka-chan must have had the same thoughts.</i>

234
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,460
<i>But if she had been rejected even once for her efforts...</i>

235
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,220
<i>there would have been no going back.</i>

236
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,220
<i>The same goes for Hide and I.</i>

237
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,700
How is Onee-chan doing?

238
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,270
Huh, good question.

239
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,850
I hope she starts feeling better soon.

240
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,640
Yeah.

241
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,560
Onii-chan, let's do the next one. How do you read this?

242
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,450
Let's see... That's "cloudburst."

243
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,530
"Cloudburst"?

244
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,090
It refers to a moment when it suddenly starts raining.

245
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,830
Hinami?

246
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,990
Oh, Mom!

247
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,330
Are you learning new words?

248
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,080
Yup!

249
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,980
Thanks for always taking the time to help Hinami out.

250
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh, it's no problem at all.

251
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,500
I'll be on my way, then.

252
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Thanks, Onii-chan.

253
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,330
See you tomorrow.

254
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:14,960
Okay.

255
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,720
Mom, look! I learned all of the vocabulary in this book!

256
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,670
Really? Good job!

257
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,020
So now, Mom...

258
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,850
What is it?

259
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,680
I want a new book.

260
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
Huh?

261
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,110
I want to learn even more words, so I can surprise Dad!

262
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,110
Dad's birthday is also coming up soon, right?

263
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,680
So...

264
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,490
You want to give him a book as a present?

265
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,200
Then, why don't we go to the bookstore together?

266
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,710
Thank you very much.

267
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,510
Looks like it's going to rain soon.

268
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
You're right! It's starting to rain!

269
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,650
See? Mom knows best, after all.

270
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,230
Yup! Oh, Mom.

271
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,220
Yes?

272
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,400
This is called a cloudburst!

273
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
Cloudburst?

274
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,570
When it suddenly starts raining, it's called a cloudburst.

275
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,050
Onii-chan said so!

276
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,340
Kaneki-san knows all sorts of things, huh?

277
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,070
I wonder if Dad knows that.

278
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,580
Let's ask him sometime.

279
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,230
If I know something that even Dad doesn't, that means I'm pretty amazing, right?

280
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,090
Yes, it does.

281
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,470
What's up with you today, Hinami?

282
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,540
It's been so long since I've gone out with you, Mom!

283
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,930
Come on Hinami, you're getting wet!

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
Hinami, let's head home.

285
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,490
Mom?

286
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,110
Weren't we going to one other place?

287
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,750
Mom?

288
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,660
I just remembered something else I have to do.

289
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,790
Hinami?

290
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,470
It's Dad!

291
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,540
Mom, Dad is somewhere nearby!

292
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,010
I-It couldn't be...

293
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,480
He came for us!

294
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,350
Ah, Hinami!

295
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,860
This way, Mom!

296
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,270
Hinami, wait!

297
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,270
Dad!

298
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,320
Wait for me!

299
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,820
Dad!

300
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,680
Wait for—

301
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,490
Hinami!

302
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,910
It's Dad's scent!

303
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,300
Hinami!

304
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,090
Dad!

305
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,660
Dad?

306
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,130
Hinami!

307
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,590
What is it... That smell?

308
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,270
Nice weather today, isn't it?

309
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,160
Though I wouldn't want the rain to come down any harder than this.

310
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,680
Your dying screams wouldn't be able to reach my ears, after all.

311
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,440
May I please have just a moment of your time,

312
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,230
Fueguchi-san?

313
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,000
Mom...

314
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,180
Hinami.

315
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,730
Run away.

316
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,360
Mom?

317
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,310
It's okay. Head on back to Anteiku, I'll catch up soon.

318
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,940
I promise I'll come back.

319
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,900
No...

320
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,940
No!

321
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,550
I want to stay here with you, Mom!

322
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,530
Kusaba! Use your Q-Bullets!

323
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,280
Y-Yes!

324
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,120
Go!

325
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,420
H-Hold it!

326
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,700
Was that supposed to be an act of motherly love?

327
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,970
How sweetly sickening.

328
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,930
I won't let you pass!

329
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,350
Somebody...

330
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,430
Somebody!

331
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,310
Onii-chan... Onee-chan!

332
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,460
Mom!

333
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
Hey, Nishiki-kun...

334
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,210
Yeah?

335
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,680
Wanna wear this with me?

336
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,980
Huh?

337
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,420
Bangles! They came in a set.

338
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,460
<i>How embarrassing. Is she actually going for a "pair" look?</i>

339
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,990
Well, since it's a present...

340
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,780
Jeez, these bangles look like horse crap.

341
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,050
What was that? Horse crap?

342
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,670
Er, no, Kimi...

343
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,220
I meant, you know, the <i>good</i> kind of horse crap—
