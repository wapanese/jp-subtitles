1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,270
Whoa! Hey, watch it!

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,630
Jeez...

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,290
Hinami-chan!

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,490
Onii-chan!

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Sorry!

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,120
Hinami-chan, what's wrong?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,990
Mom...

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,020
Mom is...

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,750
Where is she?

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,640
Let's hurry!

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,040
Quite the inexperienced fighter, aren't you?

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,740
You're rather sloppy with the use of your kagune.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,710
A mother sacrificing herself to protect her precious child...

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,360
You make my skin crawl.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,750
It's amusing,

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,240
watching this little human charade that you ghouls keep up.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
<i>What good will it do if I get involved?</i>

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,750
Amon-kun, you've done enough.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,760
I'll handle the rest.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>What should I do?</i>

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,310
<i>What should I do?</i>

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,640
Why?

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,460
No, it can't be!

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,840
It certainly can!

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,700
Dear...

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,630
Good...

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,060
Good! This is great!

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,280
Despair, terror, hatred!

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,830
Yes, expressions like those!

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,020
More! Show me more!

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,050
Mom—

32
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,780
You have to be quiet!

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,300
<i>What should I do?</i>

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,660
<i>What am I supposed to do!?</i>

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,660
I suppose I should listen to your last words out of pity.

36
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,420
What's wrong? There's no need to hold back.

37
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,260
Whoops.

38
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,020
What a shame. Time's up.

39
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,340
<i>The only thing I could do...</i>

40
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,990
<i>was cover her eyes from that horrendous sight.</i>

41
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,500
Huh?

42
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,480
Um...

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,360
Touka-chan, how are you feeling?

44
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,650
I'm sorry for skipping out on so much work.

45
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,040
It's fine.

46
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,270
Um, did something happen?

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,270
Ghoul investigators have taken Ryouko-san's life.

48
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,740
Ryouko-san...

49
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,770
What about Hinami? Is she safe!?

50
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,250
I've put her to sleep in the other room.

51
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,760
Her face. Did they see her face?

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,360
What is this?

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,260
Could things get any worse?

54
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,780
When the time comes,

55
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,770
I'm thinking of relocating her to the 24th Ward.

56
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,230
That's a joke, right? That dump of a place?

57
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,400
There's no way Hinami can survive on her own in a place like that!

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,510
Touka-chan...

59
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,930
We could always just kill the Doves, right?

60
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,130
Every last one of them. I mean, we have Yomo-san,

61
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,490
and if we all work together...

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,840
No. If the 20th Ward Doves are killed in action,

63
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,460
then they'll just be replaced. It'll be one after the other.

64
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,570
Until they've hunted all of us down.

65
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,170
But—

66
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,630
Touka!

67
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,130
Yomo-kun is right. 
We must not take any action against them.

68
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,590
For the sake of everyone's safety, this is the path we must take.

69
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,090
Even though we've lost one of our own?

70
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,730
We've just lost one of our own, and all you think we should do is sit around!?

71
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,380
Hinami's mother was killed.

72
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,560
Wouldn't it be sad if we couldn't avenge her!?

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,720
It's not because we can't avenge her that we should feel sad.

74
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,220
The only thing that's sad here...

75
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,080
is a person who's so blinded by revenge that 
they can no longer live properly on their own.

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,540
What are you trying to imply?

77
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,750
Back there, if only...

78
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,420
If only it was Touka-chan who happened to be there...

79
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,920
You mustn't blame yourself,

80
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,770
Kaneki-kun.

81
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,990
<i>I... I...</i>

82
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,710
<i>couldn't do anything at all...</i>

83
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,910
So Jason's base isn't located in the 20th Ward after all.

84
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,630
Going by this report, the 11th Ward seems like a better fit.

85
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,860
Do you suspect Jason's involvement in those organized movements?

86
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,940
That's what my instincts are telling me.

87
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,620
I hate to say it,

88
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,620
but there's nothing within our jurisdiction to do here, Amon-kun.

89
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,510
We'll hand Jason over to Special Investigator Marude.

90
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,830
The remaining S-rated subjects in the 20th Ward are...

91
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,820
that one binge eater and the Gourmet?

92
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,570
They're both keeping a low profile,

93
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,860
almost as if they're adjusting to match our actions.

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,740
In this situation,

95
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,850
I can confidently say that pursuing them would just be a wasted effort.

96
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,790
Which means...

97
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,790
We go back to the small pickings and catch them up one by one.

98
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,330
We'll definitely reel in a big fish that way.

99
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,630
Without a doubt.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,190
All right. From tomorrow onward, 
it's back to straight-up detective work for us.

101
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,270
That's all for today. Enjoy your evening.

102
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,410
Very well.

103
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,150
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,260
And you, Mado-san?

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,560
I don't really have much of a life outside my work.

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,850
Oh, I almost forgot.

107
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,160
Number 745, who is still at large,

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,010
has seen our faces. As such, be sure to watch yourselves.

109
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,170
He's just scaring us. She's only a child after all.

110
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,250
<i>An orphan?</i>

111
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,260
So that's them.

112
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,210
Welcome!

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,630
One shrimp tempura set with chicken rice balls.

114
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,710
<i>Again</i>, Nakajima-san?

115
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,530
Shut it.

116
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,250
He always orders that.

117
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,430
I see.

118
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,490
What about you, Amon-san?

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,900
Large kakiage bowl, order up.

120
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,170
Amon-san, you're from the Academy, right?

121
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,910
Well, yes.

122
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,580
What sort of things did they teach you over there?

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,680
Everything you needed to know about ghouls.

124
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,160
They also build on your physical fitness, I suppose.

125
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,340
It's against regulations, so I can't go into the details.

126
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,830
There are women there too, right?

127
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,130
Hey, Kusaba!

128
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,380
There were two of them in my class.

129
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,850
They were both women of intelligence and strong will.

130
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,020
And?

131
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,930
Were you interested in either of them?

132
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,420
That's none of your business!

133
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,280
They were both killed in the line of duty.

134
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,000
Killed?

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,630
Yes.

136
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,950
S-Sorry, I...

137
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,790
It's not uncommon.

138
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,290
The passionate ones are always the first to lose their lives.

139
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,180
With that, I'll be taking my leave.

140
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,530
You two take care.

141
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,030
Good work today.

142
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,180
Moron.

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,050
M-My bad.

144
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,050
The passionate ones are always the first to lose their lives, huh?

145
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,400
Then I guess we should kick 
back from time to time, right?

146
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,650
Don't even think about it. 
There's a mountain of work waiting for us.

147
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,820
Not as much as the other wards though.

148
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,460
The guys back at headquarters could easily take care of that stuff for us anyway.

149
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,740
You say that,

150
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,420
but we're always going to be at the bottom of the employee ladder,

151
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,030
both you and me.

152
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,630
Amon-san didn't seem to be very interested in moving up, did he?

153
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,320
It's as if he motivates himself 
purely through a sense of justice.

154
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,950
Yeah. That's just the type of person he is.

155
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,920
Honestly, he's pretty admirable.

156
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,300
There's no point in comparing yourself to someone from headquarters, Kusaba.

157
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,180
Right.

158
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,230
Actually, I was hoping for some desk work.

159
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,160
It's easier and safer.

160
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,850
But then, looking at him,

161
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,610
I find myself getting excited as well...

162
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,110
Maybe I'll try harder at work.

163
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,850
Kusaba...

164
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,800
Kusaba!

165
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,710
Why, you...

166
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,710
Nakajima-san, stand back!

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,170
Who is that?

168
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,720
Ukaku!

169
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,170
So you're a high-speed type of ghoul!

170
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,120
<i>This is it...</i>

171
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,040
<i>No!</i>

172
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,960
<i>If the foe is before you, even if it costs you your arms and legs...</i>

173
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,920
That's right, Amon-kun.

174
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,560
That's what it is to be a ghoul investigator.

175
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,170
But forgetting to bring your 
Quinque is no good, you know?

176
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,380
Mado-san...

177
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,950
You can't afford to lose your composure, Amon-kun.

178
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,680
Yes.

179
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,490
Take a short breather.

180
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,920
Dodged that, did you? Well done indeed.

181
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,380
Are you perhaps friends with that female ghoul I killed yesterday?

182
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,880
Would you like me to tell you how that pig was slaughtered?

183
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,730
Oh, my apologies.

184
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,070
I've completely forgotten. It was just yesterday too.

185
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,250
She was so weak and miserable...

186
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,110
I had quite the laugh.

187
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,070
You bastard...

188
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,600
This is some great timing, Amon-kun!

189
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,500
Let's go over what you learned at the Academy.

190
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,890
A ghoul with an ukaku is characterized by a 
flurry of attacks that entirely depend on speed.

191
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,630
However, they all share a lack of stamina.

192
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,930
If you drag out a close confrontation, 
the strength of their hits will drop considerably.

193
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,230
Listen, that female ghoul had a piglet with her, right?

194
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,160
Would you mind telling me where she is?

195
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,420
I mean, I kinda feel bad because she's separated from her mother, you know?

196
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,160
I have to hurry and slaughter her, too.

197
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,220
You scum!

198
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,010
Fool.

199
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,990
Do you have any idea how many of your fellow scum I've wiped out?

200
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,620
You're nothing more than a number!

201
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,010
Well, no matter.

202
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,900
Rabbit, the ukaku ghoul...

203
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,360
<i>Hinami-chan...</i>

204
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,860
Touka-chan!

205
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,060
Stay back!

206
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,740
But you're bleeding!

207
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,530
Don't concern yourself with me.

208
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,370
Did you move against the Doves?

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,480
Touka-chan's injured. She needs medical attention.

210
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
No.

211
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,460
Huh?

212
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,960
I said no.

213
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,860
What do you mean?

214
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,660
If she's taken her own measures against the Doves,

215
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,140
it means that she's prepared to accept full responsibility for her actions.

216
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,930
Whether she lives or dies is of no concern to anyone else.

217
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,230
You can't be serious!

218
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Touka-chan!

219
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,620
Touka-chan!

220
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,780
Stop this!

221
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,490
Manager, I'm sure you've been through a lot,

222
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,510
and you have those experiences to back your actions.

223
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,020
But when the decision to strike back against the investigators comes,

224
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,910
or when the rules of a ghoul's society are concerned,

225
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,670
I don't understand anything at all.

226
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,260
That's why I need to experience these moments myself

227
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,630
before I can decide what's right.

228
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,090
What?

229
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,380
You need to get bandaged up.

230
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,680
I don't need it.

231
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,900
But you're bleeding.

232
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,530
It has nothing to do with you, does it?

233
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,690
But still...

234
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,360
You're annoying the hell out of me!

235
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,140
You're just a human!

236
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,280
I'm half ghoul you know!

237
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,310
Why did you go alone?

238
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,880
I don't care if a murderer like me dies.

239
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,860
But when a ghoul like Ryouko-san or Hinami

240
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,840
gets killed for no good reason...

241
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,380
I can't stand it.

242
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,500
<i>She knows that what she's doing is wrong.</i>

243
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,000
<i>She knows, and yet she still fights.</i>

244
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,890
Touka-chan,

245
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,750
I can't bring myself to kill anyone.

246
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,100
Even if I think the investigators' goals are unjustified,

247
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,400
I don't believe your actions are the right choice either.

248
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,490
But after witnessing Ryouko-san's last moments,

249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,570
I realized that it doesn't matter 
whether they're human or ghoul.

250
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,250
If someone close to me died, I'd be heartbroken as well.

251
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,090
I'd be devastated if you died, Touka-chan.

252
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,860
That so?

253
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,500
I want you to let me help you.

254
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,270
I won't kill any investigators,

255
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,260
but I refuse to just sit around any longer.

256
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,770
To show our respect for Investigator Kusaba Ippei's bravery,

257
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,440
a man who lost his life in the line of duty to ghoul aggression,

258
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,820
a moment of silence.

259
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,270
Is Mado nowhere to be seen?

260
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,540
One of his own men has died,

261
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,670
and he can't even muster the effort to pay his respects.

262
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,830
That's pretty reflective on him as a superior.

263
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,690
You know, Amon. It'll be the same when you die, too.

264
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,180
If only that one thing hadn't happened,

265
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,340
that fool would be an assistant special investigator by now.

266
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,800
It's all messed up.

267
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,810
There's going to be some action over in the 11th Ward soon.

268
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,420
When that hits, I expect you to help out,

269
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,960
so get a move on and clean up the trash in the 20th Ward already.

270
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,010
Nakajima-san...

271
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Amon-san...

272
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,280
He was single, fortunately.

273
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,750
Imagine if he had a wife.

274
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,870
He respected you a great deal.

275
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,320
What, me?

276
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,660
Here you go.

277
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,090
Where's that fellow with the glasses today?

278
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,130
A glass of cold water, please.

279
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,720
All right, water for three— two, I mean.

280
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,230
I...

281
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,240
I always order this same set.

282
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,180
That moron Kusaba would chime in every time I ordered,

283
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,120
"Again, Nakajima-san?" without fail.

284
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,890
That freeloader... He'd let me pay for his meal every time,

285
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,920
and I'd only say "Shut up and eat," for God's sake.

286
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,720
Who am I going to eat my meals with now, you moron!?

287
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,550
There's no good reason for why Kusaba-san was killed!

288
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,250
Nakajima-san, this time, please pay for my meal!

289
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,560
I can eat a lot more than Kusaba-san ever did!

290
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,060
Well, I guess I can kiss my paycheck goodbye.

291
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,540
Touka-chan!

292
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,990
What exactly are we doing?

293
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,790
You said you wanted to help me, right?

294
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah, but...

295
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,880
<i>This should do.</i>

296
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,830
All right, onto the next.

297
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,400
This time, it's your turn.

298
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
What do you mean? Wait, Touka-chan!

299
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,950
This is Mado.

300
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,650
Senior Investigator Mado,

301
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,750
we've received some eyewitness accounts regarding number 745.

302
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,330
They sounded pretty nervous, 
so it may have been another prank call,

303
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,800
but I thought you should know.

304
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,910
And?

305
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,910
I see. Thank you.

306
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,970
<i>Men who adhere to a sense of justice...</i>

307
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,470
<i>Children with their loved ones taken away from them...</i>

308
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,720
<i>Those who fought to protect someone...</i>

309
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,020
<i>Why should they have to lay down their lives?</i>

310
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,790
It'd be difficult to use a Quinque there, huh?

311
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,370
<i>A ghoul's acute sense of smell...</i>

312
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,650
<i>The Rabbit was clearly of some relation to number 745.</i>

313
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,380
<i>And now, this...</i>

314
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,230
<i>How do they all connect?</i>

315
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,020
Come on in. It's ready.

316
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,530
I'll join you for a little splashing around, Rabbit.

317
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,650
Hinami...

318
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,340
<i>I'll change it.</i>

319
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>I am going to change...</i>

320
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,300
<i>this backwards...</i>

321
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,910
<i>world of ours!</i>

322
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,120
Kaneki-kun! Kaneki-kun!

323
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,700
Oh, Uta-san?

324
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,100
Your mask is done, so I wanted to personally deliver it.

325
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,870
I'm already here anyway, so I'd like to see you put it on.

326
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,050
Yes, just like that. Yes, that's it.

327
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,240
L-Like this?

328
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,120
Good! Very good!

329
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,140
I was thinking of making a one-eyed 
mask at first to match your appearance,

330
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,660
but this was definitely the right call!

331
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,740
Thank goodness! It was worth all the effort!

332
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,920
Uta-san...
