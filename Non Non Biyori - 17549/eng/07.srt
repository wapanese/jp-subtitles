1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,750
<i>Summer vacation is over and the 
second semester starts today.</i>

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>I finished my homework and I'm 
excited to go back to school.</i>

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,980
I'm sorry! I overslept!

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,360
But it's not my fault.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,320
It's my sister's fault for not waking me up!

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,840
Wait, where's Sensei?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,840
She seems to be late today.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,400
Nee-nee's "five more minutes" in her futon...

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,580
went on for more than an
hour, so I left her there.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,110
What's with her?

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,580
I woke her up lots of times, 
but she wouldn't get up.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,590
Ah, it's her own fault for not getting up.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,560
Some teacher she is.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,390
Oh, Nee-san! Good morning!

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,630
You're making me mad.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,720
<i>The second semester has begun.</i>

17
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,460
Episode 7

18
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,460
My Rice Crackers Turned Into Curry

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,230
Grade 8 Class 1

20
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,230
+Grade 1 
+Grade 7 
+Grade 9 
+Grade 5

21
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,230
Hey...

22
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,290
Since the teacher's not here,

23
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,000
does that mean we can play 
outside until she comes?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,430
This is supposed to be class time.

25
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,870
Just find something quiet to do in here.

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,170
Hmm, how to kill time...

27
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,710
Oh, you're playing cat's cradle.

28
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,160
Yes.

29
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,090
There was some yarn left 
over from Home Ec class,

30
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,140
so I made up an original. It's a cat.

31
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,900
Wow, you can make up original ones?

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,090
I wanna play cat's cradle, too!

33
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,400
Maybe I will, too. Nothing better to do.

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,600
There's plenty of yarn. Help yourselves.

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,970
All right, I'm gonna come 
up with an original, too.

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,870
Can you even play cat's cradle, Natsumi?

37
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,100
Of course!

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,250
With my unique sensibility, 
it's a piece of cake.

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,430
There! It's done!

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,630
What do you think this is?

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,360
What is it? A house?

42
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,100
As you can see, the answer is...

43
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,050
...a piece of yarn!

44
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,960
You little...

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,150
I made an original cat's cradle, too!

46
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,570
Really? Let's see.

47
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,640
What is that?

48
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,010
I'm good at games you play by yourself.

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,660
As you can see, this is...

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,990
...something you all know...

51
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,450
...outer space!

52
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,520
Wow! It's outer space!

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,540
I knew you'd see it, Nattsun!

54
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,900
I see it, I see it!

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,110
The part by your left hand especially 
looks like outer space!

56
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,060
Actually, I'd say the middle is the good part.

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,640
Oh, I get it!

58
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,260
Um, are you being serious?

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,250
Uh-huh.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,680
Look closer. That's not outer space.

61
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Why not?

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,980
Well, it's all twisted up in the middle.

63
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,390
It looks like outer space <i>because</i> it's twisted.

64
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,730
U-Um...

65
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,720
I'll read some manga.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,310
Gave up, did you?

67
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,470
Also, you shouldn't bring manga to school.

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,240
Wow, you turned that page fast.

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
You're looking, too?

70
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,200
Oh, I like this one.

71
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,810
Oh, this?

72
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,850
I like this one, too.

73
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,900
I wanna see, too.

74
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,260
Make yourself at home...

75
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,660
What was that? Were you whistling?

76
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,990
This part is interesting!

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,720
The transition from this 
page to the next one!

78
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,710
Oh, you skipped a page here.

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,160
Looks like a new manga 
starts on the next page.

80
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,210
Oh, yeah, that really would be a big 
transition if it's a different manga.

81
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,440
I don't really care for Top Banana...

82
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,760
It got weird once it turned 
into a fighting story.

83
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,500
True...

84
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm gonna play with clay.

85
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,260
<i>Our tastes are too different 
to hold a conversation...</i>

86
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,460
Hmm, maybe I'll make 
something with clay, too.

87
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,940
Me, too.

88
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,910
Let's see, what should we make?

89
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,290
I'm still deciding.

90
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,750
Senpai, yours is cute!

91
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,790
You think so?

92
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,600
It's a clio-neko.

93
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,300
It combines a clione and a cat.

94
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,490
A clio-neko sounds so nice...

95
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,570
Darn you, making cute stuff 
when you're just Nee-chan!

96
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,430
Then again, this doesn't 
look much like a cat...

97
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,010
Nii-chan, Nii-chan!

98
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,230
Help me make a cute cat.

99
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,820
That's it! You can do it!

100
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,530
When it's done, I'll say I 
made it and show up Nee-chan!

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,730
Shouldn't you keep that secret?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,560
Wow, Nii-chan, you're pretty good!

103
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,470
What? That's awesome!

104
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,480
I can beat Nee-chan with thiâ€”

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,010
I can't show that to Ren-chon.

106
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,760
I made a moai. Isn't it cute?

107
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,520
No, it's creepy.

108
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,200
That's... a dumpling, right?

109
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,330
Or a ball?

110
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,930
Ren-chon...

111
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,160
That's a ball, right?

112
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,900
Or maybe an egg?

113
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,660
Following the trend from before,

114
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,680
it's obviously a paw pad.

115
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,190
O-Oh, a paw pad?

116
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,620
But wouldn't...

117
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,890
...this look more like a paw pad?

118
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,260
That's just a cat's paw!

119
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,120
Okay, I'm sorry!

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,430
You've all been acting weird!

121
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,930
I don't know what you're talking about!

122
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,660
Uh, sorry...

123
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,790
Wait, is that my fault?

124
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,770
Sorry. I overslept.

125
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,020
Let's start class.

126
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,110
Oh... I guess it's time 
for lunch by now.

127
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,770
Oh, I've got a good idea.

128
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,430
Let's play outside and forget 
about all these little things.

129
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,430
I wanna play!

130
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,970
Now, then...

131
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,750
Would one of you take this 
garbage out before you go home?

132
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,150
I'm going fishing, so I'll pass.

133
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,960
That was a quick refusal.

134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,540
You said when we needed to use the
incinerator, you'd take care of it.

135
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,690
I did? Guess I'll have to, then.

136
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,160
Better get it over with and go home.

137
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,660
Rabbit pen, rabbit pen...

138
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,320
Let's take care of the chickens.

139
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,970
Let's take care of the rabbits.

140
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,390
Let's groom them nice and pretty.

141
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,110
Then put it all together 
and... dynamite!

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,870
I scraped my knee.

143
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,110
Well, I would imagine...

144
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,870
When I thought about going to 
the rabbit pen, I got excited.

145
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,750
Do you like rabbits that much?

146
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,130
Of course I do!

147
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,690
Going to take care of them 
on weekends is my hobby!

148
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,880
I even came over during summer vacation 
sometimes to look after the rabbits!

149
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,350
Wow, I know how you feel.

150
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,610
I only got to take care of 
a parrot at my old school,

151
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,990
but the animal I'd like 
to care for most is...

152
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,410
A rabbit got loose!

153
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,370
You're right!

154
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,120
What should we do?!

155
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,710
Trying to catch a rabbit like 
normal only wastes time.

156
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,790
Times like these call for...

157
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,510
...corn fishing!

158
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,950
We put down this bait to 
lure it toward the pen...

159
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,400
...and put the rest of the food in the pen.

160
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,390
Then when the rabbit comes close,

161
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,450
I'll reel it in with carrots 'cause 
they like those more than corn.

162
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,490
You close the door as 
soon as it comes inside.

163
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,850
Okay, then I'll go hide.

164
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,880
I'll call out to it softly 
so it won't get scared.

165
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,260
Come on... Come on...

166
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,260
Come this way and you can 
eat lots of carrots.

167
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,680
Come on, this way.

168
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,890
Come on...

169
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,280
Instead of fishing up 
a rabbit with carrots,

170
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,370
we're the ones who fell 
hook, line and sinker.

171
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,050
Oh, good one!

172
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,800
No!

173
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,920
What?! Why?!

174
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,740
Why won't it open?!

175
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,020
It's locked from the outside.

176
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,740
I thought it was just a dumb rabbit.

177
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,090
I can't believe it planned this from the start.

178
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,860
He really got us.

179
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,120
This isn't the time to be impressed!

180
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,340
I know!

181
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,040
If we yell really loud, 
won't they hear us back at the school?

182
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,910
Hmm... I doubt it.

183
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,030
It's a long way from here to the school,

184
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,110
and we didn't tell anyone 
we were coming here,

185
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,380
so we might not even draw any attention.

186
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,150
But it's okay!

187
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,250
If worse comes to worse, the next person to
come look after the animals will find us!

188
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,460
When will that be?

189
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,000
Today's the first day of the semester, 
but it's a weekend, so...

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,400
With Saturday and Sunday in 
between, it'll be Monday.

191
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,800
Three days.

192
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,850
No! I don't want to be 
in here for three days!

193
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,080
I wanna go home!

194
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,980
Mom said she was gonna make stew today!

195
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,090
Stew! Stew! Stew!

196
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,020
C-Calm down!

197
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,510
We'll be fine for three days!

198
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,490
We have all these vegetables we 
brought to feed the animals.

199
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,460
They're kinda shriveled, though...

200
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,870
And if it comes down to it,

201
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,830
we've got chicken eggs, too!

202
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,180
There's about a 50-50 chance they'll 
have chicks in them, though...

203
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,810
Someone help!

204
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,940
Hurry up and burn, hurry up and burn.

205
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,820
Burn hotter.

206
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,620
Burn hotter.

207
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm so bored.

208
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,250
There's really no one coming...

209
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,270
Uh-huh.

210
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,750
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,690
If I hadn't tried that plan 
to lure it back with food...

212
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,030
I'm sorry, too, for losing my
head even though I'm older.

213
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,190
Since we're in this situation, 
I'll ask one more time.

214
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,890
Are you sure you don't 
want these 50-50 eggs?

215
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,240
Found another corn.

216
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,200
I'll roast it in the incinerator 
and make roasted corn.

217
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,990
What? You want some, too?

218
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,040
Go on, eat all you like.

219
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,950
Want some corn, you two?

220
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,070
Why are your eyes all 
red like the rabbits'?

221
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,930
<i>We actually caught something 
with the food...</i>

222
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,330
<i>My Nee-nee.</i>

223
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,230
No customers today, either...

224
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,160
If this keeps up, I won't 
be able to make a living.

225
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,020
<i>The truth is, I'm in danger right now.</i>

226
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,870
<i>Danger?</i>

227
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,190
<i>Hey, there's something here.</i>

228
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,610
<i>He's the reason behind it all.</i>

229
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,620
<i>His name is The Hungry Tapir.</i>

230
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,490
<i>He's a troublemaker who eats 
anything he dreams of.</i>

231
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,000
<i>Which means, since I'm a dream, 
he tries to eat me, too.</i>

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,520
<i>What?! That's terrifying!</i>

233
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,640
Why are you laughing to yourself?

234
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,160
I was watching TV.

235
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,820
You by yourself today?

236
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,390
Kazuho-senpai's not with you?

237
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,550
It's just me today.

238
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,660
Nee-nee is burning garbage.

239
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,170
Beeping Watches

240
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,900
Wanna try for a capsule?

241
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,090
It's 100 yen.

242
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,010
I have money.

243
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,560
Oh, that one's really cool.

244
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,120
You can get a watch.

245
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,540
I know how these work.

246
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,830
They make you think you'll get a watch,

247
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,120
but something weird comes out.

248
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,110
Right?

249
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
Well, you won't know until you try.

250
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,160
The capsules are black so you 
can't see inside. That proves it!

251
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,420
No, that's just how they're made...

252
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,460
If you think I'm lying, just try it!

253
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,610
I've never gotten a good prize before!

254
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,870
Fine, I will. Watch.

255
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,110
Horsetail-kun - Screaming Version

256
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,800
Sorry.

257
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,680
You can't fool me.

258
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,650
What the heck does 
"screaming version" mean?

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,890
I'm gonna look at the snacks.

260
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,720
Gotcha!

261
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,870
Candy Store! How much is this?

262
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,730
Hey, call me by name.

263
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,090
I have one, you know. 
It's Kagayama Kaede.

264
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,110
Nattsun calls you Candy Store.

265
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,600
If you copy her, 
you'll grow up to be an idiot.

266
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,890
Which one?

267
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,170
This one.

268
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,120
Cherry

269
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,120
Oh, that?

270
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,640
That one's expensive.

271
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,390
300,000 yen apiece.

272
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,860
That's expensive!

273
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,940
I thought it would be cheaper...

274
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,000
We only have really good 
stuff at this store.

275
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,240
I'll get something else.

276
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,210
I was kidding. They're thirty yen.

277
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,960
You fooled me?!

278
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Why do you keep trying to fool me?!

279
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,780
I'm not trying to fool you.

280
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,330
Besides, you caught on 
with the capsule toys.

281
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,560
Why did this one trip you up?

282
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,050
It's already 4:00!

283
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,160
You need to go home?

284
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,450
Greatman is starting!

285
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,700
What's that? A TV show?

286
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,780
Can I watch that TV?

287
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,160
It's kinda cramped.

288
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,640
Why don't you watch it 
in the living room?

289
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,170
Okay! I will!

290
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,170
Greatman

291
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,170
Greatman! That's Greatman!

292
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,970
Hm... This is the stuff 
kids watch these days?

293
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,010
Wow! Greatman!

294
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,030
I'll take you home. Hop on the bike.

295
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,500
'Kay!

296
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,330
Is it okay to leave the store?

297
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,310
No one will come anyway.

298
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,760
Wasn't Greatman awesome?

299
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,020
Nope, not at all.

300
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,460
Greatman Punch!

301
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,490
You wanna walk?

302
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
Doesn't this bike go vroom vroom?

303
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,870
It's dangerous to ride double.

304
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,540
You're pretty serious for a delinquent.

305
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,860
I'm not a delinquent.

306
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,310
Okay, we're here.

307
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,340
'Kay.

308
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,580
I'm home!

309
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,550
Welcome back.

310
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,710
Nee-nee, you're home?

311
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,910
Yeah.

312
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,170
Hey.

313
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,110
Oh, Kaede's with you?

314
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,330
I brought her home since it got dark.

315
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,460
So you didn't come straight home?

316
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,960
She let me watch Greatman!

317
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,740
Sorry about that.

318
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,560
That smell...

319
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,100
Is that curry?!

320
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,970
Nee-nee, are we having curry today?!

321
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,370
Yep. Leave your backpack there.

322
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,390
Well, I'm heading back.

323
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,450
Really? So soon?

324
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,850
Yeah, I left the store open.

325
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,500
Thanks for bringing Renge.

326
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,590
Sure thing.

327
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,460
All she got was the whole package 
of rice crackers I gave her.

328
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,970
This is probably the main reason why I'm poor.

329
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,150
Candy Store!

330
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,640
What's up?

331
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,080
Take this!

332
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,120
Curry?

333
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,050
I got Nee-nee to pack you some.

334
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,480
Let's play Greatman together sometime!

335
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,980
If I feel like it.

336
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,460
Okay, you can be the hostess of 
the bar he goes to all the time!

337
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,860
I take it back, you brat.

338
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,780
Later.

339
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,790
Or you can be a monster!

340
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,250
<i>I guess I can spare the rice crackers.</i>

341
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,290
The new semester started today.

342
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,070
I played cat's cradle and looked 
after the animals. It was fun.

343
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,070
Then I watched Greatman at the 
candy store. That was fun, too.

344
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,070
It was fun when the konpeito 
hatched from the egg.

345
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:19,350
That's all for today

346
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,410
<i>Talking about "grown-up stuff" 
means talking about love!</i>

347
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,760
<i>I-I'm not flustered! I'm perfectly calm!</i>

348
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,200
<i>Is there someone you like?</i>

349
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,950
<i>Senpai! I'll draw you too, so make a cute pose!</i>

350
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,440
Episode 8

351
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,440
We Cooked Rice at School
