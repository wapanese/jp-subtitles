1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,920
Closing Ceremony!

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,920
We had our second semester 
closing ceremony,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,220
and winter break started.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,370
Now it's already the end of the year.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,570
Are you in charge of the rabbits 
over winter break, Nee-nee?

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,870
No, people from around town 
are taking care of them,

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,590
but everyone's busy around New Year's...

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,650
Rabbits don't hibernate?

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,010
Apparently not.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,080
Well, we'd better head home 
and get ready for New Year's.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,370
We'll be back soon, rabbits.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,460
Brr, it's cold...

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,950
Natsumi, what are you doing?

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,580
At least clean your own room.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,130
Can't I do it tomorrow?

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,240
It'll already be the new year then.

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,740
Happy New Year

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,710
It's done! The New Year's version!

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,670
This is great. Koma-plushies are great.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,550
Hotaru, help me shell these peas.

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,160
Okay!

22
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,530
Nee-chan! Renge!

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,920
What?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,590
Mom's still making the osechi,

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,990
so she said to go ahead and 
eat the New Year's soba.

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,220
Nee-chan, are you listening?

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,260
She's asleep.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,920
What?

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,750
Nee-chan! New Year's soba!

30
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,650
Later...

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,580
The year's gonna end, you know.

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,210
I won't sleep... until it's time to eat...

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,460
Episode 10

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,460
We Watched the First Sunrise of the Year

35
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,060
We've gotta get moving.

36
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,840
Yeah.

37
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,120
Think the weather will be okay?

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,340
It's supposed to be clear.

39
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,950
Senpai, did you get the tea and hand warmers?

40
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,870
Uh...

41
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,870
Oops. I think I forgot the hand warmers.

42
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,460
Hurry it up. We'll miss the first sunrise.

43
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,700
Yeah, yeah. Just a sec, I'll get them.

44
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, Ren-chon...

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,590
When did you wake up?

46
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm going, too.

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm going to watch the first sunrise.

48
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,730
But it's still late. You should go back to sleep.

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,840
I slept enough.

50
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,180
I'm going to watch the first sunrise, too!

51
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,860
Renge, we'll be climbing a mountain.

52
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,990
You should stay home this time.

53
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,070
I don't want to stay home.

54
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,970
You're going to watch it, too, Candy Store?

55
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,560
Well, I'm the one who invited Senpai, so yeah.

56
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,970
I wanna go watch the first sunrise, too!

57
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,780
I'll do what I'm told.

58
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,350
I'll eat foods I don't like.

59
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,430
First sunrise...

60
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,340
You won't be picky?

61
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,650
You'll even eat your carrots?

62
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,790
Yes!

63
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,860
And spinach?

64
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,050
Yes!

65
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,340
What about peppers?

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,590
Yes.

67
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,630
You paused that time.

68
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,790
I will!

69
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,230
Senpai, Renge says she'll eat her peppers.

70
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,250
Oh, really?

71
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,360
All right, then.

72
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,960
Go get yourself some clothes.

73
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,010
I'll change right now!

74
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,550
There's no time, so just change in the car.

75
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,660
We can drive part of the way.

76
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,450
Okay!

77
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,050
Watch for Deer

78
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,170
Okay, we'll have to walk from here.

79
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,410
Hikage, open the door for her.

80
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,440
'Kay.

81
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,920
It's so dark.

82
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,000
I've never seen such a dark mountain before.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,680
Yeah, it's not even 4:00 AM yet.

84
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,760
Well, we have two flashlights. 
Who's carrying them?

85
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,610
Me! I'll carry a flashlight!

86
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,250
Okay, Ren-chon can take one,

87
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,300
and I guess I'll take the other one.

88
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,910
Okay, Renge and Hikage will 
carry the flashlights.

89
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,240
Okay.

90
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,120
Not nice. Ignoring me is 
not nice. Don't do that.

91
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,350
Uh, what's with that mask?

92
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,410
Our grandpa used to use this for 
working the fields in winter.

93
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,610
It's really warm.

94
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,770
You should probably leave your
hair down when you wear that.

95
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,180
Your head looks like an alien.

96
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,970
It does?

97
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,000
Hey, don't try to go up alone.

98
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,190
We have to hurry or the sun will come up!

99
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,710
I know. We'll go together.

100
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,880
Hey, how long do we have to climb?

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,730
About one hour.

102
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,550
One—

103
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,560
S-Seriously?

104
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,180
Nee-nee, it's okay.

105
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,030
If you sing while you walk, 
it'll give you energy.

106
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,340
Sing, huh?

107
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,510
Yes, sing.

108
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,400
A quack doctor, in the depths of despair,

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,980
walked into a bamboo grove,

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,830
suddenly, out of the blue,

111
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,610
with a torn-up love letter in hand...

112
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,450
A quack doctor, in the depths of despair,

113
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,450
That's one harsh song.

114
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,000
walked into a bamboo grove,

115
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,250
She's trying her hardest 
to keep walking, though.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,550
suddenly, out of the blue,

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,320
with a torn-up love letter in hand...

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,600
Five years ago, she was 
still just a baby...

119
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,200
Oh, that's right, when our 
family was busy with the farm,

120
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,870
A quack doctor, in the depths of despair,

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,050
we used to have you watch Renge.

122
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,430
walked into a bamboo grove,

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,750
Yeah. I think she was one 
when I first watched her.

124
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,020
suddenly, out of the blue,

125
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,890
Nationwide Weather Forecast

126
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,890
<i>It will be sunny across 
Japan today, perfect for—</i>

127
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,230
<i>It's time for "My Prize Cow!"</i>

128
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,090
<i>A hit! It's a big one!</i>

129
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,260
<i>It's going, going...</i>

130
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,200
<i>Gone!</i>

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,780
<i>A three-run home run to take the lead!</i>

132
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,540
I'm so bored.

133
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,390
It's finally Sunday, 
and here I am just watching TV.

134
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,970
Maybe I should ask someone to...

135
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,840
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,220
Hello? This is Miyauchi.

137
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,210
Oh, Hikage? Perfect timing.

138
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,850
I was really bored.

139
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,770
<i>Really? That's perfect!</i>

140
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,160
Are you bored, too?

141
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,820
Well, to cut right to the chase...

142
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,060
Could you come watch Renge?

143
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,900
<i>Huh? What do you mean?</i>

144
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,710
Well, exactly what I said.

145
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,720
Our parents are out working the fields,

146
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,160
and Nee-chan is staying in a 
house closer to her college.

147
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,250
And our neighbor who usually 
watches Renge isn't home...

148
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,690
So could you just keep an eye 
on her for a little bit?

149
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,780
Our parents said they'd pay you.

150
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,820
Aren't you still home?

151
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,160
Well, I've got something to do, too...

152
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,050
What? I'm not really good with babies.

153
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,790
Can't you ask Konomi?

154
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,700
She seems to like kids.

155
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,870
Well... I'm going to town with Konomi.

156
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,650
<i>Why couldn't you invite me for that?!</i>

157
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,930
<i>By the way, how much will they pay?</i>

158
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,150
Get ready to be surprised.

159
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,940
5000 yen.

160
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,450
Hey.

161
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,160
I can't believe how fast that got you here.

162
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,260
It's true I came for the money, 
but that kind of ticked me off.

163
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,260
Easy, easy...

164
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,530
Okay, I'm going out.

165
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,030
Renge's all yours.

166
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,470
Oh... Yeah.

167
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,410
Um, is there anything I should know?

168
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,700
There's a note on the living room table

169
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,030
with instructions for heating 
her bottle and stuff.

170
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,250
Oh, okay.

171
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,640
If anything comes up, 
our parents are in the fields.

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,990
Later, then.

173
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,810
Renge, look. A vapor trail.

174
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,980
What? What's wrong?

175
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,720
Hey, chill out!

176
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,940
Are you upset because Hikage left?

177
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,090
She'll be right back. It's okay.

178
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,660
Oh, I know! Look! You're way up high!

179
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,200
Ow!

180
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,500
Is that too high for you?

181
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,490
Here, how about this?

182
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,010
No? Then...

183
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,340
You're way down low!

184
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,350
Why the heck...

185
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,730
If you liked being way down low, 
why'd you cry in the first place?

186
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,320
Is this the note Hikage was talking about?

187
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,730
Let's see...

188
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,890
"1. Renge likes her rattle."

189
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,030
This one?

190
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,820
Look, it's your rattle.

191
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,810
Here. You like this, right?

192
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,570
Hey!

193
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,620
What are you mad about?

194
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,980
What's your problem? You like this, don't you?

195
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,010
Okay, fine.

196
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,650
And here I was trying to play with you...

197
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,930
This is why I don't like babies.

198
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,250
I don't know what they're thinking.

199
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,070
Guess I should read the note again.

200
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,180
"2. Milk should match 
your body temperature.

201
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,050
Start on low heat and then turn it up.

202
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,130
Don't start crying, even 
if the baby does." What?!

203
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,370
"3. You can evade her binky bomb 
if you watch for the signs."

204
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,300
Binky bomb?

205
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,040
That thing turns into a bomb?

206
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,790
"4. For some reason, fur seal 
calls make her stop crying.

207
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,050
5. If you approach with her rattle when 
she's playing with something else,

208
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,480
she'll think you're picking on 
her and get mad, so be careful."

209
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,020
You should've made that number one!

210
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,230
Is this the right heat?

211
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,360
It'll be ready soon, okay?

212
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,490
Renge?

213
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,480
Oh, there you are. 
Don't wander around like that.

214
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,410
Whoa! Kitty punch!

215
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,390
Renge, are you okay?

216
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,020
Don't cry.

217
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,230
Ah, don't cry! Don't cry! Don't cry!

218
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,500
Oh, yeah, the milk!

219
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,010
Crap! The bottle—

220
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,930
Ow!

221
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,260
Just wait a second!

222
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,190
Childcare... is hard...

223
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,380
I didn't know just giving a 
kid milk was this hard...

224
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,080
Parents sure have it rough.

225
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,600
Jeez.

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,770
It wasn't easy getting that milk to match
my body temperature, you know.

227
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,370
You better appreciate it.

228
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,060
Don't make yourself at home on my lap.

229
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,430
You're heavy. Get off.

230
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,830
Hey, you hear me?

231
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,240
I don't know what you're saying.

232
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,430
Come on, get off.

233
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,490
Mama!

234
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,970
No, I'm not Mama... I'm, uh...

235
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,790
Cattle Crossing

236
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,420
I'm home. Sorry I'm a little late.

237
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,540
How'd it go, Candy Store?

238
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,170
Was Renge okay?

239
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,170
Huh?

240
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,890
Where'd they go?

241
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,050
Hey, are you in here?

242
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,480
Cand—

243
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,390
Peach Boy

244
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,400
Hey.

245
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,790
Is Renge here?

246
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,230
Yeah, but why?

247
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,100
We have people here to watch her today,

248
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,690
so you won't get 5000 yen.

249
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,440
I didn't come for that.

250
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,810
Or is this like, calling someone 
out behind the school?

251
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,760
As if...

252
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,940
Hang on.

253
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,230
I brought her a snack.

254
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,090
Milky Biscuits

255
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,120
Renge can eat these, right?

256
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,640
Yeah, she can eat biscuits.

257
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,600
There were some leftover at the store.

258
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,610
It seemed like a waste to throw 
them out, so I brought them.

259
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,700
Whoa, we can't give expired 
snacks to a baby.

260
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,670
I never said they were expired!

261
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,300
They just came in!

262
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,940
Huh? How can they be leftover, then?

263
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,900
Shut up!

264
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,660
They're new, but these were 
extra! That's fine, right?

265
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,410
I'm coming in!

266
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,350
What are those ribbons?

267
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,970
Oh, Konomi recommended new 
hair ties for me yesterday,

268
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,500
so I don't need them anymore.

269
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,430
If you don't need them, can I have them?

270
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,320
Sure, but what for?

271
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,370
Hey, Nee-chan's gone!

272
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm gonna look for her.

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,560
That's weird...

274
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,360
I've been singing, but I'm tired...

275
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,200
Well, considering the song...

276
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,420
Was that thing about how singing 
gives you energy a lie?

277
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,150
Don't worry. It's not a lie, Renge.

278
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,230
The one who wasn't singing is even worse off.

279
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,950
This looks bad.

280
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,030
It looks like she's trying to say 
something, but I can't hear a word.

281
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,820
Senpai, it won't be much 
longer, so hang in there.

282
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,380
Hear that? We're almost there.

283
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,540
You okay, Renge?

284
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,190
If you're tired, we can take a break.

285
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,110
I'm okay. I wanna watch the first sunrise.

286
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,420
A quack doctor, in the depths of despair...

287
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,330
Renge.

288
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,520
You're walking on the way back, got it?

289
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,590
You sure are heavy...

290
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,640
This is much easier!

291
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,060
That so?

292
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,610
Ca—

293
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,550
What? I can't hear you.

294
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,630
Carry me.

295
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,410
Idiot! Just walk!

296
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,760
We made it.

297
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,370
Okay, get down.

298
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,350
I won't do that on the way back.

299
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,250
Okay. Thank you.

300
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,640
This is the place?

301
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,050
It does look like a good vantage point,

302
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,980
but it's pretty drab scenery.

303
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,660
What does it matter if it's drab?

304
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,780
What we're here to look 
at will be far away.

305
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,400
Candy Store, can we climb up there?

306
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,790
Well, we can see the sunrise 
fine from down here, but...

307
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,980
We still have time. Let's have some tea.

308
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,690
Here.

309
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,180
The sky is getting brighter.

310
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,870
Is the sun coming up?

311
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,510
If you look away, you'll miss 
the moment it comes up.

312
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,190
Oh, looks like the sun's coming.

313
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,730
Where?! I won't miss it!

314
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,920
The sun came up!

315
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,420
It came up! The sun!

316
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,930
Happy New Year!

317
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,390
Yeah, Happy New Year.

318
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,190
Hey, the sun's up.

319
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,960
Hika-nee!

320
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,890
Yeah?

321
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,490
The sun's up!

322
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,790
It sure is.

323
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,070
You awake?

324
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,370
I'm awake.

325
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,650
Well, we've seen the first 
sunrise of the year. What now?

326
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,550
Time for our New Year's allowance!

327
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,500
Nope.

328
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,810
I wanna eat ozouni!

329
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,370
Yeah. Let's head back home and eat ozouni.

330
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,350
I'll eat as many mochi as years in my age!

331
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,520
How old are you again, Renge?

332
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,290
I'm seven now.

333
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,710
Seven?

334
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,270
Wait, isn't seven mochi too much?

335
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,410
It's fine! I'll eat my ozouni!

336
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,770
And I'll eat seven mochi!

337
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,180
I'm telling you, that's too much.

338
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,380
Hey, where's Candy Store?

339
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,380
Did she go home?

340
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,450
No, she's still here.

341
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:19,380
That's all for today

342
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,440
<i>My arm! My arm!</i>

343
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,880
<i>Hotarun is running through 
the hallway at night alone!</i>

344
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,170
<i>Senpai! Hold out your hand!</i>

345
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,900
<i>Wham bang boom! Wham bang boom!</i>

346
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,440
<i>Wham bang boom boom boom!</i>
