1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,720
<i>My name is Ichijou Hotaru.</i>

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,990
<i>I'm in fifth grade.</i>

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,760
Grade 8 Class 1

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,760
+Grade 1 
+Grade 7 
+Grade 9 
+Grade 5

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,760
<i>I used to go to school in Tokyo,</i>

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,920
<i>but my parents had to move,
so I transferred to this school.</i>

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
<i>And it seems,</i>

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>when I begin life in a new place,</i>

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,030
<i>my school environment changes, too.</i>

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,110
<i>The first change is:</i>

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,310
<i>These are the only students 
in the whole school.</i>

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>Just five of us.</i>

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,350
<i>The second is:</i>

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,850
<i>There are elementary and middle school 
students mixed into one class.</i>

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,980
<i>The third is:</i>

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,860
<i>Since we're in different grades,</i>

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,010
<i>we mostly study on our own in class.</i>

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,530
<i>That's probably why our teacher is...</i>

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,580
<i>...sleeping.</i>

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,420
Why is this cat square?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,470
Episode 2

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,470
We Went to the Candy Store

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,500
<i>Now, I'll introduce the other 
students at this school.</i>

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,310
I finished my worksheet!

25
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,260
<i>This is the first grader, Renge-chan.</i>

26
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,380
I can't figure this one out at all...

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,850
<i>This is the seventh grader, Natsumi-senpai.</i>

28
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,800
<i>And this is Natsumi-senpai's older sister,</i>

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,550
<i>the eighth grader, Komari-senpai.</i>

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
Nee-chan, do you understand this question?

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,850
If you do, can you do it for me?

32
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,840
Why should I?

33
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,480
<i>And this is the ninth grader, Suguru-senpai.</i>

34
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,310
<i>He's Natsumi-senpai and 
Komari-senpai's brother.</i>

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,630
Do I take this to the 
teacher when I'm done?

36
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,910
Yeah. After you turn it in, 
you can start lunch break.

37
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,740
Okay, I'll take it!

38
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,050
<i>The teacher, Miyauchi-sensei, 
is Renge-chan's sister.</i>

39
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,340
Nee-nee, I'm done!

40
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,210
Oh, you're done, huh?

41
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,060
There! Break time!

42
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,290
It's no use. I just don't get it.

43
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,270
I'm gonna miss lunch break at this rate.

44
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm done for...

45
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,130
As long as I'm done, I should take my break.

46
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,870
So can I start my break now?

47
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,570
What are you talking about?

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,170
Well, if you admit that you're 
finished as a human being,

49
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,410
I can't stop you.

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,300
But you should think long and 
hard about that before you act.

51
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,660
"Think long and hard," she says...

52
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,130
Anyone want to go play ball?

53
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,150
I do!

54
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,340
You haven't thought about anything.

55
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,920
Hey! No running in the hall!

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Okay.

57
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,910
Honestly...

58
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,290
<i>Komari-senpai's nickname is Koma-chan.</i>

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,060
<i>That nickname was taken...</i>

60
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,060
<i>...not from her name,</i>

61
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,210
but from her size.

62
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,210
Komai means small.

63
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,270
<i>At first, I just thought of 
her as a small senpai.</i>

64
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,040
Oh, Hotaru, what's our next class?

65
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,810
I think it's art.

66
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,560
<i>But now I think she's so cute, I can't stand it!</i>

67
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,220
<i>Senpai's looking at me!</i>

68
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,210
<i>I just want to pet that little head.</i>

69
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,510
<i>I bet it's so soft...</i>

70
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,950
<i>She has her hand on her cheek... 
Does she have a toothache?</i>

71
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,700
Aww, what are you doing, Koma-chan?

72
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,910
We set that trap to drop 
the eraser on Sensei.

73
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,950
The eraser's sitting right 
on top of her head.

74
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,420
Your hair's white now, Koma-chan.

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,990
Don't call me Koma-chan!

76
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,010
Why are you more mad about 
that than about the eraser?

77
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,950
I'm your older sister!

78
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm the oldest one here!

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,750
Call me Onee-san!

80
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,490
Okay, I get it. Relax. Chop.

81
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,750
Why are you hitting me?!

82
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,730
I'm not the one who did something dumb!

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,100
Apologize to your big sister!

84
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,710
For the eraser, too! On your knees!

85
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,990
'Cause even if you are my older 
sister, you don't look it.

86
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,350
Apologizing for the eraser comes second?

87
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,490
Come on, both of you, calm down.

88
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,190
Natsumi-senpai, you shouldn't pick 
on Koma-chan-senpai so much.

89
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,500
I wasn't trying to pick on Koma-chan...

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,820
Koma-chan, fight!

91
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,960
Don't call me Koma-chan!

92
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
Koma-ch—

93
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,350
I mean, Senpai... I'll get 
the chalk out of your hair.

94
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,080
<i>Huh? Would this be petting her head?</i>

95
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,330
Don't rub chalk into my Koma-chan!

96
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,100
Y-You're mistaken!

97
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,370
On Duty:
Koshigaya
(younger)

98
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,060
Man, that was terrible.

99
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,370
Candy...

100
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,950
Stare.

101
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,770
Lucky. You have candy.

102
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,440
You sniffed it out fast...

103
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
Huh? What's up?

104
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,660
I found candy. The new milk cola flavor.

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,130
You hyenas...

106
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,630
You shouldn't bring candy 
to school, Koma-chan.

107
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,760
I told you, don't call me Koma-chan!

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,470
I bought it at the candy store yesterday
and forgot to take it out of my bag.

109
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,990
I'm in eighth grade now, you know.

110
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,810
I've gotta keep up with the 
trends, as a grown woman.

111
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,810
What good does it do to keep 
up with candy store trends?

112
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,780
Who cares about that? I want candy!

113
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,660
Oh! Me, too! Me, too!

114
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,880
What?!

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,700
No way! Not after what you said before!

116
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,180
Huh? I didn't do it on purpose.

117
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,710
Yeah! Yeah! That's right!

118
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,900
Before I'd give this to you guys...

119
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,540
Hotaru, I'll give it to you.

120
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,900
What? But...

121
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,340
Are you sure?

122
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,900
Yeah!

123
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,270
Here!

124
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,440
Hey! Give me some!

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,650
Give me some!

126
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,020
Shut up!

127
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,300
Gimme! Gimme!

128
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,000
Candy! I want candy!

129
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>Senpai gave me something 
for the first time!</i>

130
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,230
<i>It's just candy...</i>

131
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,330
<i>But I'm so happy!</i>

132
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,370
<i>Why does this make me so happy?</i>

133
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,470
<i>I won't eat this.
 I'll keep it in my desk drawer.</i>

134
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,540
Ren-chon, Ren-chon...

135
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,850
Let's nail Koma-chan by 
turning on the waterworks.

136
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,860
Then maybe she'll give us candy.

137
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,190
What?!

138
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,600
Koma-chan, Koma-chan.

139
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Don't call me Koma-ch—

140
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,980
We've known each other for 
a long time, haven't we?

141
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,300
What's all this?!

142
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,760
It was so much fun...

143
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,780
...when we wrote those cool words on
your forehead while you were asleep.

144
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,640
It wasn't fun for me!

145
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,610
And I gave you a bite of my flan yesterday.

146
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,050
Just one bite!

147
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,190
Besides, that flan was mine!

148
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,160
One bite of flan is the same 
size as a piece of candy!

149
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,410
I guess that's true.

150
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,090
I love simple-minded girls.

151
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:25,270
Yay! Candy! Yay! Candy!

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,860
Hotaru, they're being a pain, 
so could I have the candy ba—

153
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,860
B-But...

154
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,010
I... I was so happy to get candy from you...

155
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,360
Er, well, it's not like we wanted it <i>that</i> bad...

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,020
U-Um... Hotaru-sama?

157
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,280
We can't beat those waterworks.

158
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,360
Go ahead and keep it.

159
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,340
<i>Yay! Yay!</i>

160
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,870
<i>I don't really get how, but I just got candy!</i>

161
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,610
<i>I never thought something 
so wonderful could happen!</i>

162
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,940
<i>Hooray for candy!</i>

163
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,950
<i>I hope this feeling will reach Senpai someday!</i>

164
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,950
Was it a good idea to give her 
candy if she has a toothache?

165
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,810
Hotarun has a toothache?

166
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,950
I don't know.

167
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,710
Hotaru.

168
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,980
Yes?

169
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,390
Phone call from your friend.

170
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,690
My friend?

171
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,030
Who's "my friend"?

172
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,360
Hello?

173
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,330
Hello, Hotaru?

174
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,370
It's me, Komari.

175
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,770
<i>S-Sorry!</i>

176
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,630
It's the first time you've called me,

177
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,740
and I was so surprised I dropped the phone.

178
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,310
<i>Did you need something?</i>

179
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,240
No, it's nothing important,

180
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,440
but I'm close to your house,

181
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
and thought I'd call to see if 
you wanted to hang out. Yeah.

182
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,450
<i>I do! I do! Yes!</i>

183
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,220
Okay, I'll be around the 
phone booth near your place.

184
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,300
Got it!

185
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,900
See you soon, then.

186
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,760
Okay!

187
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Uh, you can hang up first.

188
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,040
I'm going to hang out with Senpai...

189
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,050
What am I gonna do?!

190
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,560
I have to fix my hair!

191
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,510
And I should at least wear lipstick...

192
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,010
Mom! Do you have any nice clothes?

193
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,450
What about the ones you just bought?

194
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,800
I want something more grown-up!

195
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,230
Jeez...

196
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,040
I bought this grown-up dress,

197
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,280
and Natsumi and Renge don't even care.

198
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,270
They're both useless.

199
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,310
S-Sorry!

200
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,010
Sorry to keep you waiting!

201
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,160
So, where should we...?

202
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,970
I-Is something wrong?

203
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,880
<i>Wh-Who is this lady?!</i>

204
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,960
Um, I still don't know this town very well,

205
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,510
so I'd appreciate it if you 
could show me around...

206
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,990
W-Wait, you mean you're from out of town?

207
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,690
Yes... From Tokyo.

208
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,610
<i>I get it. She's here from Tokyo, and she's lost?</i>

209
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,470
Um, where would you like to go?

210
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,980
W-Well, I...

211
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,630
I'd like to visit the candy store.

212
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,210
You came all the way from Tokyo 
and you pick a candy store?!

213
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,950
W-We can't?

214
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,980
Uh, no, I didn't mean that!

215
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,580
Th-Then let's hurry!

216
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,120
U-Um...

217
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,320
<i>I have to wait for Hotaru 
so I can show her around...</i>

218
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,040
<i>I'll have to handle this like a grown-up.</i>

219
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,380
Uh, I'm sorry, but I'm actually...

220
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,860
Is something wrong?

221
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,550
<i>Uh...</i>

222
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,440
<i>Like a grown-up... Like a grown-up...</i>

223
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,770
Um...

224
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,850
My mom and sister told me not 
to go anywhere with strangers!

225
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,160
<i>D-Darn it!</i>

226
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,260
<i>That wasn't grown-up at all!</i>

227
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,170
I agree with that...

228
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,910
But can we just go to 
the candy store now?

229
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,370
<i>Huh?</i>

230
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,870
U-Um...

231
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,810
I...

232
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,780
I'm supposed to be waiting for someone...

233
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,890
W-Wait a second...

234
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,130
<i>I ended up coming with her.</i>

235
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,830
<i>This is weird. I thought I told her no.</i>

236
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,400
<i>What the heck went wrong?</i>

237
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,830
Um...

238
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,460
Where is the candy store, again?

239
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,170
Um, well...

240
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,570
If you go straight down this 
road, there's a tunnel.

241
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,650
Once you go through that,
it'll be right in front of you.

242
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,560
A tunnel?

243
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,330
Is it safe for people to walk through it?

244
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,930
Oh, it's a small one that only locals use.

245
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,540
Oh...

246
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,990
I-Is this it?

247
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,540
Yes.

248
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,510
But it's pitch dark, even during the day.

249
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,560
If you're scared, there's a longer way around.

250
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,280
Of course, you want to go back, right?

251
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,000
If a ghost were to show up—

252
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,250
What?!

253
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,540
<i>How can she have such a relaxed 
smile in a scary tunnel like this?</i>

254
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,680
<i>Is this...</i>

255
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,460
<i>...what they call a grown-up's composure?</i>

256
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,950
<i>A candy store with Senpai...</i>

257
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,500
Is that it over there?

258
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,350
The candy store!

259
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,630
I've never been to a real candy store before!

260
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,280
Really?

261
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,110
What should we buy?

262
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,250
Uh, I don't have very much money...

263
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,810
Let me buy you something.

264
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,530
To thank you for showing me the way.

265
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,100
O-Okay...

266
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
There's so much...

267
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,540
...candy!

268
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,050
Welcome.

269
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,610
H-Hello.

270
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,110
Hi.

271
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,000
Hey.

272
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,320
Let's see... What should I get?

273
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,790
Shaved Ice

274
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,590
Shaved ice already?

275
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,220
Hey, is shaved ice all right?

276
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,800
Uh, sure.

277
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Then, two shaved ices, please.

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,740
What flavor would you like?

279
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,940
Condensed Milk - Green Tea & Red Bean - Strawberry - Lemon

280
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,940
Green tea and red bean.

281
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,920
<i>Green tea and red bean?!</i>

282
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,050
Got it.

283
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,910
Green Tea & Red Bean
700 yen

284
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,910
<i>That's expensive!</i>

285
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,250
I'll be paying with...

286
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,810
...a 10,000 yen bill.

287
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,780
<i>10,000 yen?!</i>

288
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,550
<i>Is this...?</i>

289
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,030
<i>Is this what they call...</i>

290
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,590
<i>...grown-up shopping?!</i>

291
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,640
<i>I'm glad I saved my New Year's money!</i>

292
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,750
Maybe it's a little too early in 
the season for shaved ice?

293
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,870
Oh, no. It's warm today, anyway.

294
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,610
<i>The green tea is bitter...</i>

295
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,010
<i>Do grown-ups always eat stuff like this?</i>

296
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,090
<i>I got carried away and bought the 
bitter kind to show off to Senpai...</i>

297
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,770
<i>But even the bitter kind is 
good if I'm with Senpai!</i>

298
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,450
<i>It looks delicious, but it's bitter.</i>

299
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,110
<i>It's bitter, but it looks delicious.</i>

300
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,410
<i>I guess you can't be a grown-up 
if you can't eat bitter stuff?</i>

301
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,030
It's so nice and peaceful.

302
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,280
I never lived anywhere 
but in Tokyo before,

303
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,320
so I was really worried 
about coming here.

304
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,340
But it's a nice place.

305
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,810
<i>I see...</i>

306
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,400
<i>I guess grown-ups have a lot on their minds.</i>

307
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,810
Thank you for everything today.

308
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,200
Oh, no, I should thank you.

309
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,460
Well, goodbye.

310
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,710
So that's... a grown woman...

311
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,390
Sh-Sh-Sh-

312
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,560
She's so cool!

313
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,140
So that's what happened.

314
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,000
I think that's the kind of 
grown-up I'll try to become.

315
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,910
Yeah?

316
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,110
So, who was she, anyway?

317
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,210
I forgot to ask her name.

318
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,020
King General

319
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,670
Oh... Hotaru!

320
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,340
Hotaru, phone for you.

321
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,580
Okay!

322
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,700
<i>Hello, Hotaru?</i>

323
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>I'm sorry about today! I'm really sorry!</i>

324
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,430
Huh?

325
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:19,310
That's all for today

326
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,210
<i>Time for a fun, fun class outing!</i>

327
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,070
<i>Yeah. I'm laughing, all right.</i>

328
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,440
<i>Rice balls made by Senpai...</i>

329
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,760
<i>Of course I'm not scared!</i>

330
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,070
<i>Because your behavior is always so poor!</i>

331
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,410
<i>We're running away!</i>

332
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,440
Episode 3
