00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>Autumn...</i>

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,500
<i>To a grown woman, it's a time to 
breathe a sigh and get sentimental...</i>

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,950
I caught some fish!

4
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,460
I picked eggplants!

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,470
Wow, those are pretty big.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,490
That pumpkin's pretty big, too.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,490
They look yummy!

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,790
We're gonna stew them together!

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,840
Hotaru

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,650
Aren't we grilling them?

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,640
Grill?

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,610
Okay, okay.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,260
Yes, grill.

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,540
Go ahead and skewer them.

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,950
'Kay.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,950
I can't wait!

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,270
Are you okay, Senpai?!

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,850
It's hopeless.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,640
I can't get sentimental at all!

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,660
You get it?

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,470
This is a highly relevant class on 
experiencing the tastes of fall.

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,860
Yes.

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,210
And now...

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,540
When you drain the water,

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,300
make sure there are no spaces 
between your fingers,

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,590
and no rice will fall out.

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,980
Senpai, be careful!

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,650
Huh?! Wh-What?

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,380
Senpai, you need to make a 
cat's paw with your left hand.

30
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,610
A cat's paw?

31
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,880
It's dangerous to leave 
your fingers extended,

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,390
so you fold them like this.

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,810
O-Oh, yeah!

34
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, kitty hands...

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,440
The cut part disappeared...

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,150
It came this way.

37
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,560
Um, I can at least season them...

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,950
It's fine!

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,660
I'm gonna cook a delicious meal and show
you all what a good Onee-san I am.

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,690
But...

41
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,380
I'll take care of it! 
Sit down and wait!

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,560
Okay.

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,380
How much of the seasonings 
do we use, again?

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,220
Um, for that amount of rice,

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,280
two tablespoons of sake, 
one tablespoon of mirin,

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,830
and a little salt and soy 
sauce should be fine.

47
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,380
That's right! Okay!

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,850
Leave this to Onee-san!

49
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,140
It's hot.

50
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,300
Be careful.

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,040
Ah, hot...

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,450
The rice should be ready by now.

53
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,650
Let's see, how did it turn out?

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,910
Why does it sound like that?

55
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,780
And the grains are all separated...

56
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,100
Hey, Nee-chan, what did you do?!

57
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,930
What did I do? I cut the 
potatoes, I seasoned it...

58
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,460
And I... Um...

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,510
I forgot to put the water in.

60
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,010
<i>That's way too basic...</i>

61
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,470
Episode 8

62
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,470
We Cooked Rice at School

63
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,080
Oh, Konomi-chan.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,980
I brought that magazine...

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,140
Oh! Are you the transfer 
student I've heard about?

66
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,690
Huh? Uh, yes...

67
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,760
I thought so! Nice to meet you!

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,230
I live next door. I'm Fujimiya Konomi.

69
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,750
Oh, um... Nice to meet you.

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,740
Yep, you're just as big 
and pretty as I heard!

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,280
Okay, let's shake hands!

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,320
Um, I'm Hotaru.

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,570
Yeah? Nice to meet you, Hotaru-chan!

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,700
So, what were you doing?

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,820
Actually...

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,470
I splurged a while ago and 
bought a portable CD player.

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,650
It feels like I took a step 
up the stairs to adulthood.

78
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,830
Not an MP3 player?

79
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,520
MP3 player?

80
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
What's that? A game?

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,680
You can't use any magic with these.

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,060
No, not MP for magic points...

83
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,790
Well, if you don't know 
what it is, never mind.

84
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,200
Anyway, I bought the most popular CD,

85
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,260
and it's so grown-up and sentimental!

86
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,800
Do you listen to music, Hotaru?

87
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,270
Well, I don't really know what songs 
are popular lately or anything...

88
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,240
Really? Yeah, I guess you wouldn't.

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,480
Fifth grade is still a little young for J-pop.

90
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,790
Yeah, when you were in fifth grade, 
you still carried plushies everywhere,

91
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,810
and ran around in the fields all day.

92
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,520
Huh?

93
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,890
Er, but my dad has some CDs and records,

94
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,050
so I listen to classical and Western music.

95
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,860
You listen to classical, too?

96
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,050
What? You mean you do, too, Konomi-san?

97
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,460
I listen to Western music, too.

98
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,170
Do you listen to classical 
music, Komari-senpai?

99
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,820
I know what classical music is.

100
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,780
The kind with lots of people, right?

101
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,410
Yeah, I know what that is.

102
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,960
Well, yes, that's generally true...

103
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,340
But that's a broad description.

104
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,260
Y-Yeah, you're right! 
Classical is great, too! Uh-huh!

105
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,620
It's like, you know... Uh...

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,670
A lot of the people hold sticks, right?

107
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,300
Like for violins and drums and 
triangles, and the conductor's wand...

108
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,180
Komari-chan, do you really 
listen to classical music?

109
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,430
What kind do you listen to?

110
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,810
What kind? Um...

111
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,280
L-Like, the Frog Song and stuff...

112
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,540
Isn't that a children's song?

113
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,140
I-I'm not flustered! I'm perfectly calm!

114
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,520
That's not what I meant...

115
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340
What kind do you listen to, Hotaru-chan?

116
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,190
Well, let me see...

117
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,670
I like Vivaldi's "Spring" from his "Four Seasons,"

118
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,820
but "Summer" is also really 
powerful, so I like it, too.

119
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,160
"Winter" is also nice.

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,570
When I listen to it with my dad's 
headphones, it sounds so much better!

121
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,770
Really? Let me try it sometime!

122
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,160
What Western music do you listen to?

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,640
Well, it all comes from my dad's interests,

124
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,220
but I like jazz and blues...

125
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,170
Let's talk about fashion!

126
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,320
Hey, let's talk about fashion instead of music!

127
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,540
Fashion?

128
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,590
Yeah, I mean, look!

129
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,510
See?

130
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,250
As you can see, I'm just brimming 
with womanly appeal lately.

131
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,010
I've gotta talk about fashion.

132
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,990
Womanly appeal?

133
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,240
Even the quiz king wouldn't 
know the answer to that...

134
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,990
Oh, yeah. This is the magazine you asked for.

135
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,900
The special issue on autumn accessorizing.

136
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,120
Oh! Grown-up fashion!

137
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,210
Ta-da! I bought a new hair tie!

138
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,240
Well? How does it look?

139
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,700
Oh, a chou-chou! How cute!

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,070
Huh? What was that all of a sudden?

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,690
Were you impersonating a 
steam engine? Playing train?

142
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,350
Huh? That is a chou-chou, right?

143
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,710
Well, it's true that we'll have 
to buy winter clothes soon.

144
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,240
What I want right now is distressed denim.

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,570
That's skinny denim you're 
wearing now, right?

146
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,960
Yeah. I want something with a 
little more of a damaged look.

147
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,680
Aren't you interested in denim at all?

148
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
I don't usually wear pants when I go out.

149
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,040
Though if it's a tunic and leggings...

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,670
Stop! Stop!

151
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,890
I have no idea what you 
guys are talking about!

152
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,750
Speak in Japanese!

153
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,520
What's "tunic" in Japanese?

154
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,750
Huh? Japanese?

155
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,280
And what do you call this 
hair tie in Japanese?

156
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,820
So you really did buy it not even 
knowing it was a chou-chou.

157
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,540
I did, too!

158
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,790
I know what a choo-choo is!

159
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,790
No, it's "chou-chou."

160
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,400
Enough talking about fashion!

161
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,390
Let's talk about more grown-up stuff!

162
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,000
You couldn't keep up, and you want 
to raise the difficulty level?

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,470
Um, what should we talk about?

164
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,780
Okay, if we're talking about "grown-up stuff,"

165
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,190
should we tell stories about love?

166
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,920
That's it!

167
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,190
I'll start! I'll tell my story first!

168
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,550
Sure, if you actually have a 
love story, let's hear it.

169
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,680
If you have one.

170
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,640
Really, Konomi-chan, what are you saying?

171
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,680
Even I have a story or two to tell.

172
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,690
My love story is...

173
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,060
...nuh.

174
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,880
I've heard people say "I have no words,"

175
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,730
but I guess you had a "nuh."

176
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,060
They don't come to mind 
as easily as I thought.

177
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,350
That surprised me.

178
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,280
Not to mention the only boy 
around here is Glasses-kun.

179
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,990
But, Hotaru-chan, you lived in Tokyo.

180
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,900
How about it, Hotaru-chan?

181
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,490
Huh? Oh, I...

182
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,900
Did you have someone you liked?

183
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,830
Um, well, "l-l-like" might 
not be the right word...

184
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,200
<i>What? Hotaru's eyes...</i>

185
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,910
<i>I don't know who it is, 
but those eyes say she's in love!</i>

186
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,840
Gah! Stop! No more talking about this!

187
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,800
I can tell without even asking!

188
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,580
It's written all over your 
face that you're in love!

189
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,920
What?! M-M-My face looked like that?!

190
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,490
I'm older than you! Why are 
you more like an onee-san?!

191
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,780
This sucks! I'm more mature!

192
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,130
S-Senpai...

193
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,780
H-Hey, Komari-chan,

194
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,890
that's not something you say 
while throwing a tantrum.

195
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,890
This sucks! This sucks! This sucks!

196
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,110
S-Senpai, I'm way more of a child than you!

197
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,740
Hotaru, are you in love?

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,370
Um, I-I don't know if 
I'd say in love...

199
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,580
Are you sentimental?

200
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,640
Huh?

201
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,550
Of course I'm not in love.

202
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,370
Of course not! You're not, right?

203
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,000
All right! Now we're tied!

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,390
When did this become a competition?

205
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,600
Girls, I brought snacks.

206
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,290
Oh, thank you.

207
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,990
Sorry. We're out of juice, 
so all I had was coffee.

208
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,100
That okay with you all?

209
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,870
No problem at all. Thank you.

210
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,870
Works for me, too.

211
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,650
Hotaru, how much sugar do you want?

212
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,570
I'll get it for you.

213
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,080
Oh, black is fine with me.

214
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,150
<i>Today's the day I start having a 
sentimental autumn as a grown woman!</i>

215
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,370
Hey, what are you two doing?

216
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,250
Koma-chan!

217
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,800
Senpai, good morning.

218
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,810
Meowning!

219
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,880
What are you gonna do?

220
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll tell you! Fall is for the arts!

221
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,070
What does that mean?

222
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,040
Uh, in other words, we were 
going to do some sketching.

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,380
Oh, sketching?

224
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,520
Would you like to join us, Senpai?

225
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,860
<i>Art in autumn does sound nice...</i>

226
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,230
Sure, I'll go.

227
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,360
How about here? It's a nice view.

228
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,700
Yeah.

229
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Draw, draw... I'm gonna draw.

230
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,710
I didn't bring paper or 
anything. Do you have some?

231
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,020
I have drawing paper and pencils.

232
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,080
And drawing boards.

233
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
Koma-chan, what're you gonna draw?

234
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
I haven't really decided,

235
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,020
but since we're here, maybe a landscape?

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,520
By the way, Senpai, did you 
see that drama yesterday?

237
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,480
Hm? That romance show?

238
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,050
I missed it yesterday.

239
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,110
You did? It was the final episode.

240
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,370
What? It was?!

241
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,240
But I recorded it, so why don't 
we watch it together sometime?

242
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,720
Really? Oh, good!

243
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,110
Natsumi took forever in the bath yesterday,

244
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,290
which made me late taking 
mine, so I missed it.

245
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,670
Natsumi takes such long baths.

246
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,920
Renge, are you drawing me?

247
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,420
Yes. You're my model, Koma-chan.

248
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,000
What? Being a model is embarrassing...

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,230
You're doing it.

250
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,140
No way, I can't.

251
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,170
Everything can be chalked up to experience.

252
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,310
Okay, fine.

253
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,420
Do you need me to pose?

254
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,290
Just make a cute pose.

255
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,060
"A cute pose" is pretty vague...

256
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,030
I'll let you figure something out.

257
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,960
What? A cute pose...

258
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,630
L-Like this?

259
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,900
S-Senpai! I'll draw you, 
too, so make a cute pose!

260
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,580
Huh?!

261
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,830
Okay, but it's a little embarrassing...

262
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,900
How about a pose like this?!

263
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,030
What? That's way too embarrassing!

264
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,880
Then how about this?

265
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,840
Oh, that could work!

266
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,040
Koma-chan, Koma-chan.

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,710
You don't have to get so excited.

268
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,280
Senpai! Look this way!

269
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,620
'Kay...

270
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,730
Hey, Renge, what kind of 
picture are you drawing?

271
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,200
A picture of you condensed into a little
round ball and viewed from the back!

272
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,700
I-I don't know what you're talking about,

273
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,710
but can't you just draw me normally?

274
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,340
You want it to be normal?

275
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,720
I'm done.

276
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,850
That's good!

277
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,750
Isn't that kind of incredible 
for a first grader?!

278
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,690
If you entered it in a contest, you could win!

279
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,000
What are you talking about?

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
There's nothing artistic about this at all.

281
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,120
This isn't what I wanted to draw.

282
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,650
No, really, you should enter that in a contest!

283
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,290
Shouldn't you draw like that all the time?

284
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,770
I don't know anything about contests.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,250
Anyway, talking about 
contests made me hungry.

286
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,680
How do contests make you...

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,660
Well, it is almost lunch time.

288
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,060
My house is close to here,

289
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,920
so why don't I go make 
sandwiches for us?

290
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,570
Sandwiches!

291
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,520
Want some help?

292
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,360
That's all right. I'll be right back.

293
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,860
I'll be going, then.

294
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,050
Okay, take care!

295
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,610
Sandwiches!

296
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,310
What should we do? Keep drawing?

297
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,810
I'm taking a break until 
Hotarun comes back.

298
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,240
Koma-chan, let's play with these.

299
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,450
What are these? Oh, toy gliders?

300
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,730
I was gonna use them with 
Hotarun, so I brought two.

301
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,220
Okay, fine with me.

302
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,310
Now, whoever throws theirs farther wins.

303
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,800
Okay. I've done this with 
Natsumi, so I'm pretty good.

304
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,390
Okay, here we go!

305
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,300
All right!

306
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,650
Mine went farther!

307
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,520
What? Mine totally went farther!

308
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,850
Okay, fine. I lost this time.

309
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,520
You're taking this so seriously, 
even against a grade school kid.

310
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,310
D-Don't treat me like an adult...

311
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,940
Okay, let's try it again.

312
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
I'll beat you next time!

313
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, hang on!

314
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,150
Go!

315
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,840
Mine got ahead of yours this time!

316
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
What?!

317
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,980
Sorry! It took a little 
longer than I expected!

318
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,550
Sorry I was late.

319
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,970
Man...

320
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,080
Why do we have to make dried 
persimmons when we're on break?

321
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,640
We have to.

322
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,410
Our uncle sent them over for us.

323
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,150
This is boring. Let's play. Mom's not home.

324
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,620
No! Mom'll get mad if we don't 
finish before she gets home.

325
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,360
What are you, the good little daughter?

326
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,100
The ally of justice, Stem Ranger, is here!

327
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,840
Hey, what are you doing?

328
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,770
If you cut off the stems, 
we can't hang them up.

329
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,940
It's fine. I cut them from the ones we can eat.

330
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,870
If you're just gonna be childish,

331
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,180
bring in the other persimmons 
from the kitchen.

332
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,490
Onii-chan should be peeling them.

333
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,600
Boo. You should just do Stem Ranger, too.

334
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,590
You're no fun.

335
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,100
I'm not doing that.

336
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,430
Nii-chan...

337
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,710
If you're playing the guitar,

338
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,530
does that mean you're done 
peeling the persimmons?

339
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,640
They're in the kitchen, right?

340
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,060
What? I can't hear you over the guitar!

341
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,870
Stop playing for a minute!

342
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,720
Hello!

343
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,890
I came to play!

344
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,540
Oh, Konomi-chan.

345
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,030
You came at the best
time... or the worst time.

346
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,970
We were just making dried 
persimmons. Help out.

347
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,130
Dried persimmons?

348
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,300
I've never made any. You sure I should help?

349
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,040
They're already peeled.

350
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,000
We just have to tie them up, 
so you'll probably be fine.

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,560
There they are.

352
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm the ally of justice, Stem Ranger!

353
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,150
Wha...

354
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,450
K-Konomi-chan! You're here?

355
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,260
Yeah, I just got here.

356
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,100
I'll help you with the persimmons.

357
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,490
S-So that's why I thought I heard 
something from the front door...

358
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,000
Um, I was just, er...

359
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,760
It's fine. We've known each other forever.

360
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,500
I know you well. It's puberty, right?

361
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,770
That's not it!

362
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,720
Nee-chan, you're fourteen and
you haven't hit puberty yet?

363
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,880
Yes, I have!

364
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,510
I was just copying what 
Natsumi did earlier.

365
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,170
Man, now I'm embarrassed!

366
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,950
When it comes down to it, 
you wanted to do it, too.

367
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,550
Looks that way.

368
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,940
We tie these persimmons with string?

369
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,860
Yeah, around the stems.

370
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,630
Yay! Look, it's Kakijiro-kun!

371
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,380
Oh, cute! Let me see!

372
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,050
There, Kakijiro-kun's first evolution!

373
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,880
Hey! My Kakijiro-kun!

374
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,240
I worked so hard on him and 
you're already tying him up...

375
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,400
Ready for the second evolution?

376
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,170
Anyway, that was the last persimmon.

377
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,200
So now we just dry them 
and they're done?

378
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,360
No, first we soak them in hot 
water so they won't mold.

379
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,070
Yow, it's hot!

380
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,750
Now I know how cooked vegetables feel!

381
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,600
Those were Kakijiro-kun's last words.

382
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,660
But it was also the beginning 
of a nightmare...

383
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,290
...in which Kakijiro-kun became a mummy.

384
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,160
Nacchan, easy on my shoulders...

385
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,010
Didn't you have any other 
last words for him?

386
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,450
There's a rod hanging from that beam.

387
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,440
Okay, you're probably too short to 
reach it, Nee-chan, so I'll do this.

388
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,380
You only get motivated at times like this.

389
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,160
Come on, I'll do it, too.

390
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,870
Done!

391
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,930
Feels like fall.

392
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,190
Let's eat the persimmons 
we saved for eating.

393
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,300
Okay!

394
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,070
Autumn... is nice.

395
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,180
Let's eat! Stem Ranger!

396
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,690
Senpai gave me dried persimmons!

397
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:19,410
That's all for today

398
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,080
<i>A cultural festival?</i>

399
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,370
<i>Natsumi said she wants to do one.</i>

400
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,940
<i>I'm glad you came.</i>

401
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,170
<i>Welcome!</i>

402
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,530
<i>Welcome.</i>

403
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,690
<i>Welcome!</i>

404
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,470
<i>I'm going to drum on my belly!</i>

405
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,460
Episode 9

406
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,460
We Tried Having a Cultural Festival
