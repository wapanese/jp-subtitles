1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,420
I know it's summer vacation, so I 
won't tell you not to have fun...

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,810
But what's the meaning of these grades?

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,060
Well...

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,360
Um, where did you find that?

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,110
In your room.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,830
I was cleaning and found 
it underneath your desk.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,880
You weren't hiding it from me, were you?

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,800
No, of course not...

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>The summer afternoons are still hot.</i>

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,030
<i>Our mom's temperature is 
on the rise, as well.</i>

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,740
Well? What's the meaning of these grades?

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,720
I won't yell at you, so just tell me.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,400
Um...

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,530
Well, there was a lot material on the tests,

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,590
and all the questions were hard...

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,980
Don't make excuses!

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,390
My God! You just said you wouldn't yell!

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,370
You haven't finished your 
summer homework, have you?

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,420
Well, I've been busy...

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,720
Don't make excuses!

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,690
Honestly, all you ever do is talk back!

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,610
That attitude is your problem!

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,380
You need to listen to what people tell you!

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,110
You can do things if you just try.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,700
<i>I want to watch TV in the living room.</i>

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,390
Working hard every day is important.

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,390
<i>Are you gonna be done soon?</i>

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,930
Understand?

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,380
<i>Forget about that. Just hide my tests.</i>

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,830
<i>Those wretched, priceless tests...</i>

31
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,570
<i>That has nothing to do with 
me. It's your own fault.</i>

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,450
<i>Keep talking like that...</i>

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,800
<i>...and you'll see something
scarier than anything on TV.</i>

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,770
<i>Like our family's own Armageddon!</i>

35
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,600
And just what are you doing 
while I'm scolding you?

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,450
Oh, um, this is...

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,520
A bunny!

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Yeah, I'm a bunny!

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,160
Bounce, bounce, bouncity-bounce!

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,750
"Bounce" this!

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,380
<i>The end of summer is 
always Armageddon here.</i>

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,460
Episode 6

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,460
I Became a Ghost and Tried Hard

44
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,400
Oh, Nii-chan and Nee-chan, 
are you in there?

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,630
<i>Uh-oh...</i>

46
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,830
<i>Man, Onii-chan's fast!</i>

47
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,670
By the way, Nee-chan, your English 
grade dropped, didn't it?

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,970
If you're there, get in here.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,490
Where are you going?!

50
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,230
You two say something, too!

51
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,710
Speak up!

52
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,360
What makes you think you can run away?!

53
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,840
We're not finished talking!

54
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,340
I heard the cicadas calling 
and my body moved on its own!

55
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,720
You just don't know when 
to give up, Natsumi!

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,850
No! I don't wanna!

57
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,730
From now on, you will prepare and 
review before your lessons! Understand?

58
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,690
Yes. I understand completely.

59
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,170
You can do things if you just try.

60
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,470
Does that mean I can't 
do anything right now?

61
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,220
I'm going to go air out the futons.

62
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,390
You can do things if you try, you hear?

63
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,600
Yes...

64
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,390
As if I'm gonna study.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,330
Is it over?

66
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,760
Oh yeah, it's over.

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,720
These things end in no time if you 
just keep saying "yes" and "okay."

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,340
Besides, it's the tests' fault for being too hard.

69
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,020
Natsumi-chan didn't do anything wrong.

70
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,510
You never think back or 
move forward, do you?

71
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, did you hide my tests?

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,850
Yeah, for what it's worth.

73
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,370
Thanks.

74
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,080
So where'd Mom go?

75
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,720
To air out the futons.

76
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,440
Anyway, where'd you hide the tests?

77
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,260
In your closet...

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,930
...under the... futon.

79
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,170
When is this endless Armageddon 
going to be over?

80
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,220
It's never gonna end as long as 
the enemy keeps coming after me.

81
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,630
<i>Sliding door punch!</i>

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,930
<i>Special move: tile throw!</i>

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,120
<i>It's the sliding door's fault 
for being easy to tear.</i>

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,730
<i>And it's the tile's fault 
for coming off so easily.</i>

85
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,600
<i>Did Natsumi-chan do something wrong?</i>

86
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,280
No, it's never gonna end if you 
don't think about your actions!

87
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
You think?

88
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,380
Yoo-hoo!

89
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,150
Hey, Ren-chon.

90
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,280
Where do you wanna go play?

91
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,300
Yep!

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,580
This might be the best Koma-plushie yet!

93
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,370
This is great. Koma-plushies are great.

94
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,150
Though, I might have made a few too many.

95
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,970
I definitely can't let Senpai and 
the other girls see this room.

96
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,860
Well, I can't help that I already made them.

97
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,500
Where should I put them?

98
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,090
Hello.

99
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,040
Hi.

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
Meowning.

101
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,730
Oh, are you Hotaru-chan's friends?

102
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,310
Yes, nice to meet you!

103
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,190
Well, come in, come in.

104
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,010
Thank you.

105
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,520
Hotarun's house is so nice.

106
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,920
I bet her room is as clean as a...

107
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,550
U-Um!

108
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,570
Please wait here for a minute!

109
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,160
Hm? What's wrong?

110
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,030
W-Well, my room is messy...

111
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,260
So? My room's a mess, too. 
It won't bother me.

112
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,770
Well, it's not just a mess...

113
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,540
Th-There might be land mines...

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,240
Why would your room have land mines?

115
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,210
Anyway, I'll clean it up right now!

116
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,980
Please wait here!

117
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,720
S-Sorry to keep you waiting.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,970
We're comin' in.

119
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,720
Hey, it looks totally clean.

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,930
Well, I just cleaned it...

121
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,620
It's way cleaner than Natsumi's room.

122
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,680
Is that your album, Hotaru?

123
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:49,040
My Album

124
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,570
Can I look at it?

125
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,810
Sure.

126
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,040
Let's see...

127
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
Hey, this one looks like 
you when you were little,

128
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,580
but isn't this place close to here?

129
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,090
Oh, my relatives live nearby,

130
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,890
so I've been here to visit several times.

131
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,590
Oh...

132
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,570
Were you in first grade here?

133
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,940
Um... That picture is from last year.

134
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,930
Last year?

135
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,630
Th-This is...

136
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,400
The latest game console!

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,140
Mind if I play just a little bit?!

138
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,160
Wow! Oh, man!

139
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,830
It looks like you already are...

140
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,830
This controller is so cool!

141
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,680
What?! There are buttons 
on the back, too?!

142
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,680
What does this mean?

143
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,180
<i>I wasn't sure how it would work,
but I guess they won't find out now.</i>

144
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,920
There aren't any toys.

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,860
Are they in here?

146
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,320
Am I floating in the air?!

147
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,700
You sure are!

148
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,200
<i>This is bad!</i>

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,200
<i>My Koma-plushies are in that closet!</i>

150
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,970
If you don't have any toys, let's play tag.

151
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,680
We can't play tag in my room.

152
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,320
Non, non.

153
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,680
You can play my style of tag indoors.

154
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,150
It's a new kind of tag I made up! 
The rules are easy!

155
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,660
The one who acts most like a demon wins!

156
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,260
I'll show you how it's done first.

157
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,430
O-Okay.

158
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,040
My hair is not naturally curly!

159
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,740
What is this?

160
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,640
Why do I feel like I just 
told a joke that flopped?

161
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,750
I couldn't quite understand...

162
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,330
Should I have said, "Don't underestimate
the tiger stripes!" or something?

163
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,720
That might have sounded more like a demon.

164
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,340
I also could've said, "Hey, old man, 
give me a discount on this daikon!"

165
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,730
Um, Ren-chan, are we even 
imagining the same thing here?

166
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,610
Now it's your turn, Hotarun.

167
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,590
I can't impersonate a demon. 
It's too embarrassing.

168
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,510
Then I'll look for some toys.

169
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,840
Stop! Stop!

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,610
She must have some kind of secret, 
to develop this much in a year.

171
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Then be a demon!

172
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm... a demon...

173
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,960
I can't beat this level...

174
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,960
More! More!

175
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,030
I'm a demon!

176
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,420
Hotarun, how do you beat this—

177
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,420
Hotaru, did you do something 
to grow up this much?!

178
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,230
I'm a demon! I'm gonna eat you!

179
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,120
What does that mean?!

180
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,550
So you have to eat a lot to grow bigger?!

181
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,390
Is there an eat command?!

182
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,000
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,330
I couldn't understand you. Say it again!

184
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,350
I'm a demon...

185
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,400
Your face is red just like a demon!

186
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,890
Is it milk?! Do you drink milk?!

187
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,370
I don't know what's going on, 
but please make it stop!

188
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,900
Why do you have plushies of Nee-chan?

189
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,400
Why are there so many?

190
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,870
Um, this is... I was kind of practicing...

191
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,580
Of course. I understand everything now.

192
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,050
Y-You understand what?

193
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,670
All these plushies,

194
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,020
and the way you said practicing...

195
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,490
R-Ren-chan, what are you...?

196
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,720
This is your free study 
project for summer vacation!

197
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,690
Huh?

198
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,920
Oh, yeah! I came over to ask if I 
could copy your free study project.

199
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,200
I actually haven't done mine, either.

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,050
Me neither!

201
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,700
Since we have the chance, you can 
teach us how you made these,

202
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,110
and we can all make plushies 
for our free study project!

203
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,980
Okay, then I'm gonna make Ren-chon!

204
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,050
That okay with you, Hotarun?

205
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,460
Yeah...

206
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,850
<i>What was I so worked up about?</i>

207
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,930
My Ren-chon is done!

208
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,930
Done with your cat, Nee-chan?

209
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,270
Only the face. I guess it doesn't need a body.

210
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,330
I made this.

211
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,870
What is that?

212
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,170
It's Gu.

213
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,800
That's a tanuki?

214
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,030
Well, now our free study projects are done.

215
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,420
With that out of the way, our summer 
homework is practically done!

216
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,450
You still have your drills, Natsumi.

217
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,170
Koma-chan, Hotarun, let's play house.

218
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,300
Sure.

219
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,120
But that's so childish...

220
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,720
Koma-chan is the dad, 
and Hotarun is the mom.

221
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,910
Fine, fine.

222
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,340
So you'll be our child?

223
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,810
I'm a flying fish!

224
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,430
Slide, slide, slide.

225
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,580
Honey, I'm home.

226
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,560
Welcome home. We're having 
gratin for dinner today.

227
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,020
Flop, flop.

228
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,170
I love gratin.

229
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,710
Flop, flop.

230
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,390
Actually, maybe I'll have a bath first.

231
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:16,980
Flop, flop, flop, flop, flop...

232
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,360
Okay.

233
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,500
Water...

234
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,170
Let's just play this normally...

235
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,220
Thanks, Hotarun.

236
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,400
Don't mention it.

237
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,770
We'll go home now.

238
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,090
Take care.

239
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,620
A dragonfly!

240
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,580
You're right.

241
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,120
I guess summer's almost over...

242
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,030
Wow!

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,480
Just the Basics
7th Grade Social Studies
Daily 15 Minute Drills

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,480
Just the Basics

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,480
Basic English Terms
Memorize These and
it's Smooth Sailing!

246
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,500
This goes really fast with 
three people! Triple speed!

247
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,760
Come to think of it, I seem to 
recall doing this last year...

248
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,310
I should've had you guys 
help me from the start.

249
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,270
That would defeat the 
purpose of the homework.

250
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,270
I'll be finished by tonight at this rate.

251
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,750
Yeah, I guess there'll 
be no more Armageddon.

252
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,710
Hey, let's do <i>that.</i>

253
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,490
Huh?

254
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,880
Something even scarier 
than Armageddon...

255
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,850
Let's do a test of courage!

256
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,800
Since you called at night,

257
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,900
I thought you wanted to light 
fireworks, so I brought some.

258
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,980
We're not doing fireworks. 
We're doing a test of courage.

259
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,310
I actually wanted to do it at a graveyard...

260
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,390
But since it's dangerous in the dark,

261
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,780
we have to do it at the
shrine, where there's light.

262
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,520
Can't you just be happy that I 
let you do this test of courage?

263
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,870
So the rule is:

264
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,180
you have to put a five yen coin on the edge
of the offering box and come back here.

265
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,610
I also brought props for the scarer 
to use, so someone has to be the—

266
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,960
Are you stupid?!

267
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,500
What's your problem all of a sudden?

268
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,910
Well, I figured you'd do something like this.

269
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,780
But I have no intention of 
doing something that silly.

270
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,620
Aw, you're no fun.

271
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,480
Just because you can't handle scary stuff...

272
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,540
I-I'm not scared or anything!

273
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,820
I just think we might get 
spooked if a ghost shows up.

274
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,890
There are no ghosts. 
That's why we need a scarer.

275
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,740
Come on, we'll decide with 
rock-paper-scissors.

276
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,160
If you don't play, you lose.

277
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,460
W-Wait a second!

278
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,730
Rock, paper...

279
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,110
Scissors!

280
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,020
I won!

281
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,180
That means I'm the scarer, right?

282
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,640
Man, I lost...

283
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,760
It just shows that I've 
been living my life right!

284
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,940
Oh, well. Go ahead and start 
getting ready, Nee-chan.

285
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,910
Yeah, yeah. I don't want to scare 
you all so bad you start crying,

286
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,350
so I'll go easy on you.

287
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,810
Wh-What, so there's only one scarer?

288
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,350
Anyway, I should hurry up and get ready.

289
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,850
What's this sheet for?

290
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,930
Oh, I'm supposed to put 
this on and be a ghost?

291
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,860
Pretty typical setup Natsumi came up with...

292
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,600
Jeez, why do I have to do this?

293
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,870
Huh? I can't see...

294
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,340
It's dark!

295
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,200
What is this?

296
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,910
The eyes are just drawn on with a marker!

297
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,050
At least cut holes in it!

298
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,430
Not being able to see is...

299
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,520
...not scary, but let's 
find something else.

300
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,920
<i>I thought I heard footsteps behind me...</i>

301
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,920
<i>I-It's just one of them coming up here, right?</i>

302
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,910
<i>No... This sensation...</i>

303
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,930
<i>Th-There's no mistaking it.</i>

304
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,930
<i>It's definitely...</i>

305
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,700
<i>...a ghost!</i>

306
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,170
I know you're behind m—

307
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,110
What's going on? No one's there...

308
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,010
What's goin' on?!

309
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,350
I slipped into a country accent...

310
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,380
I'll go where there's light.

311
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,430
I can't stand the dark...

312
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,930
Why did it turn out this way?

313
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,940
If I had to do this, I'd rather have 
just done the test of courage...

314
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,110
Wh-Why is there a five yen coin...

315
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,080
...when no one's been here?

316
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
Wh-Who joined the game 
without telling me?

317
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,410
Who's the mysterious participant?

318
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,920
A black cat...

319
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,180
I like cats, but...

320
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,230
I know what's going on!

321
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,990
You're the one who joined the 
game without telling me!

322
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,770
You're a monster cat!

323
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,010
I-I-I'm sorry!

324
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,690
The sheet again?!

325
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,740
It's dark!

326
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
S-Someone help me!

327
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,950
It's dark!

328
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
Oh, Nii-chan's coming back.

329
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,920
Did Nee-chan do her job as the scarer?

330
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,180
All right! Now it's my turn!

331
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,330
Good luck.

332
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,800
<i>So, I wonder how Nee-chan 
will try to scare me.</i>

333
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,770
<i>Depending on how it goes, 
maybe I'll try to scare her.</i>

334
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:09,450
Evil spirits, begone!

335
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,960
What's a ghost doing that for?

336
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,740
Evil spirits, begone!

337
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,560
I'm a ghost!

338
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,880
Armageddon!

339
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,620
I'm glad we brought the fireworks.

340
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah, aren't they pretty?

341
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,140
Senpai, come join us.

342
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,080
Huh?

343
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,680
Here.

344
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Thanks.

345
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:19,380
That's all for today

346
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,000
<i>Want some corn?</i>

347
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,160
<i>This is probably the main 
reason why I'm poor.</i>

348
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,050
<i>Corn fishing!</i>

349
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,240
<i>It's a clio-neko.</i>

350
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,970
<i>Wow, Nii-chan, you're pretty good!</i>

351
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,820
<i>It looks like outer space </i><i>because</i> it's twisted.

352
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,480
Episode 7
