1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,350
Wow... I never thought we'd have 
to spend the night at the school.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,430
Night Duty Room

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,200
It started snowing hard out of nowhere,
the buses stopped running...

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,810
I bet it hasn't snowed this much in ages.

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,880
<i>Thanks to a sudden snowstorm,</i>

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,980
<i>we have to stay at the school overnight.</i>

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,600
<i>This is the first time I've ever spent 
a night at school with everyone.</i>

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,160
It's okay, though. Stuff like this is fun.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,760
Well, it's a big help that we had 
instant ramen and heaters ready,

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,120
but there is one problem...

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,030
There aren't enough futons!

12
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,460
Episode 11

13
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,460
We Made a Snow House

14
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,940
The futon stored in the night duty room
and an emergency sleeping bag...

15
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,630
And the futon from one of the two 
beds in the nurse's office...

16
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,950
That gives us three.

17
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,290
If two people sleep in each futon, 
and one in the sleeping bag...

18
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,140
But the sleeping bag would be cold...

19
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,730
Yeah, a sleeping bag isn't the 
best for a snowy day like this.

20
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,070
Right? Looks like we'll 
have a fight over futons.

21
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,990
Th-Then, Senpai, would you 
like to share a futon?

22
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,880
What a problem...

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,570
It's no use. She's asleep.

24
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,760
Hey, what's the deal?!

25
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,720
She's the one who said there'd 
be a fight over futons,

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,160
and then she went right to sleep in one?!

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,580
I couldn't believe it either, 
but she's actually asleep!

28
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,270
Um, what should we do?
Who gets the sleeping bag?

29
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,020
Don't ask me...

30
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,490
Okay, I'll sleep in the 
same futon with Nee-nee.

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,580
That's fine, right?

32
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,260
Well, yeah, even if two people fit in a futon,

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,500
there'll be more room if one 
is big and one is small.

34
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,200
I guess that'd be best.

35
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,870
That means Nee-chan should 
have the other futon,

36
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,670
and either Hotarun or I 
will get the sleeping bag.

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,470
I don't really like being 
treated as the little one,

38
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,530
but if I get to sleep in a 
futon, I can live with it.

39
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,680
Which are you going to 
use, Natsumi-senpai?

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,290
I want the futon, obviously.

41
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,950
The sleeping bag's gotta be cold.

42
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,200
I was thinking I'd rather have the futon, too...

43
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,960
<i>Sharing a futon with Koma-senpai...</i>

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,690
What, really?

45
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,120
How should we decide, then?

46
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,400
Rock-paper-scissors wouldn't be much fun...

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,400
I'm fine with rock-paper-scissors.

48
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,870
Oh!

49
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,140
How about the one who still uses 
a backpack gets the sleeping bag?

50
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,070
That leaves me with the 
sleeping bag, no matter what!

51
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,240
Just kidding. Why don't we 
arm wrestle for it, then?

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,730
Arm wrestle?

53
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,310
Wow, Natsumi, that's low.

54
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,070
Natsumi's really good at arm wrestling.

55
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,320
I've never seen her lose.

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,330
Well, I wouldn't go that far...

57
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,530
But I've never lost to Koma-chan or
Ren-chon, of course, or Candy Store.

58
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,050
Nii-chan's pretty good, too, 
but he's no match for me.

59
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,230
Th-That's...

60
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,410
Come on, Hotarun, let's arm wrestle!

61
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,570
What?

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,710
I've never arm wrestled before. 
There's no way I can win.

63
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,620
Ah, it's fine. Let's do it!

64
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,780
Ready... Fight!

65
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,350
My arm! My arm creaked! It creaked!

66
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,350
I'm sorry!

67
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,710
It hurts...

68
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,850
I think something's wrong with the muscle...

69
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,760
I bet it's spiral-shaped now...

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,230
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,340
We can disregard that match.

72
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,630
No more physical competitions.

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,300
Let's compete with something else.

74
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,160
That's fine with me, but what should we do?

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Let's see...

76
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,060
I know! Let's have a pun contest!

77
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,980
The funniest pun wins!

78
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,390
I have a feeling it'd be 
hard to choose a winner...

79
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,330
What kind did you have in mind?

80
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,500
Like... Hmm...

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,190
An American pelican!

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
Okay, let's make it an 
impersonation contest!

83
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,140
The closest resemblance wins!

84
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,500
Oh, we're giving up on the pun contest?

85
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,130
I don't care what you do, just make it quick.

86
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,200
I want to get some sleep.

87
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
Oh, sorry!

88
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,450
Don't be in such a rush.

89
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,470
We're just getting to the good part.

90
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,780
First, let's have our assistant 
impersonation instructor, Ren-chon,

91
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,280
give us a demonstration.

92
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,750
I have to do a demonstration?

93
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,450
Yeah.

94
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,630
Oh, okay, fine.

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,160
Take it away!

96
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,160
Okay, this is my best 
impersonation. Watch closely.

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,830
Pyramid!

98
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,610
Thank you very much!

99
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,590
Just like that! Good luck to both of you!

100
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,300
Yes, ma'am!

101
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,480
You're doing impersonations, right?

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,510
That's what I thought...

103
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,400
Okay, Hotarun, you can go first.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,710
Me first?!

105
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,990
Just do a quick impersonation
of someone you know.

106
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,320
Good luck!

107
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,260
<i>Senpai's cheering for me!</i>

108
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,190
<i>I have to do something...
something... something...</i>

109
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,660
I... I like crayfish!

110
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,780
Is that supposed to be 
an impersonation of me?

111
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,510
I'm sorry! I couldn't think of anything!

112
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,210
I like river crabs more.

113
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,000
Th-That's true! Crayfish are no good, right?!

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,510
They're not that bad.

115
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,370
This is why I didn't want 
to do impersonations!

116
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,900
You copied the way she talks,

117
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,470
but it's hard to say whether 
it really resembled her or not.

118
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,220
And second up is Natsumi-chan!

119
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm going to do an impersonation!

120
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,460
The Daimonji fires.

121
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,560
Looks like it's a tie.

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
That was a quick judgment!

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,420
And why?! That wasn't bad! 
It looked the same!

124
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,470
"Why," you ask...

125
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,220
That wasn't really an impersonation, was it?

126
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,570
Hey, Ren-chon, say something!

127
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm not sure it can be called...

128
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,540
...and impersonation if it's not 
a person, like Hotarun's.

129
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,950
Who's the one who did the pyramid before?!

130
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,830
Oh, fine! We're not getting anywhere this way!

131
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,690
Forget it, Hotarun! Just give me the futon!

132
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,270
B-But I don't...

133
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,190
I want the futon!

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Wow, are you sure?

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,370
I can really have a full course?

136
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,040
This is delicious...

137
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,510
Goodnight!

138
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,180
...Non!

139
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,700
It's no use. I can't fall asleep.

140
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,370
Maybe it really is harder to 
sleep in a different bed...

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,490
I'll get a drink of water.

142
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,920
So cold...

143
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,520
There's so much snow!

144
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,320
I don't think I've never seen so 
much on the ground like this!

145
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,700
<i>It's still the middle of the night, right?</i>

146
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,160
<i>What's Hotaru doing?</i>

147
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,370
<i>Since I can't sleep, it won't hurt 
to go out and take a look, right?</i>

148
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,270
<i>Snow! Snow!</i>

149
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,410
Hey. Hey, Natsumi! Wake up!

150
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,290
What?

151
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,310
Hotaru just put on her coat and left.

152
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,250
We can't let anything happen 
to her. Let's go find her.

153
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,250
She probably went to the restroom. She's fine.

154
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,590
I'm pretty sure...

155
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,560
Here, carry this.

156
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,190
You sure you're not overthinking this?

157
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,200
Nothing that shocking is gonna happen.

158
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,540
Just take it!

159
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,810
And don't you dare do anything like that!

160
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,450
It stopped snowing, and I can see the stars!

161
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,890
It's beautiful!

162
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,780
I guess this is what they mean by "stars
you could almost reach out and touch!"

163
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,760
You can't see this in Tokyo!

164
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,700
<i>Hotaru's standing alone in the school yard,</i>

165
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,920
<i>raising her hands to the sky...</i>

166
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,420
What is she doing?

167
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,440
I'd say she's calling aliens.

168
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,450
Aliens?!

169
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,370
Shh! If you're spotted, you'll get mutilated!

170
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,670
What?! Is that gonna happen to Hotaru?!

171
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,050
Maybe I'll make a snowman 
with Koma-senpai tomorrow.

172
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,080
We could make a snow house, too...

173
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,450
Uh oh! She's running this way! Hide!

174
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,810
She went inside the school...

175
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,820
Why was she running?

176
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,570
You think she's already being 
controlled by aliens?!

177
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,830
Uh, to be honest, the alien 
thing was just a joke...

178
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,790
But maybe we should check.

179
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,770
Everyone's gone...

180
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,880
Are they sleeping in the hallway?

181
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,810
Hotarun is running through 
the hallway at night alone!

182
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,480
I get it! It's a festival, right?!

183
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,180
I wanna festival, too!

184
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,750
Oh, Ren-chan, did I wake you up?

185
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,290
Sorry. Wait just a second.

186
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,220
Yeah, I didn't shut off 
the faucet all the way...

187
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,390
Good thing I came back.

188
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,390
Sorry I woke you up, but weren't you scared?

189
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,670
I came running up the hall like that...

190
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,320
I thought there was 
a festival starting.

191
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,470
But I would've been more 
surprised to see an alien.

192
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,220
That would surprise me, too...

193
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,580
But why an alien?

194
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,070
I was having a dream about aliens.

195
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,910
All these Martians with lots of legs came out.

196
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,130
Oh...

197
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,400
She's the usual Hotaru.

198
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,390
Yeah, no way the alien 
thing could be true.

199
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,330
Let's head back. It's freezing.

200
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,820
Yeah, we might as well.

201
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,600
I wonder why she was raising 
her hands like that, though...

202
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,120
Dunno. Why don't you ask her later?

203
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,900
What?! What was that noise?!

204
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,460
It came from outside!

205
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,410
This time... This time it's a festival!

206
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,840
Huh?

207
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,830
An eight-legged Martian with glowing 
eyes is lying on the ground!

208
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,710
Oh, right, no school today.

209
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,160
Back to sleep...

210
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,160
Wham bang boom! Wham bang boom!

211
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,590
Wham bang boom boom boom!

212
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,390
Ren-chon, thanks for the little wake-up jig.

213
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,230
It's not a little jig! It's a huge dance!

214
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,130
Really? Well, today's a day off. 
Let me sleep a little more.

215
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,470
Nee-nee, look outside!

216
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,570
Outside?

217
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,580
Wow, it snowed again.

218
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,620
We've had a lot this year.

219
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,410
I bet you could ski on that 
open field near here.

220
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,760
Ski! Nee-nee, let's go ski!

221
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,320
What? No, I just said I bet you 
could, not that you really can.

222
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,250
We don't have skis, anyway.

223
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,970
Why don't we have any?

224
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,720
What kind of question is that?

225
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,900
If someone has some, you can borrow them,

226
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,270
but I don't know anyone who does...

227
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,920
Wait, maybe I do.

228
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,660
You do?!

229
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,640
Then hurry up and check with them! Hurry!

230
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,070
Okay, okay, but I'd like to eat breakfast first.

231
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,950
Skiing!

232
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,060
Wow! I've never gone skiing before!

233
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,220
Hotarun, you really like snow, huh?

234
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,430
Yes, I do!

235
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,850
I'm surprised you found skis, though.

236
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,900
Yeah, I rented them.

237
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,370
Hey.

238
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,850
You run a candy store,
but you also rent out skis?

239
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,910
I couldn't make a living 
on the candy store alone.

240
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,110
I just keep the ski gear around 
because it's my hobby,

241
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,810
but I sell most daily necessities, 
and I do rentals, too.

242
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,980
I also rent out futons for when 
relatives make surprise visits.

243
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,470
And if you need anything by mail 
order, I can send away for it.

244
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,430
Could you tell your mom that for me?

245
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,350
O-Okay...

246
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,300
Hey, could you refrain from marketing 
yourself to my students?

247
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,270
Of course, I didn't have ski gear for kids,

248
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,330
so I had to bring a sled for Renge.

249
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,300
I like sleds better! Like Santa!

250
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,240
Well, good, then.

251
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,180
So, raise your hand if 
you've never been skiing.

252
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,180
Me.

253
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,240
Me, either.

254
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,610
Nii-chan, you haven't, either?

255
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,290
Oh, all right...

256
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,940
Then let's start Natsumi-chan's 
personal skiing lecture.

257
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,090
Just get on board with me and relax.

258
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,640
Are you sure that's okay? 
Don't get ahead of yourself.

259
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,460
Her boat's made of mud! No mud boats!

260
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,430
I think your lecture just earned an objection.

261
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,310
Ignoring all objections...

262
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,080
You'll learn faster by just moving a few
meters at first to get the hang of it.

263
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,990
You can stop by leaning back on your butt.

264
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,170
Let's have Nii-chan give it a try first.

265
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,280
That's it, just glide straight ahead.

266
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,110
Okay, Nii-chan, lean back 
on your butt and stop!

267
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,810
Uh...

268
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,210
Angle your feet like a V
when you want to stop.

269
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,270
That's a fundamental skiing rule, 
so make sure you remember it.

270
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,210
Your butt won't always stop 
you, so it's a last resort.

271
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,600
Got that?

272
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,680
Yes!

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,910
Okay, Nee-chan, give it a shot.

274
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,850
Even after that lecture, it's still kinda scary...

275
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,690
It'll be okay. I'll come down right behind you.

276
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,010
Okay...

277
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,930
I can't! I'm scared!

278
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,430
Help!

279
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,030
If I move, I'll fall!

280
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,420
Senpai!

281
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,170
Nee-chan stopped in a 
pretty weird position...

282
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,510
Senpai! I'm coming to save you!

283
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,010
Hotaru!

284
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,470
Senpai! Hold out your hand!

285
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,640
I can't! If I hold out my hand, I'll fall!

286
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,770
Hurry! Your hand!

287
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,630
I did it! I've got you, Senpai!

288
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,480
Hotaru! Stop! Stop!

289
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,090
What do I do with my feet, again?

290
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,110
Make them a W?

291
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,380
That's not even possible!

292
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,090
You can't turn your feet backwards!

293
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,270
At least keep them pointing forward!

294
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,020
No one was able to make it down?

295
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,810
If they could learn that fast, 
life would be pretty easy.

296
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,980
Since they all took off, 
want to race to the bottom?

297
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,860
Uh, I'm not sure we should...

298
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,920
What? You scared of losing?

299
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,780
No, it's not that.

300
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,920
I've never been skiing before.

301
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,390
Huh?

302
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,390
Huh?

303
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,020
Well, when I asked who's 
never been skiing before,

304
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,630
I raised my hand, too, remember?

305
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,360
I just used stuff I've heard 
somewhere for the lecture.

306
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,900
So, well, um...

307
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,470
Please teach me how to ski!

308
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,340
If turning your feet inward doesn't 
stop you, lean back on your butt.

309
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,560
If that doesn't work, just give up!

310
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,080
This is Sparta!

311
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,560
Oh, you finally came down?

312
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,590
Everyone else is already here.

313
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,160
I can't do this! Skiing is really scary!

314
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,950
Oh, but I figured out how 
not to fall while skiing!

315
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,400
You won't fall if you take off the skis!

316
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,170
That's not skiing. It's just walking.

317
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,750
Whoa, what's this? Are you making a hill?

318
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,210
It's a snow house, Senpai!

319
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,890
I-It's always been my dream 
to make a snow house,

320
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,360
so I asked everyone to help!

321
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,320
Y-Yeah? You sure are fired up today.

322
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,910
Where'd you get the shovel?

323
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,930
Oh, Candy Store-san brought it for me.

324
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,520
She brought a gas burner, too, 
and she's making pork miso soup for us.

325
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,690
Really?!

326
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,850
Huh? I've got all the help I need here.

327
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,150
You can play over there until it's done.

328
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,470
All right!

329
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,470
Oh, Natsumi-senpai, you'll help, too?

330
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,800
Sure, I'll help!

331
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,540
Oh, th-then use this shovel to...

332
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,890
Oh, Senpai, I'll add the cost of the 
ingredients to your rental fee.

333
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,910
Okay, chill out...

334
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,710
What? Seriously?

335
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,570
Seriously.

336
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,510
Hotarun! Is this okay?

337
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,250
It's perfect! It's wonderful!

338
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,680
Sounds like you've approved, so here, 
I brought a charcoal brazier.

339
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,260
The soup will take a bit longer, 
so cook some mochi with it.

340
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,730
Mochi!

341
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,350
Wait, is it okay to light a 
fire inside a snow house?

342
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,410
Yeah, it would be scary if 
it melted and caved in.

343
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,370
Maybe we should use the 
brazier outside...

344
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,020
Hotarun, that was quick!

345
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,300
Mochi! Mochi!

346
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,370
Mochi mochi mochi!

347
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,120
What's wrong? Hurry up 
or the mochi will burn!

348
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,690
Uh, well, you're as aggressive 
as usual, Hotarun.

349
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,870
You work fast.

350
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,850
When did you light that?

351
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,430
It's bigger inside than I expected.

352
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,730
Wow, you're right.

353
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,850
It was worth making it the right way.

354
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,110
I'm turning the mochi!

355
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,360
Ren-chon, you're in charge 
of turning the mochi?

356
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,510
It already has grill marks!

357
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,420
Doesn't that mean it's almost ready?

358
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,300
Will the soup be done in time?

359
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,520
Hey, is the soup done yet?

360
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,300
Huh?

361
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,570
Yeah, the soup's been ready for a while.

362
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,850
What?! It's already done?!

363
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,440
Why didn't you tell us, then?

364
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:14,050
Pork miso! Pork miso!

365
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,460
Could you make them lay off 
the "pork miso" chant?

366
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,100
Sure.

367
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,340
Here you go. Pork miso soup.

368
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,310
There's plenty more where this came from.

369
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,170
Okay!

370
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,730
All right! I'm gonna get seconds!

371
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,270
I'm gonna put mochi in my soup!

372
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,470
Me, too!

373
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,220
Here, Hotaru.

374
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,910
Thank you!

375
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,410
Well, then...

376
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,670
Let's eat!

377
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,930
It's delicious!

378
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,130
It is, isn't it?

379
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,130
Yes!

380
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,420
Seconds!

381
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:19,350
That's all for today

382
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,470
<i>Since you suggested we 
exchange homemade bentos,</i>

383
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,080
<i>I put some effort into it.</i>

384
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,880
<i>Really? That's great!</i>

385
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,260
<i>Yeah.</i>

386
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,680
<i>I guess this place really is 
a lot different from Tokyo.</i>

387
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,000
<i>It's beautiful!</i>

388
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,400
Episode 12

389
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,400
Spring Came Again

390
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,950
Non Non Biyori
