1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,720
Color, color...

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,220
Natsumi-chan's Room

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,220
Color, color...

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,560
Color it all black...

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,360
Color over what happened back then, too...

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,370
Nattsun, I colored the cardboard.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,110
Good, thanks.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,930
Nee-chan, are you done with yours?

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,130
Not yet. I can't sew that fast.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>We're preparing for a cultural festival.</i>

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,840
<i>It'll be the biggest event of the fall season.</i>

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,970
Our school doesn't even 
have cultural festivals.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,720
Why did you have to say 
you wanted one, Natsumi?

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you guys want to do a cultural festival?

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,450
Yeah, but having it this weekend 
is really short notice.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,970
It's partly Kazu-nee's fault for 
agreeing to it, but still...

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,940
By the way, who are we going to invite?

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,540
Can't we just invite our parents?

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,660
What?! We can't invite our parents!

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,980
If our mom goes, the festival 
will be like a scene from hell!

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,650
She's a messenger from hell, you know.

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,260
Make yourselves at home, you two.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,580
Thank you.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,760
Oh, and Komari, 
Kono-chan brought the fruit over.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,260
Huh? Konomi-chan's here?

26
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,050
She was helping me peel the fruit.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,400
Kono-chan!

28
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,100
Hi, hi, hi!

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,470
You guys working hard? I came to visit.

30
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,240
Wow, what a mess!

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,310
What are you all doing?

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,040
Getting ready for a cultural festival.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,130
A cultural festival?

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,780
I thought your school didn't 
do fancy stuff like that.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,140
Natsumi said she wants to do one.

36
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,150
What're you gonna do?

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, an art display,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,260
and we were thinking of opening a café.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,690
Hirame-ou!

40
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,700
Um, I was gonna say "hirame (flounder) 
king" as a play on "hirameki" (idea),

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,800
but since "ou" means king, I thought 
"hirame-ou" might work just as well...

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,680
If you have to explain it, don't say it.

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,700
Alumni! Let's invite alumni!

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,510
Oh, are you gonna invite me, too?

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
'Course! And Hika-nee and Candy Store, too!

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,480
Episode 9

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,480
We Tried Having a Cultural Festival

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
Hello?

49
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,310
Oh, Renge, it's not often I hear from you.

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
How's everything there?

51
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,360
Well, I was just out getting 
my hair cut with my friend.

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,290
Seriously, Tokyo's incredible!

53
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,000
They've got stylists and everything!

54
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,290
It cost a ton, but...

55
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,550
What? You don't care?

56
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,980
What about a cultural festival?

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,440
Our school's gonna have a cultural festival.

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Can you come?

59
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,860
Come! Come! You have to come!

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,670
<i>Huh? That's kinda last-minute, 
and I don't have the money to get there.</i>

61
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,350
No luck with Hika-nee. She's no fun.

62
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,570
Hand me the phone.

63
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,160
I'll use my masterful way with 
words to talk her into it.

64
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,030
Hikage-chan, you'll come to 
the cultural festival, right?

65
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,410
<i>Wh-Who is this? Konomi, is that you?</i>

66
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,110
You're okay with meeting at my place?

67
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,840
<i>I can't! I don't have the money!</i>

68
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,970
That doesn't matter.

69
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,010
<i>Yes, it does!</i>

70
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay, I'll tell Kazuho-san to cover it for you.

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,080
<i>You think she'll do that?</i>

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,900
If she doesn't, we'll worry about it then.

73
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,000
<i>Then I won't be able to come back!</i>

74
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,700
Anyway, we'll go with that, 
so make sure you come!

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,580
My masterful way with words was successful!

76
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,050
How was that a way with words?

77
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,320
She has momentum, yes,
but not a way with words.

78
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,380
Well, Hika-nee is easy to push 
around, so we're good with her.

79
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,380
Should we try Candy Store next?

80
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,780
I wanna invite her! Let's go tell her!

81
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,000
Guess we should.

82
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,580
Knowing her, though, she'll probably
throw us out if we don't buy anything...

83
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,490
Just buy something and get out.

84
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,210
If you're not buying anything, 
get out right now.

85
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,130
See?

86
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,710
Just like Nattsun said.

87
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,390
What'd you say? And don't point at me.

88
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,740
So, do you think you can 
come to the festival?

89
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,650
I can't. I have to watch the store.

90
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,210
Aw, why not?

91
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,580
Nobody comes here except us.

92
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,630
Just come and bring lots of candy.

93
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,120
Are you stupid?

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
Aren't there snails in that 
rice field out there?

95
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,990
Just eat those.

96
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,270
You eat snails, right?

97
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,680
Who would eat those?!

98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,110
Candy Store, you can't come to the festival?

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,720
I told you, I can't.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm working on a project 
to show at the festival!

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
Yeah?

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,420
I'm gonna help at the café, too!

103
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,920
And we're gonna do a play! And also...

104
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,200
Also...

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,620
You really can't come?

106
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,670
I can't help it. I have work.

107
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,070
D-Don't look at me like that!

108
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,330
Aw, Candy Store made Ren-chon cry.

109
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,330
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

110
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,040
It's not my fault!

111
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,770
I'm not going to any cultural 
festival, you hear me?

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,610
Candy Store won't come...

113
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,020
N-No, wait! I wasn't talking to you, Renge...

114
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,200
Oh, fine! I'll go to your festival, 
so stop looking at me like that!

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,710
You'll come?!

116
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,500
I guess even Candy Store 
can't resist Ren-chon, huh?

117
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,760
Shut up! I'll make you eat snails!

118
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,370
Asahigaoka Branch School 
Cultural Festival

119
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,980
Well, well, I'm glad you came.

120
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,450
Oh, hey.

121
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,450
I haven't been here in ages.

122
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,400
I was here until last year, so it 
doesn't feel like that long to me.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,510
Thinking about it now,

124
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,160
I can't believe we came to 
a dump like this every day.

125
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,610
Welcome!

126
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,780
Thank you for taking the time to come.

127
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,730
Welcome!

128
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,210
Hey, what's that?

129
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,500
Oh, these?

130
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,360
We all decided to run the 
café dressed as animals.

131
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,710
Hotarun is a kitty.

132
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,210
Oh, a cat, huh?

133
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,400
Hey, Candy Store, what do 
you think I'm dressed as?

134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,530
What are those things?

135
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,080
They just look like bug antennae.

136
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,420
They're not antennae.

137
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,750
You don't know, do you?

138
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,920
It's something everybody knows...

139
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,650
A giraffe!

140
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,660
No one would guess that!

141
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Weren't there any more prominent 
features you could use?

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,950
I thought you were a robot.

143
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm a giraffe!

144
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,580
Oh, this is our menu and pamphlet.

145
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,830
Oh, thanks.

146
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,250
Thank you for coming. 
Please enjoy our art displays and café.

147
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,250
Animal Café Menu

148
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,270
So you guys actually made stuff like this...

149
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,730
When I heard Natsumi organized all 
this, I wondered how it would turn out,

150
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,250
but they're doing everything right.

151
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,440
Well, after I came all the 
way here, they'd better.

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,110
So, can we go on inside?

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,880
Yes, go right ahead.

154
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,720
Yo!

155
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,100
Welcome! I am, as you all know, a UMA!

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,850
Welcome!! Cultural Festival!!

157
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,370
I'll show you to your table for four.

158
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,570
Please take any seat you like.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,540
You're Natsumi, aren't you?

160
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,490
I am not Natsumi.

161
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,570
I am that which you call an 
Unidentified Mysterious Animal, a UMA.

162
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,200
What UMA are you?

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,480
Well, putting that aside, 
let me take your orders.

164
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,410
What'll it be?

165
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,790
I'll have apple cake and lemon tea.

166
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,600
I think I'll have the same.

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,700
I'll have an apple tea.

168
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,330
I'll have a grape tart.

169
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,130
Got it!

170
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,680
What's that black thing?

171
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,650
I made it!

172
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,980
That's my Nee-nee.

173
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,900
You notice things no one else does!

174
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,810
This is the latest toy that I came up with.

175
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,960
You stick your face through 
the back like this...

176
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,050
D'oh. I've had it with these tricks.

177
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,910
That's how you play with it.

178
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,470
It makes you look like the end of a manga.

179
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,470
You come up with some 
difficult ways to play...

180
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,400
It's fun for one or two people!

181
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,730
Try it with me, Candy Store!

182
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,660
Seriously, no.

183
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,000
I've brought some water.

184
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,260
Oh, thanks.

185
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,230
What's Koma-chan doing?

186
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,770
Senpai is on standby.

187
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,200
I made the ears she's wearing,

188
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,760
and they look best of all, 
so look forward to it!

189
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,420
Well, we've got everyone's orders,

190
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,790
so let's go to the home ec. 
room and start cooking.

191
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,730
Okay!

192
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,480
Ren-chan, take care of the rest.

193
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,230
Okay!

194
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,990
You're not going to cook, Renge?

195
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm doing a play.

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,190
You're going to play the recorder?

197
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,690
It's not just me. Koma-chan is in it, too.

198
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,110
Koma-chan, we're doing our play!

199
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,060
Um, I really don't want to do this...

200
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,070
What are you talking about? Hurry up!

201
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,920
What the heck is that?

202
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,420
U-Um, well, see...

203
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,250
I lost at rock-paper-scissors, and 
Natsumi forced me to put this on.

204
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,550
And I think you'd be better off 
doing this by yourself, Renge...

205
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,200
Koma-chan, stop complaining.

206
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,380
We're going to show everyone our play.

207
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,730
W-We're really doing this?

208
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,820
I'm going to drum on my belly!

209
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,180
Bum! Bum! Badda-bum!

210
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,150
Bum! Bum! Badda-bum!

211
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,390
Bum! Bum! Badda-bum!

212
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,500
Bum! Bum! Bum! Badda-bum!

213
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,040
Badda-bum! Badda-badda-bum...

214
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,280
Badda... bum... bum...

215
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,450
I can't take it anymore.

216
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,620
That was great, Komari-chan!

217
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,170
I could never do that! Way to go!

218
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,170
Koma-chan, we're not done yet!

219
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,800
Did you have to pour salt on the wound?

220
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,840
Huh? But she tried really 
hard. We should praise her.

221
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,910
It's better to just let her go without a word.

222
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,730
Uh, I'm sorry.

223
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,910
It looks like our Koma-chan caused a scene.

224
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,580
Now that it's come to this,

225
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,160
as the one in charge, 
I prepared a side show.

226
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,250
What? You're gonna do something else?

227
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,800
Hika-nee, you don't see any 
tricks or setups, right?

228
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,820
No, I don't see anything.

229
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,180
Okay, then!

230
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,600
Uh... Well, what did you think?

231
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,740
Did you enjoy the show?

232
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,450
We did not! The floor's soaked!

233
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,850
You've never even done a tablecloth 
pull before, have you?!

234
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,170
I thought I could do it, though...

235
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,940
Forget what you thought!

236
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,680
You blew it! No one could enjoy that!

237
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,850
But there were no tricks or setups.

238
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,860
Set something up! Anything! 
Just do something right!

239
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,180
Okay, Natsumi, I won't 
get mad. Just come here.

240
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,440
Come here and I'll put a joint lock on you.

241
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,400
Get her, Candy Store!

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,890
What?! What's going on?!

243
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,390
This is an unbelievable complainant!

244
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,120
Okay, I'm going to go start cooking,

245
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,910
so at least clean up the floor for me!

246
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,930
Rag, rag...

247
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,170
Komari gets depressed 
and goes off to hide,

248
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,080
and Natsumi makes an 
unnecessary ruckus...

249
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,550
What's wrong with the Koshigaya 
family these days?

250
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,460
Faithful Dog

251
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,720
I don't care how, but you better 
redeem yourselves, Koshigayas!

252
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,510
I'm begging you, Koshigayas!

253
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,570
Hey, how long has it been?

254
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,800
Thirty minutes or so.

255
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
That's pretty long, no matter 
what they're trying to do.

256
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,340
Hey, we haven't gotten our orders yet.

257
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,840
Nattsun! You have to work!

258
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,610
Senpai! Please come back to life!

259
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,650
How can people be so unmotivated?

260
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,330
Are you even making the stuff we ordered?

261
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,990
Yeah, well, about that...

262
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,880
Even after looking at the recipes, 
we still couldn't figure it out...

263
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,960
And then Koma-chan got all 
depressed, and it's just chaos.

264
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,730
I give up!

265
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,330
Man, running a café is hard!

266
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,330
We shouldn't have done it 
on the spur of the moment.

267
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,710
Oh, but we have the ingredients, 
so you can eat whatever you want.

268
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,820
By the way, Candy Store,

269
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,640
I bet this would look good on you!

270
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,680
Here, try it on!

271
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,990
Yep! Just like I thought! 
It suits you, Candy Store!

272
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,620
Delicious!

273
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,850
Food that we made ourselves 
is ten times as good!

274
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,910
I'm glad you feel better, Senpai.

275
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,570
We got roped into helping in the end.

276
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,840
Well, we had fun, so it's all good.

277
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,190
Candy Store, isn't it yummy?

278
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,850
Yeah, and even better when I get 
to see a fun side show with it.

279
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,890
Um, I am truly sorry for 
getting carried away...

280
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,970
...and causing so much trouble for every—

281
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,500
Let's hear that one more time!

282
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,710
I am truly sorry for getting carried away...

283
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,500
...and causing so much 
trouble for everyone.

284
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,630
I've had it with cultural festivals.

285
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,610
And now I'm five for five.

286
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,780
Man, you're too good 
at this, Konomi-chan!

287
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,590
Let's play a different game.

288
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,580
You know, your family sure 
keeps stuff for a long time.

289
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,880
This game console is from ages ago,

290
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,620
and your DVD player also 
plays video tapes, right?

291
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,030
Well, the game console used to be our dad's.

292
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,380
There you are. Could you 
come in here for a minute?

293
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,770
What's up?

294
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,170
Well, actually...

295
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,710
Could you help me clean my room?

296
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,900
No way.

297
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,620
You've gotta clean your own room.

298
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,870
I can't!

299
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,870
Mom said I don't get dinner 
if I don't finish it today!

300
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,190
You've gotta help!

301
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,940
Well, we did use your room to get 
ready for the cultural festival...

302
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,920
If you're helping her, I guess I will, too.

303
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,930
I won't have anyone to play with, anyway.

304
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,200
Thanks!

305
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,830
It's been a week since the 
cultural festival, right?

306
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,190
You've left this mess here that whole time?

307
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,080
Well, I kinda got used to it...

308
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,440
Hey, you want me to put the 
art supplies in the closet?

309
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,280
Yeah, that's fine, please.

310
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,860
Hey, what are these?

311
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,590
What? Not my zero test scores, right?

312
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,040
No, this.

313
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,330
Oh, that?

314
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,180
You flip it inside-out like this,

315
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,530
set it on the floor, and...

316
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,900
...it pops up like this.

317
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,470
Brings back memories. I used to 
play with these all the time.

318
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,660
I don't remember that at all...

319
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,910
I might have other stuff like this.

320
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,760
Let's take a quick look.

321
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,050
I know I'm the one who brought it up,

322
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,380
but won't this distract us from cleaning?

323
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,810
Oh, come on.

324
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,500
My toy box is a box of memories,

325
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,720
so I want to share it with everyone.

326
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,270
Fine, but make it quick.

327
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,300
Recognize this?

328
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,630
Oh! I know that one!

329
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,050
The things that go down stairs, right?

330
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,370
Hika-nee and I used to always play 
with these on the shrine steps.

331
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,290
You went to the shrine because there 
are no stairs in the house, right?

332
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,240
I've been thinking this for a while now...

333
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,810
Those aren't toys that were popular 
when we were kids, are they?

334
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,900
They were popular!

335
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,820
About five years ago, about half the 
kids in school were into them...

336
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,480
Er, half the students is still only a few...

337
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,790
You bought that at the candy store, right?

338
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,660
Candy Store's grandma still 
owned the store five years ago,

339
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,640
so apparently, their stock 
didn't change in twenty years.

340
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Seriously?!

341
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,120
Is that a caterpillar?!

342
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,520
What?! Where?!

343
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,430
By the way, this is...

344
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,450
I think that's from quite a while ago, too.

345
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,660
Really? That's weird...

346
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,210
Let's find something else.

347
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,980
Like slime or mini-cars...

348
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,460
See? We did get distracted.

349
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,790
Nacchan, if you're gonna play, 
I won't help you anymore.

350
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,330
Just hang on...

351
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,530
Let's share our memories just a little longer.

352
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,640
Whoa! I found Nee-chan's 
essay from first grade!

353
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,210
What?!

354
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,170
Let's see...

355
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,900
"My name is Komari."

356
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,920
"When I grow up, I want to be a flower."

357
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,460
"I want to be a tulip..."

358
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,240
Hey! Why are you reading it out loud?!

359
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,410
Give that back!

360
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,250
Come on, it's nothing to 
be embarrassed about.

361
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,200
All first graders are like this.

362
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,220
I don't care! Just hand it over!

363
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,460
I know you're laughing 
on the inside, anyway!

364
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm not. I'm not laughing.

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
See?! You are laughing!

366
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,420
Give it back!

367
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,800
Hang on! I haven't finished reading it!

368
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,350
You don't have to finish it!

369
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,290
Aw, why not? Just a little...

370
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,330
I said no!

371
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,630
Hey, you two!

372
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,440
Don't just take it like you 
did with Shokichi-san!

373
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,440
If you keep that up, your 
mom will yell at you!

374
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,920
I didn't even mean to—

375
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,660
Hey! Natsumi! Are you done cleaning?

376
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,710
Oh, Kono-chan. Are you helping Natsumi?

377
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,600
I had nothing else to do...

378
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,920
What are they doing?

379
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,900
It looks like they slipped and fell somehow.

380
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll keep an eye on them to make 
sure they finish by dinner.

381
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,290
Sorry about that.

382
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh, since you'll be here, 
why don't you eat with us?

383
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,750
Sure. Thank you.

384
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,130
Whew, that was close.

385
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,880
Your mom's lightning bolts were 
about to start coming down.

386
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,580
Konomi-chan, easy on the Iron Claw...

387
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,870
Well, it was better than your 
mom yelling at you, right?

388
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,190
Why'd you do it to me, too?

389
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,100
All right, let's get cleaning.

390
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,120
Right.

391
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,700
That should do it.

392
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,250
I'm exhausted! You owe me, you know.

393
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,070
Thank you, dear sisters!

394
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,080
It's already 4:00. 
What should we do until dinner?

395
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,550
Want to play video games again?

396
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,540
Oh, if you're doing that, 
I found something cool earlier!

397
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,550
Ta-da! I found a video tape with 
<i>Pretty Cute</i> recorded on it!

398
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,710
Wow, I remember that!

399
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,730
Isn't that anime from about ten years ago?

400
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,570
I used to watch that, too.

401
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,990
Though, even then, 
nobody recorded on video tapes...

402
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,630
Now, now. Let's just steep 
ourselves in memories today.

403
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,130
I don't remember for sure,

404
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,290
Pretty Cute

405
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,330
but that's not the tape we 
accidentally recorded over, is it?

406
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,060
No way! Really?

407
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,210
Well, we'll find out when we watch it.

408
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,350
Oh, it's playing!

409
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,650
<i>Natsumi!</i>

410
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,160
<i>Yes!</i>

411
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,430
It's Nacchan when she was little!

412
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,980
<i>Yay!</i>

413
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,060
<i>It's Nii-chan!</i>

414
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,740
<i>I love Nii-chan!</i>

415
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,010
<i>Guess what? When I grow up, 
I'm gonna marry Nii-chan!</i>

416
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,930
Hey, all little kids are like that.

417
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,530
Wasn't it nice sharing memories today?

418
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,420
Natsumi, wanna play?

419
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,000
You can pick whatever game you want.

420
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:19,340
That's all for today

421
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,930
<i>Suddenly, out of the blue,</i>

422
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,730
<i>with a torn-up love letter in hand...</i>

423
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,390
<i>A quack doctor in the 
depths of despair—</i>

424
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,430
Episode 10

425
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,430
We Watched the First 
Sunrise of the Year

426
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,980
Non Non Biyori
