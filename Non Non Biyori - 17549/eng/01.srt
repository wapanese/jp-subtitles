00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,690
<i>This is my village.</i>

2
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,170
<i>It's a quiet, peaceful place.</i>

3
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,240
<i>But... sometimes I think...</i>

4
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,880
<i>Do I actually...</i>

5
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,430
Ren-chon!

6
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,330
<i>...live in the country?</i>

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,480
Episode 1

8
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,480
A New Transfer Student Came

9
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,130
Mornin'!

10
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,670
Say again?

11
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,690
Meowning.

12
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,690
I still don't get it. What's that mean?

13
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,900
Meow... ning!

14
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,060
Meowning...

15
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,930
Is Koma-chan coming?

16
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,840
She left earlier.

17
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,400
Such a nice day, and we 
have to go to school...

18
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,630
I'm still a bright, shiny first 
grader, so I think it's fun.

19
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,190
That won't last long.

20
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,450
School life is tough, you know.

21
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,280
What with homework, tests, homework...

22
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,130
We had miso soup with horsetail 
shoots this morning.

23
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,110
We had egg soup with horsetail 
shoots and onions.

24
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,460
Run, Ren-chon!

25
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,790
Renge! Natsumi!

26
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,370
Nee-chan!

27
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,700
Nattsun, did you see the news today?

28
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,880
No, I was in a hurry.

29
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,260
I didn't, either.

30
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,480
Too bad. Today's news was exciting.

31
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Did something happen?

32
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,720
There was an old guy doing radio calisthenics
outside the window behind the host.

33
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,690
It was really cool.

34
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,760
Why did that make you excited?

35
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,770
Asahigaoka Branch School

36
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,790
It's still kinda chilly.

37
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,230
The classroom feels different than yesterday.

38
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,500
How so?

39
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,860
Mornin'.

40
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,300
Take your seats.

41
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,480
Um...

42
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,290
Can you introduce yourself?

43
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,290
Ichijou...

44
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,340
Ichijou Hotaru

45
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,430
U-Um... I'm Ichijou Hotaru.

46
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,340
I moved here from Tokyo.

47
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,140
Wow! From Tokyo?!

48
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,610
That says "Hotaru"?

49
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,780
I never saw that character before.

50
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,350
What grade?

51
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,750
Fifth.

52
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,950
Younger? She's younger than me?!

53
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,500
She doesn't look like a fifth grader.

54
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,250
Did you get into trouble at your old school?

55
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,200
No, it's because of my dad's work.

56
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,450
Oh, well, that sounds normal.

57
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,200
Meowning!

58
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,240
M-Meow...

59
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,410
Have a seat.

60
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
Okay.

61
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,150
Oh, that's it. There's an extra seat.

62
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,410
You just noticed?

63
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,880
Nice to meet you, Hotarun.

64
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,310
Hotarun...

65
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,220
What's first period again?

66
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,050
Japanese.

70
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,150
Oh, everyone's in a different year?

71
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,610
I'm in first grade.

72
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm in eighth.

73
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,420
I'm in seventh.

74
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,480
And Nii-chan here is in ninth.

75
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,630
But you're all in the same classroom?

76
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,400
Yeah.

77
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,910
All different classes, too?

78
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,240
What do you mean, different classes? 
This is the only class.

79
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,680
There are only four students 
in the whole school?

80
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,280
Five, now that you're here.

81
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,730
Since we're all in different grades,

82
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,450
we mostly just study on our own.

83
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,690
On your own?

84
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,340
Didn't you get a workbook?

85
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,020
Oh, I did...

86
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,540
Grade 8 Class 1

87
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,540
+ Grade 1 
+ Grade 7 
+ Grade 9

88
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,020
Well, what should we do?

89
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,540
I think...

90
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,010
Dodge ball! I'm good at dodge ball!

91
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,330
Dodge ball, huh?

92
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,020
Um...

93
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,020
I wondered when I was on my 
way to the classroom, too...

94
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,990
What are those buckets for?

95
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,560
Oh, they're just to catch leaks.

96
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,030
So try not to get too close to them.

97
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,500
I see.

98
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,730
It'd be a pain if a bucket got moved and
we couldn't tell where the leak was.

99
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,060
No, that's not why.

100
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,200
The floor around them is 
rotten from the moisture.

101
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
If you get too close, you'll fall through.

102
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,540
What?!

103
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm just kidding.

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,100
No idiot has ever fallen 
through the floor before.

105
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,550
We're just supposed to be careful.

106
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,990
I see...

107
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,340
Here it comes!

108
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,000
Take that!

109
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,670
Darn it!

110
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,370
Huh?

111
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,710
Hotarun!

112
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,550
Hotarun's out.

113
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,880
I shouldn't have tried to catch it...

114
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,820
There's a key on the ground.

115
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,550
Oh, that's mine.

116
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,160
A key? To what?

117
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,340
What's up?

118
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,140
No one in my family will 
be home until tonight,

119
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,900
so I brought a house key.

120
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,820
Ren-chon, do you lock your house door?

121
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,050
No.

122
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,910
Nee-chan, ours don't lock either, do they?

123
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,150
I've never even seen a lock.

124
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,910
Me, either...

125
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,190
You're unusual.

126
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,650
Then, what should I use my key for?

127
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,480
Filleting mackerel?

128
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,210
Finally done!

129
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,560
Let's head home.

130
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,110
Hotarun!

131
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,980
Want to come to my house?

132
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,280
You don't want to?

133
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,770
Oh, sure.

134
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,070
Just for a little while.

135
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,350
Those are tangerine trees.

136
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,090
The new blossoms are just coming out.

137
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,710
You grow tangerines here?

138
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,430
Also rice and vegetables, mainly.

139
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,640
Oh, and leaves.

140
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,900
Leaves?

141
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,380
The kind you garnish food with.

142
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,810
Um, do you have any stores?

143
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,240
There's a co-op and a candy store.

144
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,070
Um, any others?

145
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,050
The police box?

146
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,550
That's not a store.

147
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,200
Is there a bookstore?

148
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,100
The candy store sells magazines.

149
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,840
They come in two days late, though.

150
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,500
So... no convenience stores, either?

151
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,180
I've seen commercials about them!

152
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,670
Cattle Crossing

153
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,700
Cattle?

154
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,010
And sometimes deer.

155
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,770
And boars.

156
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,280
What's wrong?

157
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,410
I was just thinking it's nothing like Tokyo...

158
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,440
Guess it's still too early 
to put the kotatsu away.

159
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,020
You noticed the door wasn't locked, right?

160
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,860
Yes.

161
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,930
My mom and dad are out in the fields today.

162
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,870
Nee-chan, grab that for me.

163
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,760
Can't you get it yourself?

164
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,490
Here.

165
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,220
Thanks.

166
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,310
What's this about, Ren-chon?

167
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm gonna show Hotarun 
my special talent!

168
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,910
No sound's coming out.

169
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,300
Still no sound coming out...

170
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,360
Whoa, something came out!

171
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,630
A tanuki!

172
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,220
You have a pet tanuki?

173
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,460
And the tanuki actually heard that?

174
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,430
I gave it a name, too.

175
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,400
What kind of name?

176
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,260
Gu!

177
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,040
Gu's Dish

178
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh! A psychedelic name!

179
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,420
And if I whistle again, Gu will do a trick!

180
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,330
Seriously?!

181
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,340
It made a sound this time!

182
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,680
What's Gu gonna do?!

183
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,080
Ren-chon!

184
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,940
Morning!

185
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,780
Ren-chon?

186
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,440
Nattsun...

187
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,230
Do we live in the country?

188
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,530
Where's this coming from?

189
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,430
Hotarun was really surprised.

190
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,900
Having all different grades in 
one classroom, and the tanuki...

191
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,070
Nee-nee told me that if you drive 
a car at fifty kilometers per hour,

192
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,190
you'll get to a place fifty 
kilometers away in one hour,

193
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,870
and that's really amazing.

194
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,880
I see.

195
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,660
Just so you know, if you drive 
fifty kilometers per hour,

196
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,630
you can't get to a place fifty kilometers
away in one hour because of traffic lights.

197
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,100
Yeah... I knew that.

198
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,510
But even in Tokyo,

199
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm sure there are places with combined elementary and middle schools,

200
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,980
even if they're not in the same room.

201
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,670
And there are no traffic 
lights on the highway.

202
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,120
It doesn't mean we live in the country.

203
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,490
Hotarun, hello!

204
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,860
Morning!

205
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,380
Meowning.

206
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,000
Good morning.

207
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,200
Ren-chon?

208
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,470
But a tanuki lives at my house,
so I think we're in the country...

209
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,440
You're still talking about that?

210
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,210
What were you talking about?

211
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,460
Whether we live in the country or not.

212
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,680
Is this really the country?

213
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,380
If you think about it logically...

214
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,870
Nah, just because we live here,

215
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,290
that doesn't mean it's the country.

216
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,720
You already sound like a country girl.

217
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,400
But even in Tokyo, 
monkeys randomly show up.

218
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,730
So just because a tanuki shows up,
it doesn't mean this is the country, right?

219
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,590
Right?

220
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,590
Ah...

221
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,700
You really don't want this 
to be the country, do you?

222
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,640
If living in the country means it's so 
inconvenient you can't do anything,

223
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,400
just having cattle and tanuki doesn't 
make anything inconvenient, right?

224
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,810
So this isn't the country.

225
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,570
I get it!

226
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:14,700
So, this isn't the country...

227
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,810
I think I feel better.

228
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,990
Glad to hear it!

229
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,410
What a good girl you are.

230
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,210
Let's eat!

231
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,360
This was made with the wild 
plants we picked today.

232
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,950
Horsetail shoots, wild udo, and tara sprouts.

233
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,620
It's good!

234
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,190
It sort of tastes like spring!

235
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,460
Hotarun, save your 
sakura mochi dessert.

236
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,520
How far are we going?

237
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,710
We're almost there.

238
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,680
Hotarun!

239
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,230
Good, isn't it?

240
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,010
Yes, delicious!

241
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,180
We'll bring you here again.

242
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:10,580
Grade 8 Class 1

243
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:10,580
+ Grade 1
+ Grade 7
+ Grade 9
+ Grade 5

244
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,080
Wait!

245
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,270
We took it too slow...

246
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,100
By the way, when does the next bus come?

247
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,990
In two hours.

248
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,990
What?!

249
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,900
Man, buses in the country 
are so inconvenient.

250
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,730
I knew it!

251
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:19,340
That's all for today

252
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,780
<i>Anyone want to go play ball?</i>

253
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,680
<i>I do!</i>

254
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,300
<i>Besides, that flan was mine!</i>

255
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>One bite of flan is the same 
size as a piece of candy!</i>

256
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,460
<i>A candy store with Senpai...</i>

257
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,410
<i>10,000 yen?!</i>

258
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,440
Episode 2

259
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,440
We Went to the Candy Store

260
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,950
Restaurant Non Non

261
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,950
Please Watch Again
