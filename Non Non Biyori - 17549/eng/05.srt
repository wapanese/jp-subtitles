1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,500
This is my first summer 
vacation since moving here.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,910
The cicadas' voices are full of energy,

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,220
Hiyori Shrine Stop

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,040
and the sun is sizzling hot,

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,230
but there's always a nice, cool breeze,
so we don't need an air conditioner.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,230
And every day, I wake up early for...

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>Exercises to move your body side to side.</i>

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,600
<i>With a bit of bounce!</i>

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,660
<i>Three, four, five, six, seven, eight!</i>

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,270
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,680
<i>Five, six, seven, eight!</i>

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,420
Hi-yah!

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,590
Mocchoroke dancing!

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,650
Well? What do you think of my dance?

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,000
This is supposed to be 
calisthenics, not dancing.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm pretty sure this is supposed 
to be Kazu-chan's job.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,400
Nee-nee is sleeping again today.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,210
I'll have to have a talk with her soon.

19
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,280
You should.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,520
Today's fortune was,

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,290
"Misfortune will fall 
upon someone you know."

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,530
I wonder if our chaperone is going to get
KO'd before we even get to the beach.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,420
By the way, your parents leave to work in 
the fields early every morning, don't they?

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,190
Since Kazu-chan is still sleeping, 
want to have breakfast at our house?

25
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,510
Yes!

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,140
Would you like to come, too, Hotaru-chan?

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,640
Is that okay?

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,470
Sure. The more, the merrier.

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,200
Now that I think about it,

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
is this the first time you're 
coming to our house, Hotarun?

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,270
I've never been.

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,990
We're all going to the beach 
together later, so come on over.

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,510
Okay!

34
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,430
<i>Breakfast at Senpai's house...</i>

35
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,460
Episode 5

36
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,460
I Pretended I Forgot My Swimsuit

37
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,650
Sorry to make you come 
shopping for breakfast with me.

38
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,820
Oh, it's fine. But was 
there a store around here?

39
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,570
Yeah, right over here.

40
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,850
Where do you go shopping, Hotaru?

41
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,350
On the weekends, my family drives to the city.

42
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,070
Lucky. We might not even 
go to the city once a month.

43
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,320
And we've arrived while we were talking.

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,290
Vegetables for Sale 
 Everything 100 yen

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,290
Payment

46
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,920
Huh? This is the store?

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Hm? Well, there's no one working,
but it's open twenty-four hours a day,

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,800
so it's pretty much like a convenience store.

49
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,560
They don't have these in the city?

50
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't say I've seen one...

51
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,150
That's pretty different.

52
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,040
Huh? It is?

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,390
Well, whatever. Let's head back.

54
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,020
Oh, I'll hold the tomatoes.

55
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,170
It's fine. They're not heavy.

56
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,290
But I feel bad. I'll hold at least half!

57
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,340
We're home.

58
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,730
I brought rice!

59
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,450
You're big, Hotarun, so I got lots for you!

60
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,560
Wow, you sure did.

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,430
Eat lots and get bigger!

62
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,190
Food's here.

63
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

64
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,210
Oh, not at all. I'm sorry for not helping.

65
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,180
You're a guest, Hotaru, 
so don't worry about it.

66
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,100
Well then...

67
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,520
Let's eat!

68
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,250
Wow...

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,800
Is something wrong?

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,230
Oh, no.

71
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,600
This is just my first time eating 
breakfast at a friend's house...

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
We do this all the time.

73
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,320
Munch, munch, munch, munch, non?

74
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,870
I could only understand "non."

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,430
So how are you liking 
summer vacation here?

76
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,540
Doing radio calisthenics at a shrine,

77
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,490
buying vegetables from 
an unmanned stand,

78
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,440
and having breakfast with everyone...

79
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,990
It's all so new to me.

80
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,080
Oh, really?

81
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,290
Yes!

82
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,840
Hotaru-chan is such a good, 
honest girl, unlike Natsumi.

83
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,930
You don't have to compare us!

84
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,560
Let's just hurry up and eat 
and go to the beach. The beach!

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
We're really going to the beach?

86
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,400
Of course!

87
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,570
Kazu-chan is going to the 
beach with you guys, right?

88
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,510
Munch, munch, munch, munch, non.

89
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,830
Um, there's a tomato in my miso soup!

90
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,730
Sure there is.

91
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,750
You don't usually put them 
in yours, Hotaru-chan?

92
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,710
We usually put in tofu and seaweed...

93
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,760
Well, we put in tofu, too...

94
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,760
It might be unique, but it just 
adds a little sourness. It's good.

95
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,160
Well then...

96
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,790
So, we're at the beach.

97
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,230
It is indeed the beach...

98
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,260
But, this is the country.

99
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,910
Why are there so many people at the beach?

100
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,530
There are indeed a lot...

101
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,390
It's not like there's anything special 
at a country beach like this.

102
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,500
Maybe they're people coming 
home for the summer...

103
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,190
You're not swimming, Koma-chan?

104
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,210
Not yet.

105
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,480
Did you forget your swimsuit?

106
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,020
I just like to look at the ocean.

107
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,920
You say that, but I bet you 
just don't like the fact...

108
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,100
...that you don't look like a middle 
schooler when you wear a swimsuit.

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,270
Yes, that's right!

110
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,700
And I was trying to forget that 
and just enjoy the beach...

111
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,990
Oh, sorry, sorry.

112
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,590
Um, how tall are you right now, Koma-chan?

113
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm just under 140 centimeters.

114
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,560
You probably don't know because 
you're not around kids your age,

115
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,700
but that's about average.

116
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
What?

117
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,430
I think the average for fourteen 
year olds is about 140 centimeters.

118
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,210
What? Really?!

119
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,050
Uh... yeah.

120
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,970
Crap.

121
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,560
I can't let her know that this 
is data from the Meiji era.

122
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Meiji?!

123
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,940
Oh, did I say that out loud?

124
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm smaller than people from the Meiji era?!

125
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,800
And I was padding it quite 
a bit when I said 140, too!

126
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,950
Now, now, calm down.

127
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,110
You're only in eighth grade, 
so there's still time.

128
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,000
You'll grow before you know it.

129
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,960
Wait, you padded your height?

130
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,790
Sorry!

131
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,500
It took me a little while to get my swimsuit on!

132
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,610
What are you doing?

133
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,440
Nothing. We're just playing a little game.

134
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,820
Where'd she go? Where'd she go?

135
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,570
See?

136
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,690
Huh?

137
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,540
I'm thirsty.

138
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,420
Juice!

139
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,560
I'll go buy some juice.

140
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,030
Nah, it's right over there. I'll go.

141
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,650
It's fine. I'd like to be alone.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,970
Is something wrong with Senpai?

143
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,870
You should ask yourself that, 
deep down in your chest...

144
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,980
More importantly, are you 
really a fifth grader?

145
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,390
This is why I didn't want 
to come to the beach.

146
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,740
It would have been a lot more 
fun if we'd gone to the city.

147
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,720
Isn't this vending machine 
way taller than necessary?

148
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,500
The vending machine's mocking me, too?

149
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,750
Oh, hey, you there.

150
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,220
Yes?

151
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,920
Do you have a minute?

152
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
Huh?

153
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,210
Um, isn't Senpai taking a while?

154
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,190
Hey, come back here!

155
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,080
Sorry!

156
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,830
Now that you mention it...

157
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,830
Man, what's that juice doing, anyway?

158
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,040
Don't turn your sister into juice...

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,310
It has been about thirty minutes, 
and the shop is right there...

160
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,670
I wonder if someone hit on her.

161
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,010
No one would hit on a squirt like her.

162
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,850
Though, I could definitely 
see her being kidnapped.

163
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,090
Just kidding.

164
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,950
S-Senpai was kidnapped?!

165
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,060
Hey... I was joking...

166
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,100
But it's not impossible!

167
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,800
Senpai's really cute!

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,700
And small! And easy to carry!

169
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,200
Easy to carry?!

170
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,130
But then again...

171
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,200
I wouldn't put it past Nee-chan to 
follow anyone for a piece of candy.

172
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,300
Senpai's been kidnapped!

173
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,500
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are we going to do?

174
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,210
What am I supposed to tell my mom?

175
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,920
H-Hey, calm down and let's 
think about this rationally.

176
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,940
Okay, first off,

177
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,920
I've come with you today as a 
friend, not as a teacher, right?

178
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,900
So, I can't be held responsible 
for any of this, and such. Right?

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,620
<i>We have to...</i>

180
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,250
<i>...pull it together...</i>

181
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,370
<i>...or there might not be any hope.</i>

182
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,830
All right! Anyway, 
let's all go look for her!

183
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,720
Right!

184
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,610
We're gonna look for Koma-chan!

185
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,580
Right. Um... right?

186
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,290
Senpai!

187
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,290
Koma-senpai!

188
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,120
Koma-chan!

189
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,260
Hey!

190
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,030
Senpai, where are you?!

191
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,640
She's not here, either.

192
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,940
Senpai!

193
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,740
Senpai!

194
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,870
Senpai! If you're here, please respond!

195
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:36,450
Ice 
Cream

196
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:36,450
Snacks, Locker Rentals

197
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,450
No sign of her at all...

198
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,960
We can't find her.

199
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,420
You don't think she was already 
taken somewhere else, do you?

200
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,140
Shenpai...

201
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,470
Whoa, Hotarun, stop! Stop!

202
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,360
<i>This is an announcement from 
the lost children center.</i>

203
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,140
<i>We have a little girl who's about 
130 centimeters, with long hair,</i>

204
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,400
<i>and her name is Koshigaya Komari-chan...</i>

205
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,110
<i>I told you, I'm not a little girl!</i>

206
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,330
They took me to the lost children 
center even though I wasn't lost!

207
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,850
They asked me where my 
mom was! What the heck?!

208
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,050
Senpai, thank goodness!

209
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,040
There's nothing good about it!

210
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,180
Man, I'm glad it didn't turn 
into anything big, Lost-chan.

211
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,090
I told you, I wasn't lost!

212
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,150
Sorry about that.

213
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,300
We apologize, as well. 
We were convinced she was lost.

214
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,500
Come to think of it, I have a feeling 
we're forgetting something...

215
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,860
Whoa, what's that?

216
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,970
Who knows?

217
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,500
Please don't push.

218
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,730
The beach was a lot of fun, huh?

219
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,210
But all those transfers are really tiring.

220
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,190
Yeah.

221
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,220
It's pretty dark out... What time is it?

222
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,700
Aw, it's already 8 o'clock?

223
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,210
Well, this is our last transfer. We can do it.

224
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,230
Oh, really?

225
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,700
Yeah. Once we get on the 
next train, we can go home.

226
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,640
When's the next train coming?

227
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,380
Hm? The last train should be 
here in about twenty minutes.

228
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,860
I can finally rest. Looking for 
that lost kid wore me out.

229
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,070
I wasn't lost.

230
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,220
Don't worry about it.

231
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,080
Oh.

232
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,400
What is it?

233
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,370
There are a lot of oranges 
lying around the tracks.

234
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,930
Looks like there's a summer 
orange grove over there.

235
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,010
This is the first time I've seen one.

236
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,560
Now that I saw that, I'm hungry.

237
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,610
How does seeing oranges on 
the ground make you hungry?

238
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,530
Well, we haven't had dinner.

239
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,620
Stand-and-Eat                  Konsuke
Noodles

240
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,340
Can we eat at that shop?

241
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,360
Sure, but I'm going to head 
over to the other track.

242
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,900
Me! I want to eat, too!

243
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,240
Okay! Let's hurry!

244
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,130
Should we go, too?

245
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,550
Yeah, let's.

246
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,750
The next train's the last one, so if 
you're late, I'm leaving you here.

247
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,910
Okay!

248
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,110
Here's your kitsune udon.

249
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,440
Wow.

250
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,080
This is my first time eating 
in a place like this.

251
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,010
We must be in the city. It's so cool 
to see food shops in the station.

252
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,230
And there are actually people 
working at the station.

253
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,460
This seems pretty normal...

254
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,090
Ma'am, is one child seat enough?

255
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,800
Oh, thanks!

256
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,880
Only I get a chair!

257
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,910
Yep.

258
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,810
He asked if one would be enough.

259
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,740
Does that mean he was trying 
to figure out if we needed two?

260
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,810
You're taking it too personally...

261
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,520
Red pepper!

262
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,910
Yeah, but the fact that he had to ask...

263
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,130
The fortune this morning was totally off!

264
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,890
It said, "Misfortune will 
fall upon someone you know,"

265
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,160
but it was me that misfortune fell upon!

266
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,760
I think he was just asking in general.

267
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,780
You think so?

268
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,950
U-Um...

269
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,430
M-My mouf... burnth...

270
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,130
Wha ith thith?!

271
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,560
Senpai?!

272
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,980
Anofer mithfowtune!

273
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,310
Don't worry about it.

274
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,540
Were you watching, Ren-chon?

275
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Senpai, are you all right?!

276
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,350
Hey, Nee-chan. If that's too hot, 
do you want me to eat it?

277
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,530
R-Reawwy?

278
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,060
You're sush a nithe perthon, Nathumi.

279
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,260
Don't thank me. 
It makes my heart hurt.

280
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,140
What the heck? It's not 
 nearly as hot as I expected.

281
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,620
You've got a ways to go if you're 
saying this is hot, Nee-chan.

282
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,210
Are you okay?

283
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,190
What? Does it look like I'm trying too hard?

284
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,500
Yes, it does!

285
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,520
This is so good! Super yummy!

286
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,130
Ren-chan, what have you been staring at?

287
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,810
There's a bug flying around 
the light on the ceiling.

288
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,100
You're right.

289
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,460
You were ignoring me to watch a bug?

290
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,370
Nattsun, why are you crying?

291
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,420
I don't really get it, but don't worry, Nattsun.

292
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,150
If you say so...

293
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,030
S-Senpai, the train is here!

294
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,630
If we miss this one, 
there won't be another!

295
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,770
Hurry and get ready, Ren-chon!

296
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:20,920
Even I find myself daunted by these 
smooth, yet chewy noodles. Slurp.

297
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,780
If you don't hurry, 
we're going to miss the train!

298
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,780
Thanks for the meal!

299
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,980
Thanks for the meal!

300
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,680
Hurry! Hurry!

301
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,690
We made it. Somehow.

302
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,330
Indeed.

303
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,030
<i>Thank goodness Senpai is so easy to carry.</i>

304
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,220
So you're here, too, Nii-chan?

305
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,500
You're so fast at times like these.
When did you even get on?

306
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,170
Now we can just relax until we get home.

307
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,060
Did Nee-nee miss the train?

308
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,300
U-Um... Don't worry.

309
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,030
Don't worry, Ren-chon!

310
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,000
Yep! Don't worry!

311
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,620
D-Don't worry.

312
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,650
<i>I fell asleep for a bit, but the 
train didn't come yet, did it?</i>

313
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,160
<i>There's no way they all 
forgot about me, right?</i>

314
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,140
<i>I mean, they are my students...</i>

315
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,150
<i>Nah, they couldn't have...</i>

316
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,670
Natsumi, I'm going to go pick up Kazu-chan.

317
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,110
What are you doing?

318
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,350
Crap!

319
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,880
Hey, wait!

320
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,530
Hold it!

321
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,020
You're tracking water all over the house!

322
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,960
It's because I'm so hot!

323
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,200
Make sure you clean it up with a rag!

324
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,530
Fine...

325
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,180
<i>I actually wanted to go in the water...</i>

326
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,240
<i>But with this swimsuit...</i>

327
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,240
<i>All because Mom said this one still fit, 
and wouldn't buy me a new one.</i>

328
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,480
<i>I wanted to wear something 
like Hotaru's, too...</i>

329
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,930
Rag, rag...

330
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,280
That's all for today

331
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,940
<i>I understand everything now.</i>

332
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,680
<i>There might be land mines...</i>

333
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,930
<i>If you say stuff like that...</i>

334
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,770
<i>Sliding door punch! Tile throw!</i>

335
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,930
<i>Something even scarier than Armageddon...</i>

336
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,370
<i>I'm gonna eat it!</i>
