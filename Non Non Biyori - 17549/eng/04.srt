00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,830
Closing Ceremony

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,490
<i>Before summer vacation starts,</i>

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,830
<i>on the last day of the first semester,</i>

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,570
Hotaru      Renge

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,570
<i>we all eat the watermelons 
we raised together.</i>

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>When you put salt on watermelon,</i>

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
<i>it's really sweet after the 
salty flavor goes away.</i>

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,340
There! It went over there!

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,980
Crab!

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,620
You grabbed that like a 
starving bear grabs a fish...

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,180
What're you gonna do 
with that? Keep it?

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,790
Yes.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,770
I'm going to call him Salt.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,040
You don't have much of a gift 
for naming things, do you?

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,790
Huh?

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,040
You're taking forever! What are you doing?!

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,560
We told you to bring back the 
watermelons we left cooling in the river.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,650
I forgot!

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,630
Why do you have watermelons 
at the closing ceremony?

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,920
That's hard to answer...

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,630
It's just a tradition that the 
students eat the watermelons...

22
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,890
...they raised in the school garden 
at the closing ceremony.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,090
Oh, a watermelon.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,800
It's heavy.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,150
Hand it here.

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,490
It's not damaged, is it?

27
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,740
It's nice and cool.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,110
Then let's eat it now!

29
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,810
I'm handing out your report cards first.

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,780
Report Card
Asahigaoka Branch School
Miyauchi Renge

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,780
Here's yours, Ren-chon.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,120
Five!

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,880
You're amazing, Ren-chon.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,420
I didn't do very well in math.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,990
Yay!

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,320
How's yours, Nattsun?

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,170
I'm too scared to look.

38
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,000
If my grades are bad,
Mom will yell at me again.

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,750
So many fives!

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,210
Congratulations!

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,980
Thank you!

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,890
You're smart, Nattsun!

43
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,250
You think so?

44
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,970
Maybe the age of Natsumi-chan 
has finally come...

45
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,280
Oh, by the way...

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,790
Grade school students 
are scored out of five.

47
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,990
Students from middle school up are 
scored out of ten, so take note of that.

48
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,040
Now, it's finally watermelon time!

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,460
Okay!

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,210
Line up and take a slice as I cut them.

51
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,040
Noted.

52
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,370
Nattsun, have some watermelon.

53
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,010
Life is unbelievable.

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,270
These are good, for something 
from the school garden.

55
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,530
Yeah.

56
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,480
If only life were this sweet.

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,530
I brought salt, too. Anyone want some?

58
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,130
Hmm... I might try some.

59
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,000
I guess I will, too.

60
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,250
Actually, I've never put 
salt on watermelon before.

61
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,970
Yeah, we don't do that at home.

62
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,000
It's salty...

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,110
Like life?

64
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,050
What am I gonna tell Mom?

65
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,850
What're you doing with that crab?

66
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,460
I caught it earlier.

67
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,100
Are you keeping it? 
Crabs are hard to keep in summer.

68
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,290
I can't?

69
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,450
Well, I won't say you can't...

70
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,080
But it is hot.

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,260
It'll probably be easier to keep in fall.

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,050
I'll catch another one when school starts again.

73
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,130
Well, we've had our watermelon. 
Ready to head back?

74
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, we brought your bags 
to the top of the steps.

75
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,660
Since I got bad grades,

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,790
maybe I should focus on 
stress relief this summer.

77
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,630
If you say that, 
you'll never finish your homework.

78
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,010
See you in the second semester!

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,430
Ren-chon, what're you doing?

80
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm coming!

81
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,410
Episode 4

82
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,410
Summer Vacation Started

83
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,210
Do you start summer vacation 
tomorrow, too, Nee-nee?

84
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,970
I wish.

85
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,100
I've got a lot of work to do.

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,930
By the way, your Nee-chan said 
she's coming home today.

87
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,300
But you're here, Nee-nee.

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,320
No, not me.

89
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,380
Your sister Hikage, who's going 
to high school in Tokyo.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,640
She's coming home?

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,420
Well, it is summer vacation.

92
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,950
I'm home.

93
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,590
Oh, speak of the devil.

94
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,180
Man, it's hot out there!

95
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,520
Welcome home.

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,500
How long did it take to 
get here from Tokyo?

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,850
Eh, like, six hours?

98
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,960
There's juice in the fridge.

99
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,690
'Kay...

100
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,730
Whew, that's cool.

101
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,040
Hika-nee, Hika-nee.

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,860
Huh?

103
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,700
What was the city like?

104
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,970
You wanna know?

105
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,040
You know, there are tons 
of buildings in the city!

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
And they're really tall!

107
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,980
How tall?

108
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,690
You can't look at them unless you 
tilt your head back this far.

109
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,450
That's tall!

110
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,450
The city must be so amazing.

111
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,190
Plus, I actually rode it today, y'know.

112
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,800
That "bullet train" thing.

113
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,250
Those long ones?

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,120
Yeah! The long ones!

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,170
Most trains are long.

116
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,410
And they even bring you 
juice and stuff on a cart.

117
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,320
High-tech!

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,150
That's not really high-tech.

119
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,620
I wanna be the cart pusher! 
Let's play bullet train!

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,020
Okay, go for it.

121
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,360
Roll, roll. Would you like some juice?

122
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,910
Bell pepper juice, mustard 
spinach juice, spinach juice?

123
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,650
Those are all vegetable juices...

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,700
Excuse us.

125
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,320
Oh, Hika-nee, you're home?

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,580
Hey.

127
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,450
I just got back.

128
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,240
Oh, is she new?

129
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,210
Nice to meet you.

130
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,460
Nice to meet you.

131
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,520
She moved here from Tokyo.

132
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,210
Toky—

133
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,180
How long did you live in Tokyo?

134
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,550
From kindergarten until this past April.

135
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,350
S-So you're more of a city girl than I am, huh?

136
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,710
More of one?

137
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,760
Hika-nee, you're a country 
girl through and through.

138
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,790
She was trying to talk like a city girl earlier.

139
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,530
I was just trying to act a little cool...

140
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,430
Hotarun, have you ever 
been on a bullet train?

141
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,740
No, not a bullet train.

142
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,710
Oh, really? You've never 
ridden a bullet train?

143
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,720
Bullet trains are awesome!

144
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,360
Now, why don't I tell you 
all about bullet trains?

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,150
Hotarun, you didn't ride a bullet 
train when you moved here?

146
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
I came on an airplane, not a bullet train.

147
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,670
A—

148
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,420
Airplane?!

149
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,120
You flew? You actually flew?!

150
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,960
Why didn't you tell us?!

151
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,370
Airplane!

152
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,370
Come and tell us all about 
airplanes in the other room!

153
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,230
Nice idea!

154
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,120
Here, Hotarun, sit!

155
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
C'mon, hurry up!

156
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,020
Okay...

157
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,660
How high do airplanes fly?

158
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,700
Well... above the clouds, at least...

159
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,510
The clouds?!

160
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,880
Wow!

161
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,650
Bullet trains, see, have these, 
like, armrests on the seats...

162
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,070
Oh?

163
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,920
Nee-nee, it's time for breakfast.

164
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,620
So much food... So much money...

165
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,560
I don't know what to do with it all...

166
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,230
Nee-nee! Wake up!

167
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,230
Ouch, that hurts!

168
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,090
That means I'm not dreaming!

169
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,540
Oh man...

170
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,540
Foxtail, foxtail...

171
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll play with you just like a cat...

172
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,610
My name's Renge.

173
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,750
My name's Honoka.

174
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,520
I came to stay at my grandma's 
house for summer vacation.

175
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,670
Oh.

176
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,130
And my dad let me borrow his camera, 
so I was taking some pictures.

177
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,730
Oh, camera!

178
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,960
If you want to take pictures, 
I'll show you around.

179
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,460
Really?

180
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,990
Let's go this way.

181
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,680
Okay!

182
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,030
Where are we going?

183
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,750
There's something cool this way!

184
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,210
There it is!

185
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,130
A water wheel!

186
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,050
I've never seen one before!

187
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,050
I know lots of great places.

188
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,230
It's turning fast!

189
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm gonna take pictures!

190
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,310
I got them!

191
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,240
Want to take a picture, too?

192
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,710
Yes, I do!

193
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,220
Here.

194
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,020
What do I do with it?

195
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,930
Um, you push that button.

196
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,510
Oh, point the lens that way.

197
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,660
I'm not really good with machines.

198
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,090
I'm a photographer!

199
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,070
I need more lighting!

200
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,480
That was my first time taking pictures.

201
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,620
I got some good shots.

202
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,840
It's actually my first time, too.

203
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,640
I think it set my photographer's spirit on fire!

204
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,450
I'll take you to some other places!

205
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,720
Oh, I'm supposed to be 
back for lunch today.

206
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,190
You are?

207
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,320
Where's your house?

208
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,210
Close to that bridge I was on earlier.

209
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,130
Okay, I'll walk with you.

210
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,770
How old are you, Honoka-chin?

211
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,370
I'm in first grade.

212
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,020
So am I!

213
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,200
So we're the same!

214
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,640
We're the same!

215
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,660
Thanks for coming with me.

216
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,870
And thanks for showing me your camera.

217
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,280
Oh...

218
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,250
Renge-chan, can you play again tomorrow?

219
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,640
Yes.

220
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Really? Okay, see you tomorrow!

221
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,110
Wanna take the bus to the 
store with me tomorrow?

222
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm busy.

223
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,820
Huh?

224
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,070
Well, Renge-chan, see you tomorrow!

225
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,170
Tomorrow, I'll take you where 
there's a little waterfall.

226
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,100
Okay! I can't wait!

227
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,600
Bye bye!

228
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,060
Ren-chon, you've been getting 
up early a lot lately.

229
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,700
I'm going to play with Honoka-chin!

230
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,560
Oh, the girl staying with the Ishikawas?

231
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
What about breakfast?

232
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,260
I'll take bread with me!

233
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,610
Change clothes before you go.

234
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,010
I know!

235
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,580
Ishikawa

236
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,100
Oh, hello there.

237
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,740
Let's see... You're Renge-chan, aren't you?

238
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,410
I came to play with Honoka-chin.

239
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,490
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

240
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:25,050
My son, Honoka's father, 
had a sudden call from work.

241
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,420
They had to leave quickly yesterday.

242
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,280
And you came all this way. I'm sorry.

243
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,540
Thank you for playing with Honoka.

244
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,640
Whew, it's too hot for shopping.

245
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,760
You chilled the watermelon, right?

246
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,270
It's been a week since
Honoka-chan left. You're still sad?

247
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm not sad.

248
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,750
But I want some somen.

249
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,250
And plum kelp tea.

250
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,740
Oh? And should you really 
be taking such an attitude?

251
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,180
What?

252
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,110
As a matter of fact,

253
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,180
we just got a letter from Honoka-chin 
that her grandma sent over.

254
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,360
You should've told me!

255
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,220
What does it say?

256
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,870
She said she had fun playing with you,

257
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,160
and that she'll come back next year.

258
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,930
She's coming back next year!

259
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,400
And she included a photo.

260
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,050
Somen, somen...

261
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,280
I wanna write her a letter, too!

262
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,960
What about lunch?

263
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,830
That can wait!

264
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,850
Uh, I think the postcards 
are in the bedroom...

265
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,520
An envelope looks better 
than a postcard!

266
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,440
And I'll send her a drawing 
in return for the photo!

267
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,730
I need crayons!

268
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,070
Right...

269
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:19,380
That's all for today

270
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,030
Mocchoroke... dancing!

271
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,970
<i>They don't have these in the city?</i>

272
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,650
<i>I got lots for you!</i>

273
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,380
<i>There are tomatoes in the miso soup!</i>

274
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,280
<i>So we're at the beach...</i>

275
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,440
Episode 5

276
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,440
I Pretended I Forgot My Swimsuit

277
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,980
Non Non Biyori
