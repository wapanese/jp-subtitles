00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,190
<i>Today's our class outing!</i>

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,130
Nee-chan, I came to help.
What do you want me to do?

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,350
Just make rice balls.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,260
You don't need to come
up with any weird ideas.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,610
All right, leave this to me.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,560
Looks yummy.

7
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,110
Thanks.

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,420
<i>My sister is a year older than me.</i>

9
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,240
<i>But she's short and clumsy,
so she can't get by without me.</i>

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,980
I told you, don't come up with weird ideas!

11
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,630
All right! Russian rice balls!

12
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,460
Huh?

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,140
We put mustard in just one of them.

14
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,720
If you get lucky, you lose!

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,990
You're contradicting yourself now...

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,930
It's such a nice day.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,840
Perfect weather for a class outing!

18
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,460
Episode 3

19
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,460
I Ran Away from Home with My Sister

20
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,930
Natsumi-senpai, what's that backpack for?

21
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,230
What're you talking about?
Our class outing is today.

22
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,980
What? I didn't know about that.

23
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,630
I only heard about it from Natsumi yesterday.

24
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,140
You and Nee-chan really ought
to listen to the teacher more.

25
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,470
And so, time for a fun, fun class outing!

26
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,610
Let the rice planting festival begin!

27
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,420
Today, you're going to help 
plant rice in these fields.

28
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,590
Of course, these are actually
my family's rice fields...

29
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,820
Oh, it's not that we don't have
money to hire part-time help,

30
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,480
or that I just don't want to help my family.

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,530
That's not why I'm making my students work.

32
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,040
It's a class assignment to learn the value
of rice and have fun planting seeds.

33
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, uh...

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,780
Oh, are you upset that you weren't given
sufficient details about this trip beforehand?

35
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,900
Well, I meant to bring it
up yesterday, but I forgot.

36
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,650
I did tell Natsumi, though...

37
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,140
But when I told Ren-chon about this outing,

38
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,020
she was all excited and laughing!

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,990
Yeah. I'm laughing, all right.

40
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,680
Yeah!

41
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,460
Now, let the fun rice planting begin!

42
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,480
I forgot that she always makes us
help plant rice this time of year.

43
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,500
We have no choice.

44
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,450
Let's just get it over with,
eat our lunches, and go home.

45
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,910
I didn't bring a lunch...

46
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,020
Oh, if you don't mind rice balls,

47
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,080
I'll share the ones I made this morning.

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,770
Rice balls made by Senpai...

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,320
I'll work hard!

50
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,030
Hi-yah!

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,840
There.

52
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,760
And step, and step...

53
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,290
Ren-chon, stop!

54
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,510
You're stepping on the 
seedling you just planted.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,710
Oopsie.

56
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,410
You walk backwards, 
planting the seedlings as you go.

57
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,340
Wow. The wisdom of the forefathers.

58
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,690
Don't call me a forefather.

59
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,700
Hi-yah!

60
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,910
Hi-yah!

61
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,370
What is this?

62
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,800
I wanted to go to a theme park!

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,970
I wanted to go to a zoo!

64
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,200
I wanted to go to an aquarium!

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,810
I at least wanted to ride the town's single-car
train with the manually operated doors!

66
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,780
I feel a little better.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,030
But I still don't feel like planting rice.

68
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,480
You were there, Nii-chan?

69
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,880
The scarecrow's done!

70
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,580
I thought this would be funnier somehow.

71
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,650
Hey, Natsumi!

72
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,850
What? I'm not gonna plant rice.

73
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,660
I'm stuck in the mud and can't move.

74
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,310
What? What? What is this?

75
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,740
You actually got stuck?

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,410
How did you manage to get in that deep?

77
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,100
I wanna see an encore! Encore!

78
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,100
Stop laughing and help me!

79
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,060
I guess I'll have to.

80
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,810
You always get into these
messes when I'm not around.

81
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,990
You're stuck, too, aren't you?

82
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,770
I think I'm really in deep now...

83
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,570
Hotarun! Hotarun, help!

84
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,070
Rice balls... Rice balls... Senpai's rice balls...

85
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,890
She's been like that since I told her
I'd share my rice balls with her...

86
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,010
Does she like rice balls that much?!

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,540
We have no choice!

88
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,540
Use me as a stepping stone and save yourself!

89
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,440
But what will you do?

90
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,700
Trust me! I have strong legs!

91
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,540
Okay, hold on tight.

92
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,460
I'm never planting rice again.

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,790
You weren't in the first place.

94
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,110
Where's the teacher who
made us do this, anyway?

95
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,720
Yeah, machines beat manual labor any day!

96
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,960
Since I bought this,

97
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,140
I wanted to find out which was more efficient,

98
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,730
but the machine is way better!

99
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,750
Oh, you guys can go home.

100
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,750
Let's just eat lunch and go.

101
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,050
Um, can I have some, too?

102
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,210
Of course. I did promise.

103
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,540
Here.

104
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,720
It's delicious!

105
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,780
You really like rice balls, huh, Hotarun?

106
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,290
That's hot!

107
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,390
Blew up in your face, huh?

108
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,070
Finally got all the mud off.

109
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,790
No fair getting in the bath first, Nee-chan.

110
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,810
Shut up. I'm older, so it's my right.

111
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,910
What're you watching?

112
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,920
A lighthearted, emotional romance
movie from the rental store.

113
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,250
Tomorrow's the return date,
so I have to watch them all today.

114
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,430
Yeah, returning them is tough.

115
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,000
It's ten stations away.

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,260
If it's emotional, that must mean the hero or heroine dies of an illness.

117
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,170
Wasn't expecting a virus to
kill every single character...

118
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,190
I'm not sure how to feel now.

119
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,920
That's weird. It had good reviews.

120
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,180
I'm going to bed. Today wiped me out.

121
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,380
I'll go to bed after I watch all the rest.

122
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,110
You sure are uptight, Nee-chan.

123
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,860
Urban Legends

124
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,860
100 Scary Videos

125
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,700
You rented stuff like that, too?

126
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,160
I forgot.

127
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,580
But it's okay.

128
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,700
I couldn't handle this stuff when I was little...

129
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,100
Okay, goodnight.

130
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,560
...but I'm fourteen now.

131
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,830
Natsumi-chan's Room

132
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,650
Wh-What? Why are you in my room?

133
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,790
Your room is next door.

134
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,760
Y-Yeah, well...

135
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,930
The bugs sounded too loud from my room.

136
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,650
I know that. Your room's right next to mine.

137
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,000
Fine, I'll sleep in your room, then.

138
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,340
No, no, no.

139
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,340
You watched that horror video earlier.

140
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,780
Are you scared?

141
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,940
O-Of course I'm not scared!

142
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,510
I'm fourteen now, you know!

143
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,450
Ahh! There's something white behind you!

144
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,050
Kidding. It was just the screen door.

145
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,220
You really are scared!

146
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,200
You tried to talk big, 
but you really are scared!

147
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,380
Did that scawy old ghosty
 movie fwighten you?

148
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,470
Don't worry. Natsumi-chan ish here wif you.

149
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,940
Ow! The zipper on the pillow
cover hit me between the eyes!

150
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,450
My eyes! My eyes!

151
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,450
Settle down and go to sleep!

152
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,950
And set it to evening!

153
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,040
Evening?

154
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,020
The little light!

155
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh...

156
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,570
But I can't sleep if it's not dark...

157
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,560
Oh, yeah.

158
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,400
I think I had an eye mask in this
treasure chest-slash-garbage bin.

159
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,900
Nee-chan, if you're scared of 
the dark, you want a light?

160
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,370
I'm not scared, but bring it here anyway.

161
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,360
If you're scared,

162
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,080
I also have that Shokichi-san
doll you used to like.

163
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,100
I told you, I'm not scared!

164
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,330
Bring me Shokichi-san, though.

165
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,510
Just a sec...

166
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,080
Okay! Sorry for the... wait!

167
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,140
What's wrong, Nee-chan?

168
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,490
I just brought the lamp you asked for.

169
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,960
You really are scared, aren't you?

170
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,570
Shut up, stupid! Of course I'm not!

171
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,900
Fine, fine, but look.

172
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,870
Your bear's not in great shape.

173
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,770
Shokichi-san!

174
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,330
Why is my Shokichi-san in your room, anyway?!

175
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,670
I told you, he was in my
treasure chest-slash-garbage bin.

176
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,710
Don't just turn him into garbage!

177
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,500
Come to think of it,

178
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I've been hearing a voice coming
from that drawer at night...

179
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,450
Saying stuff like "It's dark" and "Let me out."

180
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,390
It must be the curse of Shokichi-san.

181
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,060
Here you go. It's Shokichi-san.

182
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,490
What?! I can't get out of the futon!

183
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,500
It's dark!

184
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,010
You're so funny, Nee-chan.

185
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,980
Why are you being so condescending?!

186
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,880
No more. No more ghosts... 
No more ghosts...

187
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,510
Don't wanna see any more...
Don't wanna hear any more...

188
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,420
There's no such thing as spirits 
and the other world.

189
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,170
There's nothing to be scared of.

190
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:04,260
No such thing as ghosts...
No such thing as ghosts...

191
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,260
Wait... If spirits and the
other world don't exist...

192
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,230
What happens after you die?

193
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,460
Hey, Nee-chan, if we don't have spirits,

194
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,550
does everything just go dark when we die?

195
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,410
No such thing as ghosts...

196
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,850
Just sleep.

197
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,030
Nee-chan! Wake up!

198
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,540
What? Natsumi's late?

199
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,150
She apparently had trouble getting to sleep.

200
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,570
So she's not a very reliable big sister,

201
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,180
but she can really be a good sport.

202
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,240
Like...

203
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,830
I'm telling you!

204
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,450
I didn't break it! It was a stray cat!

205
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,060
You gave me the same excuse when you broke that window before!

206
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,560
I mean it this time!

207
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,220
Nee-chan was playing catch with me!

208
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,530
She saw it, too!

209
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,500
Right? You saw it, right?

210
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,470
Uh...

211
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,830
Is that true?

212
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,370
W-Well...

213
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
Komari!

214
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,140
N-Nâ€”

215
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,480
You're trying to say "No," aren't you?

216
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,560
No!

217
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,750
No to what, Nee-chan?

218
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,430
Oh, yeah! The cat had chikuwa in its mouth!

219
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,460
Chikuwa?

220
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,570
I did leave some out so I
could use them for dinner,

221
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,790
but how do I know you didn't eat them?

222
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,660
Why can't you trust your own kid?!

223
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,920
Because your behavior is always so poor!

224
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,990
Just the other day,

225
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,260
you drew graffiti on the post 
and blamed your brother!

226
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,530
But this time I...

227
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,900
And when you scored a zero on 
a test, you hid it in the attic.

228
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,540
Well, it's not like I lied...

229
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,090
And you never clean your room.

230
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,040
You leave things lying around.

231
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,180
That has nothing to do with this.

232
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,450
The point is, you need listen to what I tell you and behave properly!

233
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,190
What are you saying?

234
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,250
You're the one who's not listening to me!

235
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,400
I've had it!

236
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,150
Come on, Nee-chan!

237
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,190
Hold it right there!

238
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,650
Are you stupid?!

239
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,190
How dare you say that to your mother?!

240
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,950
We're running away!

241
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,220
I'm not staying in this house!

242
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,480
Stupid Natsumi! I didn't want to run away!

243
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,540
Well, she made me mad.

244
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,950
It really wasn't our fault this time.

245
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,550
What do we do now?

246
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,560
Let's go to our old secret hideout for now.

247
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,950
Our secret hideout? You mean this one?

248
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,830
Yep.

249
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,890
Hurry up!

250
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,270
Hang on...

251
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,220
Ah, I'm gonna fall!

252
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,950
If we go through this tunnel...

253
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,840
I don't wanna go in there.

254
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,970
It looks just like it used to.

255
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,730
We'll live here.

256
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,810
Are you serious?

257
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,810
There's not even water or electricity here.

258
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,310
Well, let's just take it easy for now.

259
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,550
My skirt will get dirty if I sit here...

260
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,060
Don't worry about a thing.
I can support one sister.

261
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,520
If it comes down to it, I'll pick
wild plants or hunt boars.

262
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,030
Why are you talking like a parent?

263
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,380
I'm bored. Wanna play shiritori?

264
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,020
Shiritori? Can't you think of 
anything more fun to do?

265
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,480
Ringo <i>(apple)</i>.

266
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,140
You complain, but you play anyway.

267
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,810
Gorira <i>(gorilla)</i>.

268
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,270
Raion <i>(lion)</i>...

269
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,030
Wait, one more try...

270
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,750
Rakko <i>(sea otter)</i>!

271
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,720
Koishi<i> (pebble)</i>.

272
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
Shi... shi...

273
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Shinkansen <i>(bullet train)</i>!

274
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,810
I didn't think you'd be so bad at shiritori.

275
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,530
So what if I am?

276
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,040
I'm starving.

277
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,340
Don't you have anything to eat, Nee-chan?

278
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,420
Weren't you going to be
the one to support me?

279
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,780
Oh, I bought this on the way home yesterday.

280
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,340
Way to go, Nee-chan!
Let's split it half and half!

281
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,140
Oh, fine...

282
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,960
That's good!

283
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,860
Huh?

284
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,400
Stupid stupid stupid! Mom is stupid!

285
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,460
Oh, I remember!

286
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,290
You wrote this when you were little.

287
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,410
You ran away here after an
argument with Mom then, too.

288
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,750
You even dragged me with you.

289
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,610
That actually happened?

290
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,180
Then you said you were hungry
and pulled up that grass to eat,

291
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,750
and it made you feel sick.

292
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,750
I remember that!

293
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,730
Wait... What happened after that, though?

294
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,930
<i>Hang in there, Natsumi. We're almost home.</i>

295
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,780
<i>Natsumi!</i>

296
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,510
<i>Mom!</i>

297
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,160
<i>Mommy...</i>

298
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,600
Natsumi! Natsumi!

299
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,820
Look!

300
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,630
Hey! What good is chasing it gonna do?

301
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,160
I'm gonna catch it and take it to Mom!

302
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,830
Wait up!

303
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,320
You're not going to follow them?

304
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm getting kinda cold.

305
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,330
Guess we should go home.

306
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,760
Yeah.

307
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,460
Is Mom here?

308
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,340
I don't know. Just sneak in quietly.

309
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,130
You two.

310
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,240
Where did you wander off to?!

311
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,130
Well, you know...

312
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,050
We thought, even if we were running
away, we shouldn't break curfew...

313
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,020
Who cares about curfew?!

314
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,060
I've been looking for you everywhere!

315
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,980
W-Wait!

316
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,930
Stop! Stop!

317
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,110
It's so good! It smells like watermelon!

318
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,710
Mom, what's with all the sweetfish?

319
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,010
The neighbors shared them with us.

320
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,620
Hey, don't eat so fast.

321
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,090
Good thing that cat only took
the chikuwa and not this!

322
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,470
That's right! We found the cat!

323
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,220
Also, Nee-chan is really bad at shiritori!

324
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,940
Natsumi, don't point at
people with your chopsticks.

325
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,000
Will you drop it? So what if I'm bad at it?!

326
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,000
And Komari, don't talk with your mouth full.

327
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,860
What's your problem?

328
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,000
Leave me alone!

329
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,490
I'm coming in.

330
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,970
Why do you want to sleep with me?

331
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,180
Just because.

332
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,710
Nee-chan, do you have enough blanket?

333
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,360
This is kind of creepy...

334
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,420
Do you feel bad for dragging me
along when you ran away?

335
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,130
Well, I've got a lot on my mind, too.

336
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,610
I'm sort of regretting it, I guess.

337
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,310
You don't have to worry about that.

338
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,700
You couldn't get by without me, you know.

339
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,200
What?

340
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,370
That's all for today

341
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,030
<i>Five!</i>

342
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,440
<i>So many fives!</i>

343
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,520
<i>Crab!</i>

344
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,470
<i>Camera!</i>

345
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,260
<i>That "bullet train" thing.</i>

346
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,760
<i>Renge-chan, can you play again tomorrow?</i>

347
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,750
<i>Yes.</i>

348
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,470
<i>Really? Okay, see you tomorrow!</i>

349
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,510
