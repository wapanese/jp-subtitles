1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,110
<i>It's been a year now since I moved here.</i>

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,400
Please walk quietly in the hallway

3
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,610
Sorry I'm late!

4
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,620
Senpai!

5
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,950
Did you finish already?

6
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,700
Yes. I cleaned the pen and fed them.

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,930
Thanks.

8
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,570
No problem.

9
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,410
Well, ready to go?

10
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,460
Yes!

11
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>Today, Senpai and I are 
going on a picnic together.</i>

12
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,480
Episode 12

13
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,480
Spring Came Again

14
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,060
I made lots of food for lunch.

15
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,870
Since you suggested we 
exchange homemade bentos,

16
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,400
I put some effort into it.

17
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,090
Uh... Actually, about the bento...

18
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,270
Is something wrong?

19
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,290
Well, I kinda messed up.

20
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,680
I did bring one,

21
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,780
but it's not one that I can exchange...

22
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,100
Really, it's all right.

23
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,670
A few of the things in 
mine are burnt, too.

24
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,620
Really?

25
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,750
This is how it turned out...

26
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,550
I did my best with it, but...

27
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,700
I'll eat this myself.

28
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,530
Uh...

29
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,610
<i>I don't want to see that 
look on Senpai's face!</i>

31
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,050
I-It's no problem at all.

32
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,820
Let's exchange bentos.

33
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,870
What?! You don't have to do that for me!

34
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,950
It's totally black!

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,240
It's not the color that matters.

36
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,520
I love black foods like 
black beans and nori.

37
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,530
Let's see... Can I start 
with this squid ink pasta?

38
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,860
Uh, that's yakisoba...

39
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh, I'll try the yakisoba, then.

40
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,350
R-Really, you can just try a tiny bit...

41
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,480
Okay, then, just a little.

42
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,710
<i>I meant to get a little, 
but it all came at once!</i>

43
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,160
Ah, sorry! It stuck together?!

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,040
No, it's okay.

45
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,810
I like crispy yakisoba.

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,730
Uh, that's regular yakisoba...

47
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,690
Oh, I'll try the regular yakisoba, then.

48
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,850
Are you okay?

49
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,800
You seem to have stopped moving...

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,530
Huh? I stopped moving?

51
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm fine! It's delicious!

52
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,370
It just tastes a tiny bit like ink.

53
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,340
Huh? Ink?

54
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,750
Squid ink!

55
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,780
It tastes like squid ink! It's very good!

56
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,600
Even though I only put regular sauce in it?

57
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,880
Huh... I've never had squid ink before.

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,450
So it tastes like yakisoba sauce.

59
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,490
Uh, well...

60
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,130
It might not be exactly like that...

61
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,550
B-But it is delicious.

62
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,500
That was very good.

63
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,610
Are you sure it was okay?

64
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,730
I thought it was pretty burnt...

65
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,710
That just made it more savory! Yeah...

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,740
Then, try this Salisbury steak, too!

67
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,220
This one gets my recommendation!

68
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,910
Huh? There's more?

69
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,410
Uh, I mean, okay! 
The Salisbury steak, right?

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,790
I saw it on TV.

71
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,390
It has chocolate sauce on it.

72
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,330
<i>All I can taste is chocolate! 
All I can taste is chocolate!</i>

73
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,100
Um, Hotaru? Is it...?

74
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,600
It's delicious!

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,620
Really? You liked it?

76
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,370
O-Of course!

77
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,240
I was just craving some chocolate!

78
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,240
Really? I'm so glad!

79
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,970
<i>Ah! I'm so glad Senpai's happy!</i>

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
<i>I feel a little guilty, though...</i>

81
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,210
Okay, how about these rice balls next?

82
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,830
R-Rice balls?

83
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,150
Um, is there chocolate in them?

84
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,230
Of course not! 
Chocolate doesn't go with rice balls!

85
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,100
They're just regular rice 
balls with a little salt.

86
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,460
O-Okay, I'll try one!

87
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,230
Oh, it's good!

88
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,540
Isn't it?

89
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,170
I've messed up at cooking rice before,

90
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,940
but I've never messed up 
at making rice balls!

91
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,280
What's inside them?

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,610
Well, dried plums, bonito flakes, 
salmon, things like that.

93
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,880
There's one with mustard leaf 
that my mom pickled, too.

94
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,270
<i>Oh, good. These are normal.</i>

95
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,120
Oh, and I thought we could 
play a little game.

96
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,620
There's one "Russian rice ball" 
with wasabi in it, so we can—

97
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,390
What? Did you get the wasabi one already?!

98
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,060
Tea... Have some tea!

99
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm sorry, I should 
have told you sooner!

100
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,060
It's okay...

101
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,740
Oh, that's the noodle broth!

102
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,070
I actually brought some somen, too...

103
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,510
This one's the tea!

104
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,050
Uh, are you okay, Hotaru?

105
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,110
Really, you don't have to force yourself.

106
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,350
The rice balls and somen 
turned out meaningless...

107
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,160
I'll just put my bento away.

108
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,530
<i>Senpai feels bad!</i>

109
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,860
I-I-It's all right!

110
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,930
I love your cooking, Senpai!

111
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,330
Is it okay if I eat it all?

112
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,540
Huh? It's okay with me...

113
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,220
You really ate it all...

114
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,530
It's 
delicious!

115
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,530
Orenamin Z Drink

116
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,100
Are you saying it was delicious?

117
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,860
Really?!

118
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,640
I wasn't too confident, but if you 
liked it, I'm glad I made it!

119
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,490
<i>Good. Senpai's happy, too.</i>

120
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,570
<i>And I ate the whole bento. Now I can relax.</i>

121
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,250
Actually...

122
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,220
I made an original dessert, too!

123
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,120
I didn't have pancake mix,

124
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,980
so I made pancakes 
from okonomiyaki mix.

125
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,610
Think you can eat more?

126
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,300
<i>Pancakes are a filling dessert as it is!</i>

127
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,330
<i>There's no way I can eat pancakes 
made from okonomiyaki mix!</i>

128
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,940
<i>I feel bad for Senpai, but I'll have to refuse!</i>

129
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,240
Senpai, I'm happy that you took 
the time to make these—

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,480
Here, say "Ah!"

131
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,310
Yay! I'll have some!

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,670
The secret to the flavor 
is sodium bicarbonate!

133
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,980
Yay!

134
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,210
What is that?

135
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,430
Hotaru, did you get your gloves?

136
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,370
I put them in Dad's bag.

137
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,170
Road Repair Information

138
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,820
Hey, Hotarun.

139
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,150
Oh, Sensei!

140
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,700
Good morning!

141
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,710
Morning.

142
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,820
Good morning.

143
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,950
Good morning.

144
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,350
Good morning.

145
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,800
Sensei, I heard everyone is 
repairing the road today.

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,330
Yeah. Simply put, 
we're cleaning up this area.

147
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,470
We check for irrigation ditches that 
got dirty from the winter snowmelt,

148
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,300
and trim any branches that have 
grown out into the roadway.

149
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,710
I think there'll be a more 
detailed explanation later.

150
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,090
Okay, got it.

151
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,810
This work takes a lot of strength,

152
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,710
so the kids can just play around here.

153
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,870
The others are here, so go on and find them.

154
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,520
Okay!

155
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,850
I'm going.

156
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,970
Be careful.

157
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,600
I will.

158
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,500
Oh, here she comes.

159
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,660
Morning!

160
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,460
Good morning!

161
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,250
Hotarun, meowning!

162
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,710
Meowning.

163
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,420
What are you all doing?

164
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,470
We were thinking of picking 
some edible plants.

165
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,830
We were waiting for you.

166
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,780
Oh, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

167
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,920
It's okay, it's okay.

168
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,380
There's a lot of stuff 
around that mountain path.

169
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,830
Let's pick some as we walk.

170
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,600
Okay!

171
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,690
This is my first time picking edible plants.

172
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,740
What kind will we find?

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,130
What's wrong?

174
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,360
Um...

175
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,280
Private Property Beyond This Point 
No Trespassing

176
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,040
It says this is private property.

177
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,300
Won't we get in trouble?

178
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,610
Oh, it's fine.

179
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,250
It's okay, Hotarun.

180
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,810
My family owns all the 
land on this mountain.

181
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,310
Huh? This mountain? Huh?!

182
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,440
What?! You mean all of this?!

183
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,550
I'm not really sure myself.

184
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,150
I just know we own all the 
mountain land around here.

185
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,890
Is your family really rich, Ren-chan?

186
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,380
We're normal. We just own a mountain.

187
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,540
It's not that unusual to own a mountain.

188
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,550
My grandpa owns a small mountain, too.

189
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,770
Hotarun, didn't your family 
own a mountain in Tokyo?

190
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,170
We couldn't even see any mountains
where we lived, let alone own one.

191
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,610
There wasn't even any dirt 
or sand, except in the park.

192
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,600
No sand or mountains?

193
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,660
I guess this place really is 
a lot different from Tokyo.

194
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey! We found some edible plants!

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,950
Aw, they beat us!

196
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,630
Nattsun, what did you get?

197
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,880
Tara sprouts!

198
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,370
Okay, let's look for some, too.

199
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,040
Okay.

200
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,500
Let's look!

201
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,880
Hotaru, look! I found some fiddleheads!

202
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,930
Oh! I think I've seen 
that in pictures before!

203
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,880
Okay, I'll find some, too!

204
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,270
Senpai, what's this plant called?

205
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,010
Um...

206
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,210
That's just a weed.

207
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,150
I don't know which ones are edible.

208
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,250
Come over here, then.
There are lots of fiddleheads.

209
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,550
Okay!

210
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,890
Nii-chan, did you find something?

211
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,290
Huh, there's less around 
here than I thought.

212
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,300
Maybe it's too early in the season...

213
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,140
Hey, there's some creeping 
wood sorrel right by your feet.

214
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,820
It tastes like sorrel if you chew it.

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,180
Sour, right?

216
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,290
Okay, I'm gonna go look somewhere else.

217
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,290
Pick, pick, pick... Pick, pick, pick...

218
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,760
I got lots of mugwort.

219
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,670
It's good in tempura, 
and you can put it in mochi.

220
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,590
Mugwort bread and mugwort 
tea are good, too.

221
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,840
I can't decide what to do with it.

222
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,780
Mugwort is such a sinful plant.

223
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm gonna pick more mugwort.

224
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,600
What's wrong, Ren-chon?

225
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,340
That's just going too far!

226
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,580
Nobody does that in this century!

227
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,680
Hey! Find anything?

228
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,220
What's wrong, Ren-chan?

229
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,280
Hotarun, this really is the country, isn't it?

230
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,920
The city doesn't have mountains 
or sand or even edible plants,

231
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,930
but there's lots here.

232
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,940
This place is different from 
the city in lots of ways.

233
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,340
It has mountains, sand, 
and even edible plants.

234
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,110
That's why I love it here.

235
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,080
Then it's okay if there are people 
chewing on grass, too, right?

236
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:19,950
Huh?

237
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,500
I-I think that's fine.

238
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,820
I don't really get it,

239
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,560
but why don't we pick 
some plants together?

240
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,550
Okay!

241
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,560
It's beautiful!

242
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,690
You can eat these flowers in 
tempura or boiled with soy sauce.

243
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,390
They're actually pretty good.

244
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,650
You can eat these flowers?

245
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,830
What are they called?

246
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,170
Renge.

247
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,920
Why did you use my real 
name all of a sudden?

248
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,710
What happened between you and 
me in these last few moments?

249
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,650
What are you talking about?

250
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,180
These flowers are called renge.

251
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,770
They look even cuter, 
knowing they have my name.

252
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,450
I like these flowers now.

253
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,620
All right, let's pick lots of them.

254
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,320
But knowing they have my name,

255
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,380
I don't want to eat them anymore.

256
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,630
What?

257
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,060
Oh... I know.

258
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,010
Nattsun, what did you make?

259
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,490
I made a renge crown.

260
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,580
A flower crown!

261
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,530
Why do you know how to 
make something so girly?!

262
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,030
Well, I'm a girl, after all.

263
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,000
Nattsun, a girl? What does that mean?

264
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,930
What's the answer?

265
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,130
It's not a riddle or anything...

266
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,940
There!

267
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,290
Now you look like a fairy with wings!

268
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,610
Oh! I'm a fairy?

269
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,980
Yeah.

270
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,310
You look fancy now, Ren-chon. It looks good.

271
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,120
What's "fancy"?

272
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,890
I think it means you look cute.

273
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,630
What?! I look cute?!

274
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,960
Yeah, I think it's really cute.

275
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,570
Can I go show Candy Store and Nee-nee?

276
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,800
Okay, let's head back, then.

277
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,470
Va-voom!

278
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,450
Candy Store! Nee-nee!

279
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,130
Welcome back.

280
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,770
What's that you've got on you?

281
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,650
Nattsun made it for me!

282
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,560
I look f... f...

283
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,890
Funky!

284
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,960
Funky?

285
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,630
Y-Yeah, I guess you 
could call it funky...

286
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,820
It's funky!

287
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,560
Let's play something 
together after we eat.

288
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,970
Oh, and after we play for a while,

289
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,620
we could go to the candy store.

290
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,330
I wanna play fairies!

291
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,760
Koma-chan, you can be a fairy with me!

292
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,830
Nah, I'd rather play a human than a fairy.

293
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,910
Okay, fine.

294
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,900
Nattsun and I will be the fairies, then.

295
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,810
What? I don't think I can be a fairy, either...

296
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,950
Hold your hands out like this, lean forward,

297
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,780
say "Va-voom," and start running!

298
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,550
Va-voom!

299
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,220
You're really into this, Nattsun!

300
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,720
Hey, I know. When the cherry trees 
bloom, let's go flower viewing.

301
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh, that sounds great!

302
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,230
And this time, I'll make a proper bento!

303
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,190
Huh?!

304
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,930
Look forward to it!

305
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,170
Uh, I'll make a bento for you, Senpai!

306
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,200
In fact, let me make 
bentos for both of us!

307
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,820
Oh? Are you sure?
