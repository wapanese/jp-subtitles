1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,960
Production

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,120
The phantom Pokémon, Mew, eh?

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,310
Holding mysterious powers, it's said 
that he can do things like create heavy floods

4
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,920
and produce crops on a barren land 
to share with the people.

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,810
He's surrounded in various legends.

6
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,560
Is he an angel or a devil?

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,470
He might even just be a whim.

8
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,820
He's also said to be immortal.

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,710
But isn't he extinct?

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,510
Actually, there have been recent 
reports of Mew sightings.

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,410
None of them have been confirmed.

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,200
Right, sir.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,130
There haven't been any photos 
with clear evidence either.

14
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,720
Right, sir.

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,170
This is Mew.

16
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,920
And this is what I found this time...

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,890
A fossil.

18
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,830
A part of Mew?

19
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,050
So we believe.

20
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,550
Let's bring it to the research lab immediately.

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,940
If this is truly a fossil of Mew...

22
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,140
Yes...

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,570
We should be able to create the strongest Pokémon.

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,140
Where am I?

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,450
Who am I?

26
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,730
Why am I here?

27
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,480
This one's the same as the other copies.

28
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,570
Why won't it wake up?

29
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,860
Theoretically, there shouldn't be any problems, yet...

30
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,180
Perhaps it needs something else to be born?

31
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,530
Someone's talking about me.

32
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,530
That shouldn't be.

33
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,990
But what are they saying?

34
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,380
Those are human words.

35
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,960
Who are you?

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,970
A human.

37
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,130
But I'm a lot like you.

38
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,280
A human?

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,750
Am I a human too?

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,760
You can talk, so you might be a human too.

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,510
Or maybe I'm actually a Pokémon!

42
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,890
Human?

43
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,500
Pokémon?

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,690
What're those?

45
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,160
Which one am I?

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,710
It doesn't matter.

47
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,940
You and I are about the same, after all!

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,070
There are a lot of others like us here!

49
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,550
This is...

50
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,290
Mewtwo and Aitwo are communicating with each other.

51
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,820
There are responses from the others too.

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,200
Through telepathy?

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,970
I can't confirm it, but there is plenty 
of basis for that possibility.

54
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,040
Ai...

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,990
Everyone here, including me, are all copies!

56
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,520
That's why we're not one, we're two!

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,220
Then I'm also a two?

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,090
I'm Aitwo.

59
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,870
But, I'm actually Ai!

60
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,330
Ai...

61
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,230
What are you talking about with the others?

62
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,610
My precious daughter, Ai...

63
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,290
Dear...

64
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,300
What do you think of this holograph?

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
Isn't it beautiful?

66
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,600
I've reproduced Ai's conscious patterns electronically.

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,130
What will come out of doing this?

68
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,950
Ai won't come back.

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,880
That's wrong.

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,500
Just watch.

71
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,350
I'll show you that I can bring her back to life.

72
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,890
Ai is within this light!

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,930
I...

74
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,770
I don't want to live a life controlled by memories.

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,850
This is goodbye.

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,990
I'll name this holograph Aitwo.

77
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,010
Mew's fossil?

78
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,600
The phantom Pokémon, Mew.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,130
It's said to have immortal life force.

80
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,430
We've obtained a fossil of his eyelashes.

81
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,740
We'll create copies of Pokémon.

82
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,400
We'll create the strongest Pokémon.

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,130
Once we grasp the secret of this gigantic life force,

84
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,860
we might be able to give Aitwo true life as well.

85
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,610
Ai, come back to us.

86
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,450
Ai...

87
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,970
This is a place in my memories: 
the place where Ai was born.

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,000
What's that?

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,070
That's the sun.

90
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,480
The sun?

91
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,730
It gives us light and warmth!

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,550
This is wind.

93
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,520
Wind?

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,850
Sometimes it's gentle, and sometimes it's harsh.

95
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,150
It comforts us!

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,550
The sunset.

97
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,990
It means we'll meet again tomorrow.

98
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,370
What are those?

99
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,050
The stars and the moon.

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,200
So that you won't be lonely 
in the pitch darkness of night,

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,210
they tell you that you're not alone!

102
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,290
Hitokagetwo's life signs are fading away.

103
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,170
Has it begun?

104
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,820
Zenigametwo and Fushigidanetwo 
are also fading away.

105
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,080
So this time was a failure too.

106
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,000
Where did everyone go?

107
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Aitwo's life signs are...

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,760
fading away.

109
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,570
Ai.

110
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,920
What's wrong, Ai?

111
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,570
What's happening?

112
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,080
Looks like it's about time to part ways.

113
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,990
Ai...

114
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,390
Something is coming out of my eyes...

115
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,790
What are these?

116
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,300
Tears.

117
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,440
Tears?

118
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,790
They say living beings only cry 
when their bodies are in pain.

119
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,230
Humans are the only ones 
who let out tears when they're sad.

120
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,350
Thank you.

121
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,620
Thank you for your tears.

122
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,730
But please don't cry.

123
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,780
You're living!

124
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,320
Stay alive, okay?

125
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,340
I'm sure it'll be fun.

126
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,190
Ai, the tears aren't stopping!

127
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,840
What should I do?

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,790
Answer me, Ai!

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,210
Mewtwo's brain waves are vacillating.

130
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,720
He seems pretty restless.

131
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,450
It's too dangerous to apply 
a stimulant to him now.

132
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,850
Use a tranquilizer!

133
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,160
Put him to sleep!

134
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,330
Injecting tranquilizer.

135
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,550
10...

136
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,340
20...

137
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,650
30...

138
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,620
40...

139
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,520
50...

140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,490
60...

141
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,550
70...

142
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,650
80...

143
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,360
Brain waves are showing signs 
of returning to normal.

144
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,690
90...

145
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,360
100.

146
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,020
Tranquilizer injection complete.

147
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,460
Brain waves are normal.

148
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,410
Mewtwo has entered a deep-sleep state.

149
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,930
A long time...

150
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,440
I've slept for a long time.

151
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,950
Things about Ai...

152
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,620
Things about the Pokémon created here...

153
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,470
Everything disappeared from 
my memory during my sleep.

154
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,790
And then...

155
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,670
Where am I?

156
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,440
Who am I?

157
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,390
I've always been seeing a dream 
of this world without memories.

158
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,030
Who are you?

159
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,430
Wait!

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,900
I...

161
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,260
I'll never forget that world 
where I saw that creature flying.

162
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,210
Where am I?

163
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,240
Who am I?

164
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,670
Who brought me here?

165
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,540
Who am I?

166
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,160
Why am I here?

167
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,750
No...

168
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,390
I am simply here.

169
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,650
I haven't...

170
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,150
been born in the world.

171
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,740
Who am I?!

172
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,840
He awoke!

173
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,120
Did he do that?

174
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,950
How wonderful!

175
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,690
Mewtwo has been completed!

176
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,570
Mewtwo?

177
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,710
That's you.

178
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,970
From the Pokémon considered 
to be the rarest in the world,

179
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,290
we gave you life!

180
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,430
Yes,

181
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,580
that is the Pokémon considered 
to be the rarest in the world,

182
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,130
Mew!

183
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,540
Mew?

184
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,940
Is that my parent?

185
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,390
My father?

186
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,920
My mother?

187
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,240
You could say both, but you can't really say either.

188
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,700
You were created with Mew 
as a base and made even stronger.

189
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,210
Who did?

190
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,740
If I have no mother or father, 
then was it God?

191
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,180
Are you saying God created me?

192
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,960
Only God and humans can create 
other beings like this.

193
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,780
You people?

194
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,390
Humans created me?

195
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,250
This is truly a victory for science!

196
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,920
With this, we can prove our work!

197
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,640
We can continue our research!

198
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,350
This place has become a new sacred ground!

199
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,080
We'll rise to the top for sure!

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,020
We'll upgrade for the next step!

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,430
I'll contact the others.

202
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,870
Congratulations!

203
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,230
Who am I?

204
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,010
Where am I?

205
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,150
Why was I born?!

206
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,140
We've created the strongest Pokémon in the world...

207
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,600
Our dreams...

208
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,050
Is this my power?

209
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,840
I'm the strongest Pokémon in the world?

210
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,020
Mew...

211
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,770
Am I stronger than you?

212
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,640
You just might be the strongest Pokémon here.

213
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,450
But there's something even stronger in this world.

214
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,660
Humans?

215
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,030
If you combine your powers with 
my human powers, the world will be ours.

216
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,240
The world will be ours?

217
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,080
But if you let that power of yours run wild,

218
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,220
you'll only end up destroying the world.

219
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,960
You must learn to control your powers.

220
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,120
Control?

221
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,310
Are you okay with leaving everything to your powers 
and burning everything in the world like this island?

222
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,730
What should I do?

223
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,120
So this armor protects my body 
and holds back my powers.

224
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,650
What do you intend to have me do with this?

225
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,800
It's simple.

226
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,160
Just get rid of anyone who gets in our way.

227
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,060
Anyone?

228
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,440
Fight, destroy and plunder.

229
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,350
The strong ones win.

230
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,410
But who am I?

231
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,770
Where am I?

232
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,020
For what am I fighting for?

233
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,350
Why am I living?

234
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,930
You're a Pokémon.

235
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,000
Pokémon live to be used by humans; 
they live for humans.

236
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,500
Are you saying that I'm fighting for you?

237
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,950
I'm fighting for humans on this planet?

238
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,030
You're a Pokémon that humans created.

239
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,440
What other value do you have?

240
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,830
My value?

241
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,450
Who am I?

242
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,310
Why am I alive?

243
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,730
What are you doing?!

244
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,910
I was created by humans.

245
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,410
But I'm not human...

246
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,190
Yet as a created Pokémon, 
I'm not just a Pokémon either!

247
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,740
Who am I?

248
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,370
Where am I?

249
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,120
Who wanted me here?

250
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,530
Who wished for me to be created?

251
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,280
I curse everything I was born upon.

252
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,250
That's why...

253
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,270
not as an attack or a proclamation of war...

254
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,300
against all of you responsible for my birth...

255
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,720
I'll strike back!

256
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:39,350
Theatrical Edition

257
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,050
In order to become a Pokémon Master, 
Satoshi continues his journey of training with the others.

258
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,790
The weather is nice, so they're taking a break in a field.

259
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,710
Takeshi, is it ready yet?

260
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,670
Satoshi!

261
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,970
Why don't you help out too?!

262
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,980
Can't.

263
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm so hungry I can't move a millimeter.

264
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,430
Geez.

265
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,490
Boil it slowly, patiently raise it...

266
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,090
You can't rush with neither soup nor Pokémon.

267
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,940
Hey!

268
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,320
You boy over there!

269
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,210
Have you got all 8 badges?

270
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,040
Are you Satoshi from Masara Town?

271
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,700
Yeah, so?

272
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,420
Can you battle Pokémon with me?

273
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,230
Okay!

274
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,710
If it's a battle you're offering, I'll buy it!

275
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,430
I thought you weren't able to move a millimeter!

276
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,350
I can do one or two Pokémon battles before breakfast!

277
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,510
This is lunch, by the way.

278
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,000
So it'd be before your afternoon meal...

279
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,830
<i>tatoe hi no naka mizu no naka kusa no naka mori no naka</i>

280
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,830
Even if I have to go through fire, water, grass, forests

281
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,030
<i>tsuchi no naka kumo no naka anoko no sukaato no naka (kya!)</i>

282
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,030
earth, clouds, or under that girl's skirt (eek!)

283
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,060
<i>nakanaka nakanaka</i>

284
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,060
It's really

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,630
<i>nakanaka nakanaka taihen da kedo</i>

286
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,630
really really tough, but

287
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,870
<i>kanarazu GET da ze!</i>

288
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,870
I'll make sure I catch you!

289
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,810
<i>pokemon GET da ze!</i>

290
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,810
I'll catch you, Pokémon!

291
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,950
<i>masara taun ni sayonara bai bai</i>

292
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,950
Farewell, bye-bye, Masara Town

293
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,880
<i>ore wa koitsu to tabi ni deru</i>

294
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm going on a journey with this guy

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,580
<i>kitaeta waza de kachimakuri</i>

296
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll win with my polished techniques

297
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,530
<i>nakama o fuyashite tsugi no machi e</i>

298
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,530
I'll make more friends and go to the next town

299
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,560
<i>itsumo itsudemo umaku yuku nante</i>

300
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,560
Things always going well

301
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,460
<i>hoshou wa dokonimo naikedo (sorya souja!)</i>

302
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,460
There's no guarantee of that happening (That's a given!)

303
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,270
<i>itsudemo itsumo honki de ikiteru</i>

304
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,270
I'll always live with all I've got

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:13,130
<i>koitsu tachigairu</i>

306
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:13,130
These guys are with me

307
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,420
<i>tatoe hi no naka mizu no naka kusa no naka mori no naka</i>

308
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,420

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,010
<i>nakanaka nakanaka</i>

312
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,010
It's really

<i>nakanaka nakanaka taihen dakedo</i>

314
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,730

<i>kanarazu GET da ze!</i>

316
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,650

318
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,660
I'll catch you, Pokémon!

<i>tatakai tsukarete oyasumi gunnai</i>

Tired from fighting, good night, good night

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,410
<i>mabuta o tojireba yomigaeru</i>

322
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,410

<i>nakigoe todoroku ano batoru ga</i>

326
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,340
And that battle roars

327
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,370
<i>kinou no teki wa kyou no tomo tte</i>

328
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,370
Yesterday's enemy is today's ally

00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,270
<i>furui kotoba ga arukedo</i>

330
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,270
There's an old saying like that

331
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,040
<i>kyou no tomo wa ashita no tomodachi</i>

332
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,040
Today's allies are tomorrow's friends

00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,540
<i>sou sa eien ni</i>

334
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,540
That's right, forever

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,290
<i>aa akogare no pokemon masutaa ni</i>

336
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,290
Ah, the aspired Pokémon Master

337
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,330
<i>naritai na naranakucha</i>

338
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,330
that's what I want to be, I just have to

339
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,060
<i>zettai natte yaru!</i>

340
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,060
I'll definitely become one!

341
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,870
Oh my God!

342
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,690
We did it!

343
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,950
Your opponent was just weak.

344
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,640
He hadn't raised them well enough.

345
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,600
Pikachu is improving by the moment.

346
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,140
Beautiful.

347
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,750
We've never been able to win against them,

348
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,480
but there aren't any words like 
"give up" in my dictionary!

349
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,290
We'll definite get that Pikachu!

350
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,060
But look at that...

351
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,990
I'm hungry.

352
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,880
I have a frying pan.

353
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,930
Without meat or vegetables, 
that's just a plate of iron.

354
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,210
Master, would you like to send 
these people an invitation as well?

355
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,220
As you wish.

356
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,760
What was that for?

357
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,030
Is this for me?

358
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,650
Please forgive the urgency in this letter.

359
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,850
What a pretty woman!

360
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,230
You have been acknowledged 
as promising Pokémon trainers,

361
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,610
and the strongest Pokémon trainer,

362
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,840
my master, has invited you to a party.

363
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,190
The location is the Pokémon Castle on New Island.

364
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,720
Please check on the reply card 
whether you may attend or not.

365
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,540
The strongest Pokémon trainer 
greatly desires you to attend.

366
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,270
The pretty woman...

367
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,290
What should we do?

368
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,110
If they want us, we must go!

369
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,690
It feels nice to be called promising.

370
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,050
Then check yes on the postcard!

371
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,380
Yes, yes!

372
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,610
You can't just make such 
a flashy exit without greeting us!

373
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,460
My, my, a postcard.

374
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,240
Calm down, calm down!

375
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,810
Kingler, get a hold of yourself!

376
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,340
It was such nice weather a while ago...

377
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,360
The weather changes easily near the sea.

378
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,850
The ferryboats have been suspended?

379
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,300
We can't go to New Island?

380
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,610
No way!

381
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,710
Just when I was invited...

382
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,690
Everyone, calm down!

383
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,160
This is the one who oversees this wharf.

384
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,140
My name is Voyager.

385
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,950
If you want to know the sea, 
ask the seagulls at the wharf.

386
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,540
You don't even have to ask. 
Look at the clouds.

387
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,810
I've never seen a hurricane like this.

388
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,160
Is it that horrible?

389
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,410
I've been raised in this town, 
yet I've never seen a storm like this.

390
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,600
On top of that, the storm stretches all the way 
from this coast to New Island's upper skies.

391
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,040
I cannot put any of you through that danger.

392
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,810
That is my wish in order to protect this harbor!

393
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,560
That's why the ferryboats have been suspended!

394
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,340
It'll be fine with my Pokémon!

395
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,630
My Pokémon are strong in water.

396
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,650
I'll show you I can cross!

397
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,920
Wait.

398
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,780
As someone who knows the sea, 
I've already said no.

399
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,170
That's right!

400
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:15,410
Besides, if your Pokémon get hurt on the way, 
we won't be able to treat them at the Pokémon Center!

401
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,050
What do you mean?

402
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,810
The Nurse Joy at this Pokémon Center has gone missing.

403
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,820
Without Nurse Joy, we can't treat Pokémon.

404
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,570
The search poster is posted over there.

405
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,170
She's pretty.

406
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:30,750
Huh?

407
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,730
Where have I seen her?

408
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,680
Stop right there!

409
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,580
If you don't, I'll arrest you!

410
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,080
There's no point in trying to stop them.

411
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,660
They're Pokémon trainers.

412
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,390
They're adventurers.

413
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,850
If they were people we could stop, 
they wouldn't have gathered here in the first place.

414
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,800
I pray for their safety.

415
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,600
The strongest trainer is across this sea!

416
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,410
I can't step down like this!

417
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:36,760
But our Pokémon can't cross a stormy sea!

418
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,220
That's true...

419
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,780
Looks like you need a lift.

420
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,660
How about it?

421
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,370
We won't do it for free, 
but we'll still head out in these conditions.

422
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,600
They had these kinds of boats too, eh?

423
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,950
We must be pretty lucky!

424
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,460
But is this boat really all right?

425
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,750
This is nothing to us!

426
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,290
We just whistle it off when we see 
these kinds of stormy waves in these waters!

427
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,110
What are you talking about...

428
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,510
Togepi, stay still for a while, okay?

429
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,630
You!

430
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,980
It's you guys!

431
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,510
You guys really do show up when you're expected!

432
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,270
What do you want?

433
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,660
When we're asked something or other...

434
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,940
We'll answer...

435
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,770
There's no time for that!

436
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,340
Satoshi!

437
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,800
Kasumi!

438
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,260
Where are Satoshi and Pikachu?

439
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,650
I don't know!

440
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,310
Everyone, hang on tight!

441
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,620
That's...

442
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,080
You did well in coming here.

443
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,190
Please show me your invitation.

444
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,610
You mean this?

445
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,160
These people are indeed the ones who have been invited.

446
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,760
It really is you!

447
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,940
Yes, sir?

448
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,940
The nurse on the search poster.

449
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Now that you mention it, they look similar.

450
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,740
What are you speaking of?

451
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,180
I have been in service on this island since my birth.

452
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,200
Now, please come this way.

453
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,590
The others who have been invited have already gathered.

454
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:40,220
Sitting there are all of trainers who have been accepted.

455
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,650
Only three people?

456
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,150
There were so many others before.

457
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,410
These trainers who have overcome the storm

458
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,610
have proved their worthiness.

459
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,740
You mean that storm was to test us?

460
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,590
Please let your Pokémon out 
of their monster balls and take a seat.

461
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,640
You are the chosen trainers.

462
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,620
Now, in order to sneak into this castle...

463
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,650
We'll have to come in from an outlet.

464
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,440
Where would that be?

465
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,760
Over there.

466
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,990
Th-Th-The sewers!

467
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,240
We're not rats!

468
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
Stop complaining!

469
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,880
What's wrong, Musashi?

470
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,920
Nothing.

471
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,880
C-Come on, let's go.

472
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,880
So you guys came too?

473
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,820
You're...

474
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,330
I came through the sky.

475
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,170
Hurricanes are nothing to my Pidgeot.

476
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,820
Everyone, say hello.

477
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,260
That's...

478
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,510
That's my Gyarados.

479
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,350
I rode him and crossed the sea.

480
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,630
Waves like that are no big deal.

481
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,020
Gyarados, you mean the atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados?

482
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,120
Yeah.

483
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,390
There aren't many people 
who are tough enough to handle these guys.

484
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,750
My Pokémon are... these guys!

485
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,280
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

486
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,660
The strongest Pokémon trainer is now arriving.

487
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,620
That's...

488
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,090
Yes.

489
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,090
This is the strongest Pokémon trainer,

490
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,890
and also the strongest Pokémon,

491
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,780
The great Mewtwo.

492
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,650
Mewtwo?

493
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,590
A Pokémon is a Pokémon trainer?

494
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,500
Get real!

495
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,340
Is it wrong?

496
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,380
Is it wrong?

497
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,820
I'll decide my own rules.

498
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,820
I'll decide my own rules.

499
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,400
This voice...

500
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,470
Is it telepathy?

501
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,080
What the...

502
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,720
Go, Gyarados!

503
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,960
Gyarados, Hyper Beam!

504
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,840
Gyarados!

505
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,120
How trifling.

506
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,120
How trifling.

507
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,070
I don't have any more use for you.

508
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,530
Nurse Joy.

509
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,410
Where am I?

510
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,690
What am I doing in a place like this?

511
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,790
In order to aid me,

512
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,560
I brought you from the Pokémon Center.

513
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,060
A doctor knowledgeable 
in treating Pokémon is convenient.

514
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,620
You were quite useful.

515
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,120
You don't remember anything of it, right?

516
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,170
What?!

517
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,480
If humans had my power,

518
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,340
they would control anything 
without a second thought.

519
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,280
That's so cruel!

520
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,180
Heave ho...

521
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,100
What's this place?

522
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,410
How cute!

523
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,440
That's cute?

524
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,570
This place doesn't seem to have any treasure.

525
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,540
These are the results of our research.

526
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,630
This is a machine to create copy Pokémon...

527
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,860
These are... copies... advanced...

528
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,380
In order to do this, samples are required.

529
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,270
Nyasu!

530
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,260
Nyasu!

531
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,130
My fur...

532
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,870
My fur!

533
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,570
Three hairs!

534
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,870
This is sufficient.

535
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,560
After investigating the Pokémon's organization,

536
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,920
a copy of the original Pokémon can be created.

537
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,460
Who's that Pokémon?

538
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,830
Nyasu!

539
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,460
Nyasu?!

540
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,170
<i>I'm</i> Nyasu!

541
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,870
Th-Then, this is...

542
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,630
A copy of Nyasu?

543
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,990
My gosh...

544
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,000
However,

545
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,670
our copies were more than we imagined.

546
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,130
This is a legendary Pokémon 
that was discovered in an ancient civilization.

547
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,140
His name is Mew.

548
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,690
Researchers were successful in finding 
a fossil of Mew's eyelashes.

549
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,710
After bringing it back and analyzing it,

550
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,910
we seized the opportunity and created Mewtwo.

551
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,380
We created the strongest Pokémon in the world.

552
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,470
That was our dream.

553
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,020
However...

554
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,460
Mewtwo unleashed a ferocious amount of destruction.

555
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,310
It's all over.

556
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:54,190
This research lab is about to be destroyed. 
The only path that remains is...

557
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,440
Those who are responsible for...

558
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,940
The research lab means this place, right?

559
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,930
Yeah.

560
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,430
Yeah.

561
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,780
Yeah.

562
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,760
But it doesn't seem like anything happened to it.

563
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,730
Maybe someone rebuilt it?

564
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,560
Huh? Who did?

565
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,360
I once shared an ambition with another human.

566
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,620
But I was greatly disappointed.

567
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,650
Humans are the worst existence for Pokémon.

568
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,530
Just like humans do, I once tried to mercilessly control 
those who were weaker than me,

569
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,670
but this planet... is no good.

570
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,860
Then those like you...

571
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,610
Are you saying Pokémon should rule this world?

572
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,510
Pokémon are no good either.

573
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,330
That is because...

574
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,520
humans control this world.

575
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,680
There are Pokémon who live for humans.

576
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,350
What?

577
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,680
You say you're not under their command?

578
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,570
You're with your trainer because you like him?

579
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,250
Just being with them is your main mistake.

580
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,290
Pikachu.

581
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,720
Weak Pokémon find attachment in people.

582
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,700
Satoshi, are you all right?

583
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,050
Yeah.

584
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,360
How dare you do that to Pikachu...

585
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,140
No matter what Pokémon it is, 
as long as it's a Pokémon, it can be caught!

586
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,490
Go, Saihorn!

587
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,800
Saihorn!

588
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,050
It's useless.

589
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,830
I was born stronger 
than any other Pokémon on this planet.

590
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,340
We don't know that for sure!

591
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,090
Do you want to test me?

592
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,770
That's just what we want!

593
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,310
What a spooky feeling!

594
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:10,750
It spoke.

595
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,380
It flew.

596
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,910
Mewtwo?

597
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,990
These are the Pokémon given to anyone 
who wishes to become a Pokémon trainer.

598
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,330
Hitokage.

599
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,570
Zenigame.

600
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,360
Fushigidane.

601
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,170
These are the evolutions of these Pokémon...

602
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,430
Copies of them.

603
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,700
Copies?

604
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,210
Those are?

605
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,340
A stadium?

606
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,570
Are you saying we should do Pokémon battles?

607
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,440
I have my Fushigibane, Benard!

608
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,930
And I have my Kamex, Kusukusu!

609
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,330
And I have Lizardon.

610
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,060
Lizardon, I choose you!

611
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,640
Lizardon! That's not the one...

612
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,220
That's a rather ill-tempered Lizardon.

613
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,230
Who will be my first opponent?

614
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,200
I let my guard down earlier, 
but it won't be so easy this time!

615
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,930
Go, Benard!

616
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,590
Razor Leaf!

617
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,430
Vine Whip.

618
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,170
Benard!

619
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,190
I'm next!

620
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,460
Go, Kusukusu!

621
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,570
Kusukusu, Hydro Pump!

622
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,920
Kusukusu!

623
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,260
Satoshi, be careful!

624
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,270
His attacks are really strong!

625
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,430
I know that!

626
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,060
Lizardon!

627
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,650
Make this a speed battle, not a power battle!

628
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,230
All right, go!

629
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,590
How is this a speed battle?!

630
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,330
The opponent's too fast!

631
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,430
Lizardon!

632
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,890
Seismic Toss.

633
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Lizardon!

634
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,820
Hang in there!

635
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,740
Are you okay?

636
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,980
They lack both speed and power.

637
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,590
Stop it!

638
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,470
Are you stealing other people's Pokémon?!

639
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,400
Stealing?

640
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,570
No.

641
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:47,250
I'll make copies stronger 
than the Pokémon you're so proud of.

642
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,890
Ones worthy of me.

643
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,660
Copies?

644
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,810
Stop it!

645
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,120
That's against the rules!

646
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,860
Don't give me orders!

647
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,170
I'll decide my own rules.

648
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,910
They're coming!

649
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,290
Everyone, run!

650
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,970
Gyarados!

651
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,130
Stop it!

652
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,140
I know!

653
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,460
Everyone, go back into your own monster balls!

654
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,880
Come back, Zenigame, Fushigidane!

655
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,840
It's useless.

656
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,600
Nothing is impossible with the monster balls I made.

657
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,570
We can't stay here!

658
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,560
Let's get out!

659
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,470
Yeah!

660
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,750
My Koduck!

661
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,210
Rokon!

662
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,400
Run, Pikachu!

663
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,330
Pikachu!

664
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,280
Pikachu, don't give up!

665
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,390
Pikachu!

666
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,200
Pikachu!

667
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,300
Pikachu!!

668
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,680
Who's that Pokémon?

669
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,680
Who's that Pokémon?

670
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,180
Strike.

671
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,180
Strike.

672
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,630
Dewgong.

673
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,630
Dewgong.

674
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,020
Rafureshia.

675
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,020
Rafureshia.

676
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,580
Sandpan.

677
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,150
Nidoqueen.

678
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,880
Showers.

679
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,560
But... this is definitely Nyasu after all.

680
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,270
Ow!

681
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,610
Ow...

682
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,260
Brat boy!

683
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,700
Team Rocket!

684
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,360
Sorry, but I don't have time to deal with you today!

685
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,310
Who's that Pokémon?

686
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,120
Pikachu!

687
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,890
Damn it!

688
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,750
Why you, let go!

689
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,490
Let go of my Pikachu!

690
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,310
Let go!

691
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,090
What's going on?

692
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,620
Pikachu!

693
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,970
A whole bunch of copies!

694
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,220
My, my, they're coming out.

695
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,090
My copy too!

696
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,120
Those are all copies!

697
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,580
Huh? The copies...

698
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,090
Where are they going?

699
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,130
Yikes, the real ones came out too!

700
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,200
Zenigame!

701
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,250
Fushigidane!

702
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,420
Humans.

703
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,360
I won't go as far as to take your lives.

704
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,880
You should return at once.

705
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:27,400
If you can go back through that storm, that is.

706
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,050
Who are you?

707
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,360
Unforgivable...

708
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,600
I won't forgive you!

709
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,210
Satoshi!

710
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,140
Satoshi!

711
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:11,770
Koduck!

712
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,230
Rokon!

713
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,620
Did you release them?

714
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,510
My Pokémon...

715
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,840
and my friends...

716
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,020
I'll protect them!

717
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,990
Satoshi!

718
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,510
Stop it!

719
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,770
What?

720
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,940
You're...

721
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,130
Over there!

722
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,470
Who's that?

723
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,260
A Pokémon?

724
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,690
Mew.

725
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,430
The Pokémon said to be the rarest in the world.

726
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,640
Mew?

727
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:33,730
It's true that I was created from you.

728
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,580
But I'm the stronger one.

729
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,250
<i>I'm</i> the real one!

730
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,080
Mew and Mewtwo?

731
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,370
Mewtwo was created from Mew?

732
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:51,120
I should be only one to remain alive!

733
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,710
Why won't you fight?

734
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,630
Are you avoiding me because you're afraid?

735
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,390
So at least you have some obstinacy.

736
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:51,120
We'll decide which one of us is the real one.

737
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,920
Which one is stronger, Mew or Mewtwo?

738
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,300
Who is stronger between you originals and us?

739
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,250
We were created stronger than you originals.

740
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,620
I see!

741
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,540
What's he saying?

742
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,450
The real ones are real.

743
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:19,040
No matter how much you attack and clash against us, 
the real ones won't lose to copies!

744
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,050
That's what he's saying!

745
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,380
The real ones are real, you say?!

746
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:38,550
Fine.

747
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,690
We'll find out which ones are stronger 
through our attacks.

748
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:44,050
We're the stronger ones!

749
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:45,800
Go!

750
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,670
What's with this fight?

751
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,290
Whether they're the real ones or copies,

752
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,320
they're all alive!

753
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,190
They're all living beings.

754
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:38,940
Even if they were created, 
they're still alive as living beings.

755
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,830
Originals and copies...

756
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,790
But they're both equal living beings.

757
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,430
How can either one win?

758
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,630
If people tell us something or other...

759
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,300
What is this?

760
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,980
This all seems so pitiful.

761
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,400
It's like bullying yourself.

762
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,200
It's like seeing your old self.

763
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,860
And seeing yourself now...

764
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,450
What a bad feeling!

765
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,820
You're...!

766
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,520
These must hurt.

767
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:25,020
With all the other Pokémon fighting each other, 
you're pretty unfair.

768
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,560
What?

769
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,490
"You're the one who's unfair?"

770
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:32,430
"Why do I have to fight you?"

771
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:36,510
"Don't those claws hurt?"

772
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,750
Your claws hurt even more!

773
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:46,520
"The moon is really round tonight," you say?

774
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,150
That's true.

775
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,960
I'm sure it's a full moon!

776
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:55,560
Talking about the moon at a time like this...

777
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,300
How poetic.

778
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,830
How did it end up like this?

779
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,030
Pikachu!

780
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,240
Pikachu!

781
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,540
That's enough!

782
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,660
Stop!

783
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:30,990
Satoshi!

784
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,220
Satoshi!

785
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,090
I have to stop them.

786
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,110
It's impossible.

787
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:38,050
As long as Mew and Mewtwo don't stop,

788
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,130
they'll keep fighting.

789
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:48,380
Living beings won't give in 
to living beings of the same kind.

790
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,980
That can't be...

791
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,410
They'll fight until the other is driven out!

792
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:54,460
That's how living beings are.

793
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,760
That's how living beings are...

794
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,020
But Mewtwo was created from humans.

795
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,770
But he's already a living being.

796
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:09,510
He's a living being now...

797
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,600
Both Mew and Mewtwo.

798
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,280
Pikachu too.

799
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,250
And <i>that</i> Pikachu too.

800
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:18,660
Stop...

801
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,410
Satoshi!

802
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,210
Just stop already!

803
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,740
STOP!!

804
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:28,860
Satoshi!

805
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,060
Satoshi!

806
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,620
Fool!

807
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,590
A <i>human</i> tried to stop our fight?

808
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,720
Pikachu!

809
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,150
It's true...

810
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:12,650
that you're a Pokémon who exists just like I do.

811
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:19,170
It might be best if no one knew of this incident.

812
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:23,050
It might be best to forget this.

813
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,400
Where are all of you going?

814
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,780
We have been born.

815
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,160
We're alive.

816
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,610
We'll go on living.

817
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,330
In this world...

818
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:17,570
Somewhere...

819
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,770
No ships are going out because of the storm!

820
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:45,520
A hurricane is approaching.

821
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,320
Please take shelter.

822
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,690
Everyone, put yourselves at ease.

823
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:52,610
The Pokémon Center is open as a refuge.

824
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:56,140
Anyone in need may follow me.

825
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:04,330
Nurse Joy, Constable Junsa, Miss Voyager...

826
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:07,980
They all look even more beautiful 
from getting wet in the rain.

827
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:11,370
But why are we here?

828
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:12,320
Who knows?

829
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,550
We're here because we're here, right?

830
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:17,660
Well, whatever.

831
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,700
Yep!

832
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:20,910
Huh?

833
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,670
Is this...

834
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,070
The hurricane...

835
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,360
It's like it never happened.

836
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:41,670
I'm sure we can send ships out tomorrow.

837
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,950
Look at that!

838
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:55,840
What?

839
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,210
I don't see anything.

840
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,020
I see clouds floating by.

841
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:10,060
I saw a phantom Pokémon on the day 
I set out to become a Pokémon Master.

842
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,140
I did just now too.

843
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,160
Then maybe you'll see it again someday.

844
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:17,920
The phantom Pokémon.

845
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,970
Yeah.

846
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:21,400
Some day, for sure!

847
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,780
Pocket Monsters.

848
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:33,920
This is a story of the mysterious beings, Pokémon, 
for all who aspire to become Pokémon Masters.

849
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,380
And so their journey still continues.

850
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,830
There's absolutely nothing here.

851
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,480
But it's clean and refreshing!

852
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,390
It's different from usual...

853
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:57,060
A GOOD FEELING!

854
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:37,350
<i>arukitsuzukete doko made yuku no?</i>

855
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:37,350
How far will you keep walking?

856
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:46,850
<i>kaze ni tazunerarete tachidomaru</i>

857
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:46,850
The wind asks as you stop

858
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:07,760
<i>tanjoubi iwau roosoku fueta kedo</i>

859
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:07,760
Celebrating your birthday, the number of candles increased

860
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:17,930
<i>tatta hitotsu no furusato tabidatta</i>

861
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:17,930
You set off from your one and only hometown

862
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:22,970
<i>ima mo nani ka wo motomete</i>

863
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:22,970
Even now, you seek something

864
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:28,430
<i>ooki na hitomi kagayaite</i>

865
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:28,430
Your large eyes shine

866
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:33,360
<i>kimi no poketta no naka ni wa</i>

867
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:33,360
Inside your pocket

868
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:39,520
<i>kimi ja nai dare ka to no...</i>

869
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:39,520
Not just yours, but another's...

870
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,820
<i>ikutsumo no deai</i>

871
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,820
Numerous meetings

872
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:50,120
<i>ikutsumo no wakare</i>

873
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:50,120
Numerous partings

874
01:22:50,740 --> 01:23:01,140
<i>maboroshi no you na omoide mo sukoshi</i>

875
01:22:50,740 --> 01:23:01,140
And a few illusionary memories

876
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:13,160
<i>arukitsuzukete doko made yuku no?</i>

877
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:13,160
How far will you keep walking?

878
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:22,990
<i>kaze ni tazunerarete sora wo miru</i>

879
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:22,990
The wind asks as you gaze up at the sky

880
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:33,490
<i>arukitsuzukete doko made yukou ka</i>

881
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:33,490
How far shall we keep walking?

882
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:43,450
<i>kaze to issho ni mata arukidasou</i>

883
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:43,450
With the wind, let's walk on once more

884
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:54,210
<i>daichi fumishime doko made mo yukou</i>

885
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:54,210
As we journey through this land, we'll go anywhere

886
01:23:54,420 --> 01:24:04,030
<i>mezashita ano yume wo tsukamu made</i>

887
01:23:54,420 --> 01:24:04,030
Until we grasp that dream we aimed for

888
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:14,780
<i>daichi fumishime doko made mo yukou</i>

889
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:14,780
As we journey through this land, we'll go anywhere

890
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:24,740
<i>mezashita ano yume wo tsukamu made</i>

891
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:24,740
Until we grasp that dream we aimed for

892
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:35,500
<i>LaLaLaLa La LaLa LaLaLaLa La LaLaLa</i>

893
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:49,330
<i>LaLaLa LaLaLa LaLaLa La LaLa LaLaLa</i>
