1
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,700
I'm surprised, Ryuga.

2
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,370
I never thought that you'd suddenly ask me
to play some tennis to get to know each other.

3
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,610
Is it a problem?

4
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,420
Not at all.

5
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,790
But you asked me already knowing my abilities?

6
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,630
It's all right, Yagami.

7
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,090
I was once the British Junior Champion.

8
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,900
If I ask him if he's British,

9
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,810
would he think that I'm trying to find out
more about him because I'm Kira?

10
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,890
Fine. I'll give it a try.

11
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,690
Ryuga, were you raised in Britain?

12
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,360
I lived in Britain for five years,

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,270
but don't worry.

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,940
There's nothing there that can reveal L's identity.

15
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,950
Oh, is that so?

16
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,200
Then the first to win a set of six games wins the game, okay?

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,240
All right.

18
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,270
This is just a friendly game of tennis.

19
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,090
This isn't a test to determine if Light is Kira.

20
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,550
But Kira hates to lose.

21
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,770
Fifteen, love.

22
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,860
Hey, Ryuga, you're serious right off the bat!

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,110
The person who makes the first move wins.

24
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,910
What do you mean that you can't say?

25
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm very sorry.

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,370
Under L's orders, no one outside the task force can know.
Not even you, Deputy Director General.

27
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,790
Including what you're doing and where you're doing it, huh?

28
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm very sorry.

29
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,160
Yagami...

30
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,430
It's been more than four months since this case has come to light.

31
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,010
People are saying that the police and L are incompetent.

32
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,560
With all due respect, Sir,

33
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,160
but can you really call the police competent for turning tail from Kira?

34
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,530
You should see how many people are left at task force headquarters.

35
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,600
If you're worried about what people are saying,

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,070
then try not to let them know that the bulk of the detectives have run away from Kira!

37
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,380
Excuse me.

38
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,330
Yagami.

39
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,170
What about L?

40
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,000
Can he be trusted?

41
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,510
I think he's far more capable than we are.

42
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,680
He's putting his life on the line right now.

43
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,890
Are they really amateurs?

44
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,460
Who are they?

45
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,150
They're Yagami Light and Ryuga Hideki.

46
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,020
The two who entered this year with top scores.

47
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,880
Don't worry, Yagami.

48
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,740
Kira hates to lose,

49
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,950
but most people don't like to lose. It's not just Kira.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,340
Is getting worked up and going for the win something Kira would do?

51
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,360
Even so, if I lose on purpose,

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,240
he'll think that getting worked up and winning is like Kira,

53
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,710
so losing on purpose is also like Kira, right?

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,720
In the end, it's the same thing.

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,220
There's no way that he could profile me with this tennis game.

56
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,720
He has some other goal in mind.

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,220
But even if it's just tennis,

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,350
I will win!

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,070
See, you came in for the win.

60
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,070
Game count, four games all.

61
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,570
All of a sudden,

62
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,490
there's an umpire and a line judge.

63
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,160
Sir!

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,000
I thought I'd heard of Yagami Light somewhere, so I looked him up.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,040
It seems he was the Junior High Champion
in 2002 and 2003.

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,920
During the Junior High third-year commendation ceremony,

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,110
he announced that he'd only play in junior high.

68
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,780
He hasn't played in any tournaments since.

69
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,920
Hey, hey!

70
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,690
So what about Ryuga?
He's holding his own against the Junior High Champion!

71
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,310
I can read your feelings, Yagami Light.

72
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,480
There's no way that this kind of tennis
can deepen our friendship.

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,280
We're going through the motions
just so we can say we're better friends.

74
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,940
By playing tennis with you,

75
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,990
you will think that I am preparing to take a step closer to you.

76
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,970
And then you're gonna try to get me to say something

77
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,540
that only Kira would know.

78
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,990
But you'll tell me you'll need to know if you can trust me first.

79
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,010
And you'll try to get me to give you details on the Kira case.

80
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,050
If I want to talk about the Kira case,

81
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,850
I'm going to have to ask him for proof
that he's currently in charge of the Kira case.

82
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,900
So the first thing you're going to want out of me is...

83
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,400
...proof that you really are L, from a third party.

84
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,150
In other words,

85
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,910
we'll go to task force headquarters!

86
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:28,950
we'll go to task force headquarters!

87
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,990
we'll go to task force headquarters!

88
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,990
In life, one cannot win just by playing defense.

89
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,870
To win, you need to attack!

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,010
Game set.

91
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,370
Won by Yagami.

92
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,540
Six games to four!

93
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,800
Wow!

94
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,340
As I expected of you.

95
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,880
I lost.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,100
It's been a while since I've played seriously, Ryuga.

97
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,210
I'm thirsty.

98
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,280
And I have something I want to ask you,

99
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,230
so do you want to go get a drink afterwards?

100
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,120
I've lost the game,

101
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,520
so I'll tell you whatever I can.

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,110
But before that, I have something I must tell you.

103
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,280
What is it?

104
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,810
Yagami, I suspect that you're Kira.

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,370
If you still want to ask me, then ask away.

106
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm Kira?

107
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,130
Well, even though I say I suspect you, it's only a one-percent possibility.

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,600
Leaving that aside,

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,840
once I'm sure that you aren't Kira,

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,380
and because you have sharp reasoning abilities,

111
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,510
I'd like for you to work with me on this investigation.

112
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,150
One percent, huh?

113
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,000
That's well-worded.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,770
Even if he suspects me just a little,

115
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,670
it still means that it won't do any good
if I ask to meet someone from the task force.

116
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,650
Which means he beat me to the punch.

117
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,910
He got me.

118
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,920
This coffee shop is one of my favorites.

119
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,950
If we sit here, there's no chance of anyone overhearing us.

120
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,590
This is a nice spot you've shown me.

121
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,760
We don't have to worry about how we sit here either.

122
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,840
I have to sit like this.

123
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,890
If I sit normally,

124
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,690
my reasoning skills drop by forty percent.

125
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,180
So, what did you want to ask me?

126
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,690
Oh yeah.

127
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,430
That can wait until you're sure that I'm not Kira.

128
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,900
You can talk about whatever you want to.

129
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,890
Then excuse me,

130
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,160
but would you mind if I test your deductive skills?

131
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,210
Not at all.

132
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,660
That sounds fun.

133
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,200
Then first...

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,040
please take a look at this.

135
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,920
These three are pictures of notes that we believe were written

136
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,850
by criminals in prison right before they died,
while under Kira's control.

137
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,140
Please tell me what you think.

138
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,410
This is interesting.

139
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,770
Really, what a childish trick.

140
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,330
The print number is written on the back of these photographs.

141
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,440
If I paid no attention to this,

142
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,660
and correctly unscrambled the sentence the way Kira wrote it,
it'd be "L, do you know, Shinigami love apples."

143
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,050
There'd be a strong possibility that I'd be Kira.

144
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,470
But just because I solve this code

145
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,920
doesn't prove I'm Kira.

146
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,180
It would be amazing if Kira could not only inflict death on others,

147
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
but control his victims' actions as well.

148
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,850
And there's a message encoded here taunting you.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,980
When we rearrange the messages and take a look at the top letters of each line,

150
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,700
they form another sentence.

151
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,860
Rearranging it into a message which makes sense would probably be...

152
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,360
"L, do you know? Shinigami love apples."

153
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,160
But there are print numbers on the back.

154
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,580
When we arrange them in that order,

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,540
we get, "L, do you know? Love Apples, Shinigami."

156
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,530
It doesn't make sense

157
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,000
and it's hard to think that Kira
would have wanted you to read it this way.

158
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,050
Incorrect.

159
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,050
There are actually four photographs.

160
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,890
When we add this one, this is what it reads,

161
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,560
"L, do you know? Shinigami who love apples

162
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,890
have red hands."

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
It's a fake.

164
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,140
This fourth picture is not a message I made a criminal write.

165
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,900
Is he stupid?

166
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,950
But even with the three photographs, my deduction was perfect, wasn't it?

167
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,320
It wasn't perfect.

168
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,910
The truth is that there are four of them.

169
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,330
If you'd figured out there was another, then yeah.

170
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,760
Yagami, even though you knew the message wasn't finished,

171
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,880
you decided that there were only three notes. You didn't guess that there was a fourth.

172
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,460
This is also true.

173
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,510
Damn him...

174
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,390
I see. He isn't just gauging my deductive abilities.
He's trying to get me to reveal myself.

175
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,850
If I latch onto this, I'll play right into his hands.

176
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,240
Hmm... I hadn't thought that far ahead.

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,110
Well, whatever the case, it's not a message that would lead to Kira.

178
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,110
Shinigami don't exist.

179
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,690
Let's say that you're in my shoes,

180
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,680
faced with someone who might be Kira,

181
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,620
how would you check if he was Kira?

182
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,560
I would try to have him say something

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,900
that wasn't broadcast to the public, that only Kira would know.

184
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,420
What you were doing just now.

185
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,340
That's amazing.

186
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,340
I've asked several detectives that same question,

187
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,580
but most of them needed a few minutes to answer.

188
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,970
You, on the other hand,

189
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,810
immediately thought of a scenario in which Kira is talking to the investigator.

190
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,810
Your deductive abilities are amazing.

191
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,480
The more impressive my answers,

192
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,110
the more suspicious I become, it seems.

193
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,570
Yes. By about three percent.

194
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,390
But in that respect,

195
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,770
it's made me more determined to work with you.

196
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,090
Even if you are Kira,

197
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,520
I would like for us to work together on this investigation.

198
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,840
Do you know why?

199
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,130
If I cooperate with you, the investigation will move forward,

200
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,120
and if I really am Kira, I might reveal myself.

201
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,390
In other words, you're killing two birds with one stone.

202
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,270
I think it's a great idea.

203
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,700
But aren't you getting the wrong idea, Ryuga?

204
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,360
I <i>am</i> interested in the Kira case

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
and conduct detective work as a hobby.

206
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,030
But I am not Kira, and I don't want him to kill me.

207
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,450
First of all, I have no proof that you aren't Kira, either.

208
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,540
It would be strange for just one of us to be investigated, right?

209
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,950
Neither of us have proof that we aren't Kira.

210
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,380
But, Ryuga, if you <i>are</i> L,
o I'm sure you can show me proof of that.

211
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,780
Like having someone in the task force, or my father,

212
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,300
tell me that you are really L in person.

213
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,310
If you can't, I won't investigate with you.

214
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,940
You talk a lot, don't you, Yagami Light?

215
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,210
Typical for someone who hates to lose.

216
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,090
Seven percent...

217
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,080
Could he really be...?

218
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,780
I never said that I wouldn't let you meet anyone from task force headquarters.

219
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,250
I am currently working with your father.

220
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,470
If I take you to headquarters, you'll help with the investigation.

221
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,830
Am I right?

222
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,180
What is he thinking?

223
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,220
Excuse me.

224
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,640
Oh, me too.

225
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,930
Yes?

226
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,440
Ryuzaki, something terrible has happened.

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,610
Light, your father has...

228
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,730
Yagami!

229
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,900
My father had a heart attack!

230
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,430
Well, see you tomorrow.

231
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,870
I'll bring your things that you need.

232
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,090
Light, I leave the rest to you.

233
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,800
Okay.

234
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,970
You're sure it's just fatigue, right?

235
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,810
Yeah. When I collapsed,
I thought it was Kira, but I'm all right.

236
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,150
I've been pushing myself a bit hard lately.

237
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,020
Especially since your son has been suspected of being Kira.

238
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,000
You told that to my father?

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,650
Yes.

240
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,340
I told him everything.

241
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,370
Even the fact that I'm L.

242
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,330
That's right. He's L.

243
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,980
We call him Ryuzaki so others can't find out,

244
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,330
but there's no mistaking it. He's L.

245
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,600
He's the real L.

246
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,850
My father is telling me so.

247
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,050
Probably the same L who has been ordering the police until now.

248
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,200
If I get rid of him and the investigative team...

249
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,600
No, it's probably not that simple.

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,230
There's no need to rush.

251
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll have time to spy from here on.

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,030
At any rate, I have to be the Yagami Light
who is worried about his father.

253
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,200
So, Ryuzaki,

254
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,990
has talking with my son cleared away your suspicions?

255
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,700
I still suspect him, but only a little bit.

256
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,710
I'll explain once more.

257
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,710
Kira killed twelve FBI agents who were in Japan.

258
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,620
They were tracking those who were connected to the Japanese police.

259
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,400
One of them was Raye Penber.

260
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,180
There were many suspicious things surrounding his death.

261
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,140
And I was one of the people he was investigating.

262
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,690
It's no wonder I'm a suspect.

263
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,980
No, it's as Ryuga says.

264
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,580
There is no one else to suspect.

265
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,570
Your deductive ability is quite impressive.

266
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,570
It's always quick and accurate.

267
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,930
Ryuga, I'll cooperate with you on this investigation.

268
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,040
My father has vouched that you're L.

269
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,760
Also, I want to catch Kira and prove that I'm not him.

270
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,770
Light...

271
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,760
Soon, you're going to have to study to enter the police force.

272
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,260
It won't be too late to do this afterwards.

273
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,260
Dad, what are you talking about?

274
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,250
I don't know how many years that'll take.

275
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,020
I promised you, didn't I?

276
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,100
That if something happened to you,

277
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,610
I'd see to it that Kira gets executed.

278
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,860
There's no way that my son can be Kira.

279
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,680
It's hard to believe this is all an act.

280
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,370
No, if it's an act, it's too corny.

281
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,580
Light, listen to me.

282
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,010
Kira is evil.

283
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,980
That's the fact of the matter.

284
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,340
But recently, I've been thinking about it in this way:

285
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,970
the real evil is the power to kill people.

286
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,510
People who attain that kind of power are unlucky.

287
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,040
No matter how you use it,

288
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,810
nothing gained by killing people

289
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,350
can bring about true happiness.

290
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,270
It's as he says.

291
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,610
If Kira is an ordinary person who gained this power,

292
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,780
then he is a very unlucky person.

293
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,660
Ryuzaki,

294
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,900
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.
I'll try to recover quickly.

295
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,160
Excuse me...

296
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,960
Visiting hours are now over.

297
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:54,840
Ryuga.

298
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,560
Is there any way that I can get you
to believe that I'm not Kira?

299
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,730
If you aren't Kira,

300
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,060
then there isn't any need to do that.

301
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,790
Cut that out!

302
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,980
Think about how it feels to be accused of being Kira.

303
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,530
It feels horrible.

304
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:23,080
How about keeping watch over me
in a place without even TV for a month?

305
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,870
Would someone really go that far to clear their name?

306
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,270
That would be no good.

307
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,400
I can't do anything that would deprive you of basic human rights.

308
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,840
And furthermore, it's nonsensical
to take suggestions from the suspect.

309
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,880
I see.

310
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,930
It's all right.

311
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,350
We'll know in time if you aren't Kira.

312
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,940
Also, during that exchange with your father,

313
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,560
I thought that you might not be Kira.

314
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,610
Well then, take care of your father.

315
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,490
Oh, one more thing.

316
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,740
I said that I would cooperate with the investigation,

317
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,940
but I don't think I can do anything until my father is well again.

318
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,740
I understand.

319
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,200
Well then...

320
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,670
Ryuga Hideki...

321
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,890
Ryuzaki...

322
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,450
He's the L I've been fighting.

323
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,470
What is his real name?

324
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,960
Yagami Light,

325
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,750
are you not Kira?

326
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,910
Ryuk...

327
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,600
Hmm?

328
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,220
I never once felt unlucky

329
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,470
since I picked up this notebook and gained this power.

330
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,790
I'm wonderfully happy,

331
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,790
and I'll create a wonderful world.

332
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:49,340
I couldn't care less if finding the notebook's
made you happy or unlucky.

333
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,400
But...

334
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,130
It seems people who have Shinigami attached to them

335
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,970
experience nothing but misfortune.

336
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,240
Then I shall show you an exception to the rule.

337
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,540
I appreciate that.

338
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,310
What is it? Is this the only plan you can think of?!

339
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,730
You think that we'll get ratings
if we do any special program on Kira, don't you?

340
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,290
We've been getting ratings

341
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,160
because we cover stories that other stations don't!

342
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,930
Understand?

343
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,910
The problem is with the story.

344
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,750
Someone bring me a good story!

345
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,290
But the police are keeping quiet about this. It's hopeless.

346
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,000
Dumbass!

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,190
If we don't have any stories, just make something up!

348
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,220
Director Demegawa, a special delivery.

349
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,890
What is this?

350
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,120
Who is this from?

351
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,500
This is what I'm talking about.

352
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,610
This is what I want you to think of.

353
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,180
Wow, this is too good to be true.

354
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,900
"A message to the world from Kira."

355
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,660
"If you don't broadcast this, I'll kill you all, starting from your company's president."

356
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,910
Who wouldn't air this?

357
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,410
This is amazing if it's real.

358
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,050
I'm so happy, my heart's beating a mile a minute!

359
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,490
If I leave things the way they are,

360
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,000
L might be finished off within the next four days.

361
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,890
God really <i>is</i> on my side.

362
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,090
Only this time, it's not really God, but a Shinigamiâ€”
a God of Death.
