1
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,690
Ryuzaki, let me go.

2
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,110
Chief, I'll go too.

3
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,310
All right, but this is Kira.

4
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,670
Be careful when arresting him.
Don't let him see your face.

5
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,720
Watari,

6
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,580
if Higuchi makes even the slightest move...

7
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,090
Yes. I'll stop him without killing him.

8
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,640
Aizawa, do you have something to cover your face?

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,580
Yes.

10
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,140
Cover me.

11
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,980
Got it. Thank you very much, Chief!

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,820
Higuchi, put your hands up and get out of the car!

13
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,330
We've captured Higuchi!

14
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,880
Mr. Mogi, as planned, give Higuchi a headset.

15
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,510
Got it.

16
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,710
Higuchi,

17
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,200
how do you kill people?

18
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,220
Tell me!

19
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,520
I'll use whatever means necessary
to make you speak if you won't tell me.

20
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,650
The notebook.

21
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,530
Notebook?

22
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,010
You may not believe me,

23
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,910
but if I write the name of someone
whose face I know in that notebook, that person dies.

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,390
Notebook...

25
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,240
Mr. Yagami.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,520
Yeah,

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,270
there's one in Higuchi's bag.

28
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,170
He's written names in it,

29
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,670
but it looks like any other notebook.

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,050
What's wrong, Mr. Yagami?

31
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,330
I-It's a monster!

32
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,720
Calm down.

33
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,060
You don't have a gun on you right now.

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,680
O-Oh yeah...

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,810
Are you all right, Chief?

36
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,570
M-Mogi, can't you see that?!

37
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,480
Chief, you're probably tired.

38
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
What's wrong, Mr. Mogi?!

39
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,570
Oh... Uh... I-It seems...

40
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,450
only people who've touched this notebook can see it.

41
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,460
This monster!

42
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,710
Bring the notebook to the helicopter.

43
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay...

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,630
What in the world are you planning, Yagami Light?

45
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,640
When you take hold of the notebook once more,

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,440
all your memories
of when you had the Death Note will return.

47
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,560
But...

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Ryuzaki, this is it.

49
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,060
That's a Shinigami, isn't it?

50
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,410
They really <i>do</i> exist...

51
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,580
Yagami Light, a notebook...

52
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,600
Show each other our notebooks in Aoyama...

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,920
Love at first sight...

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,550
Ryuzaki, let me see it too!

55
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,420
The Second Kira!

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,720
Two books!

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,940
There are more than two Notebooks in existence!

58
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,970
This isn't finished yet.

59
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,890
A Shinigami?

60
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,060
Write the name in the Death Note.

61
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,530
...and L.

62
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,830
...the god of the new world.

63
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm L.

64
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,870
A-Are you all right?

65
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,300
Anyone would be surprised by that monster.

66
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,720
Ryuzaki.

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,010
What?

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm going to try and match the names written in here

69
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,470
with the names of the victims.

70
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,930
Huh? Yes...

71
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,230
W-Well, of course.

72
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,240
I've won!

73
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,620
<i>It's just as I planned.</i>

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,130
I relinquish ownership of this notebook.

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,080
Now the ownership of the notebook has returned to you, Rem.

76
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,030
Am I right?

77
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,010
That's right. You're persistent!

78
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,180
Now give that notebook to Ryuk.

79
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,330
What?

80
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,280
Fine.

81
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,570
Now ownership of that notebook belongs to Ryuk.

82
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,190
Ryuk, drop that notebook
on the ground of the Human World again.

83
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,150
Huh? Well, okay.

84
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,410
Now ownership of this notebook belongs to me again.

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,120
Hold on, it's just gone around.
Nothing's changed.

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,920
Yeah, that may be true.

87
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,420
But there will come a time when this will be useful.

88
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,210
This notebook I first received...

89
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,770
I'm now going to return it to you, Ryuk.

90
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,930
Give it back to Rem.

91
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,100
Here.

92
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,400
Rem, give that to a person who has some status, a strong lust for power,

93
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,110
and who'll probably use the notebook solely for his own personal gain.

94
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,060
Misa will be released from her confinement if you do that.

95
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,840
If she's not released after several years, kill me.

96
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
How does that sound?

97
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,090
Yagami Light, what are you thinking?

98
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,390
This is to save Misa.

99
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,090
Trust me.

100
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,680
All right. If Misa will be saved, I'll do as you ask.

101
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,560
Later I'll make sure I'll be confined like Misa

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,650
and put under 24-hour surveillance.
and put under 24-hour surveillance.

103
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,780
While in confinement,
I will relinquish ownership of the notebook,

104
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,990
and lose all memory of the Death Note.
and lose all memory of the Death Note.

105
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,990
During that time, the killings of criminals will begin again.

106
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,990
If that continues,

107
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,210
Ryuzaki will have to release both of us sooner or later.

108
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,570
Since I've lost all my memory,

109
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll probably try to catch Kira.

110
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,010
That's the kind of person I am.
That's the kind of person I am.

111
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,340
And you'll try to catch the guy that Rem gives the notebook to

112
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,310
and steal the notebook before L gets to him.

113
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,670
That's right.

114
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,170
And at that time, I'll kill the owner of the notebook.

115
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,310
But there is one problem...

116
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,130
If you don't have ownership of the notebook,

117
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,610
your memory will only return
while you're touching the notebook.

118
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,430
Once you let go of it, your memory will disappear.

119
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,160
I'll kill Higuchi without letting go of this notebook!

120
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,250
If I do that, ownership will transfer back to me

121
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,040
and my memory won't disappear!

122
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,180
I have to pull here four times in less than a second.

123
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,300
All right...

124
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,770
I was<i> wearing this watch.</i>

125
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,310
Habits sure don't change.

126
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,860
Mr. Yagami, take Higuchi to the car.

127
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,080
Y-Yeah, all right.

128
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,560
This notebook...

129
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,100
What do you suppose we'll find
if we have it scientifically analyzed?

130
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,200
That's not like you.

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,590
That thing is beyond science.

132
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,260
That's true...

133
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,120
This is the longest forty seconds of my life.

134
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,730
Higuchi?!

135
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,050
Ryuzaki, Higuchi is...!

136
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,260
What's this?! What's going on?!

137
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,890
Hey, Higuchi!

138
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,750
Wh-What are you doing, Dad?!

139
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,230
If Higuchi dies now...

140
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,810
I-Impossible!

141
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,150
No, he's already...

142
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,770
Yeah, he's dead.

143
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,240
Ryuzaki...

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,290
you're next.

145
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,970
How to use...

146
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,510
The human whose name is written in this note...

147
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,700
shall die.

148
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,610
This note will not take effect unless the writer
has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name.

149
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,420
Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.

150
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,330
If the cause of death is written
within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,

151
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,970
it will happen.

152
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,700
If the cause of death is not specified,
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

153
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,560
After writing the cause of death,

154
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,570
details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

155
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,410
Additionally, instructions are on the back cover.

156
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,860
If you make this note unusable by tearing it up or burning it,

157
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,600
all the humans who have touched the note till then will die.

158
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,250
What?!

159
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,340
I-Is that true, Aizawa?!

160
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,590
Yeah, that's what's written.

161
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,110
That's right. With a rule like that,
my dad and the others won't try to dispose of it

162
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,690
No way! Why didn't you tell me before?

163
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,440
How was I supposed to know?!
That's right. With a rule like that,
my dad and the others won't try to dispose of it

164
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
and I won't lose my memory of this.

165
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,350
Rem, there's no way that the old man
will get mad at us if we write a fake rule here, will he?

166
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,810
No. There are no such rules against doing so.

167
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,900
Fine then.

168
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,220
Light, you owe me apples.

169
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,570
Man, I shouldn't have touched it
just because I wanted to see the Shinigami.

170
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,000
Then you'd be the only one who wouldn't know
what was going on in the investigation.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,400
Would that be okay?

172
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,670
No, I want to work on the same terms as everyone else.

173
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,500
And...

174
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,840
this last sentence...

175
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,730
If the person using the note

176
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,430
fails to continuously write names of people to be killed

177
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,410
within 13 days of each other,

178
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,420
then the user...

179
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,860
will die.

180
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,090
What?

181
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,820
That means...

182
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,610
Light and Misa-Misa are completely cleared!

183
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,860
Yes, indeed...

184
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,930
Light and Amane were detained
for more than fifty days and are still under surveillance.

185
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,040
There's no way they'd still be alive if they're both Kira.

186
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Aren't you glad, Chief?!

187
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,070
Yeah.

188
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,540
Rem...

189
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,940
You, the white-colored Shinigami.

190
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,540
R-Ryuzaki! That's rude!
Referring to her by her skin color...

191
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,550
Yes, it is...

192
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,550
There are other notebooks in the Human World, aren't there?

193
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,730
Who knows?
There may be. There may not be.

194
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,590
If there were other notebooks,

195
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,230
are all their rules the same?

196
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,440
It's useless, Ryuzaki...

197
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,240
You can't break this rule with Rem.

198
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,680
Yeah, they're the same.

199
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,260
There are many notebooks in the Shinigami Realm,

200
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,400
but their rules are all the same.

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,120
Even the rules for when humans obtain them.

202
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,040
Ryuzaki...

203
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,180
Light and Amane are cleared.

204
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,920
Their surveillance is over.

205
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,800
That's right. It's already clear.

206
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,140
You're right...

207
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,800
I understand.

208
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,940
I'm very sorry about everything that's happened until now.

209
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,530
Thank goodness...

210
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,760
Yeah.

211
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,350
But we still can't say that we've solved the case.

212
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,090
I want these handcuffs removed,

213
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,710
but can I continue to investigate here?

214
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,960
Yes...

215
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,360
Misa and I are now completely cleared.

216
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,600
He has to believe the fake rule that was written by a Shinigami

217
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,430
in the notebook of death.

218
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,640
With these fake rules
that I conjured up, Ryuzaki's lost his edge.

219
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,230
Listen, Ryuzaki...

220
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,450
In any world, rules are always created by those who are gods.

221
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,180
You will be beaten by the rule I have created,

222
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,240
and for the crime of defying the god of the new world,

223
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,450
you'll pay with your life.

224
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,250
Light!

225
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,330
Text me every day.

226
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,900
We're finally saying good-bye to Misa-Misa...

227
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,670
Hey, Matsuda, leave those two alone!

228
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,550
See you later, Misa-Misa!

229
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,520
Come on!

230
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,060
The surveillance cameras can't see my mouth at this angle.

231
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,600
Misa, I'm going to tell you about a certain place.

232
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,440
I want you to dig up something from there when no one is watching.

233
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,780
Light, your memory has returned!

234
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,900
It's all right. I'll do a good job!

235
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,860
Light, I remember.

236
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,300
I remember everything that happened
when I had this notebook.

237
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,000
You buried this notebook so I could remember.

238
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,730
Misa,

239
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,460
by the time you read this letter,

240
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,650
you should have remembered everything.

241
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,780
A letter from Light!

242
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,180
Do you remember my friend at To-oh University

243
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,290
who went by the name Ryuga Hideki?

244
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,870
I want you to write his name in the notebook,

245
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,530
and kill him.

246
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,700
Also, burn this letter,

247
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,090
hide a few pages of the notebook with you,

248
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,170
and bury the notebook.

249
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,410
When you meet me again,

250
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,300
casually touch me with a piece of the notebook.

251
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,470
If you do this, Amane Misa, I will...

252
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,570
..."love you for the rest of my life."!
love you for the rest of my life.

253
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,730
All right!

254
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,160
I see. This is Light's plan!

255
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,230
He wanted me to get this notebook, regain my memory...

256
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,780
and kill Ryuga Hideki... Ryuzaki.
and kill Ryuga Hideki... Ryuzaki.

257
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,160
One of Light's obstacles
will disappear and I'll be helpful to him!

258
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,120
It's no good, Light.

259
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,380
I can't remember his name.

260
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,300
I saw hundreds of names and life spans every day.

261
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,030
I can't remember at all!

262
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm so stupid!

263
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,810
I'm finally able to come back!

264
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,150
Ryuk!

265
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,060
It's been a while! How are you?

266
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,750
Sorry, but...

267
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,360
Huh?

268
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,940
I'm male. You're making me shy.

269
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,700
Oh yeah...

270
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,390
Here.

271
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,580
Light told me to bring this.

272
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,570
Is it really that delicious?

273
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,760
Yeah.

274
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,670
Apples in the Human World are... what's the word, "juicy"?

275
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,010
At any rate, they're great.

276
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,380
Do you want to try it?

277
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,860
It's an apple from the Shinigami Realm.

278
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,050
It doesn't look very good.

279
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,850
Come on, just one bite.

280
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,610
Oh yeah, Ryuk...

281
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,190
Do the eye deal with me.

282
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,700
Sand!

283
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,330
A deal, huh?

284
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,530
You understand, don't you?

285
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,710
You've made a deal with Rem once before.

286
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,680
Do you really want to halve your life a second time?

287
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,840
Hmm... Well, I have to do this.

288
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,490
I've forgotten the name I had to remember.

289
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,730
Light will be angry with me if I don't take a look at it again.

290
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,160
Well, it's fine with me.

291
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,700
Oh, it's Misa-Misa.

292
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,790
The poor thing. We can't turn on our cell phones here,

293
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,000
so she has to come and visit you.

294
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,810
Light, go to her quickly.

295
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,450
You shouldn't make a woman wait.

296
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,350
Yeah.

297
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,800
Ryuk!

298
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,510
Why is he attached to Misa?

299
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,270
Misa's life has been halved once more!

300
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,270
It can't be... Did she do the eye deal with Ryuk?!

301
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,650
Light...

302
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,310
It's been a while, Ryuk.

303
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,980
L-Light, I'm sorry.
I don't remember Ryuga Hideki's real name.

304
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,880
I just can't remember.

305
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,690
I see.

306
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,760
That's too bad.

307
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,970
B-But I did the eye deal with Ryuk!

308
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,300
Everything is going as planned, huh?

309
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,930
Idiot! Your lifespan has been...

310
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,680
No, it's all right.

311
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,770
I want to help you.

312
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,240
Misa, right now, I want to live with you
for a long time in an ideal world.

313
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,780
That's how I feel.

314
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,530
Light, I'm so happy!

315
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,580
Misa...

316
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,110
Let's make a new world without crime...
a world with only kind people.

317
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,250
Let's!

318
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,760
Good-bye.
