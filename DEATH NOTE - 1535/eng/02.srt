1
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,770
The human whose name is written in this note...

2
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,820
shall die?

3
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,940
Please!

4
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,150
Stop!

5
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,070
Now let's see...
Stop!

6
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,570
Now let's see...

7
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,400
what'll happen!

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,950
The Death Note is real!

9
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,130
Don't think for a moment, that any human

10
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,090
who's used the Death Note can go to Heaven, or Hell.

11
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,010
I want the world to know of my existence!

12
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,050
That there is someone passing judgment on them!

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,800
And I will become...

14
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,390
the god of the new world!

15
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,690
He was overflooded with satisfaction...

16
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,940
I had no idea what he was thinking, so I'm through with him.

17
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,240
Really? Then how was it with that other old guy?

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Uhm, Yagami.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,660
Please translate that sentence into Japanese.

20
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,620
Okay.

21
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,080
"When finally, he fully succeeded in making his dream a reality,

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,710
he was immersed in beatitude."

23
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,840
Very good.

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,510
As expected from you, Yagami.

25
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,760
A perfect answer.

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,100
Well then, class is dismissed.

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,610
It's finally over.

28
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,860
School sure is boring.

29
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,900
Hey, Light!

30
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,610
Light, are you listening to me?

31
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,780
Don't talk to me.

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,830
Others can hear my voice when I talk, unlike yours.

33
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,790
You're no fun.

34
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,170
Hey, Light! We're going to go—

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,210
Sorry, I have something to do.

36
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,300
You don't have anything to do.

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,630
Aren't you just going home like you usually do?

38
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,010
What are you talking about? I have something to do.

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,850
Something very important.

40
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,100
<i>Yamada is suspected of stabbing a fellow employee in the
abdomen at a restaurant in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, yesterday.</i>

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,270
<i>The knife was from the restaurant
and was roughly twelve inches long.</i>

42
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,150
<i>The suspect said,
"He was being rude, so I just lost it."</i>

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,030
Hey!

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,490
Hey, Light!

45
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,110
What is it?

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,620
You sure are working very hard.

47
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,830
I can't waste any time.

48
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,330
I only have a limited amount of time to write names in the notebook.

49
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,920
The only time I have is when I get home from school and until I go to bed.

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,460
I also need to maintain my grades.

51
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,340
I can't sleep during class.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,260
I need to do all of my homework for school and my prep classes.

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,430
Lack of sleep is dangerous.

54
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,600
It'll affect my health and concentration.

55
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,940
After all, I'm trying to change
this world into a utopia without evil.

56
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,980
There's never enough time.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,240
Huh? Why did you lock the door, Light?

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,150
It's Sayu. What is it?

59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,530
Help me with my homework.

60
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,990
Okay, sure.

61
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,040
It's on quadratic equations.

62
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,290
I'm sorry if you were studying.

63
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,050
But it just doesn't make any sense.

64
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,670
Please help me.

65
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,710
All right.

66
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,130
Light, be careful.

67
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,640
Any human who touches
the notebook in your drawer

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,140
will be able to see me.

69
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,680
He waits until now to tell me that crucial detail?

70
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,060
Damn Shinigami!

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,020
What's wrong, Light?

72
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,940
Hm? It's nothing.

73
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,280
Well, what exactly don't you understand?

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,070
Well, um...

75
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,570
I think everything.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,780
From what we know, there have been fifty-two deaths just this past week.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,450
They all had heart attacks.

78
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,540
They're all criminals who were wanted or being held in prison.

79
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,550
There are probably other criminals
whose deaths are still unaccounted for.

80
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,420
Does that mean the death toll
could easily be over a hundred?

81
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,970
Chief, we've already started.

82
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,180
I know. I had a call from headquarters.

83
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,440
At any rate, they were all criminals
who probably would have been executed.

84
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,190
Perhaps we shouldn't concern ourselves.

85
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,570
How stupid!

86
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,110
It doesn't matter if they're criminals
or on death row. Killing them is murder.

87
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,030
We aren't even sure that they were murdered.

88
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,620
There's no way over a hundred people
could have heart attacks at the same time!

89
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,040
It <i>has</i> to be murder.

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Is it even possible to kill
that many people at the same time?

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,130
We believe that a large organization carefully orchestrated these killings.

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,590
If you say a large organization is involved,

93
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,130
I can't help but think that the FBI or CIA is involved.

94
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,140
I dare you to say that again!

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Now, now.
Let's stop joking around.

96
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,140
We have to first clarify if these are murders,
or strange coincidences.

97
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
But don't all the autopsy reports say that

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,150
the deaths were caused by inexplicable heart attacks?

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,650
I don't see what else can be learned from just the way they died.

100
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,860
That's right!

101
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,410
It would be worth looking into
if they were stabbed with knives!

102
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,160
If that's the case, we'll just have to have L solve this!

103
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,000
Chief, what is L?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,090
This is your first time at this conference, isn't it?

105
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,970
No one knows L's name,
location, or what he looks like.

106
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,600
But he's managed to solve every case he's taken,
no matter how difficult it's been.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,520
He's cracked many of
the world's unsolved cases.

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,440
He's our trump card,
our ace in the hole. Our last hope.

109
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Something like that.

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,490
But isn't L an arrogant individual who'll only take on cases he's interested in?

111
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,740
That's right.

112
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,700
We can't even contact him.

113
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,870
L is already involved.

114
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,890
L is already investigating this case.

115
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,390
Huh? Watari?

116
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,220
Who's Watari?

117
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,440
He's the only man who can contact L.

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,610
Furthermore, Watari's identity is also unknown.

119
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,480
Please be silent.

120
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,900
L will now speak.

121
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,410
Members of the ICPO...

122
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
I am L.

123
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,750
What are we doing,

124
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,000
sneaking around in such a desolate place, Light?

125
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,420
People who touch the Death Note can see you, can't they?

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,260
I can't just walk around with something this dangerous.

127
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,010
Up until now, I thought that if my family saw the notebook...

128
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,520
I could pass it off as a record of cases
which I'm using to study to become a detective.

129
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,270
But I'm walking a fine line right now.

130
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,360
If I'm not careful, I might end up killing...

131
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,030
my own family.

132
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,460
This case is unprecedented in scope and difficulty because
it involves more people than any other case has before.

133
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,460
It is also an unforgivable crime of serial murder.

134
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,760
In order to solve this case,

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,300
I need the ICPO—

136
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,430
no, various worldwide organizations, to cooperate fully.

137
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,100
I want you to decide whether
you'll support me at this conference.

138
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,980
Also,

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,980
I strongly desire to work with the Japanese Police.

140
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,860
Huh?

141
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,940
Wh-Why Japan?

142
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,190
Regardless of how many suspects there are,

143
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,160
there's a strong possibility they're Japanese.

144
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,280
Even if they aren't Japanese, they are hiding in Japan.

145
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,660
What grounds do you have for your claims?

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,460
Why Japan?

147
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,670
I think I can show you very soon by directly confronting the culprit.

148
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,300
A direct confrontation?

149
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,630
At any rate, I would like to set up headquarters in Japan.

150
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,020
That was pretty easy to make.

151
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,100
Hmm?

152
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,190
Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?

153
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,480
Yeah, in this drawer.

154
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,360
Does that count as a hiding place?

155
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,070
You left the key in the lock.

156
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,570
That's fine.

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,660
It's better that I intentionally left the key in a noticeable place.

158
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,080
It's just a regular diary.

159
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,500
Most people will probably be satisfied

160
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,580
with the secrets of this drawer

161
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,420
after reading this diary.

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,050
But...

163
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,710
the real key...

164
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,090
is this.

165
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,300
There's nothing suspicious about
having one of these on my desk.

166
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,850
It's just a regular ballpoint pen.

167
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,430
I'll use the ink cartridge.

168
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,100
That's the key?

169
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,270
Yeah.

170
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,310
On the back of the drawer,

171
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,230
there's a small hole that's hard
to notice if you don't look closely.

172
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,820
You put this in the hole.

173
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,740
I see. It's got a false bottom.

174
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,030
Well, you also have the fake diary,

175
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,120
so I doubt anyone will find it.

176
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,490
That's not all.

177
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,420
Even if they discovered it has a false bottom,

178
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,250
there would be no way that they could take the notebook.

179
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,340
You see...

180
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,590
This ink cartridge is an insulator,

181
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,760
so it doesn't channel electricity,
stopping its flow in the circuit.

182
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,180
When the bottom of this drawer is closed,

183
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,430
this piece of rubber also stops the flow of electricity.

184
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,640
However, if someone were to force open the bottom,

185
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,730
gasoline in thin plastic bags will ignite at that moment...

186
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,490
and the notebook will instantly be set aflame.

187
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,700
All evidence will be completely destroyed.

188
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,450
That's how it's set up.

189
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,330
I can just say the reason I burned it was that "I didn't want anyone to see my real diary."

190
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,460
It's a believable excuse.

191
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,920
It <i>is</i> a notebook, after all.

192
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,460
I've heard that when a human gets a Death Note,

193
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,420
the biggest problem they have is finding a good place to hide it.

194
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,800
But, Light, you're probably the first to go this far.

195
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,930
That setup is really dangerous, though.

196
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,180
If you make even the slightest mistake,

197
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,440
you could be badly burned.

198
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,850
Dangerous?

199
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,940
You're talking nonsense again, Ryuk.

200
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,820
I've been putting myself in danger from the very beginning.

201
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,450
Ever since I first got ahold of the Death Note.

202
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,740
Compared to that, this is hardly dangerous.

203
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,450
In fact, quite the opposite. It protects me.

204
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,170
A small fire in the house, or being executed?

205
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,330
Which is worse?

206
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,470
Last night, within the Tokyo West Penitentiary,

207
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,730
Kurotsukayama Naoki, aged thirty-two, who was detained for armed robbery,

208
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,650
is reported to have died of a heart attack.

209
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,240
In response to the endless, bizarre deaths of prisoners...

210
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,030
That's amazing.
Bad guys just keep dropping dead.

211
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,660
It's a little scary, but it does feel great.

212
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,700
But now we really can't do anything bad.

213
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,830
I wonder if the police are behind it.

214
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,210
The police don't have that kind of power.

215
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,080
Don't you know about him?

216
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Huh? About who?

217
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,090
You know, Kira. Kira!

218
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,880
I wonder who's going to be killed next.

219
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,510
Ryuk, take a look at this.

220
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,310
Hmm?

221
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,180
Someone's already created a website.

222
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,020
"The legend of Kira the Savior."

223
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,230
That's pretty cool. Is this about you?

224
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah.

225
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,320
"Kira" seems to come from the English word "killer."

226
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,820
I don't like that,

227
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,820
but I've become "Kira" to the world.

228
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,830
Just searching the word "Kira"
brings up countless sites like this one.

229
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,460
Television and newspapers have only publicized

230
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,590
"the successive, mysterious deaths of vicious criminals."

231
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,840
But the people of the world can already feel it.

232
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,510
The existence of someone passing judgment.

233
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,970
Oh?

234
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,510
Humans are like that, Ryuk.

235
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,850
For example,

236
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,690
there's no way that anyone in homeroom at school would bring up the topic of killing bad people.

237
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,150
But if someone were to do so, everyone would act pious.

238
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,570
That's wrong.

239
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,150
That's what they're bound to say.

240
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,160
Of course, it's the right thing to say.

241
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,450
Humans must put up a front like that in public.

242
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,370
But their true feelings are there.

243
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,670
They may be afraid, or not acknowledge my existence on the surface,

244
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,630
but on the Internet, where one can remain anonymous,

245
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,340
Kira is already thriving.

246
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,430
They don't talk about it,

247
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,180
but they all understand.

248
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,310
Someone is making the bad guys disappear.

249
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,310
Those who have a clean conscience

250
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,600
are cheering for Kira in their hearts.

251
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,440
And those who have done wrong

252
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,690
fear that heaven's judgment will strike upon them.

253
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,280
It's perfect.

254
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,200
Everything is going exactly as planned.

255
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,330
We interrupt this program to bring you

256
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,500
a special, worldwide broadcast from the ICPO, Interpol.

257
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,540
Hmm? What's this?

258
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,340
Interpol?

259
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,500
We'll start now.

260
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,550
I am the sole person able to mobilize the world's police.

261
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,760
I am Lind L. Tailor.

262
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,060
Also known as L.

263
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,560
Wh-Who is this?

264
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,060
It's finally started.

265
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,310
He's never shown his face, right?

266
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,440
So why now?

267
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,690
It means that L is serious.

268
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,700
All right, L. We're doing exactly what you told us to do.

269
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,910
Now, let's see you prove
what you said at the ICPO conference.

270
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,080
There has been a string of
serial killings targeting criminals.

271
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,290
This is the most atrocious act of murder in history,
and it will not go unpunished.

272
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,300
I will definitely catch the one behind the murders,

273
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,050
commonly known as "Kira."

274
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,890
He said he'll definitely catch you.

275
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,310
The fool. There's no way he can catch me.

276
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,480
This is the Death Note!

277
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
If you don't have this,

278
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,690
there's no evidence.

279
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,520
It's impossible to catch me.

280
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,860
I knew that the police would start investigating and that someone like you would turn up.

281
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,330
Kira, I have a pretty good idea behind your motive.

282
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,910
But what you're doing

283
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,750
is evil!

284
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,340
I'm evil?

285
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,550
I am justice!

286
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,930
I'm saving the meek, who fear evil.

287
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,220
I'm the man who will become the god of the ideal, new world!

288
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,220
All who oppose that god...

289
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,020
It is <i>they</i> who are evil!

290
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,270
You're too stupid, L.

291
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,690
This could've been more interesting if you'd been a bit smarter.

292
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,120
The entire world is watching

293
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,670
to see what happens to those who defy me, L.

294
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,300
Just five more seconds.

295
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,550
Four...

296
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,600
Three...

297
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,600
Two...

298
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,810
One...

299
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
What's wrong?
Why don't you say something?

300
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,790
Unbelievable.

301
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,790
I had to check to be sure.

302
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,290
You're capable of this?

303
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,380
Kira,

304
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,090
it seems you can kill people without direct contact.

305
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,170
I couldn't believe it before seeing it with my own eyes.

306
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,590
Listen to me, Kira.

307
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,020
If you just killed the man on-screen, Lind L. Tailor,

308
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,980
you just killed a man who was scheduled to be executed today.

309
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,190
It wasn't me.

310
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
What?!

311
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,650
This criminal was someone
whom the police caught secretly.

312
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,650
His capture wasn't broadcast on television or the Internet.

313
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,160
It seems that even you couldn't get information on him.

314
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,790
He got you.

315
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,330
But I, L, do exist!

316
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,040
Bring it on! Try and kill me!

317
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,050
Th-That bastard!

318
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,220
What's going on?! This is unreal!
What's wrong? Do it quickly!

319
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,090
C'mon! Kill me!

320
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,470
Are you trying to die, L?!
C'mon! Kill me!

321
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,680
What's going on?

322
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,180
It's Kira versus L!

323
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,430
It's a live murder!

324
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,510
Come on, Kira!

325
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,020
This is scary!
Come on, Kira!

326
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,730
Try and kill me!
This is scary!

327
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,600
What's the matter? Can't you do it?!

328
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,490
It seems that you can't kill me.

329
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,570
So, there are some people whom you can't kill.

330
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,450
You've given me a good clue.

331
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,250
I'll tell you something good in return.

332
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,290
I told you that this is a live broadcast worldwide,

333
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,800
but this is only being broadcast in the Kanto region of Japan.

334
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,590
I was planning on broadcasting this in different areas
at different times, but it seems that I no longer need to.

335
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,930
Now I know that you are based in the Kanto region.

336
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,810
This L guy is pretty good.

337
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,270
The first victim was the killer in Shinjuku.

338
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,320
The police overlooked that case because it was so minor.

339
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,860
Of all the criminals who died of heart attacks,

340
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,320
this one's crime was the least serious.

341
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,660
Furthermore, his crime was only broadcast in Japan.

342
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,580
I have been able to deduce this much.

343
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,210
You are in Japan,

344
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,500
and your first victim pwas your guinea pig.

345
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,680
You're just lucky that you're in Kanto,

346
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,680
the most heavily populated region in Japan.

347
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,180
I never thought that things would go quite so well, but...

348
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,390
Kira,

349
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,730
it won't be too long before I can sentence you to death.

350
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,980
L certainly lives up to his reputation.

351
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:25,490
Yes, he's proved that Kira exists, that the killings took place, and that Kira's in Japan.

352
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:32,040
Kira, I'm interested in how you commit the murders.

353
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,380
But I'll find that out when I catch you.

354
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,920
Until we meet again,

355
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,960
Kira.

356
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,770
He's going to...

357
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,520
sentence me to death?

358
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,270
Interesting.

359
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,190
I'll accept your challenge.

360
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,990
They have to hunt each other down,
but neither of them know the other's name or face.

361
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,620
And the first one who gets found is dead!

362
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,120
Humans sure are interesting!

363
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,540
L...

364
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,960
Kira...

365
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,460
I will definitely find and finish you!

366
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,460
I am...

367
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,460
justice!

368
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,460
I'm not the one who's going to find L.

369
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,500
The police will track him down.

370
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,210
And I will eliminate him.

371
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,630
Looks like I may be able to provide you a little more entertainment, Ryuk.
