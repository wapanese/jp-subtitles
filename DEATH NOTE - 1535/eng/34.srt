1
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,860
I'm going to announce my engagement to him at the Music Festival.

2
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,360
I used to like Kira as well,

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,200
but Light's going to catch him soon enough.

4
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,450
You'll probably get executed.

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,600
Send me a fan letter that I can tell is from you.

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,540
Place within it... five blank notebook pages.

7
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,930
Continue killing as usual until I receive them.

8
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,170
What about after you receive them?

9
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,100
Make a notebook that looks
as close to the original as possible,

10
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,930
and act as if you're killing using the fake.

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,310
What's up with that, lady?

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,980
You're wearing such a short skirt even though it's winter.

13
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
S-Someone...

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,070
Delete.

15
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,720
Mikami's getting off.

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,830
A man who was harassing a woman collapsed.

17
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,670
He was in the same train car as Mikami.

18
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,050
It happened a few seconds after Mikami
wrote something in a notebook.

19
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,090
It's probably...

20
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,350
Now we're sure.

21
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,190
Indeed.

22
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,930
First we've got to get as close as possible to Mikami.

23
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,700
But there's something we need to be careful of.

24
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,380
The Shinigami.

25
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,320
We must assume that if the Shinigami discovers that we're following him, he'll alert Mikami.

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,990
But the Shinigami can only be seen
by those who have touched the notebook.

27
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,460
Being careful of something you can't see is difficult.

28
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,290
Even if it's difficult, please do it.

29
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,330
I understand.

30
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,150
Light is going to meet Takada again in this room today.

31
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,890
As soon as they began their secret meeting,

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,440
Takada received a phone call from Kira

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,310
and the surveillance cameras were removed.

34
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,860
The first thought that hit me was that

35
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,990
they could communicate by writing messages.

36
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,650
It looks fine.

37
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,080
There's nothing in this room other than the wiretap on me.

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,330
Y-Yeah. All that's left is the bathroom.

39
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,840
Why does Light care so much about the cameras and wiretaps?

40
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,720
No, why is Kira allowing this secret meeting to go on?

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,390
It doesn't add up.

42
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,640
In the event that they are<i> writing notes,</i>

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,430
the only thing that I can do is...

44
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,390
Yagami, I talked to Amane yesterday, alone.

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,870
About what?

46
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,820
Light's in trouble now!

47
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,790
Matsuda, you seem kind of happy.

48
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,800
Amane said that she was going to announce
her engagement to you at the Music Festival.

49
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,080
Trouble, trouble! Big trouble!

50
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,550
Matsuda, shut up!

51
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,530
Well,

52
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,890
I just haven't been able to break it to her.
She's nothing to me already.

53
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,940
Misa, that moron.
That was unnecessary.

54
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,020
No, Takada as well.
Why are women so...

55
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,850
Already?

56
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,150
Is that true?

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,410
She was in charge of Kira's killing before T.

58
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,320
She gained Kira's power somehow

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,620
and discovered that I was Kira.
It couldn't be helped.

60
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,250
There would be no other reason
I would choose such an impulsive woman.

61
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,560
Amane was doing Kira's killings,

62
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,220
but right now it's me.

63
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,840
He had no choice with Amane,

64
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,930
but he chose me.

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,880
Takada, believe me.

66
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,310
You're the only one for me now.

67
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,400
"You're the only one for me now?"

68
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,460
That's so unlike you,

69
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,230
such a predictable line.

70
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,150
It's definitely unlike Light to give such a brutal excuse.

71
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,600
Those are my honest feelings.

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,170
So... Amane or Takada. Which one is it?

73
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,540
I wonder how many women you've said that to.

74
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,280
Well... He might be dating both.

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,450
Takada, do you really think I'm that kind of guy?

76
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,350
Two-timing? Do you think that's acceptable?!

77
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,190
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

78
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,540
Hey, I'm not the one...

79
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:56,690
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

80
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,550
Shut the hell up!

81
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,780
It depends on you from now on,

82
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,460
but I'll trust you.

83
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,980
However, I'll make things hell for you if you're lying.

84
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,260
I'll tell Kira.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,730
Kira, huh?

86
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,080
I know that the world needs Kira right now.

87
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,640
But I've been thinking...

88
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,780
I wonder if I'll ever be together with you.

89
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,820
In other words, I hate Kira
because he chose you as his spokesperson.

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,120
It's fine if he kills criminals.
But we're not criminals.

91
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,160
We should have the right to be happy.

92
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,590
"Together, peacefully and happily."

93
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,060
"But that could only happen...

94
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,590
if Kira weren't around."

95
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,850
Yeah. If only Kira weren't around.

96
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,020
"Kira...

97
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,680
should be arrested."

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Huh?

99
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,560
You're right.

100
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,650
Kira needs to be arrested

101
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,650
in order for us to be happy.

102
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,000
T-Takada,

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,550
are you serious?

104
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,370
Yes.

105
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,710
But I'll need your help for that. You'll be putting yourself in danger.

106
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,320
I'll be defying the police,

107
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,170
and you'll be going against Kira and the whole world.

108
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,450
Is that...

109
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,920
all right with you?

110
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,730
Th-That's one long pause.

111
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,020
It's fine.

112
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,050
"I'll help you if it means that

113
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,320
we can be happy together."

114
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,090
A big turn in our favor!

115
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,530
Just as I expected of Light!

116
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,420
He brought the conversation from two-timing with Misa-Misa to getting Takki to help him!

117
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,920
Mikami is talking to himself!

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,670
To himself?

119
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,420
Yes. He's too far away for me to record his voice,

120
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,920
but I've got visuals of his mouth!

121
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,010
This is footage of Mikami during his break at work.

122
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,410
Right here. He's saying something.

123
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,620
Show it once more to us in slow motion.

124
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Shinigami, huh?

125
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,200
But...

126
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,090
He seems to have reacted to the scrap of paper at his feet.

127
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,530
He just gave a small sigh.

128
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,500
Here he talks a bit more.

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,980
I'll zoom in on his mouth.

130
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,630
And that Shinigami

131
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,180
justgave me the notebook and has

132
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,310
not appeared before me since then.

133
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,110
"That Shinigami just handed me the notebook and has not

134
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,740
appeared before me since then."

135
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,110
Mikami was given the notebook by a Shinigami,

136
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,910
but the Shinigami hasn't been following him.

137
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,630
I see...

138
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,050
Then I guess that'll be it for today, Yagami.

139
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,250
Yeah.

140
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,050
It's finally over.

141
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,030
Today was really quite amazing.

142
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,520
It's tough to do this for several hours.

143
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,610
And yet you're still smiling.

144
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,680
Then I'll go to the hotel and checkout.

145
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,530
Thanks for your help!

146
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,730
Must be tough for Aizawa, making all
the reservations and checking out of the hotels.

147
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,050
It's gone...

148
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,120
The nail mark I left is gone!

149
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,690
Two of the four marks I left are gone.

150
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,730
The room is the way they left it.

151
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,990
The hotel staff hasn't come in yet.

152
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,750
So why is the notepad switched with a new one?

153
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,080
They've been passing notes!

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,170
Yes?

155
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,930
What?

156
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,830
You want to meet and talk to Near directly?

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,240
Mr. Aizawa, it's been a while.

158
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,110
And also, nice to meet you.

159
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,580
There's no point in saying that if I'm blindfolded.

160
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,410
He doesn't have any weapons or cameras on him.

161
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,540
Then you can take off the blindfold.

162
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,610
Near,

163
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,140
I believe you.

164
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,890
L and Takada have been meeting almost every night.

165
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,050
I know.

166
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,910
Then what about this?

167
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,560
There's no mistake that they've been passing notes!

168
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,650
Mr. Aizawa,

169
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,690
please don't do something unnecessary.

170
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,480
Something unnecessary?

171
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,280
Yes.

172
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,700
It's no longer a matter
of simply finding evidence against Kira.

173
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,200
We must hit Kira with complete defeat in order to stop him.

174
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Mr. Aizawa, to put it bluntly,

175
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,290
you and the task force are no longer part of this battle.

176
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,520
But if you still want to capture Kira,

177
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,920
just keep an eye on him as you've been doing.

178
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,530
Just keep an eye on him?

179
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,930
Yes. But there is a purpose to watching over L.

180
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,220
And that's part of my plan.

181
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,860
I want you to cooperate that way.

182
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,700
In order to win against Kira

183
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,280
and to watch...

184
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,860
the end of Kira.

185
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,680
There's only a few minutes left of this year,

186
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,480
but it's been one full of breakthroughs for myself.

187
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,680
The East-West Music Festival will wrap this year up.

188
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm Takada Kiyomi, your host.

189
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,690
Pleased to meet you.

190
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,860
The Music Festival is about to begin!

191
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,530
Matsuda, have you crosschecked Kira killings and the victims?

192
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:29,030
After our Misa-Misa's performance! She's this year's opening act!

193
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,360
Wh-What is it?

194
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,210
We're the SPK.

195
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,020
We want you to come with us.

196
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,890
I must apologize to everyone.

197
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,560
Unfortunately, this year's opener, Amane Misa, has not arrived yet.

198
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,230
What?

199
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,230
However,

200
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,840
unexpected things can happen at this Music Festival.

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,550
What's going on?

202
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,860
Mogi didn't tell me anything about this.

203
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,570
Go back to NHN immediately!

204
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,550
I'm already known as the queen of sudden cancellations!

205
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,370
Misa-Misa, please calm down.

206
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,830
Mochi, why?!

207
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,010
We need to do this to catch Kira.

208
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,590
That doesn't involve me!

209
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,090
If worse came to worst, I was prepared to pull a gun on you.

210
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,880
But I'm glad that you didn't resist, Mr. Mogi.

211
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,990
I probably would've resisted
if I hadn't listened to what Aizawa said.

212
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,120
But...

213
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,190
hearing about the notepad, there's no doubt that...

214
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,150
What's going on?

215
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,610
Near.

216
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,610
What is it, L?

217
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,710
Mogi and Amane Misa have gone missing.

218
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,620
Yes. I've taken them into my custody.

219
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,090
What?!

220
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,370
Why?

221
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,790
Just in case.

222
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,130
Near...

223
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,780
Kidnapping and confinement are crimes.
Release them immediately.

224
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,430
Well, Mr. Mogi and Amane agreed to cooperate.

225
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,930
I'll put them on the line.
Here you go.

226
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,860
Mogi, Misa, this is L.

227
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,410
Light!

228
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,610
It seems that Near is detaining you.

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,950
Is it true that you agreed to it?

230
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,950
Yes.

231
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,250
Mogi...

232
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,470
I was against it!

233
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,870
But Mochi said it would be better if I sat still.

234
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,670
He said that we would be killed otherwise.

235
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,260
I understand.
I guess it's fine if you both agreed.

236
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,270
For the time being, I'm excluding Amane,

237
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,230
who was suspected of being the Second Kira.

238
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,490
Yagami Light,

239
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,770
you know what this means.

240
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,170
No way!

241
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,240
You're planning to end this without Misa-Misa performing?!

242
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,250
Have Misa-Misa perform!

243
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,570
Looks like Lidner and the others succeeded.

244
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,350
It's past nine.

245
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,870
All right, now it's my turn.

246
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,490
The time that Mikami leaves work differs only slightly.

247
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,970
He leads a completely fixed life.

248
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,040
So he always goes to that gym every week on Monday and Thursday until 9:00 p.m.?

249
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,130
<i>Yes. He's come at that time
for the past four years, ever since he joined.</i>

250
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,890
<i>He hasn't even skipped New Year's Day.</i>

251
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,130
<i>I became a member to confirm it.</i>

252
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,490
Then can we assume that he's going this 31st?

253
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,440
<i>Yes. He's someone who would go on New Year's Day.
He's sure to go on New Year's Eve too.</i>

254
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,810
Gevanni.

255
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,440
Is it possible for you to touch
the notebook on the 31st at the gym?

256
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,730
Yes.

257
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,200
I've already checked the hotel's security.

258
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,430
There are no surveillance cameras in the locker room.

259
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,080
<i>Then I leave it to you.</i>

260
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,560
There's a possibility that I'll die

261
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,320
if there's a Shinigami with him, isn't there?

262
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,960
<i>Indeed.</i>

263
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,470
We need to confirm it.
That is why I'm asking you to do it.

264
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,450
Even if you don't see a Shinigami after touching it,

265
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,980
I want you to continue to watch him
for a while to see whether there is one with him.

266
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,660
<i>I'll have Rester do it if you're too afraid.</i>

267
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,730
No, I understand. I'll do it.

268
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,630
If a Shinigami is with him...

269
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,090
No, I'm already past the point of no return.

270
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,240
I have to touch it.

271
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,040
I have successfully touched the notebook!

272
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,050
I cannot confirm any Shinigami at this time.

273
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,470
Commander Rester, connect me to Mr. Mogi.

274
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,980
Mr. Mogi, according to the notebook's rules,

275
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,600
how long can a person be controlled before death?

276
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,120
Twenty-three days,
judging by the data from Yotsuba's experiments.

277
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,610
Are you sure?

278
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,070
Yes. I think that Yotsuba's killings have proven that.

279
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,200
Thank you very much.

280
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,270
Then it is possible that Gevanni is already being controlled,

281
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,580
and is being made to say that there is no Shinigami.

282
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,790
I'm going to confront L

283
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,420
if Gevanni is alive twenty-four days from now.

284
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,890
Takada, you had quite some trouble at the Music Festival, didn't you?

285
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,560
Yes. To think that Amane would go missing...

286
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,110
"Give T the order to tell you
once everything has been confirmed."

287
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,250
"Once you get the message,

288
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,450
send me a text message or something

289
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,780
that says you want to meet me quickly."

290
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,830
Taking pictures?

291
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,690
Yes.

292
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,460
I want to see how it's written.

293
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,890
Any patterns as to how it's being written,

294
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,840
if there are any quirks, and what kind of notebook it is...

295
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,350
I want to see everything in detail with my own eyes.

296
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,650
What do you think, Near?

297
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,030
Gevanni has done well.

298
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,000
The handwriting matches that
of Mikami's records he wrote as a prosecutor.

299
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,410
This is definitely Mikami's handwriting.

300
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,250
Yeah.

301
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,170
We can do this.

302
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,460
The escort team has been attacked?

303
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,020
Takada, are you all right?

304
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,880
Is it Near again?

305
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,590
No, this way of doing things...

306
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,130
It's Mello!
