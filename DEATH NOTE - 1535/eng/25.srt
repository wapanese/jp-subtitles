1
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,130
What seems to be the trouble, Ryuzaki?

2
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,690
What's wrong?

3
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,780
The corner of this page from this killer notebook is cut out.

4
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,000
Would someone still die if their name
was written on the part that has been cut out?

5
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,520
Who knows?

6
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,070
I haven't used it in that way, so I don't know.

7
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,180
Then do Shinigami only eat apples?

8
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,940
No.

9
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,690
But a Shinigami's organs are devolvedâ€”no, evolved,

10
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,910
so there's no need for us to eat.

11
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,100
Yagami...

12
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,730
You've finally been freed, but you never leave headquarters.

13
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Even if Misa comes to visit,
you only chat with her for a few minutes.

14
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,410
You're free to go and have
a love life outside of here, you know.

15
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,260
We still haven't solved the Kira case.

16
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,920
I'm not in the mood for love.

17
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,350
Or are you trying to say that I'm a nuisance if I stay here?

18
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,510
No...

19
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,750
Right now, I'm in no position to be punishing criminals.

20
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,750
Misa,

21
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,390
punish them for me.

22
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,550
Misa,

23
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,120
let's make a new world together.

24
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,020
What do you mean?

25
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
The murders of criminals have begun again?

26
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,880
There were sixteen just yesterday.

27
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,530
They were broadcast after Higuchi died.

28
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,320
That's thorough, huh?

29
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,280
I guess that means Higuchi wasn't necessarily Kira.

30
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,180
No, we're positive that Higuchi
was the one killing criminals until we caught him.

31
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,640
Then does that mean another Kira has appeared?

32
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,460
Why?!

33
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,510
Damn... Curse Kira...

34
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,040
Kira appears now...

35
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,760
What's going on?

36
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,930
Just what is going on?

37
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,260
There's only Misa.

38
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,430
This happened as soon as Misa was freed, didn't it?

39
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,770
Ryuzaki, you're still saying that?

40
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,900
Misa is not involved.

41
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,410
It happened as soon as Higuchi died.

42
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,980
You're right...

43
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,960
Well, if there is another notebook and someone is using it...

44
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,620
I'll catch him.

45
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,380
The Shinigami said it didn't know,

46
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,510
but if someone could kill by writing a name
on a clipping from the notebook...

47
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,640
It's not impossible...

48
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,690
But whoever writes a name in this notebook

49
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,940
has to write another name within thirteen days, or they'll die.

50
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,030
Yagami Light and Amane Misa are both alive.

51
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,420
Thirteen days...

52
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,490
This is the only...

53
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,300
Ryuzaki, even if we do catch the person who was writing in the notebook,

54
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,920
can we really convict and punish him as a serial killer?

55
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,420
Well, of course!

56
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,660
He wrote countless names knowing that people would die.

57
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,890
We should kill him if we don't want
the existence of the notebook to go public.

58
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,150
Killing him is harsh,

59
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,180
but I bet that's what our superiors would demand.

60
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,590
If he admits to killing with the notebook, he would receive the death penalty.

61
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,460
Or at least a life sentence.

62
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Something like that.

63
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,290
What are you thinking, Yagami Light?

64
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,900
If Misa is caught, you'll also be...

65
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,620
So that's it!

66
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,170
That bastard!

67
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,720
Light Yagami is sure that I'll save Misa's life.

68
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,350
In order to save Misa in this situation,

69
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,680
I'll have to write Ryuzaki's real name in my notebook.

70
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,230
And if I kill Ryuzaki...

71
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,980
it'll definitely affect Misa's lifespan and I'll die as well.

72
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,910
Yagami Light is making everything go his way.

73
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,140
What are you going to do, Rem?

74
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,870
I know completely that despite
being a Shinigami, you care about Misa.

75
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,160
Misa's life has been halved. There's no way you'd abandon her.

76
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,420
Think about Misa's happiness.

77
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,650
What are you doing there, Ryuzaki?

78
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,790
What are you doing there, Ryuzaki?!

79
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,810
What are you up to, Ryuzaki?

80
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,270
Well, nothing in particular, but...

81
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,020
The sound of the bells...

82
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,190
Bells?

83
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,810
Yes.

84
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,170
The bells have been really noisy throughout the day.

85
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,860
I haven't heard anything.

86
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,340
Really?

87
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,860
They've been ringing all day

88
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,750
and I can't help but feel curious.

89
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,880
Do you suppose it's a church?

90
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,250
A wedding?

91
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,610
Or perhaps...

92
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,340
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

93
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,450
Don't say such silly things.

94
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,010
Let's go back.

95
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm sorry.

96
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,720
Everything I say is complete nonsense,

97
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,400
so please don't believe any of it.

98
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,190
That's right, Ryuzaki.

99
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,240
Most of what you say is nonsense.

100
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,650
There would be no end if I took you seriously all the time.

101
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,430
I know that the best.

102
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,620
Yes, that's right, Light.

103
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,070
But...

104
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,840
it's true for both of us.

105
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,590
What do you mean?

106
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,720
Have you ever told the truth at any point in your life?

107
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,860
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

108
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,850
It's true that I lie once in a while.

109
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,280
But how many people live their entire lives

110
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,820
only telling the truth?

111
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,700
Humans aren't made perfectly.

112
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,930
Everyone lies.

113
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,330
Even so,

114
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,100
I've been careful not to tell lies that hurt others.

115
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,000
That's my answer.

116
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,010
I thought you'd say that.

117
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,220
Let's go back.

118
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,580
We're drenched.

119
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah.

120
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,450
Well, that was awful.

121
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,420
It's your fault.

122
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,630
You were standing in that rain.

123
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,120
You're right.

124
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,830
I'm sorry.

125
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,240
What are you doing, Ryuzaki?

126
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,140
I thought I'd help you,

127
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,540
since you're vigorously wiping yourself off.

128
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,980
You don't have to do that.

129
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,600
I can give you a massage as well.

130
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,400
It's the least I can do to atone.

131
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,850
I'm pretty good.

132
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
Do as you please.

133
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,440
All right.

134
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,570
Hey...

135
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,910
You'll get used to it.

136
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,480
You're still wet.

137
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,170
I'm sorry.

138
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,850
How sad...

139
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,640
What?

140
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,220
We'll soon part.

141
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,300
Yes.

142
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,260
All right. I'll come immediately.

143
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,730
Let's go, Light.

144
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,250
It seems it went well.

145
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,450
Oh, Ryuzaki! What is the meaning of this?!

146
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,650
I heard that you got approval from another country
to use the notebook for an execution!

147
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,460
Watari...

148
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,300
Good job.

149
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,170
Not at all.

150
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,460
Let's immediately

151
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,640
make arrangements to transport the notebook.

152
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,810
Yes.

153
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,420
Ryuzaki, what's the meaning of this?

154
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,430
It means that I'm going to try out the notebook for real.

155
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,400
That's pointless! We don't have to do that...

156
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,770
We already know that the power of the notebook is real, don't we?

157
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,980
Besides, who's going to write the name?

158
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,690
Once you write in the notebook, you have
to continue writing names every thirteen days!

159
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,280
The one who's going to write the name

160
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,100
is someone who'll be executed within thirteen days.

161
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,430
If he's still alive after thirteen days,

162
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,370
we've made a deal to commute his execution.

163
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,280
But we can't sacrifice people's livesâ€”

164
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,130
Just a little more.

165
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,750
If we just clear this,

166
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,000
the case will be solved.

167
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,430
Wh-What's this?!

168
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,510
A blackout?!

169
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,280
Watari?

170
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Data deletion?
What's the meaning of this?!

171
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,410
I told Watari to erase all information

172
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,460
in the event that something happened to him.

173
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,730
If something happened to him?

174
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,000
Could it be...

175
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,520
Where's the Shinigami?

176
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,260
Come to think of it, I don't see him.

177
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,980
He's nowhere!

178
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,050
What's the meaning of this?!

179
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,390
Everyone, the Shinigaâ€”

180
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,880
Ryuzaki!

181
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,750
What's wrong?!

182
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,530
Hey! Ryuzaki!

183
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,500
What's wrong?! Get a hold of yourself!

184
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,820
Wh-What's this?!

185
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,160
What's going on?

186
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,520
Calm down, Light!

187
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,500
We're next!

188
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,670
Watari, Ryuzaki, we're next!

189
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,220
Damn!

190
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,350
Where are you, Shinigami?! Come out!

191
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,060
L-Light!

192
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,480
You must know something! Come out!

193
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,660
Let's search as well.

194
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,720
Y-Yeah...

195
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,350
Mogi, please stay with him.

196
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,330
Got it.

197
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,400
Everyone, come here.

198
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,340
Wh-What is this?

199
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,370
Sand?

200
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,390
What's going on?

201
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,420
Whatever it is...

202
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,350
Whatever happened...

203
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,280
I will avenge Ryuzaki.

204
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,720
Solving this case will be our gift...

205
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,100
for Watari and the other victims...

206
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,870
for all people.

207
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,830
Light...

208
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,790
That's right, Light.

209
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,740
Yeah, but we're going to be killed.

210
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,290
Isn't that what this means?

211
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,680
Matsuda, if you're scared of dying, leave the investigation.

212
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,550
Only people who have chosen to risk their lives should be here.

213
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,680
Oh... no. That's right,

214
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,510
b-but, Light, don't talk like Ryuzaki.

215
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,990
All those in my way have disappeared.

216
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,710
I'm the god of the new world.

217
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,830
Ryuzaki...

218
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,040
Watari...

219
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,500
Rem...

220
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
All those in my way have disappeared.

221
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,260
I'm...

222
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
the god of the new world.
