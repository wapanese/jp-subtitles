1
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,650
You there.

2
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,210
Yes?

3
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm here in Japan on a secret investigation.

4
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,050
Keep this a secret from the Japanese police.

5
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,050
I understand.

6
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,850
I won't tell anyone that I met you.

7
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,460
Including my father...

8
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,100
Well, I'll be off now.

9
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,060
It's just as I thought.

10
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,580
I also don't want the police to know that I've come into contact with an FBI agent.

11
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,200
If my father ever found out, he'd tell L.

12
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,450
Raye doesn't suspect me at all.

13
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,120
<i>The police will deal with what happened just now as a regular accident.</i>

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,060
Welcome back.

15
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,470
I'm home.

16
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,600
What's the matter?

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,340
Why the big sigh?

18
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,860
Raye, what happened?

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,840
Oh...

20
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,810
By chance, I was involved in a bus jacking.

21
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,360
A bus jacking?

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,120
Yeah. A man who robbed a bank two days ago tried to hijack a bus.

23
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,800
Japan has become a scary place.

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,120
Does that mean you were also riding on that bus?

25
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,130
Yeah.

26
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,670
In the end, the suspect jumped out of the bus and was hit by a car.

27
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,170
Did he die?

28
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,200
Probably...

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,560
I didn't have any time to watch what happened.

30
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,780
Raye...

31
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,390
Hmm?

32
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,970
Do you really think that was an accident?

33
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,230
What do you mean?

34
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, you were on that bus because you were investigating someone, weren't you?

35
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
The criminal probably died.

36
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,780
Doesn't that mean...

37
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,410
Hey...

38
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,120
You were indeed once an excellent FBI agent.

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,830
But now you're just my fiancÃ©e.

40
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,040
You're no longer an agent.

41
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,650
Don't say anything about the Kira case.

42
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,970
Don't get involved or take risks.

43
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,540
That's what we agreed on

44
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,890
when I brought you with me here so we could meet your parents.

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,200
I understand, Raye.
It's just a force of habit. Sorry.

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
No... I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

47
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,470
Once we start a family,

48
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,770
you'll be so busy that you'll forget that you were an agent.

49
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,860
You won't have time for that habit to pop up.

50
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,180
But first, help me think of something that will make your father like me more.

51
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,440
Oh...

52
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Are you going to write down the name of the agent now?

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,920
No.

54
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,130
I'm going to write his name a week from today.

55
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,050
If he died soon after I met him, I might look suspicious.

56
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,400
It would be better to do it

57
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,890
once they've investigated more people involved with the police.

58
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,650
For now, I'll use some more prison inmates to play with L.

59
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,400
L.

60
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,270
There is another dying message left by a victim.

61
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,700
Please send an image to me.

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Shi    ni    gami

63
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,410
Shinigami...
Shi    ni    gami

64
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,120
"L, did you know?

65
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,580
Shi       ni    gami
"L, did you know?

66
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,910
Shinigami."
Shi       ni    gami

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
Does he want to say that Shinigami exist?

68
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,410
Watari.

69
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,090
Tell the police to keep watch on the prison.

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,440
There may be someone else who will leave a message.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,180
I understand.

72
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,110
There sure are a lot of humans.

73
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,030
Are you going to do it here?

74
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,820
I'll show you what I've learned from

75
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,780
all of the investigations and experiments I've done these past few days.

76
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,910
Experiments?

77
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:57,160
Yes. I've been testing different killing methods on the criminals in this area.

78
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,180
First, I write the cause of death and the circumstances in the Death Note.

79
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,630
Then when I write a name in afterwards, it becomes true.

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,180
That's something even I didn't know.

81
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,760
He's here.

82
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,600
Right on time.

83
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,850
Mr. Raye Penber.

84
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll kill you if you turn around.

85
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,050
I am Kira.

86
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,920
If you turn around or put your hand in your pocket,

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,660
I will kill you on the spot.

88
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,120
I-It couldn't be...

89
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,910
But this voice... I've heard it somewhere.

90
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,480
I shall first prove to you that I am Kira.

91
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,630
I'll kill the man with the glasses

92
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,940
working at the coffee shop you are looking at.

93
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,010
Th-That's impossible.

94
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,670
Don't do it...

95
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,480
I had no choice.

96
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,560
I thought that if I didn't kill at least one person, you wouldn't believe me.

97
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,220
That man has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault,

98
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,150
but the police have never convicted him because of a lack of evidence.

99
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,620
He was a menace and deserved to be punished.

100
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,160
You may already have heard from L,

101
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,120
that I cannot kill someone unless I know their face.

102
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,740
I could kill everyone you see here.

103
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,460
If you have any requests, I'll do it.

104
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,870
D-Don't do it.

105
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,970
I believe that you're Kira.

106
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:40,550
You of course care about your loved ones more than you do the people here, right?

107
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,230
Consider them to be hostages.

108
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,610
Y-You know about her?!

109
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,390
That's right.

110
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,520
I've investigated you.

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,880
I shall kill everyone,

112
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,640
including your family, if you don't do exactly as I say.

113
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,090
You too, of course.

114
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,680
I-I understand.

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,710
What do you want me to do?

116
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,950
You have a computer with you, don't you?

117
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,420
Is there a file on the agents who've come to Japan?

118
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,770
My laptop is for work.
I always carry it around with me.

119
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,080
But those files aren't in it.

120
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,020
Then take this envelope.

121
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,340
First, take out the transceiver

122
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,150
and put on the earphone.

123
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,390
A transceiver...

124
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,610
It's almost like a toy.

125
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,280
But this won't leave a transmission record anywhere

126
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,280
and we can converse at close distances even underground.

127
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
He's thought this out.

128
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,720
Please take the Yamanote Line.

129
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,880
It doesn't matter if you take the inner circle or outer circle.

130
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,010
I shall be observing you from a close distance.

131
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,580
Even when you're on the train, look forward. Keep your eyes focused on one spot.

132
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,220
Don't forget, I can kill at any time.

133
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,500
Once you're on, sit in the corner closest to the door.

134
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,230
If it's taken, wait until it's free.

135
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,920
First, I must ask you something.

136
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,930
If your answer differs significantly from what I expect,

137
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,920
I will kill your girlfriend.

138
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,860
Of the FBI agents who have come to Japan,
how many are there and how are they organized?

139
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,210
Please answer into the transceiver.

140
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,310
I-I've heard it's four teams

141
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,140
and a total of twelve people.

142
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,310
Next, take out what's in the envelope.

143
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,900
Huh?!

144
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,950
What is this?

145
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,570
Of those investigators,

146
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,490
write the name of the agent who is directly in charge of you all

147
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,160
in the space at the top.

148
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,560
What is the meaning of this?

149
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,130
What is he planning?

150
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,620
But I have to do as he says.

151
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,760
He shouldn't be able to kill with just names alone.

152
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,880
Next, open your laptop.

153
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,790
You should be receiving a file from your superior soon.

154
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,270
A file of all the names and faces of the FBI agents who came to Japan.

155
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,810
Wh-What's going on?

156
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,760
Now, like you just did,

157
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,950
take a good look at each agent's face as you write their names on the envelope.

158
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,530
I don't understand it.

159
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,330
What is Kira trying to do?

160
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,580
What is he doing?

161
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,540
Looks like you're finished.

162
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,650
Now put the transceiver and envelope with the names on it

163
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,550
back into their original envelope and put them on the rack.

164
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,550
Now put your hands on your lap and continue riding the train without making a move for about thirty minutes.

165
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,410
When you are sure that nobody has noticed that you have forgotten the envelope,

166
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,310
get off of the train.

167
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,910
Why?

168
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,960
Why can't I remember that voice?

169
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,330
Kira...

170
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,870
Who are you?

171
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,770
Yagami Light...

172
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,230
Farewell, Raye Penber.

173
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,830
Raye Penber was writing those names on pages taken from the Death Note.

174
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,830
He unwittingly killed all of his coworkers.

175
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,840
Penber's directions were to die after sending the file to all of the agents.

176
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,760
The rest of the agents all died of heart attacks after the file was received.

177
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,780
L.

178
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,820
We have a call from the FBI Director.

179
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,090
It's me.

180
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,700
I've just got word from Japan that all of our agents have died.

181
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,580
They all died of heart attacks.

182
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,850
I can only think that Kira killed them.

183
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,710
L, I'm very sorry,

184
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,970
but the FBI will call off our investigation in Japan.

185
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,470
It's from Chief Yagami.

186
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,140
L. I have just talked with the FBI Director.

187
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,220
According to him,

188
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,650
you were investigating everyone here who is involved with the task force.

189
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,390
Yes.

190
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,270
What is the meaning of this?

191
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,150
Do you mean to say that you suspect us?

192
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,720
I decided that it was necessary to learn Kira's identity.

193
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,450
I cannot condone this.

194
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,660
I cannot believe that you

195
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,560
would spy on your comrades.

196
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,580
L, how can we trust you?

197
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,540
Besides that, Kira killed those FBI agents, didn't he?

198
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,970
Even if they're not criminals,
he'll kill anyone who stands in his way!

199
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,330
Kira is really just a murderer!

200
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,430
Another victim has left a message.

201
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,890
L,

202
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,360
do you know? Shinigami...

203
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,990
love apples.

204
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,450
Damn you, Kira!

205
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,250
Raye... died.

206
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,970
No...

207
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,800
He was killed by Kira.

208
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,010
What? A family meeting?

209
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,960
Even if I kept it secret, you'd find out sooner or later.

210
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,730
I'll tell you now.

211
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,440
I am currently in charge of conducting the Kira investigation.

212
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,070
Is that so?

213
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,270
Dad, you sure are amazing.

214
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,680
That isn't what I wanted to say.

215
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,280
Hm?

216
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,610
Yesterday,

217
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,190
twelve FBI agents who were sent to Japan to find Kira

218
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,590
all died.

219
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,540
Does that mean that they were killed by Kira?

220
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,290
What?!

221
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,580
It means that Kira might kill

222
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,550
anyone who tries to catch him.

223
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,160
It's a cold and ruthless crimeâ
the most horrific we've ever seen.

224
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,070
Many of my officers have quit.

225
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,370
D-Dad, you should quit too!

226
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,970
I don't want you to die!

227
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,790
That's right.

228
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,060
You should place your life before your job.

229
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,420
No. I will not remove myself from this case.

230
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,440
I will not yield to evil.

231
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,590
Dad...

232
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,990
Dear...

233
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,160
Dad, that's admirable.

234
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm proud of you.

235
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,460
If something ever happens to you, I'll see to it

236
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,250
that Kira gets executed.

237
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,630
Kira will probably kill all who oppose him,
even if they aren't criminals.

238
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,600
We may be killed by Kira.

239
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,160
Think of your lives, your families, and your friends.

240
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,820
If anyone wants to be dropped from this investigation, please resign.

241
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,110
If you resign, you will not be demoted.

242
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,740
I promise you.

243
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,840
I want those with the confidence to stay on the case to fight Kira,

244
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,170
even if going after him means sacrificing everything.

245
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,870
That is all.

246
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,590
Hey, what are you going to do?

247
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,710
"What" indeed...

248
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,500
Yeah, right, that's him.

249
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,300
I remember him because he said, "Get down."

250
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,050
But I don't really remember the other passengers.

251
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,300
Is that so?

252
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,770
I understand. Thank you very much.

253
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,380
If what I'm thinking is right,

254
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,730
Kira could have been among those passengers.

255
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,990
If so, I can find Kira along the path this bus takes.

256
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,160
Only five people, huh?

257
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,370
Six including myself.

258
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,710
No, I should say as many as five of you are willing to risk your lives.

259
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,550
I trust all of you who have a strong sense of justice.

260
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,470
Wait just a moment.

261
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,560
L says he trusts us,

262
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,560
but we don't trust L.

263
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,420
L,

264
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,480
we have decided to risk our lives to catch Kira.

265
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,820
You should know what we mean by that.

266
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,540
But you never show your face,

267
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,410
and you just boss us around.

268
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,250
We cannot work with someone like that!

269
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,490
L.

270
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,180
If you want to work with us

271
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,610
and catch Kira,

272
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,010
would it be possible for you to come here?

273
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,060
<i>Earlier, I said that I trust you all.</i>

274
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,540
Why does he suddenly want to work with us?

275
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,850
If he's solved numerous difficult cases by himself,

276
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,550
he should do the same this time, too.

277
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,560
And judging by the way that L has been conducting the investigation,

278
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,480
he'll probably send a double to meet us.

279
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,200
A double, huh?

280
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,660
It's possible...

281
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,060
I-I trust L.

282
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,900
I also think we need L's help in this case.

283
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,920
Me too.

284
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,450
L said from the beginning

285
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,470
that he needed the police's help in this case.

286
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,250
Perhaps you could think of it like this.

287
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,750
L was waiting for this to happen.

288
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,960
For what to happen?

289
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,570
There were people in the investigation who distrusted L from the beginning.

290
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,470
Then we had detectives continue to resign

291
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,160
and our confidential information was leaked.

292
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,430
You can't run an investigation unless you trust your partners.

293
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,510
In other words,

294
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,180
L was waiting for the task force to be whittled down to people he can trust

295
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,460
and who will face evil without fear.

296
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,440
Yes.

297
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,070
I'll resign rather than join up with L.

298
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,590
Don't worry.

299
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,700
I won't trail you and try to find L.

300
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,670
I trust L and will try to cooperate with him.

301
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,460
Me too.

302
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,550
I am currently in a room at the Teito Hotel.

303
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,450
I shall be switching hotels from now on every few days.

304
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,560
From now on, I want you to think of these rooms

305
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,790
as the de facto center of the investigation.

306
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,420
If you can agree to these terms,

307
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,860
I want you to split into two groups, separated by a thirty-minute interval,

308
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,360
and come here by twelve o'clock midnight.

309
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,590
Kira...

310
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,160
We're finally at an even distance

311
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,000
from finding each other.

312
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,930
Very well.

313
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,260
I'll make my first appearance in front of people as L.

314
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,020
If you manage to find this out,

315
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,760
you'll definitely close in on me.

316
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,720
Bring it on.

317
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,480
I've worked a lot during these past few days.

318
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,840
Think.

319
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,440
Was there something that I missed?

320
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,570
And what should I do from here?

321
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,530
The real battle starts now, L.

322
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,590
Please come in.

323
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,170
If this woman had spoken to the police before she met me...

324
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,240
It seems that a god other than a Shinigami...

325
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,050
is on my side.
