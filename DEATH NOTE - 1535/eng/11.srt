1
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,080
Next, we have the Misora Naomi case.

2
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,250
Should we go ahead and open a criminal investigation?

3
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,960
We should investigate it separately from the Kira case.

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
We should avoid using photographs and only use police sketches.

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,050
But she's already been missing for four months.

6
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,090
She's probably dead by now.

7
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,860
If she's dead, it's odd that her body hasn't turned up yet.

8
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,930
If it does turn up, we might be able to find a clue.

9
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,820
Ryuzaki.

10
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,850
Take a look at Sakura TV.

11
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,610
Something terrible is happening.

12
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,800
In other words,

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,980
we are all Kira's hostages.

14
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,450
It is also our duty as news broadcasters to give you this announcement.

15
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,780
Please understand that this is not a hoax

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,700
and that we are not airing
these tapes solely for sensationalism.

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,620
Kira's hostages?

18
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,580
What is this?

19
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,540
Four days ago, our program director was sent these four tapes.

20
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,090
Beyond a shadow of a doubt,

21
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,170
they are from Kira.

22
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,260
Our ratings could go up sixty—no, seventy percent.

23
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,100
The first tape predicted the time of death of two suspected felons, yesterday.

24
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,110
As predicted, they died yesterday of heart attacks.

25
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,110
If this is true, it really is<i> something that only Kira could do.</i>

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,250
And Kira has instructed us to air
these two tapes today at exactly 5:59 p.m.

27
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,550
To prove that he is Kira, one tape predicts the killings,

28
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,670
and the other sends a message to the people of the world.

29
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,670
I-It's probably just another fake documentary, isn't it?

30
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,050
It couldn't be.
Who would make such a vicious fake?

31
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,260
Now, take a look.

32
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,810
I am Kira.

33
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,860
If this video was aired on April 18th, at exactly 5:59 p.m.,

34
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,960
the time now is 5:59:47...

35
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,400
48... 49.

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,910
Please change the channel to Taiyo TV.

37
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,710
The anchor, Hibima Kazuhiko,

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,880
will die of a heart attack at exactly six o'clock.

39
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,710
Wh-Whoa!

40
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,420
Change it!

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,930
It can't be!

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,730
How could he?!

43
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,510
Change the channel back.

44
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,260
Hibima continued to insist on the air that Kira is evil.

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,020
Bring one — no, two TVs here.

46
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,310
This is his punishment.
Understood.

47
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,660
There shall be another victim.

48
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,610
The target

49
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,650
is an NHN TV commentator
who has continued to condemn me

50
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,150
and is to appear live.

51
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,740
Kumaizumi Seiji.

52
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,110
Ryuzaki!

53
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,700
Change it to channel 24!

54
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,380
Change it back.

55
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,750
I trust you now believe that I'm Kira.

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,340
Kira said that he was going to send
a message to the people of the world.

57
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,920
Something terrible will happen if we don't stop this broadcast!

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,550
Get Sakura TV on the line!

59
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,470
It's no good.

60
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,220
No one I know at the station has their cell phones on.

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,640
The lines at the station are all busy!

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
Damn!

63
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,650
Ukita!

64
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,820
I'll go to the station and stop this at the source!

65
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,780
Everyone, please listen to me.

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,740
I don't want to kill the innocent.

67
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,950
I hate evil, and I love justice.

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,540
I consider the police as allies,

69
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,660
not as my enemies.

70
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,500
Damn you, Kira.

71
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,920
My intention is to create a world without evil.

72
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,350
If everyone cooperates, this will be simple.

73
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,850
If no one tries to catch me, the innocent will not die.

74
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,510
Damn!

75
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,890
Even if you don't agree with me,

76
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,200
keep your sentiments to yourself.
As long as you do not broadcast them, I won't kill you.

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,570
Please be patient.

78
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,530
I will create a better world for everyone.

79
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,860
I will change this tainted world

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,820
into a new one in which only kind people live.

81
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,830
Imagine it.

82
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,000
Together, the police and I will create...

83
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,090
Sachiko...

84
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,880
Dear, you'll ruin your health.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,300
Please rest.

86
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,270
Sachiko,

87
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,810
I am the head of the Kira task force.

88
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,820
Damn! It's locked!

89
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,910
This is the police!

90
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,590
Open up!

91
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,870
You moron!

92
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,920
We interrupt this scheduled program

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
Hello?!

94
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,940
Damn, I'm not getting through!
We interrupt this scheduled program

95
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:01,950
to bring you live footage from the front of the Sakura TV studio.

96
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,140
Damn, I'm not getting through!

97
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,500
to bring you live footage from the front of the Sakura TV studio.

98
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,610
M-Mr. Aizawa!

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Take a look!

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,700
Someone has collapsed!

101
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,200
We're in front of the Sakura TV studio!

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,470
U-Ukita!

103
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,670
D-Dammit!

104
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,920
It's Kira, isn't it?!

105
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,380
Mr. Aizawa.

106
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,920
Where are you going?

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,260
Where Ukita is, of course!

108
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,720
That wouldn't be good.

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,350
Please think about this calmly.

110
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,430
Are you telling me that we should just quietly watch TV here?!

111
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,270
If this is Kira's doing,

112
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,440
you'll just meet the same fate.

113
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,310
Kira shouldn't be able to kill without a name!

114
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,070
So how could this happen?!

115
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,070
Our aliases and fake police IDs are pointless!

116
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,160
You don't think Kira already knows our names?

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,580
That may be so.

118
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,170
If that's the case, it would be a lot easier to kill off all those who are investigating him before making a move.

119
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,590
I deduced that he needed a face and a name to kill.

120
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,770
But from what I just saw,

121
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,970
it's not entirely impossible
that he may only need a face to kill.

122
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,970
All I can say is that

123
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,180
Kira is within that television station

124
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,730
or is in a place where he can watch who enters the buildin—

125
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,060
If Kira is in that area,

126
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,310
isn't that more of a reason to go?!

127
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,110
He may have only placed surveillance cameras in the area.

128
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,110
If we go there unprepared,

129
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,030
we're as good as dead.

130
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,830
You said that you were risking your life to catch Kira, didn't you?!

131
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,990
Risking my life

132
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,000
and having a death wish are worlds apart.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,460
What?!

134
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,550
Please control yourself.

135
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,770
Mr. Ukita was killed.

136
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,930
If something were to happen to you as well...

137
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,640
I want the police to tell me

138
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,270
whether or not they will help me create a new world.

139
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,650
Please make an announcement
on the six-o'clock news in four days.

140
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,610
I have prepared a video

141
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,320
for whichever answer you choose.

142
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,060
Wh-What the hell is this?!

143
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,270
Hey!

144
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,680
What do you think you're doing?!

145
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,320
Where is the studio that's airing the Kira video?!

146
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,820
This just in!

147
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,530
A vehicle has just crashed into the Sakura TV studio!

148
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,870
That's one way to get into the building without being seen.

149
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,950
But who would...

150
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,830
This is the police!

151
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,620
Stop this program!

152
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,710
Wh-What's going on?!

153
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,170
Stop the Kira tape right now!

154
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,710
W-Wait a second, Detective!

155
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,340
If we stop this, we'll be killed by Kira.

156
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,310
Shut up!

157
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,390
If you hand them over, you won't be killed <i>now</i>!

158
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,890
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!

159
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,970
Are you out of your mind?!

160
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,030
All of this is happening because you're treating Kira like some kind of celebrity.

161
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,910
Don't you think it serves you right?

162
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,330
Hand over all of the copies of your tapes!

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,290
Don't try anything funny!

164
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,790
I-I got it!

165
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,250
I'll hand 'em over!
So please stop waving that gun around!

166
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,090
You've got a crazy look in your eyes!

167
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,420
At last, police cars have arrived

168
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,790
in front of the Sakura TV building!

169
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,490
We aren't alone in this.

170
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,210
There are still people within the police
who will stand up against Kira.

171
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,940
Mr. Aizawa.

172
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,440
You know Deputy Director Kitamura's cell phone number, don't you?

173
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,380
Aizawa, I told you not to call me.

174
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,280
This is L.

175
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,280
I want you to do something for me.

176
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,410
Watch the news. You will see the police officers who are fighting hard to bring Kira to justice.

177
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,540
If you don't take control of them as their superior,
we'll have a tragedy on our hands.

178
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,330
But we are to stay out of this case.

179
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,490
Two of the police officers who rushed forward have collapsed!

180
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,080
W-We're going to retreat!

181
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,050
I understand, L.

182
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,100
Please advise me on how I should lead them.

183
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,900
It's from Detective Superintendent Yagami.

184
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,270
Call him back, and give the phone to me.

185
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,780
Quickly, get me Ryuzaki!

186
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,050
It's me.

187
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,390
Mr. Yagami, so that <i>was</i> you in that police van.

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,760
Yeah, I just couldn't take it anymore.

189
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,700
I've confiscated all the tapes.

190
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,040
I'll bring them to you.

191
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,500
How are you doing?

192
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,480
I'm more than fine.

193
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,500
I've never felt better.

194
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,260
So what should I do?

195
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,440
I think exiting out the front would be dangerous,

196
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
but maybe I'll be all right in that van.

197
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,030
Wait just a moment.

198
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,320
Deputy Director Kitamura,

199
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,770
Chief Yagami is the one who crashed into the building.

200
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,570
Are you prepared?

201
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,190
As you requested.

202
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,120
Mr. Yagami, wait five minutes,

203
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,980
and then use the front entrance.

204
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,900
Use the front entrance?

205
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,100
Listen up! Don't leave any gaps!

206
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,390
Conceal yourselves!

207
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,600
Kira is not in the television station.

208
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,610
He's outside!

209
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,580
Thank you.

210
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,210
I'll drive myself.

211
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,490
I understand.

212
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,590
Listen up!

213
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,680
There is a good chance that Kira is in the area!

214
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,600
Be sure to remain hidden while you're searching the place carefully!

215
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,850
The police have

216
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,520
turned down Kira's calls
and have shown that they are ready to fight!

217
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,940
I will gather up the courage to say this:

218
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
This is right!

219
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,450
This is the right thing to do!

220
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,450
This is the right stance that a country under rule of law should take!

221
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,200
My name is Tanakabara Koki.

222
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,440
This has been NHN's Golden News anchor,

223
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,310
Tanakabara Koki!

224
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,590
Chief!

225
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,840
Chief Yagami!

226
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,390
Ryuzaki,

227
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm sorry for acting on my own.

228
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,720
My emotions had clouded my judgment.

229
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,900
Not at all.

230
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,010
The tapes and envelopes that Kira sent are all in here.

231
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,850
Thank you very much.

232
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,570
P-Please allow me to rest for a moment.

233
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,900
Mr. Yagami...

234
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,080
This won't be in vain.

235
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,410
The postmark is from Osaka.

236
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,480
But Kira can control his victims before they die.

237
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,720
He could've had it delivered
from Osaka without going there himself.

238
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,670
Mr. Aizawa.

239
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,450
Could you take this to the lab?

240
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,490
I have a lot of contacts in the lab.

241
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,320
I'll be sure to check this out thoroughly.

242
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Please do.

243
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,260
I shall check the contents of the duplicate tapes.

244
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,690
Ryuzaki, what's on them?

245
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,650
They're very interesting tapes.

246
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,360
If the police had said yes and cooperated with Kira,

247
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,220
tape number three was to be aired.

248
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,280
Otherwise, number four was to be aired.

249
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,200
Tape three details the conditions for cooperation.

250
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,900
Basically, to broadcast more criminals.

251
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,410
Especially those who had hurt people,

252
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,120
or criminals who had abused those weaker than they are,
regardless of how severe their crimes were.

253
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,170
And Kira would be the judge, jury, and executioner in all of this.

254
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,380
Furthermore, as proof that the police are cooperating,

255
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,470
he said that he wanted the top brass from the NPA and L

256
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,140
to appear on TV and announce that they will cooperate with him.

257
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,510
In other words, have the top brass and me show our faces

258
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,840
so that if we raise any suspicion,

259
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,360
he can kill us.

260
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,570
What if we had answered no?

261
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,870
Basically the same thing, just expressed differently.

262
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,950
Mr. Yagami, our answer is no, of course.

263
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,670
Please allow Sakura TV to air the fourth video.

264
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,170
I think it is unfortunate that your answer is no.

265
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,930
The police have answered that they still wish to fight me.

266
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,180
So I will first take the life of the director general of the NPA.

267
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,550
Or, I may take the life of L,

268
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,440
who is leading the investigation.

269
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,280
The director general or L.

270
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,540
Whom will you hand out as a sacrificial lamb for not cooperating to create a peaceful world?

271
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,380
Please decide in four days.

272
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,240
God really <i>is</i> on my side.

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,090
Only this time, it's not really God,

274
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,570
but a Shinigami — a God of Death.

275
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,090
So it seems.

276
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,010
Another Shinigami has come to the human world.

277
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,350
And another Shinigami's Death Note

278
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,310
has fallen into the hands of someone who agrees with Kira.

279
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,850
This guy probably also has the Shinigami eyes.

280
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,110
Which means this Kira's killing abilities are far greater than mine.

281
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,110
If I leave things the way they are,

282
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,700
L might be finished off within the next four days.

283
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,200
However,

284
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,160
I can't forgive the impostor for dragging down
Kira's image with these dirty tactics.

285
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,790
If the impostor slips up and is caught,

286
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,890
the existence of the Death Note could be discovered.

287
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,550
I can't let him run wild for too long.

288
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,180
What I need most now

289
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,680
is to cooperate with the investigation

290
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,850
and to figure out both L's <i>and</i> the Fake Kira's moves.

291
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,680
Ryuzaki,

292
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,190
it's as you thought.

293
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,360
Leaders of several countries have convened

294
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,780
and they want the real L to appear on TV.

295
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,910
That would be the most right and reasonable choice.

296
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,860
Well, we still have three days,

297
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,130
so let's think of a measure to prevent all that.

298
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,040
It would annoy me

299
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,200
if I were killed by someone
who had jumped on Kira's bandwagon.

300
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,710
Huh?!

301
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,800
What do you mean, Ryuzaki?

302
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,800
There is a high possibility that this Kira is a fake.

303
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,060
No,

304
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,310
we should call him the Second Kira.

305
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,190
The Second Kira?!

306
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,070
Why do you think there is a second Kira?

307
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,070
Please explain it to us.

308
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,930
First of all, there are the predicted victims.

309
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,070
They were used to convince
the TV station employees that he's Kira.

310
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,080
Those two victims were featured only
in women's magazines and on daytime talk shows.

311
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,790
The real Kira has no need to prove himself
with such insignificant people.

312
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,920
But in the Second Kira's view,

313
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,840
he couldn't use a criminal that
the real Kira might kill before his prediction.

314
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,390
Hmm... Ryuzaki.

315
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,850
What are the chances that there is a second Kira?

316
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,010
This time it's more than a seventy-percent chance.

317
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,820
I don't like the way he does things.

318
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,220
It's not like Kira.

319
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,610
It's not like Kira?

320
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,740
Kira has always avoided innocent victims,

321
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,830
aside from those who have tried to catch him.

322
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,980
If we catch one Kira,

323
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,110
I think we'll get a hint as to how we can catch the other.

324
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
Mr. Yagami.

325
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,300
May I ask your son to cooperate in this investigation?

326
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,550
Does that mean he's no longer a suspect?

327
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,220
No, I can't say that he's been cleared,

328
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,850
but I could use his deductive skills.

329
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,060
So that's what it means.

330
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,840
If my son wants to cooperate with you,
I have no reason to stop you.

331
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,320
Thank you. However,

332
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,320
please keep it a secret that this current Kira might be a fake.

333
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,140
Please make it seem as if we're chasing the same Kira.

334
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,170
Hey, Misa,

335
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,960
I gave you a Death Note,

336
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,120
so why don't you use it more for yourself?

337
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,290
I <i>am</i> using it for myself.

338
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,820
I believe in what Kira is doing.

339
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,640
I want to know what kind of person Kira is.

340
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,170
I want to meet and talk to him.

341
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,850
I sent those videos to the television station especially for that.

342
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,650
I made sure Kira would take notice.

343
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,710
I bet that got Kira's attention.

344
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm sure of it.

345
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,990
That's a dangerous game.

346
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,700
You might be killed.
Do you realize this?

347
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,010
It's all right.

348
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm sure that Kira is kind to those with pure hearts.

349
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,170
In any case,

350
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,710
I'm stronger because I have the eyes!

351
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,500
I need to find out about the Fake Kira

352
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,680
before anyone else at task force headquarters does.

353
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,280
What kind of person are you,

354
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,340
Fake Kira?
