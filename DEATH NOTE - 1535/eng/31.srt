1
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,150
The current Kira is foolish,

2
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,070
and his exchange with the
Japanese task force was far too convenient.

3
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,700
Kira is probably conspiring with the Japanese task force.

4
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,820
Conspiring?

5
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,280
If that's the case, then Kira is...

6
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,160
the Second L.

7
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,450
To the members of the Japanese Task force:

8
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,170
was there ever a time that you thought your Second L was Kira?

9
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,340
Near...

10
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,460
I have to kill him!

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,220
Big trouble!
Demegawa's on TV and...

12
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,180
I, Demegawa, along with my comrades, have finally

13
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,140
pinpointed the location of and surrounded the hideout
of the evil organization that is trying to catch our god, Kira.

14
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,590
Fellow Kira followers!
Do not rush in all at once.

15
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,090
The traitors may hide among you to escape.

16
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,640
I am Kira's voice.

17
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,100
Follow me and we will place them
in front of the cameras, and offer them to Kira!

18
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm not going to miss them!

19
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,740
Near, you have to get out of there.

20
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,660
You have some nerve, saying that as Kira.

21
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,830
You're still saying that?

22
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,700
There are other organizations that are chasing Kira.

23
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,460
We get attacked as soon as I begin to suspect you.

24
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,840
The timing is too convenient.

25
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,140
Near, you've made some kind of mistake and are making too many assumptions.

26
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,970
Members of the task force:

27
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,390
Kira is probably among you.

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,090
Think carefully.

29
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,010
Light is Kira...

30
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,970
My suspicions are getting stronger again.

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,410
The previous L also thought that Light was Kira.

32
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,000
The first wave of twenty people will break the door and get inside! The second wave will stand by!

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Get out of the way, dumbass!
We're the first wave!

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,090
What?! We're going first!

35
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,990
Near, we have to get away immediately.

36
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,290
Really, what stupid people.

37
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,510
I don't think it's strange that there are people who follow Kira.

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,950
They are people who hope
that Kira will bring justice to evildoers.

39
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,210
The people who are barging in here are different.

40
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,410
They really are stupid people.

41
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,040
Selfish people... who only want to have some fun.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,070
I-I know that, but right now...

43
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,930
Let's use L's fortune and the anti-Kira people we hired.

44
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,350
But if we carry out that plan once...

45
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,510
Let's do it.
We should be prepared already.

46
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,510
It should be interesting.

47
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,100
M-Mo...

48
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,580
It's money!

49
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,130
I-It's money!

50
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,550
Money?

51
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,760
Wow! There's so much!

52
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,050
Amazing...

53
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,620
I wish I were there.

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,460
Matsuda...

55
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,140
Jeez. Humans sure are interesting.

56
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,520
Well, that can buy apples, so I kind of understand.

57
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,170
I grabbed these first!

58
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,290
Cut it out!
I grabbed these first!

59
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,020
Out of the way!

60
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,280
Damn. Curse you, Near!

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,480
He plans to escape in this chaos!

62
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,900
But then he'll be caught on Demegawa's cameras...

63
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,330
P-Pilot! Go to the floor where the money is coming from!

64
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,110
Jeez! What is Deme doing?!

65
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,790
You can't buy love and peace with money!

66
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,380
A large flurry of money
is causing a panic in Lower Manhattan.

67
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,970
It's the police!

68
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,470
The police?!

69
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,550
As expected when faced with this chaos,
the police were called in.

70
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,890
This is bad... At this rate...

71
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,600
Let's go.

72
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
Right now, we can just walk out the entrance.

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,320
As expected, the police have to take action in a riot like this.

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,370
Damn... They were prepared for something like this.

75
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,700
They plan to come out among the police!

76
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,160
Telling Aizawa and the others
to watch over the police is like saying that I'm Kira!

77
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,870
The police have come out from the building.

78
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,000
Where is he?!

79
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,130
He should be among them...

80
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,490
Where?!

81
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,600
Dammit...

82
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,810
I wonder how much money that was...

83
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,710
Matsuda...

84
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,260
It was probably about ten million dollars...

85
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,720
How many apples is that?

86
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,100
Near!

87
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,770
Near?!

88
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,730
This is Near.

89
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,910
We've reestablished a connection, so I decided I should give you a call.

90
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,710
Near, you're safe.

91
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,670
Members of the task force:

92
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,920
I think it's about time that you have some certainty about who Kira is.

93
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,050
We were attacked at such a convenient time.

94
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,580
It's like saying that Kira is
in the Japanese task force headquarters.

95
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,890
With this in mind, you're no smarter than a preschooler
if you aren't suspicious of the Second L.

96
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,880
The number I gave the day before is working again,

97
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
so call any time you like.

98
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,810
Well, then... I'll be waiting.

99
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,400
He's pretty bold to be <i>that</i> sure of himself.

100
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,990
Everyone...

101
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,080
Help Near if you want to.

102
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm not satisfied with this situation.

103
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Ideally, we should cooperate with the SPK.

104
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,760
Near sure is tripping us up, isn't he?

105
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,280
When I think about Deputy Director Yagami,
I don't want to suspect Light.

106
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,190
But...

107
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,510
Dad?

108
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,640
Welcome back.
So you're home today.

109
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah... You're still awake?

110
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,240
I have tests coming up.

111
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,220
I see.

112
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,440
Don't push yourself too hard.

113
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,260
Okay.

114
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,510
You too.

115
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,060
It's not unusual for someone to want to contact Near.

116
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,620
The problem is after that.

117
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,130
If I'm late to act, something
I may not be able to fix may happen...

118
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,050
I'm left with no other choice!

119
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,930
It's an emergency order from Light.

120
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,270
Um... number three...

121
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,400
Huh?

122
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,650
No way...

123
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,380
Yes, this is Near.

124
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,740
This is Aizawa of the Japanese task force.

125
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,090
The time has finally come...

126
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,100
In order to keep me safe
and for me to become a normal wife...

127
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,290
This is what Light wants for me!

128
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,150
He wants me to be happy just as a woman should be.

129
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,060
Light, thank you!

130
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,800
I see. How fascinating.

131
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,730
So that L was detained for more than fifty days,

132
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,580
and there were two suspects
who were cleared due to the thirteen-day rule.

133
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
Of course, that alone doesn't mean that they're Kira.

134
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,650
So L just simply released them?

135
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,170
No, L had Deputy Director Yagami, who was Bureau Chief at the time,

136
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,670
put on an act.

137
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,370
He said that they both had been found
to be Kira and the Second Kira,

138
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,800
and were being taken to their execution.

139
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,810
Then the Deputy Director

140
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,120
pointed a gun at the suspects and said that he would kill Kira and then kill himself.

141
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,660
We rationalized if they were Kira,
they would kill the Deputy Director if pressed that far.

142
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,830
Kira is quite impressive.

143
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,830
He used his detainment to demonstrate his innocence.

144
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,900
Did the suspect volunteer himself to be detained?

145
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,010
Come to think of it, Light did<i> volunteer to be detained.</i>

146
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,010
If he did, then it's already decided.

147
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,020
So who is it?
Who were those two suspects?

148
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,560
I can't tell you that much.

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,780
I'm still a member of the Japanese task force
and am working under L.

150
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,530
I understand.

151
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,600
Thank you very much for your valuable information.

152
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,530
Especially the part about the Shinigami eyes that enable people to see other's names.

153
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,160
It will be helpful. Goodbye.

154
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,420
Is it all right, Near?
Shouldn't you have pressed a little more?

155
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,440
I think that his cooperation with us is fine at this rate.

156
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
Also, I discovered something very important.

157
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,390
Deputy Director Yagami and the person
who is suspected of being Kira are parent and child.

158
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,490
That's the only thing it could be.

159
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,980
It's the only reason he would say
that he would kill Kira and then kill himself.

160
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,240
Therefore,

161
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,870
the Second L, and the one whom I think is Kira, is...

162
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,870
Yagami Light.

163
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,630
Light.

164
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,130
Yes?

165
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,240
I'll tell you truthfully.
I contacted Near.

166
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,060
Don't worry about it.

167
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,060
I recommended it.
So what did you say?

168
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,070
No, I won't ask.
It was strange of me to ask about that.

169
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,780
I want to believe that you're not Kira.

170
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,660
Sorry for doing this again,

171
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,790
but I want to observe you until we catch Kira.

172
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,130
And Amane Misa as well.

173
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm going to check your home right now.

174
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,070
There's a possibility that Amane has a notebook.

175
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,910
Hold on, Mr. Aizawa!

176
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,850
No, go right ahead.
You can prove to everyone

177
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,350
that I'm not sneaking around and contacting Misa.

178
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,060
Mogi...

179
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,830
I also want to make sure.

180
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,420
It would be best if Light weren't Kira,

181
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,420
but if Amane has any evidence linking her to Kira...

182
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,420
<i>If so...</i>

183
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,700
Oh! Mochi and Monchichi!

184
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,540
It's been a while.

185
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,710
Light hasn't come back because of the Kira investigation, so I've been so bored.

186
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,340
<i>It's impossible for her to have the notebook
on her while dressed like that...</i>

187
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,290
Misa, we were just told that there were explosives planted in L's home.

188
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,350
We think it's a prank,
but we'd still like to check the place out.

189
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,640
What?! Is Light okay?
I have to call him.

190
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,290
You can't.

191
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,680
Why not?

192
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,520
Light is all right.

193
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,860
There's something he has to do right now,

194
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,070
so he handed the investigation to us.

195
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,570
I-I guess so. Light loves me very much,
so he'd worry about me if he heard my voice.

196
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,910
Search as much as you like, Aizawa.

197
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,790
You won't find the notebook.

198
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't want all this to ruin the mood we have here.

199
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,520
We're not a club.
You and Mogi should do as you see fit.

200
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,860
Oh, it's time for <i>Kira's Kingdom</i>.

201
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,460
Hello, Kira supporters.

202
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,280
I am Demegawa, Kira's voice.

203
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,620
Take a look.
Kira's Kingdom shares its name with this program.

204
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,140
Its construction is going smoothly with your support.

205
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,740
When it is completed, let's welcome Kira here!

206
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,640
Boy, that's in such bad taste...

207
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,600
Say, is everything all right?

208
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,380
Yeah, it must have been a prank.

209
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,920
But just in case, one of us is going to stay here to keep watch over you for the next few days.

210
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,840
Okay. Thank you.

211
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,490
Mogi, you can go back to headquarters.

212
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,600
I'll stay.

213
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,410
Huh? Why Monchichi instead of Mochi?

214
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,290
Don't you trust me?

215
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,980
That's not it. You're just not Monchichi
since you changed your haircut. It's not cute.

216
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,940
Mogi!

217
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,890
Yes. Sorry!

218
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,550
You stay here.

219
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,050
We have received over a million yen in donations

220
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,140
towards the completion of Kira's Kingdom!

221
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,740
It looks like a scam...

222
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,020
Yeah. It's no different from any other suspicious group.

223
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,770
It doesn't seem like Kira...

224
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,030
Demegawa... he's doing things on his own...

225
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,990
People will begin to drift away from Kira if he does this.

226
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,530
I no longer need Demegawa, but...

227
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,740
Oh, welcome back.

228
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,000
We didn't find a notebook in Light and Misa's home.

229
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,990
But...

230
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,830
I understand.

231
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,930
Keep watch over us until you're satisfied.

232
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,260
<i>And now,</i>

233
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,520
<i>I shall introduce the Kira's Kingdom leaders whom I have chosen.</i>

234
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
The first one is...

235
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,580
Delete.

236
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,740
With Kira, we will...

237
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:12,790
Delete.

238
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,430
Please save me!

239
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,020
Delete.

240
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,370
Wh-What is this?

241
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,720
Why would Kira kill his supporters?

242
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,790
Do you suppose that he wanted
to stop them from going overboard?

243
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
That might be so.

244
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,800
But this is horrible.

245
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,820
What's the meaning of this?

246
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,140
There was no chance for Amane Misa,
or Light, to use the notebook.

247
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:13,150
Mikami... I can definitely use him!
It seems I chose correctly.

248
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,740
He knows Kira's beliefs, ideals,
and what Kira does and doesn't want.

249
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,650
He takes action without orders.

250
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,050
I made Misa relinquish ownership of the Death Note.

251
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,180
Misa has lost all memory of the Death Note,

252
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,750
and I've sent the Death Note to someone else.

253
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,960
Right now, she cannot answer any questions about it.

254
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,750
She's merely a plain woman.

255
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,130
The question is...

256
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,630
the next owner.
The question is...

257
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,960
the next owner.

258
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,520
He talked to Kira through the television.

259
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,460
He worships Kira from the bottom of his heart,

260
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,600
and he understands that by accepting the notebook, he was chosen.

261
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,010
There was nothing wrong with my selection.

262
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,450
Mikami Teru...

263
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,150
He's worthy of becoming Kira's right hand.

264
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,950
Shinigami, thank you for coming.

265
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,170
Now I can punish evildoers with death.

266
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,210
God.

267
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,770
You are a woman whom the whole world pays attention to.

268
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,620
It must be fate for us to meet again like this.

269
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,290
I just want you to meet me and listen to what I have to say.

270
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,760
Somewhere... alone.
