1
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,830
I relinquish ownership of this notebook.

2
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,290
Take care of Misa.

3
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,190
Mister Stalker...

4
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,120
Hey, Mister Stalker, where are you?

5
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,400
Let's stop playing this game...

6
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,150
Stalker? What does this mean?

7
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,240
Her attitude completely changed all of a sudden.

8
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,690
Just as I expected.

9
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,410
As long as I have Ryuk's notebook, even if I throw away Rem's notebook,

10
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,670
my memory of Rem doesn't disappear.

11
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,830
But, Rem,

12
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,990
all of this is happening to me because you brought
another notebook to the Human World.

13
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,940
You really sure about this, Light?

14
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,820
Yeah.

15
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,560
I never thought that the notebook I gave you

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,980
would end up buried in the ground.

17
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,650
Listen, Ryuk,

18
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm just hiding it in the ground.

19
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,990
I won't get rid of it

20
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,370
until the next time I say, "Get rid of it."

21
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,050
When I say it, regardless of the context it's in,

22
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,100
it means, "I want to get rid of the notebook."

23
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,710
Got it.

24
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,210
Mister Stalker, this is illegal. Stop it.

25
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,540
Please, Mister Stalker!

26
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,550
She's been acting like this ever since
she passed out and regained consciousness.

27
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,600
Honestly. Does she think she can play dumb like this?

28
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Okay, I know.

29
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,250
Could you at least take off my blindfold?

30
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,560
I really want to see what you look like!

31
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,840
Mr. Matsuda, give Mr. Mogi a call.

32
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,600
Huh?

33
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,320
Oh...

34
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,320
Here.

35
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,660
Mr. Mogi, when you apprehended Amane Misa,

36
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,240
you told her that we suspect she's the Second Kira, didn't you?

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,750
Yes. I did as you told me.

38
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,090
I covered her eyes and mouth from behind and told her,

39
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,420
"You're going to come with me
on suspicion of being the Second Kira."

40
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,130
She didn't seem to be struggling even when I put handcuffs and the eye mask on her.

41
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,720
She seemed to have given up.

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,450
I'll give you an autograph or shake your hand.

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,100
That's it!
I'll give you a kiss on the cheek!

44
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,440
Please! I won't run away!

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,690
We'd made so much progress with her.

46
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,440
Why is she suddenly talking about a stalker?

47
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,310
Amane Misa.

48
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,620
What, Mister Stalker?
Are you planning to release me?

49
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,050
You were quiet before you fell asleep.

50
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,790
You asked us to kill you.
Are you trying to give us trouble now?

51
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,280
What are you talking about?

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,090
You're the one who knocked me out and brought me here, aren't you?

53
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,180
So what?
Do you want to "investigate me" or something like that?

54
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,060
Do you know why I'm detaining you here?

55
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,230
Why? Because I'm an idol?

56
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,520
You're the first stalker who's ever gone this far.

57
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,150
Hey! Amane, quit wasting our time!

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,390
I'm afraid!
What is this?

59
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,530
I can't stand it anymore!
Let me go! Let me go!

60
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,950
Oh yeah...
I have to go to the restroom again.

61
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,120
I need to go to the restroom!

62
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,460
It's been only four minutes since you last went.
Please hold it in.

63
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,310
What's with that?!
That's the only way you'll untie me!

64
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,720
You can watch me pee again.
Isn't it fun? You pervert!

65
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,930
I'm... a pervert?

66
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,970
Amane, let's seriously talk more about what happened before you went to sleep.

67
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,190
Do you know Yagami Light?
Why did you approach him?

68
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,150
Huh? There's no way I wouldn't know my own boyfriend...

69
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,050
She was so tight-lipped about it earlier,

70
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,210
but now she nonchalantly says that he's her boyfriend?

71
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,870
What's going on?

72
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,960
It's from Light.

73
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,880
Turn off the visuals and sound.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,520
Yes.

75
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,970
Yes... Yes, I understand.

76
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,810
We're in the K., room 2801.

77
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,220
My son's coming here?

78
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,360
Ryuzaki, I told you over the phone,

79
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,070
but I think I may be Kira.

80
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,830
Th-That's impossible!
What are you talking about, Light?!

81
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,620
What's wrong?!
Tell me!

82
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,940
There's no proof that Yagami Light is Kira,

83
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,250
but for him to say that he may be Kira?

84
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,340
It's an act.

85
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,370
It's not that you may<i> be Kira, but that you </i>are<i> Kira.</i>

86
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,640
What in the world are you trying to do?

87
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,380
Dad, if Ryuzaki is L,

88
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,220
I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that he's the world's best detective.

89
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,430
L has decided that I am Kira.

90
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,660
Therefore, I must be Kira.

91
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,650
Wh-What are you talking about, Light?!

92
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,610
I'm the one whom Raye Penber, the FBI agent, was investigating in Japan when he died.

93
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,030
I'm the one who went to Aoyama on May 22nd.

94
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,790
Also, I'm the first person
whom the alleged Second Kira, Misa,

95
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,620
approached in the Kanto region.

96
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,710
It's all me.

97
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,300
If I were in L's shoes, even I would say that I'm Kira.

98
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,000
See... I may be Kira.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,030
I just might not know it.

100
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,350
Light...

101
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,180
<i>I see.
You aren't conscious of it, huh?</i>

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm not sure of anything anymore...

103
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,190
Even if I have no memory,

104
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,740
there could be another me who's killing people as I sleep.

105
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,990
That's impossible.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,830
What do you mean, Ryuzaki?

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,580
Actually, there was a time when I put surveillance cameras
in your room for five consecutive days.

108
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,330
Cameras?

109
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,750
Yes. You slept normally at night.

110
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,980
Broadcasted criminals whom you didn't know about were dying.

111
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,000
But I decided that, even if you were Kira,

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,230
you wouldn't give yourself away on camera.

113
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,850
I won't give myself away, huh?

114
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,770
That may be true.

115
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:33,710
Well, up to a certain point,
I believe that some major criminals should die.

116
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,450
I think that anyone who has
such thoughts could become Kira.

117
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,870
Light! I believe the same thing!

118
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,680
I've thought it would be better if quite a few people were dead.

119
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,880
But, even so, we can't really kill people, right?

120
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,050
Besides, criminals were dying
while you had no knowledge of them.

121
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,800
The surveillance cameras proved that!

122
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,300
N-No...

123
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,560
We were short of investigators then
and we only watched him when he was at home.

124
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,230
It's also not as if we were watching him
every hour during those five days.

125
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,230
There may have been a way for him
to kill while he wasn't at home.

126
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,560
Did you purposefully come out
in order for this to happen, Yagami Light?

127
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,060
But if we restrain you for a long period like Amane,

128
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,580
and criminals who appear
before the public still continue to die,

129
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,420
Yagami Light is no longer Kira at that point?

130
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,380
Is this what you're trying to do?

131
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,140
I kind of dislike the direction
this conversation is heading in, but...

132
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,600
Fine.

133
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,360
Fully restrain Yagami Light and confine him in a cell.

134
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,860
Wh-What are you...?!

135
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,650
Y-You're going to detain Light?

136
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,250
We should do this now.

137
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,600
You won't be able to go anywhere where my eyes can't see you.

138
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,540
Th-This is crazy!
There's no way that my son is Kira!

139
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,340
My son wouldn't...

140
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,900
It's fine, Dad.

141
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,960
Light...

142
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,380
I can't help you catch Kira

143
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,980
if I keep worrying that I may be your man.

144
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,720
In exchange,

145
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,960
until you decide that I'm not Kira or you agree that I'm not Kira,

146
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,150
don't let me free no matter what I say
or whatever condition I'm in.

147
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,300
Understood.

148
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,420
Mr. Yagami, could you come up with an excuse
for Light's absence for your family?

149
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,320
No, please do it now.

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,100
I-I'm not too sure I can on such short notice...

151
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,630
But why does my son have to be thrown into a prison?!

152
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,290
You're being stubborn, Dad.

153
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,250
I can't be fully satisfied with myself unless I do this.

154
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,500
Are you serious, Light?

155
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,490
Yeah. By taking away my freedom,

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,760
I'll be able to defeat the fear of Kira that lies within me.

157
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,900
Mr. Aizawa, please take care of this.

158
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,850
As you wish.

159
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,960
All that's left is to get rid the notebook.

160
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,090
Does this mean I won't be able to eat apples again?

161
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,410
Ryuzaki...

162
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,130
Please remove me from the investigation.

163
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,400
Chief!

164
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,200
We're holding my son as a suspect in this case...

165
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,820
I shouldn't be here.

166
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,780
Regardless of whether we should investigate him,
when we were talking about confining him,

167
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,830
I let my personal feelings get in the way.

168
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,830
That's true.
Personal feelings shouldn't be involved.

169
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,140
A-And if my son really <i>is</i> Kira...

170
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,590
I don't know what kind of actions I may take.

171
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:30,310
Yes. I can imagine that you
p would kill your son and then kill yourself.

172
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,270
I agree that we shouldn't have you here.

173
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,650
Ryuzaki!

174
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,610
Could you confine me as well?

175
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,610
I'm calm now,

176
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,990
but I don't know what I'll do when my feelings for my son...

177
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,720
I thought you might say something like that,

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,980
so I had Watari make arrangements.

179
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,000
However, even though I'm confining you,

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,060
please keep your cell phone on as usual.

181
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,510
Maintain regular contact with your family
and people from the outside.

182
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,330
We won't tell Light about this.

183
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,370
If Light calls you,

184
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,390
talk to him as if you're right here, inside headquarters.

185
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,330
Also, we will keep you posted
on the details of the investigation.

186
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,780
Is that okay?

187
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
I am indebted to you, Ryuzaki.

188
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,830
Mister Stalker, I want to take a bath.

189
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,660
You know where I live, don't you?

190
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,710
Bring me a change of clothes...

191
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,430
The situation has gotten even more bizarre.

192
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,670
I feel so sorry for the Chief.

193
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,730
Ryuzaki, what's happening?

194
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,980
Have any new criminals been broadcast

195
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,520
whom Kira would target in the last couple of days?

196
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,490
And if so, have they been killed by Kira?

197
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,140
Quite a few criminals have been broadcast,

198
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,280
but since you've been detained, none of them have been killed.

199
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,680
No one's been killed? Really?

200
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,790
Yes.

201
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,530
I see.

202
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,830
Maybe I really <i>am</i> Kira.

203
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,260
Oh man, I wanna eat an apple...

204
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,950
What's going on?

205
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,160
I thought that the murders would continue
even with Yagami Light confined,

206
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,840
but in reality, they completely stopped.

207
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,050
It seemed like Yagami Light wanted to be confined,

208
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,400
but this would mean that Yagami Light is Kira.

209
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,320
Now the question is whether he was conscious of being Kira.

210
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,400
If he is<i> Kira,</i>

211
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,660
does he think he can get away with saying
that he wasn't conscious of what he was doing?

212
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,850
It's not like Yagami Light.

213
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,080
No, it's not like Kira.

214
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,030
I can't take it, Light.

215
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,260
If I don't eat an apple soon...

216
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,760
Anyway, I just have to get through it...
even if there's nothing to do.

217
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:16,100
Mister Stalker, your video won't sell if I'm just sitting.

218
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,700
Mr. Yagami looks even worse than Light or Misa.

219
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,440
Of course.
It's been five days since Light's been imprisoned.

220
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,950
During that time, not a single criminal who's been broadcast has died.

221
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,030
In times like this, I suppose it's harder
for the parents than the suspects themselves.

222
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,690
Especially since now, it's almost definite that Light is Kira.

223
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,960
Mr. Yagami.

224
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,960
What is it?
Good news?!

225
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,170
Bad news?!

226
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,670
Uh, no...
Try not to work yourself up too much.

227
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,770
You won't accomplish anything by mulling over things.

228
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,650
The outcome will remain the same.

229
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,930
Perhaps you should rest...

230
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,680
in a more comfortable place.

231
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,860
Out of the question!

232
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,240
There's no place anywhere
that would be relaxing in this situation!

233
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,900
In the state I'm in now, this is the best place for me.

234
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,710
No matter what the result,

235
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,070
I will<i> leave with my son!</i>

236
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,740
I understand.

237
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,420
Light, it's only been one week, but you're looking worn out.

238
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,260
Are you all right?

239
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,660
Now that I've come this far,

240
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,940
I think it's about time.

241
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,040
Yeah, I know I probably look pretty bad in here.

242
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,200
But this useless pride...
I'll just have to...

243
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,620
get rid of it.

244
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,370
All right.

245
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,920
Got it.

246
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,720
See you later.

247
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,100
What am I doing here?

248
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,030
Ryuzaki...

249
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,130
I know I agreed to be detained and chose to do this.

250
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,570
But now I just clearly realized

251
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,460
that doing this is meaningless!

252
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,040
It's because I'm not Kira!

253
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,300
Get me out of here quickly!

254
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,400
I can't do that.

255
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
We promised that no matter what you said,

256
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,140
I wouldn't let you out until we decided on whether or not you were Kira.

257
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,910
There was something wrong with me then!

258
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,100
Do you really think that Kira would be able to operate

259
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,680
without being conscious of it?
Do you really think that Kira would be able to operate

260
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,150
without being conscious of it?

261
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,770
I don't remember committing Kira's crimes, so I'm not him!

262
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,700
I also don't believe that Kira has been acting
without self-awareness all this time.

263
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,660
But if you <i>are</i> him, then everything adds up.

264
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,960
As soon as you were detained, murders by Kira stopped.

265
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,380
All right, Ryuzaki, hear me out!

266
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,970
I am not lying...

267
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,790
I'm not Kira!

268
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,800
I can only think that I've been framed!

269
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,800
What's wrong with you, Yagami Light?

270
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,950
What you're saying doesn't make sense.

271
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,310
But for some reason, it feels like it's the truth.

272
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,440
Hurry and get me out of here.
We're wasting time!

273
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,060
No. I can't let you out.

274
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,150
Damn... How did this happen?

275
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,820
What's going on?
This isn't like Light.

276
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,490
He's taking back what he said earlier.
It makes no sense.

277
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,640
We can't release him now that the murders have stopped.

278
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,100
Even I know that.

279
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, whatever anyone says,

280
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,530
can't we just decide that Yagami Light is Kira,
and that the case is closed?

281
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,850
What's going on?

282
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,640
Two weeks worth of criminals
were murdered all at once yesterday!

283
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,560
Yeah.

284
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,230
Kira is back.

285
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,570
Have you told the Chief?

286
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,190
No, not yet.

287
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,860
Chief, Kira has started killing again!

288
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
What?!

289
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,570
Kira was just resting.
He's started punishing criminals again.

290
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,870
I-Is that true, Matsuda?!

291
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,780
Th-Then my son...

292
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,770
I shouldn't be happy that the murders have occurred,

293
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,220
but now, suspicion of my son will beâ€”

294
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,800
No, knowing Ryuzaki, he's not completely cleared just yet.

295
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,680
Well then...

296
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,550
He's in the grey.

297
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,470
Did you hear that, Chief?!

298
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,310
Yeah, he was pretty much guilty up to now.

299
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,200
Thank goodness.

300
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
It's probably a grey that's one shade closer to being clear.

301
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,360
Then I'll tell Light, too.

302
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,790
Matsuda!

303
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,050
I mean, Mr. Matsuda.
Please stop.

304
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,320
Matsuda?

305
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,820
Don't tell Light.

306
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,820
Wh-Why not?

307
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,740
Light.

308
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,240
What is it, Ryuzaki?

309
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,990
It's already been over two weeks. There haven't been any new killings.

310
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,640
Won't you just give up and confess that you're Kira?

311
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,210
Don't play dumb, Ryuzaki.

312
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,190
You're wrong.

313
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,720
I can understand how you deduced
from the investigation that I'm Kira. But it's a trap.

314
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm not Kira!

315
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,850
Zoom in or something and look at my eyes!

316
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,100
Are these the eyes of someone who's lying?

317
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,320
Amane, you're really sure that you don't know who Kira is, aren't you?

318
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Huh? That again?
That's what I want to know!

319
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:12,830
Kira is a champion of justice who punished the burglar who killed my parents.

320
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,320
I can't make sense of anything that's happening.

321
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,540
Th-That's crazy!

322
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,190
Wait, Dad!

323
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,260
If we die here,

324
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,790
we'll never find out the truth!

325
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,420
You trust L more than you trust me?

326
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,380
Dad!
