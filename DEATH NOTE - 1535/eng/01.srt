1
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,520
What?

2
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,810
A pair of sleeping skulls?!

3
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,440
Hah! I win.

4
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,980
Don't hold it against me.

5
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,320
Hey, Ryuk, wanna join us?

6
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,910
Come hang out with us
for a change.

7
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,000
No, I'll pass.

8
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,880
Listen for the voice of God

9
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,420
and never guess you will...

10
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,800
I didn't do a thing, but he still got upset...

11
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
Really? And then?

12
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,220
Yagami, what's the matter?

13
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,550
Please translate the following sentences.

14
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,440
Follow the voice of God.

15
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,810
Then the blessings of the sea will become bountiful

16
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,530
and there will be no storms.

17
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,910
Today, at approximately 11 a.m.
in Kanagawa Prefecture in Yokohama,

18
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,540
the body of a man appearing to be about 30 years old
was found in an apartment, covered in blood.

19
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,450
Kanagawa Police have opened a homicide investigation.

20
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,830
In other news...

21
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,750
Today, shortly after noon,
in the Shibuya district of Tokyo,

22
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,210
a 25-year-old woman was gagged and killed by her live-in partner.

23
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,510
35-year-old Tofuji Naoki is being
held in custody charged with her murder.

24
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,640
Day in and day out...

25
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,440
the same thing over and over again.

26
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,350
Jeez...

27
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,190
It's so ridiculous.

28
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,650
This world...

29
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,650
...is rotten.
This world...

30
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,490
Another is the extinction of many species of life on the planet.

31
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,450
No way! You went to see that?

32
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:49,750
Species are becoming extinct
at a faster rate than has occurred...

33
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,330
It was a complete waste of time.

34
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,080
I should've asked for a refund!

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,750
Well, you <i>did</i> watch it.
Species are becoming extinct
at a faster rate than has occurred...

36
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,160
Death Note?

37
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,920
Literally translated as "a notebook of death."

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
How to use it...

39
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
The human whose name is written in this note...

40
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,050
shall die?

41
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,680
What a joke...

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,640
This is so sick.

43
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,980
It's no different than a chain letter.

44
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,820
"The human whose name is written in this note shall die?" C'mon.

45
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,040
Seriously... I must be going insane.

46
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,460
There will be no effect when the face of
the targetted person is not in the writer's mind.

47
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,170
Therefore,

48
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,470
people sharing the same name will not be affected.

49
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,350
If the cause of death is written within
40 seconds of writing the person's name,

50
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,060
it will happen as it is written.

51
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,520
If the cause of death is not specified,
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

52
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,770
After writing the cause of death,
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds,

53
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,270
details of the death should be written.

54
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,950
So you can let people die peacefully or make them suffer.

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,080
A prank this intricate isn't too bad, I guess.

56
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,920
Write their name and they die, huh?

57
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,750
This is so stupid!

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,810
Wait a minute.

59
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,280
If someone actually dies,
does that make me a murderer?

60
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,450
No way. It'd never happen.

61
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,450
The assailant who killed six people yesterday at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku

62
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:39,870
has now taken eight people hostage,
including children and teachers, in this daycare center.

63
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,050
The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Otoharada Kurou, unemployed.

64
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,260
The police will begin negotiations with the suspect.

65
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,640
Otoharada Kurou

66
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,060
A heart attack in 40 seconds,

67
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,850
right?

68
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,520
Well, that is not clear at the moment.

69
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,110
You can't help but be worried for the hostages right now.

70
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,270
Absolutely.

71
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,820
This has been a report from the scene.

72
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,320
Thank you very much.

73
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,610
What do you think, Mr. Hashimoto?

74
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,660
Well, I'm hoping for a quick resolution to this.

75
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,540
Oh well, nothing happened.

76
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,580
What did I expect?

77
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,500
Just a minute.

78
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,420
There seems to be something happening.

79
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,130
The hostages are coming out!

80
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,800
They all seem to be fine!

81
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,340
And now it looks like the SWAT team is entering!

82
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,010
Has the suspect been arrested?!

83
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,010
Yes!

84
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,270
We just received word that the suspect has died inside the daycare center!

85
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,650
The suspect is dead!

86
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Dead?!

87
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,900
The police are strongly denying that they shot the suspect!

88
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,660
Then could he have felt cornered and committed suicide?

89
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,790
According to one of the hostages,
"The suspect just suddenly collapsed."

90
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,290
A heart attack...

91
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,460
N-No way...

92
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,380
This is a coincidence.

93
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,000
It's gotta be a coincidence!

94
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,630
Light!

95
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,970
It's almost 6:30.

96
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,260
Don't you have cram school tonight?

97
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,890
The Death Note...

99
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,440
It's a long shot, but if this is the real thing,

100
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,310
it's worth testing once more.

101
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,480
In which case, the victim should probably be a criminal.

102
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,610
But it can't be someone too infamous.

103
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,240
If they die, it's possible that
their deaths will be covered up.

104
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
I need an immediate result.

105
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,580
Hey, Ryo baby!

106
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,710
Wh-What is it, Sudou?

107
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,670
Lend me 'bout 2,000 yen, will ya?

108
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,830
Wh-What? Again?

109
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,880
Sudou...

110
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,290
What? You refusing?

111
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,250
Shall I kill him?

112
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,300
No, I'd better avoid people I know.

113
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,760
No...

114
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,140
Why should I worry?

115
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,470
If one or two people like him were to die,

116
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,310
not a single soul would care.

117
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,230
Now we can go to the arcade after school.

118
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,860
Maki, wanna party with some guys tomorrow?

119
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,980
Absolutely!

120
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,740
Hey, me too!

121
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,700
Dammit, that stupid old hag!

122
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,910
She's not here to pick me up!

123
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,370
It's sickening.

124
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,830
Every single one of them...

125
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,790
I'd do society a favor
by killing them.

126
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,040
Hey girl!

127
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,670
Fancy having some fun with us?

128
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,550
Hey, Taku! You've got a beauty there!

129
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm Shibuimaru Takuo. Shibutaku, for short.

130
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,770
Hang out with us for a while, baby.

131
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,390
I-I don't think so.

132
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,480
She doesn't think so!

133
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,980
How cute!

134
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,400
C'mon, grab her.
Get those clothes off!

135
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,990
Can we?!

136
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,660
Stop!

137
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,120
Please!

138
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,040
Stop!

139
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,960
All the different variations of writing the name "Shibuimaru Takuo."

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
Now let's see...

141
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,500
what'll happen!

142
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,010
Hey, wait!

143
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,090
Taku! Watch out!

144
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,020
This... This settles it!

145
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,560
The Death Note is real!

146
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,350
Taku!

147
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,770
I-Idiot!

148
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,440
He just jumped out in front of me.

149
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,570
I guess...

150
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,990
I'd better get going.

151
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,550
It's been five days since then.

152
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,590
I guess...

153
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,550
I'd better get going.

154
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,090
Huh? Going out, Ryuk?

155
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,180
This place is barren everywhere you go.

156
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,480
I dropped my Death Note.

157
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,400
You really messed up big time!

158
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,480
Hey, weren't you carrying around
a second one behind the old man's back?

159
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,490
Don't tell me you lost both of 'em?

160
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,450
Do ya even know where ya dropped it?

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,370
The Human World.

162
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,740
What?!

163
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,770
Welcome home.

164
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,070
You're home early, Light.

165
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah.

166
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm back, Mom.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,860
Huh?

168
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,540
Oh, you want the results of
the national mock entrance exams?

169
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,120
Hurry!

170
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,120
Here you go.

171
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,540
Goodness! Number one again!

172
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,590
You really did your best, Light!

173
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,840
Well, yeah.

174
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,590
I'll be studying, so don't bother me.

175
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,840
All right.

176
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,340
Oh, Light...

177
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,220
Do you want anything?

178
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,890
Anything at all?

179
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,100
Not really, Mom.

180
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,350
I already have what I want.

181
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,000
You seem to like it.

182
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,300
Why are you shocked?

183
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,560
The one who dropped that notebook was me, Ryuk, a Shinigami.

184
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,020
From what I just saw,

185
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,140
you're already aware that that's no ordinary notebook.

186
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,860
A Shinigami, huh?

187
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,660
I'm not shocked, Ryuk.

188
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,540
In fact,

189
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,660
I've been waiting for you, Ryuk.

190
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,540
Oh?

191
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,130
I didn't think the Shinigami's Notebook was real,

192
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,260
but after seeing its results,

193
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,430
I can act with certainty.

194
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,760
I see.

195
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,850
You really surprise me.

196
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:58,310
I've heard of Death Notes getting down
to the Human World a few times before.

197
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,780
But you're the first one to use it to this extent in just five days.

198
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,070
Most people would be too scared to try it out.

199
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,110
I'm prepared, Ryuk.

200
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,490
I used a Death Note knowing it belonged to a Shinigami.

201
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,080
And now the Shinigami's here.

202
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,330
So what'll happen to me?

203
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,370
Are you going to take my soul?

204
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,880
Huh? What's that about?

205
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,420
Some fantasy you humans came up with?

206
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,590
I'm not going to do anything to you.

207
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,390
Once the Death Note lands in the Human World,

208
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,720
it belongs to the Human World.

209
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,600
In other words,

210
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,140
it belongs to you.

211
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,310
It belongs to me?

212
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,900
If you don't want it, give it to some other human.

213
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,980
But if you do that, all memory of
the Death Note will be erased from your mind.

214
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,900
So using the Death Note

215
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,240
doesn't come with a catch?

216
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,660
Well, if anything, there is...

217
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,790
only the fear and pain humans who
have used the Death Note will experience.

218
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,330
And when you die,

219
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,130
it falls to me to write your name in my Death Note.

220
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,590
Don't think for a moment, that any human

221
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,720
who's used the Death Note can go to Heaven, or Hell.

222
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,390
That's all.

223
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,770
You'll find out about it after you die.

224
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,030
Light...

225
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,320
Don't worry.

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Answer her.

227
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,910
What?

228
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,700
I brought some apples.

229
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,830
They're from our neighbors.

230
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,000
Why is it so dark in there?

231
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,580
You'll ruin your eyesight!

232
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,040
What's going on?

233
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,710
Geez.

234
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,500
Mom can't see him?

235
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,800
That notebook originally
belonged to me.

236
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,510
And since you're the one using it,

237
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,140
only you can see me.

238
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,350
Of course, my voice...

239
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,180
Only you can hear it.

240
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,390
In other words, the Death Note

241
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,020
is a bond between Light the human and Ryuk the Shinigami.

242
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,030
Tasty.

243
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,280
Let me ask you one more thing.

244
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,990
Why did you choose me?

245
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,450
Hey, are you listening?

246
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,790
Apples in the Human World are awesome.

247
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,420
What would you call them?

248
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,670
Juicy?

249
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,250
Answer my question.

250
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,050
I didn't choose you.

251
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,880
I just dropped the notebook.

252
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,010
Did you think you were chosen because you were smart?

253
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,050
Don't flatter yourself.

254
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,720
It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up.

255
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,430
That's all.

256
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,400
That's why I wrote the explanation in English,
the most popular language in the Human World.

257
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,650
Then why did you drop it?!

258
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,950
Don't tell me it was by mistake after you went to the trouble and wrote all those instructions.

259
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,110
Why'd I drop it?

260
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,950
Because I was bored.

261
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,450
Bored?

262
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,120
The truth is that Shinigami these days have a lot of time on their hands.

263
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,960
They're either taking a nap or gambling.

264
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,760
If others see you studiously scribbling names in the Death Note,

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,470
they'll say, "What are you working so hard for?" and laugh at you.

266
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,720
Writing names of other Shinigami doesn't work.

267
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,140
But since we live in the Shinigami Realm,

268
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,980
it's no fun at all to kill people who live in the Human World!

269
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,190
So I figured it'd be more fun to come down here myself.

270
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,280
But you sure wrote a lotta names.

271
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,780
But why'd you write down the cause of death only for that guy who was hit by the truck?

272
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,750
Without the cause of death written down,
they all die of heart attacks.

273
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,040
That's the best thing about the Death Note, Ryuk.

274
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,260
I can write down the names of the criminals

275
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,630
and slowly reduce the number of evil people.

276
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,430
What's the point?

277
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,430
Any fool can figure it out if someone is just "eliminating the bad guys."

278
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,020
I want the world to know of my existence!

279
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,400
That there is someone passing judgment on them!

280
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,280
But what's the point in passing judgment?

281
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,570
Why do it?

282
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,410
I, too,

283
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,120
was bored.

284
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,040
Naturally, I didn't believe it at first.

285
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,790
But that Death Note

286
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,090
has the supernatural power to tempt people
to want to try it at least once.

287
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,090
I... I killed them.

288
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,930
Two men...

289
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,350
I killed them!

290
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,220
Human lives...

291
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,310
shouldn't be taken so lightly!

292
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,850
Do I have the right
to judge people like that?

293
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,230
No...

294
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,860
I'm not wrong!

295
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,070
I've always thought about this.

296
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,740
The world is rotten!

297
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,740
Rotten people deserve to die!

298
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,580
Someone...

299
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,500
Someone has to do it!

300
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,040
Even if it means sacrificing
one's conscience and life!

301
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,250
Things can't stay like this!

302
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,090
If the Death Note had fallen into someone else's hands,

303
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,180
would they have had the resolve
to erase unwanted people from this world?

304
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,100
No way!

305
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,930
But I...

306
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,310
I can do it!

307
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,930
In fact,

308
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,230
only I can do it!

309
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,810
And I will! With the Death Note!

310
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,780
I'll change the world!

311
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,570
At first I kept writing the names of criminals

312
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,230
as if I were cleaning up the world.

313
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,320
So that in time, no one would do evil.

314
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,540
While those guilty ones who truly deserved to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks,

315
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,160
people who were immoral or harass others,

316
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,420
would slowly be erased through illness or accidents.

317
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,840
Then the world would truly move in the right direction.

318
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:46,850
And I would create a new world of earnest, kind humans.

319
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,060
Then you'd be the only
fucked-up person left.

320
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,560
Huh? What are you saying?

321
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,520
Ryuk,

322
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm probably the best, most diligent honor student in Japan.

323
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,280
And I will become...

324
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,570
the god of the new world!

325
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,120
I knew it! Humans...

326
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,960
sure are interesting.

327
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,960
The entire world is watching

328
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,090
to see what happens to those who defy me,

329
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,170
L.
