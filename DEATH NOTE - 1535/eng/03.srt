1
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,560
Members of the ICPO...

2
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,110
I am L.

3
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,610
Regardless of how many suspects there are,

4
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,900
there's a strong possibility they're Japanese.

5
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,740
Kira, I have a pretty good idea behind your motive.

6
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,120
But what you're doing

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
is evil!

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,670
Th-That bastard!

9
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,210
Bring it on! Try and kill me!

10
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,750
What's wrong? Do it quickly!
I am justice!

11
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,250
I'm saving the meek, who fear evil!

12
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,880
C'mon! Kill me!

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,010
I'm the man who will become the god of the ideal, new world!

14
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,380
L...

15
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,590
Kira...

16
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,100
I will definitely find you and finish you!

17
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,100
I am...

18
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,020
justice!

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
All right then, let's start with the tip-line reports.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,280
Until now, there have been 3,029 responses about the murders from telephone calls, etc.

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,620
Most of them are from curious members of the public.

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,000
But there are fourteen people who say that they either "know the killer" or "have seen the killer."

24
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,050
Each account was followed up and recorded carefully.

25
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,220
But no one had information that hasn't already been released to the public.

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,970
There are also twenty-one people who claim they are Kira.

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,230
We didn't want to rule out any possibilities,

28
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,070
so all twenty-one people were put on record and filed.

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,110
Okay.

30
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,110
Next up: victims.

31
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,740
Sir!

32
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,740
Upon further investigation,

33
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,950
we have confirmed that information of the heart attack victims was, in fact,

34
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,870
publicly available in Japan prior to their deaths.

35
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,170
Also,

36
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,880
concerning L's request that we investigate the times of death for each victim...

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,720
We found they occurred between 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays Japan's time.

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,470
Sixty-eight percent of them occurred between 8 p.m. and 12 midnight.

39
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,060
Furthermore, we have a great variation of times

40
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,980
on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

41
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,650
That is extremely interesting.

42
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,110
Judging from those times of death,

43
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,610
the culprit may be a student.

44
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,580
I have other grounds for this belief.

45
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,870
Drawing from the fact that the perpetrator is only killing criminals,

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,710
he's probably driven by his own idealistic sense of justice.

47
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,420
He may even be trying to become a god.

48
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,300
You could say that he has a very childish mentality.

49
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,970
I can't believe that...

50
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,300
This is just a mere possibility.

51
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,810
But please get rid of the assumption that the culprit couldn't be a student.

52
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,350
Considering various possibilities

53
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,150
is the shortest route to arresting Kira.

54
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,730
Please continue your investigative report.

55
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,610
Y-Yes...

56
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,700
Has anyone else noticed anything?

57
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,740
Um, yes...

58
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,580
What is it, Matsuda?

59
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,790
Um... I'm in no way saying this to give credit to Kira's actions...

60
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,670
But for the past few days, worldwide... and especially in Japan,

61
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,050
the number of violent crimes more serious than robbery has dropped drastically.

62
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,470
Well,

63
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,140
I suppose that's to be expected.

64
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,600
Anything else?

65
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,650
That about sums up our investigative report for today, L.

66
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,650
Thank you, everyone. I feel as if we're closing in on the culprit.

67
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,910
Still, I'd like to make another request.

68
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,410
I want the teams investigating the victims, the news, and the Internet

69
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,210
to examine once more how the victims' identities were made public in Japan.

70
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,010
I want to know if pictures of the victims' faces were shown.

71
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,720
I leave it to you.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Chief...

73
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,640
You seem exhausted.

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,930
Thanks.

75
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,560
I've been pulling all-nighters lately.

76
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,610
What I said about crimes dropping drastically...

77
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,700
Now that I think about it, everyone knows already.

78
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,820
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,830
What are you talking about?

80
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,910
Keep speaking the truth.

81
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,160
Especially when it's about things people hesitate to bring up.

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,300
However, if you had gone on to say that

83
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,880
we should commend Kira for admirably reducing crime rates,

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,380
now that might have been a problem.

85
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,090
I-Impossible! Support that killer?

86
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,890
I'm just kidding.

87
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,770
Just as I expected, Light!

88
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,100
Hey! Did you understand any of that by yourself?

89
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,270
Huh? Yeah, kind of.

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,740
Oh, it seems like Dad's home.

91
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,530
Welcome home, Dear.

92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,740
He's home early!

93
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,990
Hey! At least figure out the last problem by yourself.

94
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,200
I will, after dinner!

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,460
Really...

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,460
Helping your little sister do her homework...
You sure are confident.

97
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,590
Yeah. There's one thing that gives me confidence to fight the police if they move against me.

98
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,010
Welcome home, Dad.

99
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,180
Good to be home.

100
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,860
Light, how are your studies?

101
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,400
Hmm? They're okay.

102
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,450
He's at the top of his grade as usual.

103
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,370
Yes, my wonderful big brother!

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,870
Yes, my wonderful son!

105
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,660
Dad, you seem a bit tired.

106
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah...

107
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,250
I can't tell you any details,

108
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,590
but this current case is very difficult.

109
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,590
I see.

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,130
Your father is one of the police.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,970
That must be the reason you're so confident.

112
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,680
Yeah.

113
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,940
I can hack into my father's computer from my own without leaving a trace.

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,360
I can always keep track of the investigative situation.

115
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,070
Here it is.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,250
The police are beginning to suspect that the culprit is a student.

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Doesn't that mean you're in trouble, Light?

118
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,730
If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.

119
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,360
If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,280
After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written

121
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,150
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

122
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,910
Is that right, Ryuk?

123
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,370
Yeah, so?

124
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,830
In other words, if I write "heart attack" as the cause of death,

125
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,420
I can write down the circumstance and time of death.

126
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,130
Looks like I may be able to provide you a little more entertainment, Ryuk.

127
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,530
Number 148, what's wrong?!

128
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,830
Get ahold of yourself!

129
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,640
What?!

130
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,560
Th-There were another twenty-three heart attack victims yesterday?!

131
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
Y-Yes.

132
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,190
The day before, there were another twenty-three victims.

133
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,230
One at every hour...

134
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,990
The fact that this has continued for two weekdays straight...

135
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,240
...means our sketch of the culprit has become doubtful.

136
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,200
No, anyone could skip school for two days.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,410
That's not it!

138
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,250
It does appear less likely now that the culprit's a student.

139
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,500
But that's not the message Kira's trying to send!

140
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Why one every hour?

141
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,130
And why are all the victims in prisons, where they can easily be found?

142
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,930
Kira is trying to say that

143
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,140
he can freely control

144
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,140
the time of death.

145
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,860
But something's not right.

146
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,570
As soon as we began to suspect that Kira was a student,

147
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,360
the timing of the killings changed as if to contradict our theory.

148
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,490
Is it a coincidence?

149
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,830
No, the timing is too convenient.

150
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,660
Does that mean that Kira knows what the police know?

151
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,290
This is obviously

152
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,170
a direct challenge from him!

153
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,840
L is probably quaking in his boots by now.

154
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,970
I still have fifty criminals left especially for times like this.

155
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,930
Oh...

156
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,940
Now, L should be starting to suspect someone involved with the police.

157
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,150
Kira has found a way to obtain information from task force headquarters.

158
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,360
I cannot ignore this fact.

159
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,280
What is Kira's real objective?

160
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,080
What is he trying to do?

161
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,250
But I don't get it.

162
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,300
By getting rid of the student theory, aren't you at a bigger disadvantage if L thinks you're connected to the police?

163
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,880
My reason is...

164
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,300
It's in order to find L and finish him off.

165
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
What do you mean?

166
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,430
In human society,

167
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,730
there are only a few people who actually trust each other.

168
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,770
That's true even among police.

169
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,900
In particular, L and the police don't trust each other at all.

170
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,450
Could you trust someone whose name and face you don't know?

171
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,820
When L discovers that the findings from the investigation were leaked,

172
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,040
he's bound to search for leads on me within the police force.

173
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,620
When he does,

174
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,960
it's only a matter of time before the police get as mad as a hornet.

175
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,840
On the surface,

176
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,420
L and the police are working together to try to catch me.

177
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,010
But in reality,

178
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,260
L is investigating the police and the police will start investigating L.

179
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,560
I'm not the one who's going to find L.

180
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,520
The police will track him down.

181
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,980
And I will eliminate him.

182
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,490
What is this?!

183
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,790
As you see, these are our letters of resignation.

184
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,330
Transfer us to a different case.

185
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,790
If you can't, we will quit the police force.

186
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,090
B-But why?

187
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,550
Why?

188
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,590
Because we value our lives, sir.

189
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,140
By L's deduction,

190
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,520
Kira can kill people indirectly through supernatural powers, right?

191
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,230
If I were Kira,

192
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,400
I would try to kill anyone who tried to catch me.

193
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,020
That's because he'll be executed if he gets caught.

194
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,150
Earlier, in that media stunt, L challenged Kira.

195
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,200
"Try and kill me," he said.

196
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,660
But L never showed his face or revealed his name.

197
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,290
Just recently, L ordered us to find out

198
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:42,630
if the victims' faces and names were broadcast in Japan.

199
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,840
That's right!

200
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,180
All the victims were those whose faces were broadcast to the Japanese public!

201
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,640
We, unlike someone we know,

202
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,390
carry around our personal identification as well as our photos in our police IDs.

203
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,770
We don't hide our faces. We're out in the open!

204
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,860
We...

205
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,690
could be killed at any time by Kira.

206
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,450
This is why we wish to be removed from our post.

207
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,410
Excuse us.

208
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,370
H-Hey!

209
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,080
You guys!

210
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,910
Wait a second!

211
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,010
Here's the solution to this problem.

212
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,880
Take x squared equals

213
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,180
large x.

214
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,470
You can think of large x's quadratic equation

215
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,890
as the multiple of two integers.

216
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,400
We had the FBI come to Japan four days ago.

217
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,870
They are currently investigating the police involved.

218
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,830
This is the list, isn't it?

219
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,410
Yes.

220
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,370
There are 141 people within the police force alone

221
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,000
who have access to classified information on the Kira investigation.

222
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,290
But one of the 141 people

223
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,760
or someone close to them...

224
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
Kira is definitely among them!

225
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,890
Light, you gotta second?

226
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,600
Didn't I tell you not to talk to me as much as possible when we're outside?

227
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

228
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,940
Well then, I'll just talk.

229
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,070
Cover your ears if you don't want to hear.

230
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,820
I don't have anything against you, Light.

231
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,450
I don't think the notebook could've been picked up by a better person.

232
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,500
And I have to stick around with you until you or the notebook is finished.

233
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,250
But I'm not on your side or L's side.

234
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,260
I knew that much already, Ryuk.

235
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,720
That's why I'll never say anything about

236
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,970
whether what you're doing is right or wrong.

237
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,350
But I'm going to say this as your roommate.

238
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,560
What's wrong, Ryuk?

239
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,860
Why are you telling me this all of a sudden?

240
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,320
This isn't like you.

241
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,990
I'm going to tell you this,

242
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,320
not because I'm an ally of Kira,

243
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,950
but because it's giving me the heebie jeebies.

244
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,410
Get to the point already.

245
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,670
Someone's been following you all this time.

246
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,350
He's been getting on my nerves.

247
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,610
He can't see me,

248
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,900
but because I'm always hovering behind you,

249
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,530
I feel like I'm being watched.

250
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,740
That's a problem.

251
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,740
I'll be sure to finish him off, Ryuk.

252
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,750
Who in the world could he be?

253
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,750
Does that mean that L has begun to suspect the police?

254
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,880
He must need quite a large number of people to investigate them.

255
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,550
Even if he had fifty people investigating,

256
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,600
there is no chance that I'd be suspected of being Kira.

257
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,140
I should only look like a regular high-school student.

258
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,060
But if I leave it alone for several months,

259
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,860
that possibility won't remain at zero.

260
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,110
I must learn my tracker's name.

261
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,110
When I find that out, I can get rid of him.

262
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,950
Light...

263
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,410
I'll let you in on something good.

264
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,120
There are two big differences between

265
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,710
Shinigami and humans who have a Death Note.

266
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,760
Do you know why Shinigami have to write people's names in the Death Note?

267
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,930
Why would I know that?

268
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,640
You're really talkative today, Ryuk.

269
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,930
It's because Shinigami receive the human's remaining life span from them.

270
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,520
You get their remaining life span?

271
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,440
Let's say that there's a person who will live till sixty in the Human World.

272
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,440
You write that he'll die at forty in the Death Note.

273
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,320
Sixty minus forty equals twenty.

274
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,160
Those twenty years in the Human World

275
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,740
are added to a Shinigami's life span.

276
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,620
As long as we don't slack off,

277
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,000
even if we're shot in the head

278
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,960
or stabbed in the heart with a knife, Shinigami will not die.

279
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,180
But no matter how many names you write in the Death Note,

280
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,430
your life span will not lengthen.

281
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:45,350
That's one difference between Shinigami and humans who have a Death Note.

282
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,600
Hmm...

283
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,480
To humans, that's very kind of the Shinigami.

284
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,520
That's kinda interesting.

285
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,150
Our second difference is probably of more interest to you.

286
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,950
Instead of lengthening life, it's about cutting it short.

287
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,820
Cutting it short?

288
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,540
When a Shinigami sees a person's face,

289
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,210
they know their name.

290
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,120
Do you know why?

291
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,590
With Shinigami's eyes,

292
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,180
a human's name and life span can be seen above their head.

293
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,840
Name and life span?

294
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,100
Of course, in my eyes, I can see your name and life span right now.

295
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,400
If I convert it to human time, I'll know how many years it is.

296
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,110
Of course, I wouldn't tell you even if you stretched my mouth open.

297
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,360
Even if my mouth is stretched out as it is.

298
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,580
Shinigami never have problems knowing the names of the people they kill.

299
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,870
They also know how much life they're going to receive.

300
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,880
Our eyes are different.

301
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,210
That's the crucial difference between you and me.

302
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,220
Shinigami can also turn the eyes of whoever picked up their Death Note

303
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,010
into Shinigami eyes.

304
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,730
But only if a deal is made.
One that's been with us since ancient times.

305
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,060
A deal?

306
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,730
The price for a pair of Shinigami's eyes

307
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,660
is half of that person's remaining life span.

308
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,450
Half of my remaining life span...

309
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,910
Yeah.

310
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,710
For example, if you were to live another fifty years, you'll have twenty-five years.

311
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,250
If it was one year more, you'll have half a year.

312
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,840
And since you're neither Kira's nor L's ally,

313
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,760
you won't tell me the name of someone I want to kill, even if you see their name.

314
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,600
In other words,

315
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,140
I can't get your help.

316
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,640
Is that what you're trying to say?

317
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,350
Yeah. It's also part of the Shinigami code.

318
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,270
I'll say this once more.

319
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,490
Give me half your remaining life and I'll give you the Shinigami eyes.

320
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,610
If I do that,

321
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,280
I'll know everyone's name.

322
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,000
It means that it'll be easier to use the Death Note.

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,290
So...

324
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,080
What'll it be, Light?

325
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,420
Exactly 11:45.

326
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,970
Everything went as planned.

327
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,260
The Death Note never fails.
