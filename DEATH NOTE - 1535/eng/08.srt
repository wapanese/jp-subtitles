1
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,770
That was footage that was coincidentally captured on surveillance cameras

2
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,020
of the FBI agents who died in Japan.

3
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,750
Please show me only the scenes of Raye Penber

4
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,560
passing the ticket gate, riding the train, and then dying.

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,540
Yes.

6
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,240
Let's see...

7
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,330
It's right below that.

8
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,800
Oh, this?

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,010
Uh... Raye Penber enters through
the ticket gate of Shinjuku Station at 3:11.

10
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,620
At 3:13, he rides the Yamanote Line.

11
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,850
Even if he was following someone,

12
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,910
it would be difficult to conclude anything from this blurry video.

13
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,900
And at 4:42...

14
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,990
Oh, thank you very much.

15
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,780
Uh... And at 4:42, he gets off
and dies at the Tokyo Station platform.

16
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,910
That's strange, isn't it?

17
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,120
Huh?

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,790
L, what's strange?

19
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,790
Did you notice something?

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Judging by this footage,

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,120
from the time that Raye Penber got on the train until his death,

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,640
he had been riding for an hour and a half. The Yamanote Line only takes an hour.

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
That envelope is especially strange.

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,940
Envelope?

25
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,020
He's holding that envelope as he enters the ticket gate and reaches the platform.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,520
H-He is!

27
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,480
He's carrying it!

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,190
But by the time he dies,

29
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,560
it's disappeared!

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,700
Ryuzaki, it's amazing you noticed that!

31
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,830
An envelope isn't on the list of articles he left behind.

32
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,410
Which means it was left in the train.

33
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,910
And this video of Penber's final moments...

34
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,380
It looks to me as if he's desperately trying to look inside the train.

35
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,470
If so, could there be a hint there?

36
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,870
Wouldn't it be interesting if Kira was there?

37
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,680
C-Couldn't be!

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,180
I don't think so either.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,180
There's no reason for Kira, who can control death from a distance, to come to the scene of the crime.

40
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,240
But in spite of all that,

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,820
he may have tried something bold.

42
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,660
Light, are you all right?

43
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,170
You've been writing criminals' names in the Death Note
for four days already without sleeping.

44
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,900
Why do you have to set up
a death schedule for several months ahead?

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,170
Quite simply, suppose I get hospitalized.

46
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,160
People will say,
"As soon as Chief Yagami's son was hospitalized,

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,430
criminals have stopped dying, haven't they?"

48
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,270
So that's why...

49
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,270
But are you sure that any date before
the end of their predestined life span is all right?

50
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,780
Shinigami never use it that way, so I can't say for sure.

51
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,730
But in theory, any time before
their natural deaths should be all right.

52
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
I can't count on you, can I?

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,910
You can't.

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,290
Yes.

55
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,080
Yes, please wait one moment.

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,680
Ryuzaki.

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,640
Ukita at the NPA has received
a phone call he's concerned about.

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,000
Then have him give the telephone number of number five

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,680
and have the informant call that number.

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,780
Matsuda, you can turn on your cell phone.

61
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,640
No, please turn it on.

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,560
O-Okay.

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,070
Yes, this is Suzuki, head of the Public Information division.

64
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,650
Raye Penber's fiancée?

65
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,300
Misora Naomi...

66
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,030
I've heard that name somewhere.

67
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,050
It's her...

68
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,670
She's from the Los Angeles BB murder case.

69
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,200
So that's it...

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,800
She worked under me on that case and now she's in Japan.

71
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,780
She's been missing since the death of her fiancé.

72
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,770
Anyone would be depressed over the death of a fiancé.

73
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,960
Could it be...

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,480
...suicide?

75
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,680
No, the Misora Naomi I knew

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,070
was very strong-willed and made for an excellent FBI agent.

77
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,070
She would likely be thinking of catching Kira.

78
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,570
She was with Penber.

79
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,490
She might have found a clue.

80
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,710
If that's the case, did Kira get to her first?

81
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,990
Everyone,

82
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,630
from now on, we'll focus our investigation on the people whom Raye Penber was investigating while in Japan.

83
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,370
He was investigating two people in relation to the police and the people around them.

84
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,850
Who are they? Who are those two?

85
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,020
Deputy Director General Kitamura and his family, and...

86
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,520
Detective Superintendent Yagami and his family.

87
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,940
I also wish to place

88
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,400
wiretaps and surveillance cameras in both households.

89
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,410
I have to make sure this computer
is clean enough if anyone examines it.

90
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,180
I just have to hide a clipping of the Death Note in here.

91
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,960
You sure are skillful with your hands.

92
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,090
You're popular with the girls, aren't you?

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,420
That has nothing to do with skill.

94
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,720
It's all about looks, not skill.

95
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,580
Ryuk, you aren't popular, are you?

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Surveillance cameras? Ryuzaki!

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,450
That's way out of line!

98
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,100
It'll become a civil rights issue
if this is discovered, and we'll all be fired!

99
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,610
Weren't you willing to risk more than your jobs? I thought we were putting our lives on the line.

100
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,280
Ryuzaki... What is the possibility that Kira is among them?

101
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,060
Ten percent...

102
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,740
No, five percent.

103
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,640
No way! All that for only
a five-percent possibility is a bit much.

104
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,920
No. Of the people we've investigated so far,

105
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,260
there wasn't anyone who even seemed the least bit suspicious.

106
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,450
Even if there's only a one-percent chance of finding Kira...
We should leave no stone unturned.

107
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,800
Chief!

108
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,480
I never thought that my family was under suspicion.

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,280
Fine. Please place them!

110
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,600
In return, install them in every part of the house!

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Even the bathroom! Don't miss a single corner!

112
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,020
Thank you very much. That's what I was planning to do.

113
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,640
Ch-Chief! What are you talking about?!

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,610
That's right! You have a wife and daughter, don't you?

115
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,640
I know!

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,620
There's no point in doing this unless we're thorough!

117
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,620
Just shut your trap!

118
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,310
Sorry.

119
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,420
No, it's okay.

120
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,500
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,840
Well, out of courtesy,

122
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,550
only Yagami and I will conduct surveillance on his home.

123
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,550
Watari, how long will it take to set up the wiretaps and camera monitors?

124
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,180
Starting tomorrow,

125
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,310
I can set them up at any time once
we know when both families will be out.

126
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,350
See you later, Light.

127
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,150
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

128
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,820
What? No one's home yet?

129
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,160
I'm home...

130
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,360
Hey, Light, no one seems to be home.

131
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,400
Wanna play a game together? It's been awhile.

132
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,990
Hey, Light, let's play a game.

133
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,120
Are you listening to me?

134
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,740
Light?

135
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,790
C-Couldn't be.

136
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,820
I never knew he went to those lengths!

137
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,800
Could he have something in his room he doesn't want anyone to see?

138
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,940
If you keep in mind that he's only seventeen, there's nothing suspicious about his behavior.

139
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,310
I also did that for no apparent reason.

140
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,180
Have you ever talked to him about the investigation?

141
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,220
Of course not!

142
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,310
I'd never leak anything top secret to him.

143
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,500
Besides...

144
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,760
Lately I haven't been returning home regularly,

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,750
and when I do, I'm exhausted, so I just get some sleep.

146
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,610
I understand.

147
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,580
Light, where are you going?

148
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,240
Hey, Light, you've been giving me the cold shoulder! I'm getting mad.

149
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,440
Hey, Light!

150
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,290
There don't seem to be any taps planted on these clothes.

151
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,110
Light...

152
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,420
Ryuk, there's a possibility that there are wiretaps or surveillance cameras—

153
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,070
no, likely both—

154
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,140
placed within the house.

155
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,970
Huh? But that piece of paper was still in your door, wasn't it?

156
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,120
That piece of paper

157
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,370
was a fake to make people think it was there to see whether anyone had entered the room while I was gone.

158
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,080
The real detector is, first of all, my door handle.

159
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,070
Your door handle?

160
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,550
When that door is closed, the door handle naturally rises to a horizontal position.

161
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,070
It won't rise any higher.

162
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,870
But whenever I close the door,

163
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,080
I purposefully lower the door handle to five millimeters below its highest position.

164
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,330
In other words, when I open the door,

165
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,330
if the handle is all the way up,

166
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,840
chances are that someone was in my room.

167
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,920
But I can't rely on just that.

168
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,490
So I also put a mechanical pencil lead in place.

169
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,180
A pencil lead?

170
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,960
On the hinge.

171
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,480
After I close the door, I place a mechanical pencil lead

172
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,440
on the hinge at an angle so that it will break if the door is opened.

173
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,690
The lead is sure to break if the door is opened.

174
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,590
I've always taken it out myself
when I entered, but today, it was broken.

175
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,260
Oh, that. I remember you doing that.

176
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,900
The door handle and the pencil lead.

177
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,500
I have no doubt that someone went in.

178
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,200
Wasn't it probably your parents?

179
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
My parents and sister probably wouldn't notice the piece of paper.

180
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,710
It's suspicious that someone took the time to put it back.

181
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,960
Welcome!

182
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,410
Are you planning to buy a book to research wiretaps and surveillance?

183
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,540
Ryuk, by the way, what'll happen to your apples?

184
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,640
My apples?

185
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,170
Oh!

186
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,230
On the surveillance camera footage,

187
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,720
if I put the apple in my mouth, no one can see it, but it'll look like it's floating if I'm just holding it.

188
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,900
I thought so...

189
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,940
Shinigami cannot die, so they won't starve either.

190
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,780
In other words, there's no problem if I don't give you any apples.

191
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,820
Wh-Whoa, wait just a minute, Light!

192
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,820
Apples are to me... w-well...

193
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,680
what cigarettes and liquor are to humans.

194
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,170
I have withdrawal symptoms if I don't have any for a while.

195
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,330
What kind of symptoms?

196
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,110
My body twists around wildly, and I'll do handstands.

197
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,410
I don't want to see that.

198
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,790
Right?

199
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,180
Listen, Ryuk.

200
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,480
I've given L the hint that Shinigami love apples.

201
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,850
When did you...

202
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,690
If you really want to eat apples,

203
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,590
find out where all the cameras are.

204
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,530
There might be a place where you can eat apples without being seen.

205
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,660
All right, Ryuk, let's go!

206
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,160
Yeah!

207
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
Finding cameras.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is also interesting!

209
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,640
Oh right, I have to find cameras.

210
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,560
I-I can't believe my well-behaved son
is looking at a magazine like that!

211
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,460
It's normal for a 17-year-old.

212
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,940
But to me,

213
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,570
it seems like he's making an excuse, as if to say,
"I was checking to see if someone was in this room

214
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,280
because I have magazines like these."

215
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,000
R-Ryuzaki, are you telling me that you suspect my son?

216
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,010
I suspect him.

217
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,500
That's why I placed wiretaps and cameras in both your and the Deputy Director General's houses.

218
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,800
I found a camera in the air conditioner.

219
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,820
So there were<i> cameras.</i>

220
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,760
That probably means there are also wire taps.

221
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
Even if this is for the Kira case,

222
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,850
I can't believe the Japanese police would go this far.

223
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,310
This is L's doing.

224
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,360
If that's the case, how far has he narrowed it down to?

225
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,490
It must be down to at least someone whom Raye Penber was investigating

226
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,750
or he would never have gone this far.

227
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,910
I was tricked by the cover again.

228
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,750
No, in this case, I should move as if I were
the only one being suspected and being watched.

229
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,180
It'll be all right.

230
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,090
I've been preparing for something like this.

231
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,920
That's why I got these magazines.

232
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,760
Light...

233
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,430
Light, dinner time!

234
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,420
I...

235
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,350
love you.

236
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,860
You're so dreamy, Ryuga Hideki!

237
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,610
There's nobody in my class like him! No one at all!

238
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,560
Sayu,

239
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,080
eat your dinner.

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,040
I'll eat it later.

241
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,780
Mr. Aizawa, are the Kitamuras watching television now?

242
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,500
Yes.

243
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,030
Aside from the Deputy Director General,
the four of them are watching television as they eat.

244
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,420
It's channel four.

245
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,640
Watari, order the various television companies to broadcast our banner.

246
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,930
Understood.

247
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,760
Huh? What?

248
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,230
"In response to the Kira murders,

249
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,720
the ICPO has decided to dispatch 1,500 investigators

250
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,940
from various developed countries to Japan."

251
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
1,500 investigators?

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,030
Wow!

253
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,490
There should also be cameras in the living room.

254
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,390
Whether or not this news is real,

255
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,330
it's being shown to me to get some kind of reaction.

256
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,330
L, it's the same trick you used the first time.

257
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,930
The ICPO sure is stupid.

258
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,080
Huh?

259
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,770
There's no point in making this announcement.

260
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,640
If they're going to send them in,

261
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,600
they should let them investigate in secret.

262
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Even those FBI agents investigating in secret were killed.

263
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
The outcome will be the same.

264
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,230
This is just an overblown attempt to shock Kira into exposing himself.

265
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,990
But it just might be completely obvious to Kira.

266
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,920
Your son is very smart.

267
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,240
Huh?

268
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,120
Y-Yeah...

269
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm done.

270
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,910
No way! Are you eating potato chips after dinner?

271
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,690
You look good right now. Do you wanna get fat?

272
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,170
It's a late-night snack for my exam studies.

273
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,330
L-Light...

274
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,960
I found all of the cameras.

275
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,550
I guess even Shinigami get tired when they try hard.

276
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,440
I'll explain now.

277
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,310
It's a bit complex, so pay attention.

278
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,480
I don't want to explain it again.

279
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,690
All right, time to study hard!

280
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,200
There are many, many cameras.

281
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,440
Whoever put them here must've expected you to find some.

282
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,370
There's sixty-four in all.

283
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,480
It's definitely L.

284
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,120
He had no qualms putting a death-row inmate in his chair when he declared war with me.

285
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,460
He doesn't know any limits.

286
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,390
So where am I going to eat apples in this situation?

287
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,760
Obviously that's impossible, Ryuk.

288
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,320
Oh yeah, you can't talk to me in this house, can you?

289
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,020
Tomorrow, tell me when we go outside.

290
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,760
Okay, I got this one right.

291
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,740
Judging from the number of cameras,

292
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,610
he's planning on making his decision
in a short amount of time.

293
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,400
A normal person would probably give himself away,

294
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,570
but you're messing with the wrong person, L.

295
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,610
This is as far as you'll get.

296
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,420
I've written down criminals in the Death Note
so that they'll continue to die over the next three weeks.

297
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,930
But Kira has already shown L
that he can control the time of death.

298
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,560
So in this case,

299
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,320
current criminals being broadcast on the news

300
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,200
have to die while I'm not receiving any knowledge of them.

301
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,190
Oh no!

302
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,690
My withdrawal symptoms!

303
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,110
Just watch, L!

304
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,830
With Ryuk's information and my prior preparations,

305
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:29,650
I can kill criminals currently
being broadcast while masquerading...

306
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,710
as a regular high-school student.

307
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll solve equations with my right hand...

308
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,590
and write names with my left.

309
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,890
I'll take a potato chip...

310
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,390
and eat it!

311
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,470
After dinner, your son has continued studying
without turning on a television or computer, hasn't he?

312
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,530
It's because the entrance exams are fewer than ten days away.

313
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,510
Now a criminal whom I should have no knowledge about will die of a heart attack in forty seconds.

314
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,470
The witness to my alibi is L himself.

315
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,310
All right, just a little more!

316
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,390
Ryuzaki.

317
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,940
What is it, Watari?

318
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,630
Two people just broadcast on today's nine o'clock news,

319
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,030
a bank clerk on suspicion of embezzlement during questioning

320
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,240
and a purse snatcher in a detention center

321
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,220
just died of heart attacks.

322
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,540
It's Kira!

323
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,290
During that time in your home,

324
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,840
your wife and daughter were watching a drama.

325
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,800
As soon as that was finished, they turned off
the television and didn't watch anything afterwards.

326
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,140
From just past 7:30 until now, 11 o'clock, the only thing your son has done is study.

327
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,150
Kira needs a face and a name to kill.

328
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,650
Those who did not watch the news can't be Kira, huh?

329
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,190
My family is cleared now, right?

330
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,100
Kira killed people with minor crimes

331
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,480
as soon as they were broadcast, didn't he?

332
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,890
Even if it is the same day that the cameras were installed,

333
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,750
the Yagami household is interestingly in the clear.

334
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,920
Light, are you awake?

335
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,090
Yeah, I'm awake.

336
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,840
Today is trash day, so bring out any garbage if you have any.

337
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,040
What a pain!

338
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,510
What are you talking about?

339
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,390
I always say you should be doing this
without me reminding you!

340
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,650
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,460
The weather today is nice.

342
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,240
Well, I don't know if you'll do
just about anything if it's for yourself,

343
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,200
or if you're just a big spender,

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,360
but didn't that mini LCD-TV

345
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,860
cost 39,800 yen?

346
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,480
This is great. There's nothing to worry about.

347
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,460
This proves that they don't have anything on me.

348
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,340
It's a contest between L and me.

349
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,800
It's a game of wits!
