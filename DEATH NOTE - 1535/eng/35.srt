1
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,710
Near, it went well.

2
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,710
I did everything that you told me to do.

3
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,740
Okay.

4
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,300
"T"...

5
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,730
That is all I have to tell you today.

6
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,300
Very well.

7
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,880
I also have something I want to tell you.

8
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,770
Go ahead.

9
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,480
I've confirmed it.

10
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,450
Hm? A text message?

11
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,200
Ooh... It says "I want to see you."

12
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,070
I'm so envious!

13
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,920
I did it! That's the confirmation sign from Mikami.

14
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,310
I just have to wait for Near to ask to meet me.

15
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,510
Near, I've won!

16
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,050
I predicted from the very beginning how you would move.

17
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,020
This is Gevanni.

18
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,520
Near, I've checked the notebook.

19
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,390
For the past three days,

20
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,600
he's filled out one page a day every night past midnight
as he usually does. The victims match up.

21
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,940
There's been no change in Mikami's behavior.

22
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,030
I understand.

23
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
Then let's begin.

24
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,950
Oh, it's Near!

25
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,750
He called!

26
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,330
L.

27
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,880
What is it, Near?

28
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,380
I want to meet you.

29
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,300
What?

30
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,710
I must meet you to discuss the Kira case.

31
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,160
But don't you suspect me of being Kira?

32
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,050
You shouldn't want to meet me.

33
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,680
Well,

34
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,170
there is something that I cannot show you

35
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,690
unless I show my face.

36
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,190
Everything will be resolved once I do that.

37
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,900
Fine.

38
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,450
I want you to realize that you are wrong
about me as soon as possible.

39
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,450
The time has finally come for Near to prove that Light is Kira.

40
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,420
If Light is Kira, then for him to kill Near,

41
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,510
he has to...

42
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,370
Let's agree on some rules regarding our meeting.

43
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,090
Yes. Anything.

44
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,800
To start off,

45
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,910
all of our investigators must be present at the meeting.

46
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,310
In other words, everyone who is pursuing Kira will gather.

47
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,020
I understand. That's fine.

48
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,150
As I said before,

49
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,110
there are a total of four SPK members, including myself.

50
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,810
Mr. Mogi, who is here, will accompany us.

51
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,080
Amane will be released right before we meet. She will not be told where we'll be heading.

52
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,370
We shall meet you once you confirm that Amane has been released.

53
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,710
How about it?

54
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,360
What should we do?

55
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,130
Near, I understand.

56
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,500
We have five investigators, including myself.

57
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,640
No, Mogi is with you, so aside from me, there are three.

58
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,420
Very well.

59
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,600
Now about the location of the meeting...

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,900
Daikoku Wharf.

61
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
An abandoned warehouse

62
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,740
on the outskirts of the southeast side,
nicknamed the Yellow Box.

63
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,200
I've already purchased the lot if it is all right with you.

64
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,270
How about it, Yagami Light?

65
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,080
You should be able to put your plan into action here.

66
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,420
One more thing.

67
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,920
I want you to bring with you the notebook that you have at your headquarters.

68
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,510
Why the notebook?

69
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,930
A simple reason:

70
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,790
there's no one to guard the notebook

71
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,430
if everyone leaves.

72
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,410
I promise you that I will not try to steal it.

73
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,690
I won't even lay a finger on it.

74
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,530
I'll place my faith in you

75
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,930
if Mr. Aizawa can confirm
that it's the notebook from your headquarters.

76
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,200
All right.

77
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,120
Someone other than L will hold onto it

78
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,140
because I believe that L is Kira.

79
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,920
I understand. But I will decide who holds onto it. Is that all right?

80
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,240
Yes.

81
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,550
Then all that's left is the time and date.

82
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,920
The time and date... The question is what time.

83
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,140
Mikami kills right after midnight. In the morning,
he'll probably be receiving a notice of the people to kill.

84
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,060
Taking his movements into consideration...

85
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,140
In three days.

86
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,590
On the 28th. How about 1 p.m.?

87
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,580
One o'clock, huh?

88
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,210
Just as I expected.

89
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,660
Near is calculating Mikami's movements.

90
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,560
That's fine.

91
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,660
It doesn't matter what time it is.

92
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,160
Then three days from now at one o'clock.

93
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,080
Got it.

94
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,310
Near.

95
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,880
Yagami Light.

96
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,500
I know what your plan is!

97
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm going to win!

98
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,100
Sorry, Miss Takada.

99
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm a little busy today.

100
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,690
Busy? Does that mean that you can't stay until morning?

101
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,190
Yeah.

102
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,810
Sorry.

103
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,030
The police are going to have
their hands full for two to three days.

104
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,490
How unfortunate...

105
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,160
I've already given orders to Mikami and Takada.

106
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,700
This is the final order

107
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,290
to kill Near.

108
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,800
Protect Miss Takada!
It's a rebel!

109
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,850
Miss Takada, are you unhurt?

110
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,580
Yes.

111
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,600
He's getting away! Give chase!

112
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Miss Takada, please get inside NHN quickly!

113
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Don't!

114
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,600
If someone like that was just here,

115
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,110
it's too dangerous in or around NHN!

116
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,610
Mello!

117
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,440
At any rate, you should get away from here!

118
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,150
Miss Takada, please get on!

119
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,260
Quickly!

120
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,150
Miss Takada, it's all right.

121
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,590
Get on quickly and get out of here.

122
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,160
Okay...

123
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,540
Team A and Team B, follow Miss Takada by car.

124
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,130
The other teams go after the car that just sped off!

125
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,270
All right! We've confirmed her safety.

126
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,220
Get Miss Takada to car number seven.

127
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,570
I-It can't be!

128
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,650
He's taking Miss Takada?!

129
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,950
D-Dammit!

130
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,410
You idiot! Stop!

131
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,620
What if you hit Miss Takada?!

132
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,830
Wh-What are you doing?!

133
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,100
One of them is heavily armed.

134
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,860
Miss Takada's escort team and the police are hot on the trail.

135
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,610
Th-This is really bad!

136
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,860
Is it Near again?

137
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,280
Near, you promised that we'd meet three days from now.

138
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,320
What's the meaning of this?

139
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,460
No, this isn't his style. It's more like...

140
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,500
It's Near!

141
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,250
So it's the cars that got ahead of me, huh?

142
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,690
Just how many escorts does that Takada have?

143
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,900
Come on!

144
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,740
Since when were the Japanese allowed to carry such big guns?

145
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,040
I'm an accomplice in the kidnapping of Miss Takada.

146
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,330
Don't you want to question me?

147
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,870
You wouldn't shootâ€”

148
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,850
Idiot. He probably wouldn't have told us anything.

149
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,710
Death is the only way to pay for defying Kira.

150
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,100
This guy is...

151
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,660
the person whom Yagami warned me
to be most careful of: Mello.

152
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,490
Mihael Keehl...

153
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,030
Take off everything you're wearing and put it in there.

154
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,830
Quickly.

155
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,500
I'll give you a blanket.

156
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,420
L, the one who kidnapped Takada

157
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,470
was not me.

158
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,920
I see. If that's the case,

159
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
then it was Mello.

160
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,590
Indeed.

161
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,170
I'll tell you honestly.

162
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,760
The individual whom I had guard Takada

163
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,890
has confirmed that Mello was the one who abducted her.

164
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,520
I'm sorry this happened while we had an escort with her.

165
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,810
Near, can't you contact Mello?

166
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,740
No, it's impossible. I have a method,

167
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,360
but there is no way that Mello would respond in this situation.

168
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,910
Let me take off my underwear

169
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,040
after I wrap the blanket around me.

170
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,910
Fine.

171
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,200
The escort team was forced to shoot one of the perpetrators.

172
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,780
They are still tracking Miss Takada's whereabouts.

173
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,210
It's definitely no good, is it, Light?

174
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,830
Yeah.

175
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,090
Takada's cell phone is turned off.

176
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,460
I want to get in contact with Takada if at all possible,

177
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,240
but right now, all I can do is wait.

178
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,420
This is the only thing that can be done. If I don't do it...

179
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,130
We are still unable to identify

180
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,130
the man who was shot.

181
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,670
Matt,

182
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,650
I never thought you would be killed.

183
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm sorry.

184
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,090
Light!

185
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,820
Impossible!

186
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Everyone, be quiet.

187
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,200
Yes?

188
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,500
Yagami, I...

189
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,160
Miss Takada?!

190
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
Miss Takada, are you all right?!

191
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,980
The only reason that she'd call me
without notice in this situation

192
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,510
is because she escaped from Mello, or...

193
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,250
Yagami, save me!

194
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,390
It's all right.
Calm down and answer my questions.

195
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,390
All right.

196
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,560
First, your location.
Do you know where you are?

197
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,230
I don't know where I am.

198
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,400
I was put into a truck. It was locked from the outside.

199
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,510
We went on the freeway and I once saw a sign
that said we were heading to Nagano.

200
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,550
Right now, I'm inside a building.

201
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,750
Miss Takada, you're Kira's spokesperson.

202
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,520
Do you remember telling me
that there might be people who are after your life?

203
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, I remember.

204
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,510
We talked about what you would do in that situation.

205
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,970
Do you remember?

206
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,600
I remember.

207
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,520
I did as you said.

208
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,520
I did it.

209
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,270
She did it!

210
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn't struggle even when I was stripped naked.

211
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,270
I did exactly as you said.

212
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,210
I made survival my first priority

213
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,620
and I did it.

214
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,090
Yagami, I did everything you told me to do.

215
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,460
Come quickly... Save me!

216
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,580
Miss Takada...

217
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,190
You know what to do afterwards, don't you?

218
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,180
Do as many killings as possible while I still can...

219
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,410
I-I know...

220
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,430
But Yagami...

221
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,350
You can do it, can't you?

222
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,240
I can...

223
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,750
Aizawa, Ide, let's go.

224
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,490
Okay.

225
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,620
Matsuda, take care of headquarters.

226
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,370
All right.

227
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,000
It's me...

228
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,790
Send me as many names as you can of those to be punished.

229
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,340
My email address is...

230
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,820
Yes. Yes, I understand.

231
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,230
The fact that she's called me like this

232
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,350
means that she's killed her kidnappers.

233
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,810
Then the only thing that's certain is that she's in a situation where she can't make any moves.

234
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,990
Nakajima, I'm heading to the crime scene for the case.

235
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,820
Okay.

236
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,570
We've discovered the location by tracing the call.

237
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,130
Head to Karuizawa by freeway.

238
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,900
Karuizawa, huh?

239
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,830
Damn. It'll take at least thirty minutes.

240
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,530
Please hurry.

241
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,150
It's Mello. We don't know what he'll do.

242
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,500
Yeah.

243
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,180
For God's sake... Aizawa and Ide are so stupid!

244
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,770
They both got into the front seats without a thought.

245
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,640
This is just too easy.

246
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,440
This scene... Mello!

247
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,060
What's going on?!

248
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,330
Takada Kiyomi, suicide.

249
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,730
January 26th, 2013,

250
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,240
2:32 p.m.

251
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,260
Burns to death by setting fire to everything around her,

252
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,090
including the things she wrote on.

253
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,260
It'll end now.

254
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,960
No,

255
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,340
today is just the beginning.

256
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,590
Kira's perfect world.

257
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,220
Everyone who knows about the notebook

258
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
shall die!
