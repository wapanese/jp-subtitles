1
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,880
Near, I think it's time you to tell us
your thoughts about this case.

2
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:36,990
The current Kira is foolish, and his exchange
with the Japanese task force was far too convenient.
Near, I think it's time you to tell us
your thoughts about this case.

3
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,180
The current Kira is foolish, and his exchange
with the Japanese task force was far too convenient.

4
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,450
Taking that into consideration,

5
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,040
Kira is probably conspiring with the Japanese task force.

6
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,170
Conspiring?

7
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,670
If that's the case, then Kira is...

8
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,560
the Second L.

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,500
I-It can't be!

10
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,560
Are you serious, Near?

11
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,820
Yes.

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,590
I'm only seven percent sure, though.

13
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,100
Commander Rester,

14
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,290
we have to make assumptions during investigations.

15
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,100
If we're wrong, we can just apologize.

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,320
There have been fewer crimes in Japan lately.

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,140
If you do something bad,
your name will be posted on the Internet

18
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,120
and Kira will kill you.
That's what my dad told me.

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,220
What's your name?
and Kira will kill you.
That's what my dad told me.

20
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,900
Come on, if you don't tell us your name, we can't file a report.
and Kira will kill you.
That's what my dad told me.

21
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
Come on, if you don't tell us your name, we can't file a report.

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,630
Give me a break!
Anything but my name!

23
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,630
I'm going to post your names on the Internet!

24
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,250
I will declare this right here!

25
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,770
Kira is justice!

26
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,810
It is absolutely true that I was appointed
by Kira as his spokesperson.

27
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,790
Some people may try to kill me because of this.

28
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,890
But!

29
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,900
I am prepared to risk my life to spread Kira's word around the world.

30
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,080
Kira's Kingdom, huh? What a horrible title.
I am prepared to risk my life to spread Kira's word around the world.

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,690
The world's come to an end.
I am prepared to risk my life to spread Kira's word around the world.

32
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,400
I am prepared to risk my life to spread Kira's word around the world.

33
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,380
Persecuting Kira is an unforgivable act
and should be considered a crime.

34
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,590
We should really kill this guy.
Persecuting Kira is an unforgivable act
and should be considered a crime.

35
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,300
If you see someone trying to find Kira, whether that person is a police officer,
We should really kill this guy.

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,450
If you see someone trying to find Kira, whether that person is a police officer,

37
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,890
a regular citizen, or a criminal, bring charges against them!

38
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,450
Oh, the president's press conference is about to begin.
a regular citizen, or a criminal, bring charges against them!

39
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,540
Oh, the president's press conference is about to begin.

40
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,910
What could it be about?

41
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,160
They said that it was an announcement to the world.

42
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,670
You're always watching TV, aren't you?

43
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,900
We, the United States of America...

44
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,260
Could it be?

45
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,690
accept Kira

46
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,460
and will do nothing to stand in his way.

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,280
This is insane!

48
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,740
I did it! The United States has bowed down to Kira.

49
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,260
Wh-What is he talking about?

50
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,950
Is he afraid of Kira?!

51
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,650
Mr. President, explain this!

52
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,950
When was this decided?!
Mr. President, explain this!

53
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,370
When was this decided?!

54
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,600
Explain yourself!
Give us more details!

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,370
Are you saying that Kira is justice?!

56
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,850
Are you?!

57
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,800
Justice? I didn't say that.

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,990
But war no longer exists because of Kira.

59
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,840
Criminal organizations are in a state of ruin,
not only in the United States, but around the world.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,660
Make no mistake.
Whoever defies Kira directly will be killed.

61
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,600
We know that Kira does not stand for justice,

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,560
but as a country, we will not take any actions to catch Kira.

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,110
That's the same thing! You idiot!

64
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,390
You just announced that you accepted Kira!

65
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,700
Please explain!
You just announced that you accepted Kira!

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,740
You're fleeing?!

67
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,530
Can you really call yourself the leader of our country?!

68
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,550
I don't believe it.

69
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,860
This is the U.S. we're talking about...
It's their president's word.

70
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,850
Uh... I'd like to ask a serious question.

71
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,690
What is it all of a sudden?

72
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,540
So you're saying that you aren't always serious?

73
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,550
In the depths of your heart, do you think that Kira is evil?

74
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,440
What?!

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
What do you mean, Matsuda?!

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,890
To tell the truth, I don't think he's completely evil.

77
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,260
You believe that Kira is justice?

78
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,930
I don't know.

79
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,380
But I think that Kira is fighting evil.

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,940
The world has definitely become
a good place for people who live honestly.

81
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,760
You're wrong, Matsuda.

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,290
They're afraid of the carnage.

83
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,800
It's not true peace.

84
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,960
I know. I know that!

85
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,340
But I understand the feelings of those who call Kira a savior!

86
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,330
I've always been

87
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,160
a weak person.

88
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,850
But I'm a detective.
I can't accept Kira.

89
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,270
I understand that and want to catch him as a part of my job.

90
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,350
Not being able to completely denounce him...

91
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,160
My head's probably messed up.

92
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
There's nothing wrong with you, Mr. Matsuda.

93
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,060
Light, you too?
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,900
Kira probably knows that what he's doing is evil.

95
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,450
He'll change the world even if he becomes a martyr.

96
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,740
That is the form of justice that Kira has chosen.

97
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,080
That's probably what Kira thinks.

98
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,210
We shouldn't argue over whether Kira is good or evil.

99
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,250
We just have to catch Kira.

100
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,880
If Kira is caught, he is evil.

101
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,550
If Kira rules the world, he is justice.

102
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,940
But the world is rapidly coming to Kira's side.

103
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,460
Soon Kira will be justice.

104
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,130
What'll happen to us?

105
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,910
We've been dissolved thanks to that chicken of a president.

106
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,620
No, not even a chicken.

107
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,450
He's lower than a maggot.

108
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,500
You've got to be kidding.

109
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,460
There's no way that accepting Kira can be good.

110
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,450
You're alive?

111
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,950
Near!

112
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,560
What should we do?

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,630
Let him in.

114
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,390
Welcome, Mello.

115
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,680
Throw down your gun!

116
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,500
Everyone, please put down your guns.

117
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,650
It is meaningless for us to shed blood here.

118
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,070
But Mello killed the others.

119
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,120
Don't make me repeat myself.

120
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,690
Our goal is to catch Kira.

121
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,120
Right now, killing Mello will not benefit us.

122
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,540
All right...

123
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,690
Have things gone as you planned, Near?

124
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes. You've heard from Lidner, haven't you?

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,220
About the Second L...

126
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,600
I've pretty much figured out who Kira is
because of everything you've done.

127
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,730
Near!

128
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,230
I'm not your tool to solve your puzzles!

129
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,950
Mello, shoot me if you want.

130
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,370
Mello!

131
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,060
If you shoot Near, we'll have no choice but to shoot you.

132
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,430
What'll happen if you both die?

133
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,130
Only Kira will be happy.

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,310
That's true.

135
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,650
Near, I just came to retrieve the photograph you have of me.

136
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,470
Yes.

137
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,470
This is the photograph.
There's only one and there are no copies.

138
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,010
I've already dealt with everyone
who knows your face at Wammy's house, and elsewhere.

139
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,410
I can't guarantee it,

140
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,940
but it's safe to say you won't be killed by the notebook.

141
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,160
Is that all, Mello?

142
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,850
Near...

143
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,410
I have no intention of working with you.

144
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,850
I know.

145
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,850
But it'll upset me if I just take my picture and leave.

146
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,070
The killer notebook...
It's a Shinigami's notebook.

147
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,150
Whoever touches it can see a Shinigami.

148
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,360
That's crazy!

149
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,130
Who would believe that?!

150
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,320
I believe him.

151
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,870
What good would it be for Mello to tell a lie like that?

152
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,250
He would at least tell a better lie,
or something that has some truth to it.

153
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,540
Therefore, Shinigami really do exist.

154
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,080
The notebook I had was one that belonged to someone other than a Shinigami.

155
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,340
Also, there were fake rules within the rules written in it.

156
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,350
That's all I can tell you.

157
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,610
Near.

158
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,530
Mello.

159
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Which of us is going to get Kira first?

160
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,790
The race is on.

161
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,640
Our destination is one in the same.

162
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,920
I'll be waiting for you.

163
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,900
Yes.

164
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,570
A fake rule...

165
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,960
Judging from previous events, there's no doubt that the notebook
can cause heart attacks and control its victims, to a degree.

166
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,110
As for burning or tearing the notebook...

167
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,790
The book still exists and there is no way to test it.

168
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,580
In that case...

169
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,880
The fake rule is the rule

170
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,840
that a person will die if he doesn't write a name within thirteen days.

171
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,240
Gevanni.

172
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,810
Get me L.

173
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,510
Yes.

174
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,440
It's from Near.

175
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,710
Yes?

176
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,130
L, we've caught Mello.

177
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,650
But he escaped.

178
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,650
However, we were able to interrogate him a little.

179
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,120
He didn't escape.
You let him escape.

180
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
Isn't that right?

181
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,330
No, he really did escape.

182
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,210
By the way, Mello said that there is
a Shinigami attached to the notebook.

183
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,120
Have you been able to confirm any such entity?

184
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,690
Yes. Shinigami do exist.

185
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,970
I kept it a secret because I didn't think that you'd believe me.

186
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,630
I'd like to talk to the Shinigami about some things.

187
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,730
I don't want to talk.

188
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,630
The thing that bothers me the most is the fact that

189
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,860
there is a fake rule among the rules
written within the notebook.

190
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,160
There's a fake?

191
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,780
Yes.

192
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,830
L, tell me what you think.

193
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,660
Which rule do you think is a fake?

194
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,450
By elimination, it would have to be the one

195
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:44,850
that requires the owner of the notebook
to write a name within thirteen days, or he'll die.

196
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,390
I thought you'd say that.
I think so too.

197
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,110
Shinigami. Was there a fake rule
among the rules written within the notebook?

198
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,690
No, there aren't any.

199
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,690
So there's a Shinigami there?

200
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,890
Yes.

201
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,530
I see...

202
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,820
I pretty much get the picture.

203
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,530
In other words,

204
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,540
Kira is there and he's making the Shinigami lie.

205
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,680
This guy's amazing.
He got it right.

206
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:23,510
Even if the Shinigami is lying, it doesn't mean anything.

207
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,050
No. It would mean that it was meaningless to detain Light.

208
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,900
If the rule that a person has to continue to write names is fake,

209
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,060
then it's meaningless that he spent more than thirteen days doing nothing.

210
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,330
B-But that's wrong!

211
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,050
There's no way that Light is Kira.

212
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,900
The Deputy Director confirmed that he didn't have a notebook, and passed away.

213
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,410
Well then, how about testing it in this way?

214
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,750
I will write Mello's name in the notebook.

215
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:08,840
When Mello dies, and if I die thirteen days later, Kira wins.

216
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,170
I don't mind.

217
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,930
Wh-What? So it's just a matter of winning or losing?

218
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,900
Even if testing the thirteen-day rule
benefits the Kira investigation,

219
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,350
there shouldn't be any drawbacks.

220
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,020
I shall put my life on the line.

221
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,990
If I reject this offer on my own, it'll give a bad impression.

222
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,940
Wait a moment.

223
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,820
We need to think about that suggestion.

224
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,700
Give me your honest opinion.

225
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,480
It's easy to say that we should honor human life

226
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,770
and we shouldn't do that,
but I was the one who was confined.

227
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,250
It's strange for me to be saying that.

228
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,130
This is awkward...
I want to see the Deputy Director avenged.

229
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,300
I think that Near should do it if he wants to.

230
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,540
I'm against it.

231
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,230
I don't believe that Kira is among us.

232
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,310
We shouldn't kill anyone with the notebook.

233
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,310
Yes. We should follow the Deputy Director's will.

234
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,060
I'm also against testing the notebook.

235
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,020
Near, we cannot allow you to test the notebook.

236
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,270
I thought you would say that...

237
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,490
And lastly, one more thing.

238
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,930
To the members of the Japanese task force:

239
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:27,210
was there ever a time that you thought your Second L was Kira?

240
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:33,720
If you've listened to the conversation and want to help my investigation,

241
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,890
call the number that I'm going to give you.

242
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,750
I'll answer.

243
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,040
There's no way that Light could be Kira.

244
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,770
No, I just don't want to think that.

245
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,480
But...

246
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,520
If the thirteen-day rule is fake,

247
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,990
it's true that we can't say that he's innocent.

248
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,910
Near... I have to kill him!

249
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,160
It's me.

250
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,920
This is Kira.

251
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,460
I-Is-Is this a prank?

252
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,320
I will read you a list of people whom I'm going to punish tomorrow.

253
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,890
Check it and make your decision.

254
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,810
Mr. President,

255
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,480
I am very grateful that you have sympathized with me.

256
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,670
But that isn't enough.

257
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,350
The SPK is trying to catch me.

258
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,120
I want you to stop them immediately, and disband them.

259
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,070
At the same time, I want you to use American police, the CIA, the FBI,

260
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,080
and all other intelligence agencies

261
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,030
to find out where the SPK members are hiding.

262
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:58,390
Let me know immediately.
I will tell you how to contact me.

263
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,510
Mr. President,

264
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,950
it is your choice whether or not you live a long life.

265
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,900
Don't forget that.

266
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,980
All right...

267
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,110
Demegawa! Please wait!

268
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,510
Why are you suddenly going to New York?

269
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm going to crush an organization that's defying Kira.

270
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,290
It's going to be live!

271
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,580
This is an order from Kira.
I got a call from the President.

272
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,180
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore!

273
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,800
I don't care about anything!

274
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,090
I'll get 100%â€” no, 120% viewer ratings!

275
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,930
Come on, everyone!

276
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,120
The age of Kira is upon us!

277
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,400
The last L was suspicious of Light.

278
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,730
But I'll just be killed if he really is Kira

279
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,410
and I say that we should investigate him again.

280
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,200
The thirteen-day rule...

281
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,460
Aizawa.

282
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,570
I've known you for a long time.
I know what you're thinking.

283
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,430
You should do what you think is right.

284
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,930
I never trusted L to begin with.

285
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:30,490
I'm doing this because I want to work with you rather than with Light.

286
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,770
Ide...

287
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,810
I'll contact Near without letting Light know.

288
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,990
All right.

289
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,730
I'll make sure that no one knows what you're doing.

290
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,350
Light...

291
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,930
I want to believe...

292
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,010
that you're not Kira.

293
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,600
Big trouble! Demegawa's on TV and...

294
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,740
I, Demegawa, along with my comrades, have finally

295
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,160
pinpointed the location of and surrounded the hideout
of the evil organization that is trying to catch our god, Kira.

296
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,590
Right now, they appear to be hiding within this building!

297
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,590
Behold the power of the people!
The power of justice!

298
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,890
When Near escapes, I'll write his name in the notebook.

299
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,310
Light, I'm going to do my best!

300
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,430
Near, at this rate, we'll be dragged out...

301
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,940
L...

302
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,200
What's wrong, Near?

303
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,950
Is this a plan by Mello to finish off the SPK?

304
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:12,450
Or is the SPK is so poorly structured
that even the public was able to discover your location?

305
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,130
You and your lies...

306
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,420
I win, Near.

307
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,470
I can definitely use him.

308
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,920
He worships Kira from the bottom of his heart,

309
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,210
and he understands that by accepting the notebook, he was chosen.

310
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,760
There was nothing wrong with my choice.
