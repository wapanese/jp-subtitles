1
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,240
Delete.

2
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,070
The average Japanese adult would say that Mikami Teru

3
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,700
was a child with a strong sense of justice.

4
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,900
One who was able to distinguish right from wrong.

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,340
And compared to the average Japanese citizen,

6
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,590
Teru was also clearly more unfortunate.

7
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,390
He was a person who continually witnessed death.

8
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,460
Stop...

9
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,360
There is only good and evil in this world.

10
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,120
That is the first truth that I grasped from watching the world around me

11
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,370
ever since I was young.

12
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,320
All humans are split into two groups,

13
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,580
that of good and evil.

14
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,420
That held true even in a small world like elementary school.

15
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,050
As the class president,
no matter what lofty goals I tried to achieve,

16
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,880
there were always enemies.

17
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,820
Stop! Stop... Please.

18
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,320
Evil has to be confronted.

19
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,400
Get him good!

20
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,030
At times, it seemed as if justice had lost.

21
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,910
But I felt happy no matter what happened to me.

22
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,190
Thank you...

23
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,920
Those words from the victims
made me want to save them time and time again.

24
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,340
I didn't spare any effort for that.

25
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,680
In the end...

26
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,060
I was able to defend my sense of justice.

27
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,680
Just let him have it!

28
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,190
Come on, come on, come on...

29
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,490
But...

30
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,310
That was the case only within the world of children.

31
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,580
In middle school...

32
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,960
the more often I faced evil,

33
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,130
the more enemies I had to face.

34
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,570
Victims became participants.

35
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,800
Even observers

36
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,860
became influenced by evil and turned into enemies.

37
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,790
Justice must be served.

38
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,360
I must delete evil in order to do that.

39
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,490
The only one who understood me and was my ally

40
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,990
was my mother, who had raised me by herself.

41
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,040
No, it should've been my mother.

42
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,550
Teru, not everything in the world works the way you want it to.

43
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,050
Please stop.
There's no reason for you to be bullied.

44
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,050
There's no reason for you to be hurt like that.

45
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,460
You'll just look foolish.

46
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,550
Nothing will change, no matter how hard you try.

47
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,350
My mother was wrong. She wasn't virtuous.

48
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,690
She was a person who should not have existed.

49
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,900
Then a miracle happened.

50
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,280
The four enemies lost control of their car while joyriding without a license and died.

51
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
A bystander was killed.

52
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,380
That bystander was my mother.

53
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,630
The people I denied were deleted.

54
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,380
At first, I was scared.
I trembled from my heart.

55
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,890
However...

56
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,650
I was sure there were some people
who were happy due to this elimination.

57
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,680
The victims definitely were—

58
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,610
no, almost everyone in my class
must have been glad somewhere in their hearts.

59
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,570
I wasn't wrong.

60
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,730
There was a peaceful class.

61
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,080
There was definite retribution for evil deeds.

62
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,830
It is deserved and needed.

63
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Evil must be deleted.

64
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,090
That's all. Is there anything wrong with this record?

65
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,590
No. Thank you very much.

66
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,390
My beliefs became stronger with my growth.

67
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,070
There will always be those who have no reason to exist—

68
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,770
no, whose very existence is a threat to others.

69
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,190
And the older they are, the less hope I have to reform them.

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,940
They can only be deleted.

71
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,490
Surprisingly...

72
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,790
Time and time again, whomever I decided
should be deleted was deleted.

73
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,890
Was this a coincidence? Was I special?

74
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,720
Such questions aren't important.

75
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,220
Evil must be punished by the heavens.

76
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,640
If it isn't, then someone
must mete out punishment to that evil.

77
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,970
That is why I became a prosecutor.

78
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,150
A prosecutor is the good that punishes evil.
That's what I thought.

79
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,020
That's when...

80
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,050
God came before me.

81
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,660
Everything that had been happening around me
until now was not mere coincidence.

82
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,700
It was divine justice.

83
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,710
God was watching me.

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,580
How I did not kneel down before the face of evil...

85
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,720
And He punished them for me.

86
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,530
When I realized that,

87
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,720
I went to the place where I could grab
God's attention the best I could.

88
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,220
And...

89
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,090
God accepted me.

90
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,280
Not only that, but He shared his power with me.

91
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,750
I must respond to this.

92
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,580
I'll figure out what Kira wants and do what Kira would do.

93
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:58,830
Delete.

94
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,690
Mikami killed Demegawa before I gave the order,

95
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,070
but now there's no one to be Kira's spokesperson to the world.

96
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,100
I can't do anything in this situation.

97
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,790
What are you going to do, Mikami?

98
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,450
Kira isn't saying anything.

99
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,360
I guess he's in a situation in which he can't move.

100
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,610
But this is an important time.

101
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,630
We need someone to spread Kira's thoughts.

102
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,260
Then I will...

103
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,350
Extra, extra! A new development!

104
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,600
Kira has chosen a spokesperson to take Demegawa's place.

105
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,770
Take a look!

106
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,110
This woman...

107
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,150
Takada Kiyomi!

108
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,200
Good evening.

109
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
This is Takada Kiyomi of News 6.

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,710
Starting today, it is my duty to spread the word of Kira

111
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,520
accurately and quickly.

112
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,540
NHN's star newscaster, huh?

113
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,950
Kira has good taste, choosing Takki.

114
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,330
There's no mistake.
This girl is from Light's college days.

115
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,600
You dealt with it quickly, Mikami.

116
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,850
But the fact that she and I had a relationship will soon be...

117
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,730
No, she's not a bad choice.

118
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,360
I wouldn't have thought of her because I know her.

119
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,860
<i>Things may be getting easier.</i>

120
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,340
The police are calling for civilians to evacuate.

121
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,320
<i>I can definitely use him.</i>

122
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,830
I want to contact him as quickly as possible, but...

123
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,160
Takada Kiyomi...

124
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,210
I spoke to her when we were on a debate show.

125
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,670
She was a shrewd host,

126
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,300
but her attitude changed as soon as Kira was brought up.

127
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,500
She has a uniquely rigid way of thinking.

128
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,140
She hates crimes and social evils.

129
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,660
I talked to her privately several times afterwards.

130
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,950
She clearly thinks like Kira.

131
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,230
She is the broadcaster
who is most worthy of being Kira's voice.

132
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,200
Takada Kiyomi...

133
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,580
It would be too suspicious
to choose an ex-girlfriend as a spokesperson.

134
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,250
There was no sign of Light sending any messages.

135
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,880
Am I reading too much into this?

136
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,210
Everyone.

137
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,550
About our investigation...

138
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,220
I think we should incorporate Takada Kiyomi from now on.

139
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,520
To be honest, I was quite friendly with her during my college days.

140
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,700
Oh?!

141
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,180
He said it himself?!

142
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,230
That means he has no intention of hiding that fact.

143
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,140
If Kira is giving her orders to read messages,

144
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,650
it might be our best option
to find a way to get Kira through her.

145
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,440
But Takki is probably being threatened by Kira.
She may be too scared to help us.

146
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,750
That's true...

147
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,250
That's all right.
I know her cell phone number.

148
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,740
She'll surely meet me if I ask her to.

149
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,760
That's some confidence.
So typical of you, Light.

150
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,020
But it'll probably be difficult to get her to help catch Kira.

151
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,490
I talked to her about many things during college.

152
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,770
She's quite...

153
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,980
the Kira-worshiper.

154
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,110
But we can use that to our advantage.

155
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,150
Right now, even the police say that they support Kira.

156
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,270
But actually they're doing nothing.

157
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,620
So I'll reveal that I've joined the police

158
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,530
and ask her what I can do to get instructions from Kira.

159
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,630
It wouldn't sound like a bad idea to a Kira-supporter like herself.

160
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,640
Will it go well?

161
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,390
I don't know. But it's worth trying.

162
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,390
I agree, we shouldn't ignore a lead that's in plain sight.

163
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,960
Then let's do this tonight, if possible.

164
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,260
Light!

165
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,080
I want to listen to your conversation with Takada.

166
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,980
Sure. I don't mind.

167
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,780
Actually, I want you to listen.

168
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,460
We don't know when she may give us a hint about Kira.

169
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,870
Y-Yeah...

170
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,200
Hello?

171
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,800
Miss Takada, it's Yagami.

172
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,830
Yagami?!

173
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,780
It's been a while. What is it?

174
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,010
Miss Takada...

175
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,320
There's something important I have to tell you.

176
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,050
Could you meet me?

177
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,010
I want to ask a favor of you.

178
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,270
A favor?

179
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,270
Yeah... It might be impossible,
since you're the woman the whole world's watching.

180
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,570
But I don't think you would
have called if that wasn't the case.

181
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,780
You're right...

182
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,710
Since we left college,

183
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,030
I've wanted to tell you, but I never had the chance to.

184
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:16,140
But since we've had the chance
to connect through our jobs as adults,

185
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,800
I can't help but feel that it's fate.

186
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,820
What's this job?

187
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,970
I'm with the police right now.

188
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,550
There's also something I really wanted to tell you in person.

189
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,060
Right now, the police won't do anything to betray Kira.

190
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Fine. I may have to help you, depending on what you say.

191
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,120
Thank you. I just want you to meet me
and listen to what I have to say.

192
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,820
Somewhere... alone.

193
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,330
Okay. After tonight's broadcast is finished.

194
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,790
All right. I'll find a hotel room.

195
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,540
<i>Is that all right?</i>

196
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,710
Yagami, I thought you were living with Amane.

197
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,180
Are you still happy together?

198
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>Well, the truth is...</i>

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,510
she doesn't have the brains to be my partner.

200
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,600
Mochi.

201
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,230
Yes?

202
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,280
Your cooking is good, and I appreciate that you'd do anything for me,

203
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,610
but it's been five days.

204
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,620
Yes.

205
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,340
Light doesn't know about this, does he?

206
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm beginning to get a bad feeling about this.

207
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,240
Yes...

208
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,450
No matter how much Light trusts me,

209
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,370
wouldn't most people think that I might cheat on him?!

210
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,290
He'll definitely be jealous!

211
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,210
Near and the others told me
that this woman is the Second Kira.

212
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,140
But could this stupid woman really be?

213
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,170
Kira hasn't tried to contact me yet.

214
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,190
If Kira is in a situation in which he couldn't
contact me even if he wanted to,

215
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,600
he'll try to contact Takada first.

216
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,770
Good evening. This is the nine o'clock news.

217
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,770
Kira's words, which I am to tell you now, are to become the law of this world.

218
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,490
Kira will not forgive people
whose existence is deemed a threat.

219
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:18,250
Additionally, he will not tolerate people who live wastefully and do not use their abilities for the good of society.

220
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,980
Huh? Does that mean he'll kill lazy people?

221
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,000
You're kidding, right?!

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,340
You're overdoing it, Mikami.
No, it's too early.

223
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,670
I have to contact Mikami...

224
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,680
Matsuda, how is it?!

225
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,730
Yes, the sound and visuals are crystal clear.

226
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,680
No blind spots!

227
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,180
The nine o'clock news just ended.
See you again.

228
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,850
Light, I'll be heading back.

229
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,650
Okay.

230
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,970
I've wanted to see you...

231
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,450
Oh, excuse me. It's just...

232
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,940
Please have a seat.

233
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,400
It doesn't seem like it's been that long now that you're here.

234
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,130
What's wrong with Light?! He's silent.

235
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,800
He'll look suspicious if he doesn't say something quickly.

236
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Ide, have you ever been in love?

237
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,720
What?

238
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,620
How is it?

239
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,930
The mood's good.

240
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,770
That's not what I meant.

241
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,570
Sorry.

242
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,560
Kira...

243
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,900
Mikami?!

244
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,870
She just said Kira!

245
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,780
Kira's contacting her directly?!

246
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,040
You should answer it.

247
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,700
O-Okay.

248
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,390
Hello?

249
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,650
No, I'm with a friend.

250
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,200
There's no one else.

251
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,550
If luck is on my side, I'll get on the phone.

252
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,460
Mikami, can you bring me luck?

253
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,230
We decided to meet unexpectedly.

254
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,760
Someone who could privately call on Kira's spokesperson.

255
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,260
Pass the phone over to your friend.

256
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,730
He wants me to give the phone to you.

257
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,980
It was right to choose you.

258
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,300
She's passed the phone to Light...

259
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,150
It's dangerous if it really is Kira!

260
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,610
Hello?

261
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,320
Who are you?

262
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,820
November 26th? Five pages?

263
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,990
What are you talking about?

264
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,210
God!

265
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,290
All right, Mikami.
How much have you figured out?

266
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,280
You can't move freely now.

267
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,030
Yes.

268
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,920
You're being watched right now.

269
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,720
Yes.

270
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,930
Are you really Kira?!

271
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,480
Turn to Sakura TV!

272
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,230
Huh? Sakura TV?!

273
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,020
Sakura TV.

274
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,770
No matter what it takes, we're going to call back Kira!

275
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,800
He died!

276
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,650
This is bad! He's the real thing!

277
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,750
Mikami, you're better than I expected.

278
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,200
Yes...
Mikami, you're better than I expected.

279
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,530
Mikami, you're better than I expected.

280
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,910
Wh-What? Remove the wiretaps?!

281
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,790
We have no choice but to obey him.

282
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,720
What is the meaning of this?!

283
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,250
Now I can talk to you without constraints.

284
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,050
Huh?!

285
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,970
Listen, Kiyomi...

286
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,300
I'm Kira.

287
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,450
That's right. I'm Kira.

288
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,310
That's all.

289
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,230
Yagami is... Kira.

290
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,530
Listen. I won't allow you to ask Kiyomi

291
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,300
about who I am.

292
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,650
Yes. I leave the rest to you, God.

293
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,340
Understand?

294
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,100
I am Kira, and that man just now

295
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,750
is someone with whom I've shared Kira's power.

296
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,550
Y-You really are amazing.

297
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,760
You're the only man I've respected and admired my entire life.

298
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,860
For you to be Kira...

299
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,760
It's almost too good to be true!

300
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,690
With me,

301
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,460
you're going to become the goddess of the new world.

302
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,520
Yagami...

303
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,280
Light, are you all right?!

304
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,040
Yes. Things went well with Takada.

305
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,790
From now on, I'll be meeting with her

306
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,040
to find Kira.

307
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:24,580
Delete. Delete. Delete.

308
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,320
Come to think of it, since the beginning,

309
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,000
this has been a one-on-one battle against L.

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,020
Fine, Near. I'll come out if you're coming out.

311
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,840
I accept your challenge!
