1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,270
L,

2
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,310
I want to meet you.

3
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,860
Daikoku Wharf.

4
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,980
The Yellow Box.

5
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,400
On the 28th. How about 1 p.m.?

6
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,820
That's fine.

7
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,410
Take off everything you're wearing and put it in there.

8
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,660
I'll give you a blanket.

9
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,170
Miss Takada, are you all right?!

10
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,080
Yagami, I did everything you told me to do.

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,250
I made survival my first priority and I did it.

12
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,630
Come quickly... Save me!

13
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,260
Takada Kiyomi.

14
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,590
January 26th, 2013,

15
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,390
2:32 p.m.

16
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,060
Burns to death by setting fire to everything around her, including the things she wrote on.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,840
We are sad to announce that the Special Police
has confirmed in their autopsy report

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,370
that one of the bodies recovered
at the crime scene was that of Takada Kiyomi.

19
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,870
A two-ton truck and a motorcycle were found in the burnt-down church.

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,790
Officials suspect a gasoline fire.

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,880
I'm wondering

22
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,130
who's going to be Kira's next spokesperson?

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,560
Kira's voice should continue to be broadcast to the world.

24
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,390
It is very unfortunate that Newscaster Takada passed away,

25
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,670
but I have to say that with that kind of carelessness, she lacked a full appreciation for her position as Kira's representative.

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,730
A woman is not suited for this role.

27
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,610
Kira, make me your representative.

28
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,280
No. Give the honor to Sakura TV once again!

29
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,950
This is horrible.

30
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,540
Yeah.

31
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,080
As soon as Takada was annnounced dead,

32
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,380
every station has been debating over who should be Kira's spokesman.

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,890
The killings last night were carried out.

34
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,090
This means that Takada and Mikami had cell phone contact.

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
There's nothing to worry about.

36
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,270
It's Near!

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,890
L.

38
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,600
Yes?

39
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,130
Sorry to interrupt,

40
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,520
but we're going to meet...

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,320
on the 28th at 1 p.m. Is that still all right?

42
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,880
Yes.

43
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,540
There's no change,

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,610
just as I thought.

45
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,330
There's no mistake.

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,840
So the day after tomorrow, the 28th.

47
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,340
Got it.

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,600
The day after tomorrow, huh?
Isn't it exciting?

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,640
Yeah, I don't know what Near wants to show us, but...

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,150
Matsuda, Ide,

51
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,570
we all might be killed tomorrow.

52
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,650
Do you understand?

53
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,450
Gevanni.

54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,200
Yes.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,070
Will you make it in time?

56
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,450
Yes. It's not a problem.

57
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,020
Commander Rester, Lidner, Gevanni,

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
let's do our best.

59
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,450
Good morning, everyone.

60
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,030
G-Good morning.

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
First,

62
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,610
we've released Amane.

63
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,290
Call her for confirmation.

64
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,590
I don't know why, but I'm in a deluxe suite at the Teito Hotel.

65
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,570
Probably as some sort of compensation...

66
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,430
It feels great!

67
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,420
I see. All right.

68
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,600
Please stay there for a little longer.

69
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay!

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,570
Near, please get me Mogi.

71
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,780
In order to bring the notebook we have here,

72
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,030
we need PIN's from each of us.

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,580
All right. I'll connect you to him.

74
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,710
This is Mogi. The number is 62-324.

75
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,630
<i>All that's left is my number.</i>

76
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,310
<i>The Killer Notebook.</i>

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,350
How to use...

78
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,210
The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die.

79
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,280
This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name.

80
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,870
Therefore, people sharing
the same name will not be affected.

81
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,870
If the cause of death is written

82
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,870
within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,

83
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,120
it will happen.

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,710
If the cause of death is not specified,
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

85
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:48,130
After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

86
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,140
Near, I've got the notebook here.
I'll be bringing it with me.

87
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,150
Is it all right if Mr. Aizawa carries it, L?

88
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
Near,

89
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,490
my only concern is whether you think that Aizawa is best-suited for this task.

90
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,410
Thank you very much.

91
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,740
We'll see you there.

92
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,880
It's all going to end.

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,220
No, today is just the beginning.

94
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,390
Kira's perfect world...

95
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,980
Everyone who knows about the notebook...

96
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,000
shall die.

97
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,540
Near is inside. There's no mistake.

98
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,540
Well then, let's go.

99
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,620
Near, you're far inferior to L.

100
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,110
You have no right to wear a mask of L.

101
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,150
L, those four are the SPK.

102
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,360
Near is the one wearing the mask.

103
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,760
W-Wait, I have a problem with this.

104
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,300
I don't care whom he accuses of being Kira,

105
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,800
but that mask proves that he's trying to protect only himself.

106
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,680
This is just for insurance.

107
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,810
There is a chance that everyone's faces, excluding me, can be seen by Kira.

108
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,520
He may already have written down our names.

109
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,530
So for an hourâ€”

110
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:40,360
no, for half an hour, I want to see
if anyone becomes controlled or dies.

111
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,400
Wh-What's with that?
He's waiting to see if we die?

112
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,790
He's right... It's not impossible if Light is Kira.

113
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,370
Especially now... We're expendable.

114
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,910
This is just a front to buy some time, Near.

115
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,920
I never thought it would be so hard to keep myself from laughing.

116
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,330
Near's probably waiting for him to come.

117
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,930
I've already predicted that.

118
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,310
Near!

119
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,940
It's been over thirty minutes.
Nothing's happened!

120
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,190
Of course. Kira isn't here.

121
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,190
Fine. Everyone seems safe.

122
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,900
I'll remove my mask.

123
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,390
What's wrong, Near?

124
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,890
Are you still waiting for something?

125
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,940
Waiting... That's right.

126
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,100
I am waiting

127
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,710
for the one person who will solve everything to arrive.

128
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,860
One more person who will solve everything?

129
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,720
He'll come soon.
That's what I'm waiting for.

130
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,620
This building is enclosed.

131
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,620
You can't see inside without opening that door.

132
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,500
He'll come through that door,

133
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,920
or peek through it.

134
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,880
Who's going to come?

135
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,380
The one who is currently killing in Kira's place: X-Kira.

136
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,950
He'll come with the notebook

137
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,140
and he'll see me and write my name.

138
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,140
No, he'll probably try to kill everyone here
who knows about the notebook.

139
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,230
This...

140
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,170
This makes no sense.
What are you talking about?!

141
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,480
Are you saying that some third party is going
to come strolling by with the notebook and kill us?!

142
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,820
So we should just be quiet and watch this happen?!

143
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,290
That's right. Please listen.

144
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,180
If someone comes through that door,

145
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,830
just let him in.

146
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,210
If the door opens slightly,

147
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,000
act as if you don't notice.

148
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,710
Th-That's crazy. That wouldn't...

149
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,840
He's already here.

150
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,280
God!

151
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:32,200
Delete.

152
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,220
Please do not move.
Delete.

153
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,310
It's all right. You won't die.
Delete.

154
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,140
How can you be so sure, Near?!
Delete.

155
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,660
Delete.

156
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,230
I've tampered with the notebook.
Delete.

157
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,960
Delete.

158
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,860
We took possession of the notebook and replaced its pages.
Delete.

159
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,860
The person behind the door who is killing for Kira
Delete.

160
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,610
has been using exactly one page every day.
Delete.

161
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,540
So I replaced the pages for today
and all subsequent days so no one will die.
Delete.

162
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:08,880
Delete.

163
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,220
X-Kira, who's beyond that door,

164
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,160
will eventually look inside to see if we're dead.

165
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,160
We can catch him when he does.

166
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,420
The one whose name isn't written in the notebook is Kira.

167
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,940
Y-You're right...

168
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,130
The one whose name isn't written is Kira.

169
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,710
But...

170
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,020
Exactly as planned! Exactly as planned! Exactly as planned!

171
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,860
Tampering with the notebook...

172
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,490
I knew it all along.

173
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,790
Near, you've been completely defeated!

174
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,000
The notebook you tampered with
was the fake that I had Mikami prepare!

175
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,170
And now the one that Mikami is writing names in

176
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,420
is the real notebook that's been hidden!

177
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,350
I had Mikami make a fake notebook

178
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,400
and send Takada clippings from the real one.

179
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,690
In other words, Takada was the one who was really doing the killings.

180
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:56,280
I had Mikami write names in public numerous times in the fake notebook

181
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,990
so he would be noticed if he was being followed.

182
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,330
But even then, Takada was the one who was doing the killings.

183
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,540
That is how I made them believe

184
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,420
that the notebook that Mikami had was the real one.

185
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,470
Mikami's daily behavior can be called morbidly methodical.

186
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,670
He fills the notebook with names one page a day.

187
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,720
Near, you noticed that,

188
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,730
and thought of tampering with it.

189
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,190
In other words, you arranged it so that on the day of our meeting, the page would be on the right side.

190
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,620
You just had to change the pages for that day on.

191
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,700
If you did, no one would die from having their names written in the notebook.

192
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,910
That was your plan!

193
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,410
That's why the meeting date was unchanged.

194
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,290
But I knew you were going to tamper with the notebook,

195
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,010
so I had Mikami check the notebook every day.

196
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,170
I've confirmed it.

197
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,390
This match was settled at that point.

198
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,890
The notebook that Mikami brought today

199
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:07,940
was the real one I had him hide!
The notebook that Mikami brought today

200
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,730
was the real one I had him hide!

201
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,610
But, Near,

202
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,320
you had a chance.

203
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,120
You're soft.

204
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,950
You're nowhere as good as L was.

205
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,040
L would have noticed there was a possibility
that the notebook was fake,

206
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,920
and would have tested it.

207
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,090
You had the opportunity.

208
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,610
I'm completely disappointed in you.

209
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,880
This is no fun.

210
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,890
You tried to win too nobly.

211
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,140
Well, that's fine.
It's your fault. Everyone's going to die.

212
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,020
And I...

213
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,150
Kira will have a perfect victory.

214
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,210
To the person outside:

215
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,420
have you written the names down in the notebook?

216
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,170
God!

217
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,090
Yes, I've written them.

218
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,480
No, not yet. Don't laugh yet. Hold it in.

219
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,520
They're all going to die forty seconds after he's written everyone's names.

220
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,490
Thirty-five seconds...

221
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,190
I'll claim my victory after thirty-five seconds!

222
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,990
That's odd.

223
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,360
Why would he answer you calmly

224
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,080
when you asked him if he had written our names?

225
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,570
Who knows? Maybe he's honest?

226
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,330
No, he's confident?

227
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,900
Could it be that he's seen through your plan?

228
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,710
Huh? Then that means we're in big trouble!

229
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,090
Mikami Teru.

230
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,050
Come in if you'd like.

231
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,980
I know that you are doing the killings for Kira.

232
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,850
There shouldn't be anything to be afraid of if you've written our names.

233
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,230
Waltz right in.

234
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,780
Mikami Teru?

235
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,010
That's right.
Don't hide. Come in.

236
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,410
God!

237
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,390
Well done, Mikami!

238
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,270
How many seconds has it been since you wrote the first name?

239
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,650
Thirty...

240
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,620
Thirty-one... Thirty-two...

241
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,410
Thirty-three... Thirty-four...

242
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,160
Thirty-five... Thirty-six...

243
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,540
Thirty-seven...

244
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,920
Thirty-eight!

245
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,660
Thirty-nine!

246
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,130
Near, I win!

247
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,960
Forty!

248
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,840
That's right.

249
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,170
I'm Kira.
