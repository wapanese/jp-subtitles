1
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,450
Use it like that to kill the criminals who are broadcast.

2
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,210
Then you can use the notebook however you want.

3
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,830
Those are the conditions.

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
If everything goes according to Yagami Light's plans,

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
this is sure to save Misa.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,250
This is a good deal for both of us, isn't it?

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,050
Or I guess as you would say, it's good business.

8
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,390
Mr. Yagami, are you all right?

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,830
There's no reason for you to stay there like that.

10
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,900
It's been over a month since
Kira started to kill criminals again.

11
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,220
I am sure that my son isn't Kira.

12
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,160
Now, all that's left is for you to be sure.

13
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,660
I get out when my son does.

14
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,460
The Chief sure is stubborn.

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,250
Light, are you all right?

16
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,260
Yeah. I'm all right.

17
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,700
But, Ryuzaki, criminals
have stopped dying since I've been confined.

18
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,960
I think it's highly likely that Kira
is someone who knows about my situation.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,670
The logical conclusioâ€”

20
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,770
No, criminals are not dying because you are Kira.

21
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,820
No! I'm not Kira.

22
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,280
How many times must I say it?

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,890
Kira should know that the killings have begun again.

24
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,370
It doesn't seem like he knows.

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,040
This is cruel, Ryuzaki.

26
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,290
You still haven't told Light
that criminals are being killed again.

27
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,770
Amane.

28
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,500
Yes?

29
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,690
I know you're tired, but are you all right?

30
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,720
Are you stupid?

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,960
There'd be something wrong with me if I were all right after all this time.

32
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,760
Yes, that's true.

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,300
Let me go...

34
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,470
I want to see Light.

35
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,470
See Light...

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,850
It seems like all three of them are at their limit.

37
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,990
Ryuzaki, why are you still confining Light?

38
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,230
Let him go already!

39
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,410
If you do, the Chief will come out too.

40
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,440
Criminals are still being killed even though
Misa and Light aren't able to obtain any information.

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,380
We know at least that much.

42
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,620
No.

43
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,050
All we know is that Amane harbors
an unnaturally strong love for Yagami Light.

44
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,730
Ryuzaki, sorry, but I think that you're doing this

45
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,140
because you don't want to admit that you were wrong about Light.

46
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,970
I thought you might think that.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,780
As Light said,

48
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,480
Kira killed Lind L. Tailor and the FBI agents.

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
If Kira could kill under surveillance and without obtaining information,

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,990
then he wouldn't have needed to kill Tailor and the FBI agents!

51
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,410
No matter how hard we investigate, he can't be traced.

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,160
Kira doesn't kill without a reason.

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,590
You even said so yourself.

54
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,660
I see.

55
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,920
If he could kill in these circumstances,

56
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,620
he shouldn't have had a problem with leaving those FBI agents alone.

57
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
It's already been fifty days.

58
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,260
There's no reason to be doing this.

59
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,300
Besides that, we should be thinking of ways to catch the real Kira.

60
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,600
I understand.

61
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,570
Mr. Yagami.

62
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,650
What is it?

63
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,590
Will you return to task force headquarters?

64
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,710
I want you to hear my hypothesis on what's happening.

65
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,210
But first, I want to talk to you as Light's father.

66
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,170
All right.

67
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,610
I never thought that you would be an old man, Mister Stalker.

68
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,130
I'm not a stalker.

69
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,620
I'm a detective.

70
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,660
A detective?!

71
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,540
I remember now!

72
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,160
I was told that I was being arrested for being the Second Kira or something.

73
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,290
That was for real?

74
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,290
It couldn't be.

75
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,030
There's no way the police
would tie me up in such a fetish-like way.

76
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,050
Anyways, isn't it strange that my hands and feet
are restrained even though you're going to let me go?

77
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,960
Be quiet.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,920
Light!

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,490
Misa?
Light!

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,660
I was dying to see you!

81
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,450
Dad, what's going on?

82
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,960
Huh? Dad?

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,850
Oh, no! I called your dad a stalker and other rude things like that...

84
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,830
Pleased to meet you. My name is Amane Misa.
I'm currently going out with Light...

85
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,460
I leave it to you, Chief.

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,710
What's wrong?
Hurry up and get in.

87
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,980
We're finally cleared and are free to go, right?

88
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,650
No.

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,300
You two are now

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,150
being taken to your execution.

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,610
I volunteered to escort you to the execution site,

92
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,150
secretly built in an underground facility.

93
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,810
Our execution?

94
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,560
What?!

95
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,120
What are you talking about, Dad?

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,500
This is a joke, isn't it?

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,690
L has decided that Yagami Light is Kira

98
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,380
and Amane Misa is the Second Kira.

99
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,120
He decided that if you were executed,
the killings would stop.

100
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,990
Haven't the killings stopped?

101
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,900
No, they're still continuing.

102
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,440
Continuing?

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,630
That's not what he told me...

104
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,940
L was trying to get a confession out of you.

105
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,530
That's not the problem here.

106
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,850
L's suggestion that the killings
would stop if you two were eliminated

107
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,110
was immediately accepted by all the top officials
of the UN and the Japanese government.

108
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,690
Kira will be erased,

109
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,110
hidden from the public.

110
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,460
Th-That's crazy.
Wait, Dad, I'm not Kira!

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,830
That's right.
What are you thinking?!

112
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,340
He's your own son!

113
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,650
This is not my decision.

114
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,200
It's L's.

115
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,010
He has solved many difficult cases
in the past and has a perfect track record.

116
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,330
Dad...

117
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,720
You trust L more than you trust me?

118
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,920
L says that if the killings don't stop,

119
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,060
then he'll take responsibility and end his own life.

120
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,070
L, what are you thinking?

121
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,770
I understand that all of the physical evidence
points to this conclusion.

122
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,960
But this is wrong!

123
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,280
Why did L come to this conclusion?

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,220
Something's strange.

125
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,930
This isn't like L at all.

126
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,200
L's always used hard evidence in all of his cases.

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Is he planning to end it like this?!

128
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,670
We're almost there.

129
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,800
Where are we?

130
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,990
Why did you bring us out to the middle of nowhere?

131
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,010
What are you going to do?

132
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,110
Are you going to let us go?

133
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,360
Nobody will see us here.

134
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,620
I decided to bring you here instead of the execution site.

135
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,290
Light,

136
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,830
I'm going to kill you here and then kill myself.

137
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,200
Wh-What are you talking about, Dad?!

138
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,450
Stop it already! You're crazy!
Wh-What are you talking about, Dad?!

139
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,300
Th-That's crazy!
Stop it already! You're crazy!

140
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,530
Kill your child and then yourself?

141
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,010
If you want to die, then why don't you just die by yourself?!

142
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,010
If you do this, then you'll be no different from Kira!

143
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,100
No, I'm different from Kira.

144
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,770
I have a responsibility as a parent and as the Detective Superintendent!

145
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,850
Dad, Misa's right!

146
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,770
If we die here, we'll never find out the truth!

147
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,200
It would be better if we ran away!

148
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,480
It's too late, Light.
It would be better if we ran away!

149
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,570
Either way, you'll be executed.

150
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,320
At least this way, it'll be by my own hand.

151
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,120
Stop, Dad!
I'm not Kira!

152
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,410
If I die here, we all fall into Kira's trap!

153
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,540
Don't you see?!

154
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,290
Amane, I'm going to die here with my son.

155
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,840
I have no reason to kill you.

156
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,580
The police will probably find this car soon.

157
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,040
You'll be executed at the original site.

158
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,550
Light...

159
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
From one murderer to another, I'll see you in hell!

160
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,860
Dad!

161
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,820
Stop!

162
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,130
Light...

163
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,640
From one murderer to another, I'll see you in hell!

164
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,510
Dad!

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,180
A blank?

166
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,860
Thank goodness...

167
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,820
What are you doing, Dad?

168
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,110
Forgive me, you two.

169
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,560
This was the only way to free you from confinement.

170
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,500
But please understand...

171
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,010
I did this because I believe that you aren't Kira.

172
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,680
Were you watching, Ryuzaki?

173
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,480
I did as you said,

174
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,390
and as you can see, I'm still alive.

175
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,520
Yes, it was a convincing performance.

176
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,690
If Amane were the Second Kira,
who can kill just by knowing a person's face,

177
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,740
then she would have killed you before you fired.

178
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,650
Also, if Light were Kira,

179
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,100
the Kira I know would even kill his parents if he was in trouble.

180
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,530
In Light's case, I cannot deny the possibility that
he may have discovered it was all an act halfway through.

181
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,380
But as I promised, I will end their confinement.

182
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,970
Also as promised,

183
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,110
even though she insists
that those tapes were just occult videos,

184
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,770
I have physical evidence and a confession
that she sent the Kira videos.

185
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,620
So Amane Misa will remain under surveillance until Kira is caught and his case is resolved.

186
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,770
What's with that?
Do you still suspect me?

187
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,990
Well, you get to return to your everyday life.

188
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,750
If you're not guilty,

189
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,780
you can think of the surveillance as police protection.

190
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,520
I see.

191
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,610
Since I'm not the Second Kira,

192
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,530
I should think of it like I have some bodyguards.

193
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,120
Also, Light, as promised...

194
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,080
I will arrange things so that

195
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,460
you and I will be together 24 hours a day,
working on the investigation.

196
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,830
All right, Ryuzaki.

197
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,850
Let's catch Kira together.

198
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,060
Yes. I'm looking forward to working with you.

199
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,520
Is this really necessary, Ryuzaki?

200
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,530
I'm not doing this because I want to.

201
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,880
Huh? Is this what you meant by
being together with him 24 hours a day?

202
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,840
It's kinda gross for two men to be like that.

203
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,460
Ryuzaki, is that what you're into?

204
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,660
I told you, I'm not doing this because I want to.

205
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,250
But Light belongs to me...

206
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,090
If you're together with him 24 hours a day, then when will I get to go on dates with him?

207
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,250
Dates will be with the three of us.

208
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,640
Huh? Are you telling me we have to kiss in front of you?

209
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,550
I'm not telling you to do anything.

210
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,510
But I will be watching.

211
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,910
What's with that?

212
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,540
You really are a pervert, aren't you?

213
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,350
Light, please silence Misa.

214
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,840
Misa, don't be selfish.

215
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,120
You were definitely the one who sent the tapes.

216
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,420
Just be grateful that you're allowed as much freedom as this.

217
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,660
Huh? What are you talking about?

218
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,050
I'm your girlfriend, right?

219
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,700
Don't you trust your own lover?

220
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,940
G-Girlfriend?

221
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,600
You said you fell in love with me at first sight,

222
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,830
and now you're always forcing yourself on me.

223
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,670
S-So then you took advantage of that fact and kissed me?

224
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,420
You jerk!

225
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,420
About this "love at first sight" thing...

226
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,500
It happened in Aoyama on May 22nd, didn't it, Misa?

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
Yes.

228
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,250
Why did you go to Aoyama on that day?

229
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,680
What did you wear?

230
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,360
I told you, I just happened to go there. How many times have I told you?

231
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,290
I don't really remember how I felt that day or what I wore!

232
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,160
Is it so wrong for me to be hanging out
in Aoyama without a reason?

233
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,340
So when you came back from Aoyama,
you were in love with Light and knew his name.

234
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,890
Yes.

235
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,910
You don't even know how you knew his name.

236
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,370
Yes. That's right.

237
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,370
Then, how would you feel if Light were Kira?

238
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,100
Huh? If Light were Kira?

239
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,350
That's right.

240
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,300
That would be wonderful!

241
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,720
I've always been grateful to Kira
for punishing the man who murdered my parents.

242
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,480
If Light were Kira, I'd love him more,

243
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,060
though I love him so much already!

244
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,850
We're talking about Kira, here.

245
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,570
You'd love him even more?
Don't you feel afraid at all?

246
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,780
That's supposing if Light is Kira, right?

247
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,500
He's not scary at all.

248
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm one of those people who accept Kira.
I'd think of ways I could help him.

249
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,290
You'd probably get in his way rather than help him.

250
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,980
According to this, there's no mistake
that you're the Second Kira.

251
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,600
But it's so clear-cut that I don't want to believe it.

252
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Don't believe it, because I'm not Kira!

253
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,080
Anyway, you'll remain under surveillance.

254
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,510
When you go out, contact us using this room's extension.

255
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,970
From now on for private and work-related affairs,
Mr. Matsuda will accompany you as your manager, Matsui.

256
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,180
I've already paid off your agency to agree to this.

257
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,980
Hey there, I'm Matsui.
I've already paid off your agency to agree to this.

258
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,150
I haven't told them he's from the police, so be sure not to give yourself away.

259
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,740
This old man's gonna be my manager? How awful...

260
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,830
N-No way!
What's wrong with me, Misa-Misa?

261
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,900
Cut it out with all this dating, kissing, and Misa-Misa talk!

262
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,710
This is the Kira case!
Take it seriously!

263
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,220
S-Sorry.

264
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
No, I'm sorry.

265
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,220
I know we're serious,

266
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,090
but, Amane, go to your room now.

267
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,850
What?

268
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,260
No questions, c'mon.

269
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,650
Light! Let's go on a date, even if it's the three of us!

270
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,680
Light, are you serious about her?

271
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,570
No, as I said earlier, it's one-sided.

272
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,230
Then could you act as if you're serious?

273
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm sure that Amane's connected
to the Second Kira from the video incident.

274
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,650
And also from the way she loves you...

275
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,420
Are you asking me to become intimate with her

276
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,840
so I can find out information about the Second Kira?

277
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,350
Yes. I think you can do it.

278
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,650
And we could get clues to solve this case from Amane.

279
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,430
This is why I released both of you.

280
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,230
Ryuzaki...

281
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,880
Even if it's for the Kira case,

282
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,440
I would never use a woman's feelings like that.

283
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,450
I'm sorry, you need to understand.

284
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,900
To me, taking advantage of another person's feelings

285
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,410
is unforgivable, and is the most despicable thing a person can do.

286
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,060
There's something wrong.

287
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,530
I can only assume that his personality has changed.

288
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,380
Is this really an act?

289
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,590
At this rate, it sounds as if Kira was not only controlling Amane,

290
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,210
but Yagami Light as well.

291
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,280
What's wrong, Ryuzaki?

292
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,980
Nothing. You're right.

293
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,400
But it would be helpful if you could make sure

294
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,230
she doesn't leak any information about the investigation.

295
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,980
Ryuzaki, this system of moving to a new hotel every few days...

296
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,860
Can't we change it?

297
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,200
Yes. I've also been thinking about that.

298
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,200
That's why...

299
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,080
construction started immediately after

300
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,280
my first meeting with Mr. Yagami and the others,
when we decided to investigate together.

301
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,450
It will be completed in just a few more days.

302
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,420
This is it.

303
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,260
It has twenty-three floors above ground and two below.

304
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,900
It's built so you can't see them from the outside,

305
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,040
but there are two helicopters on the roof.

306
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,830
What?!

307
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,470
Incredible...

308
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,440
I would like all of you to spend as much time there as possible.

309
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,100
Even if the number of investigators increases
on this case, we can accommodate about sixty people.

310
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,530
Misa shouldn't have any complaints if we give her her own floor.

311
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,820
This is really amazing...

312
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,230
To go to these lengths...

313
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,700
By the way, Ryuzaki, where's the money
to pay for this coming from?

314
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,710
As you can see, I want to solve this case, no matter what.

315
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,960
That's what it means.

316
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,090
No, you dodged the question.

317
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,460
Yeah, that's right.

318
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,420
The mass murders are bad enough,

319
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,050
but I can't forgive the one
who put my dad and me through all of this.

320
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,010
I'll do whatever it takes to solve this.

321
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,020
Well, if you'll "do whatever it takes,"
then become intimate with Misa and investigâ€”

322
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,820
I can't do that.
It goes against my honor.

323
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,520
I see. That's too bad.

324
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,730
It's nothing.
I just feel very motivated.

325
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,430
Ryuzaki, Chief Yagami, Light,

326
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,800
let's all try to catch Kira, no matter what!

327
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,430
Yeah.

328
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,950
Excuse me... I wasn't included.

329
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,400
It seems we're all here.

330
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,670
Well then, let's begin our meeting.

331
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,230
To further the growth of the Yotsuba Group,

332
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,720
and for our company to become the biggest business in the world...

333
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,470
Whom shall we kill?

334
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,930
It's tough to kill someone every week.

335
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,820
This may be irrelevant,

336
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,170
but why has Kira begun killing like this?

337
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,330
Takahashi, haven't you already noticed?

338
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,990
Huh?

339
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,030
This is the most advantageous course of action for Kira.

340
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,740
Advantageous?

341
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,410
The fact that Kira began a killing service is advantageous, Higuchi?

342
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,400
I think you should keep quiet.

343
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,590
You might be killed if you're too stupid.

344
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,750
The eight of us here are still young,

345
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,460
but we're all aiming to land in the CEO's chair.

346
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,970
And since we started these meetings,

347
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,480
our salaries have been raised well
above the other employees'.

348
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,230
It's kind of odd that Kira would back a company.

349
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,610
No matter how I think about it,

350
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,330
one of us has to be Kira.

351
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,830
So, back to business. Does anyone have a proposal?

352
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,290
Whom should we have Kira kill to further our interests?

353
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,380
Humans...

354
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,050
are disgusting creatures.

355
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,790
No, you're not.

356
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,900
The way you talk...

357
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,630
It's as if you won't be satisfied unless I'm Kira.

358
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,970
Stop messing around, Ryuzaki!
