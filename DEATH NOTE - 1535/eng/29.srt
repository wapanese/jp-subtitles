1
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,020
You have to go outside and get some sunlight every so often.

2
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,000
What in the world...

3
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,500
should I do now?

4
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,040
Ryuk.

5
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,160
Shidou?

6
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,580
Why are you here?

7
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,370
Hey, don't follow me!

8
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,380
I want my notebook back.

9
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,300
Yeah, I figured it'd be that.

10
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,040
Well...

11
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,740
To be honest, things have become complicated
and I don't know where it is now.

12
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,680
That's so irresponsible.

13
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,050
You're still following me?

14
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,760
Give me back my notebook!

15
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,630
I don't know where it is!

16
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,320
If you want it back, go look for it.

17
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,620
Wammy's House wasn't simply an orphanage.

18
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,460
It was an institution for brilliant children

19
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,250
to raise them to become the Second L, L's successor.

20
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,770
L's successor...

21
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,230
The one who ranked at the top was a boy called Near.

22
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,260
Near... N, huh?

23
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,000
And the boy N mentioned, Mello,

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
was ranked next after Near.

25
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,320
Near is L's successor.

26
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,110
There's no mistake.
N is commanding the SPK.

27
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,070
No, Mello probably wanted to become L's successor.

28
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,330
If that's the case, Mello would probably want to use any means necessary to get the notebook before Near.

29
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,840
Near is convinced that Mello is involved.

30
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,430
He's certain that he is.

31
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,960
These are sketches of both of them.

32
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,550
There are no photographs of them.

33
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,340
L's successor...

34
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,670
I'm still...

35
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,220
fighting L.

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,850
At any rate, I have to figure out
where Mello and his Mafia associates are located.

37
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,850
I've already had Misa check a list of wanted Mafia members
At any rate, I have to figure out
where Mello and his Mafia associates are located.

38
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,070
I've already had Misa check a list of wanted Mafia members

39
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,780
with her Shinigami eyes.

40
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh! There he is!
Someone whose lifespan I can't see!

41
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,580
Number 105!
He's listed as Jack Neylon,

42
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,870
but his real name is Kal Snydar!

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,420
With the Death Note, I made Snydar
send a letter to tell me where his hideout is.

44
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,750
It should be coming soon!

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,800
Light!

46
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,300
You've got a letter!

47
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,550
He's in Los Angeles!

48
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,650
I did it! I've completely surpassed both of them!

49
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm definitely the strongest as long as I have the notebook and Misa's eyes!

50
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,960
Light, I've been a big help, haven't I?

51
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,340
Yeah.

52
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,120
I love you, Misa.

53
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,530
The only thing I have to do is see how far I can control people.

54
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,820
I'd like everyone to notice me

55
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,510
so I can talk to them.

56
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,540
The owner is Snydar.

57
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,090
I guess I have to make him touch the notebook.

58
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,490
Oh, well...

59
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,850
What?

60
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,970
The notebook moved on its own...

61
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,770
It's a notebook that can kill people.

62
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,840
I wouldn't be surprised if it were alive!

63
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,680
Whoa!

64
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,310
B-Boss! The guy with the dirty clothes...

65
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,810
Is he new?

66
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,270
I'm not a new guy.
I'm a Shinigami.

67
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,830
A Shinigami?

68
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,530
If you want others to see me,

69
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,320
you have to make them touch the notebook.

70
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,820
H-He says you'll be able to see him
if you touch the notebook...

71
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,200
Everyone, touch it!

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,250
There's nothing wrong with me!

73
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,210
Fine. Everyone...

74
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,130
Touch the notebook.

75
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,290
What's this?!

76
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,380
I couldn't see him before.

77
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,550
Boss, shall I kill him?!

78
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,510
It's no use. Humans cannot kill me.

79
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,520
It seems that this Shinigami's real, and it looks like he's telling the truth.

80
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,860
Ryuk.

81
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,680
Right now I'm going to relinquish ownership of this notebook.

82
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,230
Follow the person whom I give it to.

83
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,830
What? You're relinquishing your ownership?

84
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,400
Won't you lose your memory if you do that?

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,310
Misa, lend me your notebook.

86
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,130
If I do this, I won't lose my memory even if I relinquish my ownership.

87
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,010
I'll give you as many pages as you need.

88
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,720
From now on, you shall be Kira.
Can you handle that?

89
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,850
That's fine, but what are you going to do?

90
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,850
I'll explain that right now.

91
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,730
Mistakes will not be allowed.

92
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,700
Chocolate is good.

93
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,410
Hey! So is what you just said true?!

94
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,180
"If the person using the note

95
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,110
fails to continuously write names of people to be killed within 13 days of each other, then the user will die."

96
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,280
"If you make this note unusable by tearing it up or burning it,

97
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,420
all the humans who have touched the note till then will die."

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,590
These two rules were made up?!

99
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,090
Yeah. Those are definitely fake.

100
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,290
A Shinigami probably wrote that
as a joke before giving it to a human.

101
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,100
We can disprove the thirteen-day rule
by using a single person.

102
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,970
The question is whether this notebook has passed through the hands of Kira.

103
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,610
If it has, we'll know whether or not it's fake.

104
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,770
If we know,

105
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,160
we can use this rule.

106
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,870
The thirteen-day rule

107
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,120
can be proven in thirteen days.

108
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,540
Shidou, keep guard outside.

109
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,090
Huh?

110
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,100
You can't be seen by humans,
so at least you're useful for something.

111
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,260
Keep watch outside.

112
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,730
Got it?

113
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,940
What's with this guy?

114
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,740
He's terrifying for a human.

115
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,910
This is Yagami.

116
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,690
This is Kira.

117
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,420
What did you say?

118
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,370
Kira?

119
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,780
The notebook that the Japanese task force had in its possession

120
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,030
was stolen by criminals, wasn't it?

121
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,490
Kira...

122
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,240
Do you have any proof that you're Kira?!

123
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,040
Proof?

124
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,510
Now that the notebook has been passed,

125
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,960
there's no way I can prove that I'm Kira by predicting killings.

126
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,720
But soon you'll receive proof that I am Kira.

127
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,890
My notebook.

128
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,470
Wh-What is the meaning of this?

129
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,090
The notebook that I'm giving you

130
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,860
allows me to know a person's name by seeing their face.

131
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,980
Got that?

132
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,860
Calm down...

133
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,360
and listen to me...

134
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,500
On November 10th, at 11:59 p.m.,

135
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,620
every mafia member whom I have gathered information on

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,480
from the FBI and other organizations will die.

137
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,080
I've already written it in my notebook,
so it cannot be changed.

138
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,880
I also know their hideout.

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
I shall send that information along with the notebook.

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,440
In other words...

141
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,680
November 10th, 11:59 p.m...

142
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,110
This moment

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,310
is your best chance

144
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,640
to retrieve the notebook.

145
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,470
What should we do?

146
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,880
If the members of the mafia are going to die
on the day that Kira specified, there would be a chance.

147
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,930
I resent the idea of following Kira's plan, but it's a good plan.

148
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,550
That's right.

149
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,850
But...

150
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,100
it doesn't do us any good just by knowing
when the mafia are doing to die.

151
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,830
Mr. Ide, you know the answer.

152
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,160
We have the Shinigami follow us,

153
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,240
a-and we do the eye deal and kill them for sure.

154
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,530
I'll do the deal.

155
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,900
N-No way!
I'll do the bargain.

156
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,290
I handed over the notebook to begin with.

157
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,000
Because of that, I even thought of killing myself.

158
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,980
I'll use the notebook to kill the criminals,

159
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,350
and after thirteen days, I'll die too.

160
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,620
If Dad ever writes a name in the notebook...

161
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,980
When that happens...

162
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,600
Is everyone ready?

163
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,620
We're ready.

164
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,790
Then... Deputy Director Yagami...

165
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Make the eye deal with the Shinigami.

166
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,700
Ryuk, please.

167
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,130
All right.

168
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,970
Deputy Director Yagami,

169
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,730
take a look at the photographs of the criminals I gave you.

170
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,190
Can you see their names and lifespans?

171
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,360
Yeah, I can.

172
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,860
Your signal to go is when their names disappear.

173
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,090
We're going in!

174
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,900
So Kira was<i> involved after all...</i>

175
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,280
I never thought he'd go this far.
My perfect plan is still...

176
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,850
Damn! What is Shidou doing?

177
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,200
Just be quiet and watch, Shidou!

178
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,790
You'll get your notebook as long as you don't interfere.

179
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,170
Roy! Skyer!

180
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,430
The notebook is under Rod!

181
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Bring it up to the monitor room!

182
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,690
Don't move!

183
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,200
L, we've captured two of them.

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,990
We've also safely retrieved the notebook!

185
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,790
We're going back now!

186
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,040
No, not yet.

187
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,540
We still haven't found anyone who resembles Mello.

188
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,550
He's hiding somewhere in the building.

189
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,760
We've come this far. Exercise caution, and hunt him down.

190
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,320
Whoa!

191
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
What's was that?

192
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,240
An explosion?

193
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Don't move.

194
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,580
I've just blown up the two entrances.

195
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,760
But that was only a warning.

196
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,370
Next, I'll blow up the entire building.

197
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,380
Follow my orders.

198
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
It's Mello!

199
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,590
Yagami again, huh?

200
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,560
Maybe I should have killed you back then?

201
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,060
I never thought I would be bargaining for the notebook with you again.

202
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,630
M-I-H-A-E-L...

203
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,570
K-E-E-H-L...

204
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,030
Your real name is Mihael Keehl.

205
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,660
Dammit! How?

206
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,450
I did it!

207
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,120
Give up, Mello.

208
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,710
I won't kill you if you surrender.

209
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,970
Wha—

210
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,300
Why are you being stupid?

211
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,550
Hurry and write his name in the notebook and kill him!

212
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,890
You'll die if I write your name in this notebook.

213
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,390
Throw away that switch and put your hands up!

214
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,380
Yagami...

215
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,650
Don't move!

216
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,040
I only have to write your last name!

217
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,400
It won't take a second.

218
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,870
You idiot... Just write it. Write it!

219
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,880
Sorry...

220
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,750
I really didn't want to kill you.

221
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,880
Yagami, you've...

222
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,760
never killed anyone before, have you?

223
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,060
Gun shots?!

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,010
What was that?!

225
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,440
Jose! Grab the notebook!

226
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,340
Damn... This guy...

227
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,860
He won't let go of the notebook!

228
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,030
Why, you!

229
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,210
Deputy Director!

230
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,010
This is it, Mello!

231
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,760
Hands in the air now!

232
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,850
Matsuda, are you okay?

233
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,120
I don't think so...

234
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,430
He seems okay.

235
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,250
L, I don't see any sign of Mello.

236
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,390
Wha—

237
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,010
Damn. He got away?!

238
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,970
That's why I told my dad to kill him quickly!

239
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,820
Dad... Dad!

240
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,190
Please, don't die!

241
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,860
Light...

242
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,150
Dad!

243
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,700
I'm so glad...

244
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,040
Yeah, I'm glad too, Dad.

245
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,840
Light...

246
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,580
I still have...

247
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,760
the Shinigami eyes.

248
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,060
According to that Shinigami, Ryuk,

249
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,770
I can't see the lifespans of those who own the notebook.

250
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,980
Light...

251
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,730
You aren't Kira...

252
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,860
I'm really...

253
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,780
glad...

254
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,200
Of course not.
You're still worried about that?

255
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,410
Dad, don't say anything unnecessary.

256
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,010
That's important, but there's something even more important right now.

257
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,920
He has to write Mello's name in the notebook.

258
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,190
S-Sorry...

259
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,660
In the end, I...

260
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,220
I couldn't kill him...

261
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,220
It might not be good to say that "it's not too late" now.

262
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,180
No, it depends on how I say it.

263
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,520
At a time like this, I can be distraught to a certain extent.

264
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,730
Dad! Write his name!

265
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,950
Write his name with the last ounce of your strength!

266
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,490
You can't just let him beat you!

267
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,290
Dad!

268
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Light...

269
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,930
I'm sorry...

270
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,940
Dad!

271
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,940
Don't die! You idiot!

272
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,950
You're the Shinigami who came
to take back this notebook, aren't you?

273
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,930
Yes.

274
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,210
Even if it benefits the Kira investigation,

275
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,550
we only need one of these notebooks.

276
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,560
I'll return it to you.

277
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,040
People who use the notebook are cursed with misfortune, huh?

278
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,520
Well, it's not as if Soichiro actually used the notebook.

279
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,600
He died believing that his son isn't Kira.

280
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,540
So I guess he died a happy man.

281
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,800
If Kira is caught, he is evil.

282
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,920
If Kira rules the world, he is justice.

283
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,460
From now, the world will gradually lean in favor of Kira.

284
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,760
Kira will become justice.
