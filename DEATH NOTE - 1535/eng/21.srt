1
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,740
Hey, I thought we were only supposed
to meet every other week.

2
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,370
It can't be helped.

3
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,870
Coil reported that Amane Misa might know L.

4
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,540
According to this, it means L questioned Amane.

5
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,080
This is the problem.

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,380
He says he's "deduced that Amane worships Kira."

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,170
"Furthermore, Yoshida Productions

8
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,640
is trying to promote Amane as the face of Yotsuba."

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,150
"I suggest that Yotsuba use Amane for its commercials

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,220
to extract information about L."

11
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,560
I cannot accept this idea.

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
Why not?

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,030
I think it's a great plan.

14
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,360
No, what Ooi is trying to say is...

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,740
It's ultimately Coil's job to reveal L's identity.

16
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,950
So it's illogical for him to leave this to us, isn't it?

17
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,250
Yeah. We contracted him to reveal L's identity.

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,750
Shouldn't we ask Coil about his stance?

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,710
That's right...

20
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,700
Mr. Kida, I thought we'd agreed you wouldn't contact me directly.

21
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,890
Is it an emergency?

22
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
I understand.

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,730
If that's the case, I have a good idea.

24
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,400
Even though the meeting's over, I still have to punish criminals when I get home.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,740
It sure is tough being Kira...

26
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,070
But it's become interesting...

27
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,820
There's no doubt that Amane Misa is the Second Kira.

28
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,910
And L caught her at some point.

29
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,120
If he's letting her move about freely,

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,600
it means that she's forfeited ownership

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,340
and lost all her memories.

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,510
I can't leave her alone.

33
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,260
I'm going to make Amane Misa my wife.

34
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,370
Money, power, and a beautiful wife...

35
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,110
That's enough to make anyone green with envy!

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,190
Once we're married,

37
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,080
I'll take out a lot of life insurance on her.

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,490
Would she marry such a disgusting guy?

39
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,720
Rem, hide the notebook in the usual place.

40
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,380
Right now, this is the only thing I can do...

41
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,730
for Misa's sake.

42
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,520
All right! Let's take it from there.

43
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,900
Misa, you said that you came to Tokyo to meet Kira.

44
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,730
What?!

45
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,690
Hey!
What?!

46
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,990
Misa, please stop overacting.
It looks cheesy.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,260
What? But that's what's called a realistic performance...

48
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,980
Just do it over...

49
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,430
Yes, yes, Great Director Ryuzaki...

50
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,410
If you don't take this seriously, I'll kick you.

51
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,880
M-Misa-Misa...

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,590
You're so tense.
You can just call me "Misa," Mochi.

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,050
I'm not suited for this.

54
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,760
But it's still part of the mission to catch Kira.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,870
Misa-Misa!

56
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,770
What is it, Mochi?!

57
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,560
We have an interview with Yotsuba to see if they'll use you in their ads.

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,020
But it's also an infiltration.

59
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,530
I already know.

60
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,780
Of course, don't blow your cover either.

61
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,410
You're supposed to be a cheerful, energetic manager!

62
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,540
Yes, I'll give it my best!
All right!

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,450
Sorry to keep you waiting.

64
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,210
Good morning!

65
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,900
I'm Misa-Misa's manager, Mochi, also known as Moji Kanichi.

66
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,670
Mr. Ooi, Mr. Shimura, nice to see you again!

67
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,210
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Mr. Ooi, Mr. Shimura, nice to see you again!

68
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,090
Good luck, Misa-Misa!

69
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,350
You're really nailing it, Mochi.

70
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,260
I'll be waiting to celebrate when they decide to put you in their commercials!

71
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm not cut out for this, am I?

72
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,400
Well... This is our first time meeting, isn't it, Misa?

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,610
I'm John Wallace, the executive advisor
for the marketing department.

74
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,570
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,410
Pleased to meet you too.

76
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,160
This is a bit sudden, but I'll tell you honestly.

77
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,590
We're pretty much certain we're going to hire you.

78
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,170
But before we do, there's just one thing we have to clarify.

79
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,290
Yes?

80
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,920
We did a little background check on you...

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,090
A burglar killed your parents.

82
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,050
You worship Kira because he killed the man who murdered your family.

83
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,560
You said that you came to Tokyo to meet Kira.

84
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,740
Wh-Whom did you hear that from?

85
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,730
We can't tell you our source.

86
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,070
But this is reliable information.

87
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,450
It's written on your face.

88
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,240
Coil, I never thought you investigated that far.

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,620
Also...

90
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,620
You're still hiding something, aren't you?

91
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,590
Something that you don't want the world to know.

92
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,640
<i>I have to sweat a lot and pause here.</i>

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,890
L detained you.

94
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,390
Please tell us about what really happened.

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,710
It would be a problem if the face of Yotsuba were Kira.

96
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,650
Yes. Please tell us truthfully.

97
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,840
A-All right.

98
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,490
I'll tell you everything.

99
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,330
I was indeed detained.

100
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,620
I don't think it was L,

101
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,120
but he did ask me about Kira.

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,290
I'm not the Second Kira, though.

103
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,710
I'm here because he found out I have nothing to do with Kira.

104
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,340
Did you see who was detaining you?

105
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,750
I was blindfolded.

106
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,890
But you heard his voice, didn't you?

107
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,430
Only through a speaker, so...

108
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,930
Hey...

109
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,690
This is more like an interrogation than an interview.

110
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,360
How long do you plan on doing this?

111
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm going to the restroom.

112
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,400
Indeed, it seems the interview has veered off track.

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,030
Excuse me...

114
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,370
May I also go to the restroom?

115
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,370
This is tiring...

116
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,460
But it's going well.
I have to keep it up.

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,240
Touching her with this piece of the notebook

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
won't return her memories.

119
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,640
But at least now, Misa can see me again.

120
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,560
Wh-What is this?!
A monster?

121
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,030
Misa, you're in a dangerous situation. The people from Yotsuba may kill you.

122
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,950
I came to tell you that.

123
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,370
Calm down and listen to me.

124
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,830
Calm down?
This monster looks like it's going to kill me!

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,670
I am your ally.

126
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,020
My...

127
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,420
ally?

128
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,550
I wonder if Misa-Misa is all right.

129
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,550
We should have at least wired her!

130
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,620
It is<i> a different person, after all.</i>

131
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,140
The Kira before and after I was detained...

132
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,940
are clearly different.

133
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,650
The current Kira is killing every criminal
as soon as they've had their crime broadcasted,

134
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,820
regardless of the situation.

135
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,250
The previous Kira would never punish

136
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,040
those who didn't have any intention to kill,

137
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,000
those who killed by accident,

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,660
or those with extenuating circumstances.

139
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,850
If I were Kira, that's what I would do.

140
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,040
The original Kira's criteria for killing

141
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,420
are disturbingly close to my own thoughts.

142
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,090
What am I thinking?

143
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm not Kira.

144
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,100
There must be something wrong with me
if I'm comparing myself to Kira.

145
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,020
Yagami Light is Kira.

146
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,640
What is Light doing now?

147
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,780
What are you?

148
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,740
I know you're not a stalker,

149
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,210
but you don't look human at all.

150
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,960
Of course not.

151
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,930
I'm a Shinigami.

152
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,010
We once worked together.

153
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,140
You met me?
Light is Kira?

155
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,310
The Death Note...

156
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,940
If you write a person's name in it,

157
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,570
that person dies.

158
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,870
With that notebook,

159
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,140
Yagami Light punished criminals

160
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,870
and became known as Kira.

161
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,690
And you had the sameâ€”

162
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,560
no, greater power than Kira.

163
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,090
With that power, you managed to get close to Yagami Light.

164
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,320
Light is Kira... and I'm the Second Kira?

165
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,890
That's right...
No, more correctly, you were.

166
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,690
This should all be going according to Light's plan.

167
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,270
So Ryuzaki's right!

168
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,570
Misa,

169
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,190
do you still love Light more than anything?

170
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,660
Shinigami, you really are the real thing.

171
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,400
You know everything about me.

172
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,780
I'll believe everything you say.

173
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,750
Yes, I love him...

174
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,210
more than anything.

175
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:41,670
Besides, it's really awesome that Light and I were both Kira.

176
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,720
I believe you.

177
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,930
You haven't changed at all, Misa.

178
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,420
Those feelings towards Light
will probably never change, will they?

179
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:57,570
I now believe that you'll find happiness by staying with Light.

180
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,690
Thank you, Shinigami.

181
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,450
It's Rem.

182
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,780
The current Kira is a crooked and pathetic human.

183
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,160
You don't know what he'll do.

184
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,620
Be careful.

185
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,790
Be careful of the other Yotsuba men as well.

186
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,920
Trust Light and let him do whatever he feels necessary.

187
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,370
All right, I just have to act normal, right?

188
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,300
That's right.

189
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,090
When you go back to the interview,

190
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,240
you should be able to tell who Kira is.

191
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,290
Do not trust him.

192
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,230
Sorry I took so long in the restroom.

193
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,690
I fixed up my makeup!

194
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,880
Listen, when you return,
the man who's sitting in front of me is Kira.

195
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,920
Rem...

196
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,530
The person in front of Rem is Kira.

197
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,090
Higuchi is Kira.

198
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,050
That's horrible...

199
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,290
Misa-Misa sure is late...

200
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,450
They're back!

201
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,740
Hey!

202
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,620
I am so tired.

203
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,670
Hey...

204
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,700
How was it?

205
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,200
Yotsuba hired Misa to appear in their ads.

206
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,130
I see.
That's great.

207
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,720
Once I told them my cell phone number,

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,380
I was asked out by three of the seven.

209
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,460
What?

210
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,760
I just have to accept and investigate them, right?

211
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,330
It's exactly as planned.

212
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,410
No, the plan has been canceled.

213
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,050
Huh?

214
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,510
Why? It's been going so well!

215
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,310
You'll be in danger if we do this.

216
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,810
I won't stop you from appearing in any of their commercials,

217
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,470
but from now on, deny that you were suspected
of being the Second Kira and that you were detained by L.

218
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,820
Mogi will be your bodyguard,

219
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,640
and you will just be an entertainer.

220
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,330
If that's what you say, then that's what I'll do.

221
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,380
Well, I'm tired and tomorrow's shoot
is early in the morning, so I'm going to bed.

222
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,630
Thank you for worrying about me, Light,

223
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,010
but I've thought of a good plan.

224
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,100
I'm sure to be of help to you.

225
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,390
Light, want to come to bed with me?

226
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,690
What are you talking about, Misa?

227
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,730
I understand...
That's for after we catch Kira, isn't it?

228
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,940
You don't have to be shy, Light.

229
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,030
You do not have to be shy, Light.

230
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,530
I'm not being shy.

231
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,950
Why are you answering so seriously?

232
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,330
Cut!

233
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,860
That's good!

234
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,080
Good work!

235
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,000
Good work, Misa-Misa!

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,020
I can use the restroom in this hospital, right?

237
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,090
Yes!

238
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,340
Go right ahead!
_.Medical
College
Hospital

239
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,540
Then wait for me a moment.

240
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes...

241
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,640
Good work, Misa.

242
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,210
Wow! Nori, you look good in that nurse outfit!

243
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,860
You think so?

244
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,560
To-Oh Women's Medical Center

245
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,950
It went well.

246
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,450
To-Oh Women's Medical Center

247
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,870
Whoa...

248
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,820
Just as I expected, an amazing car.

249
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,310
If you like it, I'll let you ride in it any time,

250
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,880
or I'll buy you one.

251
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,260
By the way, that nurse's outfit is pretty nice, Misa.

252
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,240
You like it?

253
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,580
You sure took your time.

254
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,710
Where's Misa?!

255
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,970
She's on a date.

256
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,260
Dammit!

257
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,830
Higuchi Kyosuke...

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,030
Misa, you're really my type.
He's the persistent dirty old man

259
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,040
who's been texting me ever since that party.

260
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,880
Hey, Higuchi! Quit hogging her!

261
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,570
It's horrible that this guy is Kira...

262
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,890
Misa, shall we get something to eat?

263
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,470
Don't take me anywhere weird, okay?

264
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,060
Well, even if you <i>do</i> try something,

265
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,060
it's all right because I can kill people.

266
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,930
<i>What are you thinking, Misa?</i>

267
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,280
<i>Is this what Yagami Light wants you to do?</i>

268
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,410
<i>No, is Misa just saying that she wants me
to kill Higuchi if something happens?</i>

269
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,010
That's a funny thing to say, Misa.

270
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,790
You can kill people?

271
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,060
It's true.

272
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,630
Because I'm...

273
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,960
the Second Kira.

274
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,050
I-It can't be...

275
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,740
Even if this girl was the Second Kira in the past,
she can't be right now.

276
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,920
She shouldn't have any memory of it.

277
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,430
What's going on?

278
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,520
Misa, you don't have to make up things like that to protect yourself.

279
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,250
I'm actually quite the gentleman.

280
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,110
Well, I don't really feel like proving
I'm the Second Kira to anyone other than Kira.

281
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,420
You'll only show Kira?

282
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,450
What do you mean?

283
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,220
It's my dream to become Kira's bride.

284
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,140
I know with all my heart that Kira needs me by his side.

285
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,800
If she's the Second Kira, then it's clear
from the Sakura TV incident that she has the Shinigami eyes.

286
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,670
If it's true,

287
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,300
I need her by my side, no matter what.

288
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,220
I'll test her.

289
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,150
Well then, I'm Kira,

290
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,810
so marry me, Misa!

291
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,030
Really?!

292
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,340
Yeah... I am.

293
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,240
Really.

294
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,520
What? Then prove it!
Let's show each other the proof!

295
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,170
That's impossible.

296
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,570
It would be risky to show how I kill.

297
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,750
You think so?

298
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,500
I would show someone if they might be Kira.

299
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,260
Nothing would happen if I didn't.

300
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,260
Then kill someone.

301
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,580
I may be Kira.

302
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,350
Fine. But I only kill bad people.

303
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,690
That's right.
A bad person, huh?

304
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,110
Kaneboshi Ginzo.

305
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,660
He's the president of a major consumer financing company.

306
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,690
He's a crook who's famous for his cruel collection methods.

307
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,120
Sometimes, he makes people pay
with their insurance money.

308
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,490
How about him?

309
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,940
Can you immediately check if he died?

310
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,670
I can tell if I make a phone call.

311
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,320
Then turn around for a moment.

312
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,550
Misa...

313
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,120
I have to kill Kaneboshi Ginzo, don't I?

314
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,550
Then Higuchi will trust you.

315
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,590
Fine.

316
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,310
Kaneboshi Ginzo

317
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,730
All right.
He should be dead now.

318
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,970
This is Higuchi from Yotsuba.

319
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,300
Sorry! Our president just collapsed and stopped breathing... Call back later!

320
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,790
See?

321
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,790
She killed a person whom I chose, right here...

322
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,710
It would've been impossible unless she had the powers!

323
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,670
It's decided!

324
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,220
Then if I'm Kira, you'll marry me, right?!

325
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Wh-Why are you getting so serious all of a sudden?

326
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,930
Because I'm Kira.

327
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,600
Then prove it.

328
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,580
I can't kill until I go home.

329
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,110
You understand.

330
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,610
Yeah... then it's no good.

331
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,910
It might be a scheme to lure me into your house.

332
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,290
Oh, I know.

333
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,810
Then stop killing criminals.

334
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,290
If you're Kira, I'm sure you can do it.

335
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,130
Then begin killing when I tell you to.

336
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,800
Then I'll believe you.

337
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Killing criminals

338
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,920
is something that only Kira could do.

339
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,560
I see.
That's a good idea.

340
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,060
All right.

341
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,780
I'm Kira, so in order to make you trust me,

342
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,060
I'm going to stop killing criminals starting now.

343
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,320
And when you know I'm Kira, we'll get married!

344
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,360
And there you have it!

345
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,700
Higuchi is Kira.

346
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,030
Now we know Kira's identity,

347
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,950
and the killings that have been bothering the Chief will stop!

348
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,290
You're awesome, Misa-Misa!

349
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,580
It's been three days since I stopped killing criminals.

350
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,640
That should be good enough.

351
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,380
Now if I marry the Second Kira, Amane Misa,

352
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,320
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.

353
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,760
And I'll control everything Yotsuba has!
