1
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,370
How many seconds has it been since you wrote the first name?

2
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,120
Thirty-five...

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,670
Thirty-six...

4
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,210
Thirty-seven...

5
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,000
Thirty-eight!

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,540
Thirty-nine!

7
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,090
Near, I win.

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,680
Forty!

9
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,830
We're not dead...

10
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,410
A minute's passed...

11
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,660
and we're not dead!

12
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,670
I've been telling you that nobody would die.

13
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,840
Wh-Why?

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,630
Why won't they die?!

15
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,260
G-God!

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I did as you told me!

17
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,680
Rester, Gevanni, apprehend Mikami.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,930
Gevanni, the notebook.

19
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,970
See for yourselves.

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,520
The first four names are unmistakably the real names of the SPK members.

21
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,330
And the only name not here is...

22
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,840
Yagami Light.

23
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,950
Mikami called you "God,"

24
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,450
and said that he did as you told him to.

25
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,300
This proves it.

26
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a trap!

27
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,810
This is a trap!

28
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,810
Near set the whole thing up to frame me!

29
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,570
It's strange that no one's dead even after their names were written in the notebook.

30
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,490
That proves that this is a trap!

31
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,160
But I told you that nobody would die because I tampered with the notebook.

32
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,660
N-No...

33
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,780
No way!

34
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,500
Impossible!

35
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,920
This is a setup. I don't know that man.

36
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,620
Light, it's too late.

37
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,760
Near wins.

38
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,860
A second ago, you said "I win."

39
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,020
That's as good a confession as any.

40
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,250
Light...

41
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,820
Wh-Why?

42
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,580
S-Stop!

43
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,550
Yagami Light...

44
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,590
L...

45
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Kira...

46
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
You lose.

47
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,770
You declared your victory a moment ago.

48
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,650
Truthfully, you might have won

49
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,950
and I might have lost.

50
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,450
We tampered with the fake notebook

51
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,790
as you expected us to.

52
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,580
But when I said that I had tampered with it,

53
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,460
I was referring to the real notebook as well.

54
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,500
We only switched a part of the fake notebook.

55
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,760
But as for the real one,

56
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,090
we switched the whole thing.

57
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,760
This is the real notebook.

58
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,560
I-Impossible!

59
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,740
We used the same pen as Mikami,

60
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,250
copied Mikami's handwriting perfectly,

61
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,190
and made the inside and outside look exactly the same.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,570
Gevanni was able to do it in a single night.

63
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,990
Since I had already touched the real notebook,

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
I could see the Shinigami.

65
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,750
Shinigami, pleased to meet you. I'm Near.

66
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,960
Pleased to meet you. I'm Ryuk.

67
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
He can talk to Ryuk.

68
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,850
He can see him, so it must be real.

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,200
The edges of this page of the notebook are cut.

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,730
Would someone die if their name were written on this clipped portion?

71
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,850
Yeah, he would.

72
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,500
I thought so.

73
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,480
You probably found many ways to use this.

74
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,100
I wonder how many times you've killed
and deceived us with this.

75
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,140
Yagami Light.

76
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,210
You are Kira.

77
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,060
This has to be a trick.

78
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,810
Could Mikami have betrayed me?

79
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,050
You're mistaken.

80
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,760
This is happening thanks to Mello.

81
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,030
I'm sure you'll understand what I mean by that.

82
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,350
Mello?!

83
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,140
Take a good look at this.

84
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,690
Takada's name is in the notebook!

85
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,230
A plan to kill Takada

86
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,820
a minute after I did!

87
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,740
Could it be that Mikami did the same thing at that time?!

88
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,490
G-God, I thought that you were being watched and couldn't take action.

89
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,870
I thought it was my job
to take care of Takada in a situation like that...

90
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,320
You idiot!

91
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,750
I've been giving you orders not to make any unnecessary moves until today!

92
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,630
That's right. On the 26th,

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,760
right after Takada's kidnapping was broadcast,

94
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,880
Mikami went to the bank.

95
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,300
According to my findings,

96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,700
Mikami goes to the bank every month on the 25th.

97
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,060
It is very odd for someone as methodical as Mikami to go there two days in a row.

98
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,150
I followed Mikami to a safe deposit box.

99
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,900
It was only at this time

100
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,070
that he became clearly concerned that someone was following him.

101
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,490
It was easy to open the safe.

102
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,240
Inside it,

103
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,900
the real notebook was there

104
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,960
and Takada's name was written in it.

105
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,510
Yagami Light,

106
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,760
you didn't notice that Mikami took the liberty and made a move

107
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,340
because you had just killed her with a clipping from the notebook.

108
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,340
This is when I noticed the possibility of a fake notebook

109
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,390
thanks to Mello, who had created this situation.

110
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Mello may have known about it.

111
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,920
He said that it's straightforward
if we can get him to write in the notebook?

112
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,740
Yes...

113
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,990
I'm going to have to do it.

114
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,520
Mello knew.

115
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,050
He knew that alone, we aren't able to attain our goal to surpass L.

116
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,910
But together...

117
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,100
Together we can stand with L.

118
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,760
Together we can surpass L!

119
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,180
And right now, we are confronting Kira, who defeated L,

120
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,140
with solid evidence!

121
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,980
Try to talk your way out of this if you can.

122
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,980
That's right.

123
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,820
I'm Kira.

124
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,290
That's right. I'm Kira.

125
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,310
So what are you going to do?

126
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,590
Are you going to kill me here?

127
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,380
Listen...

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,630
I'm Kira.

129
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,300
And...

130
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,220
I'm the god of the new world.

131
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,320
Kira is the law of the world right now.

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,060
Kira is maintaining order.

133
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,440
I am already justice incarnate.

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,190
The human race and the world's only hope.

135
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,360
Are you going to kill me?

136
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,780
Is that really the right thing to do?

137
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,030
Since Kira appeared six years ago,

138
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,170
wars have stopped and global crime rates
have decreased by seventy percent.

139
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,800
But the world is still rotten!

140
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,880
There are still too many rotten people.

141
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,140
Someone has to do it.

142
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,180
When I first laid hands on the notebook,

143
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,680
I knew I had to do it!

144
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,390
No,

145
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,190
I was the only one who <i>could</i> do it!

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,820
I know that killing people is a crime.

147
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,860
But this is the only way to fix the world!

148
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,570
This is a duty given to me!

149
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm the only one who can do this.

150
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Could anyone else have done it?!

151
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,630
Could they have done this much?!

152
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,130
Could they have continued on?!

153
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,630
That's right.

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,180
The only one who can create the new world...

155
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,560
is me.

156
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,640
No.

157
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,060
You're just a murderer.

158
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,020
And this notebook is the worst murder weapon in history.

159
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,860
You've yielded to the power
of the Shinigami and the notebook.

160
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,830
You're no different from a crazy serial killer who has a god complex.

161
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,960
That's all you are.

162
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,580
Nothing more, nothing less.

163
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,430
They're all fools who don't understand.

164
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,720
Near.

165
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,020
The notebook you have right now,

166
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,800
and the notebook that Aizawa brought
from the Japanese Investigative Headquarters...

167
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,420
Are they real?

168
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,430
Is he bluffing now?

169
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,280
Only I know where the real notebook is.

170
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,310
If you're going to defeat Kira,

171
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,150
even if it's just to test the notebook that Aizawa's carrying...

172
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,030
you should write my name or Mikami's in it.

173
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,450
To see if the notebook is real...

174
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,330
or fake!

175
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,080
He's hidden a piece of the notebook!

176
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,590
Matsuda!

177
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,200
You imbecile!

178
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,280
Matsuda! Who do you think you're shooting at?!

179
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,430
Stop fucking around!

180
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,760
What was it all for?

181
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,990
What in the world did your Dad die for?

182
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,990
Dad? Oh, you mean Yagami Soichiro?!

183
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,580
That's right, Matsuda!

184
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,450
Overly earnest people with a strong sense of justice like him are always going to lose.

185
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,290
Are you okay with a world like that?!

186
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,830
Kill the others if you understand!

187
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,330
Shoot!

188
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,490
You let your father die...

189
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,800
How can you act as if it were nothing?!

190
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,010
He's writing with his blood!

191
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,230
I'm going to kill you!

192
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,860
We have to kill him!

193
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,140
Matsuda!

194
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,630
Damn...

195
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,570
What... is this?!

196
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,270
Mikami... What are you doing?!

197
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,020
Write!

198
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,230
You have... to kill them!

199
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,050
Near...

200
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,020
It's finally over, isn't it?

201
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,620
Yes.

202
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,810
What happened to Misa?!

203
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,790
What about Takada?!

204
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,050
S-Someone...

205
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,660
What in the world should I...

206
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,530
M-Mikami's...

207
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,920
Stop the bleeding!

208
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,610
No, but...

209
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,640
We can't do anything anymore...

210
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,220
Light!

211
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,480
Light! Wait!

212
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
Mr. Aizawa!

213
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,610
He probably doesn't have any more notebooks hidden.

214
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,180
He can't go very far with those wounds.

215
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,740
He'll stop on his own if we leave him alone.

216
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,240
Near, I'm not taking your orders.

217
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,960
All right. I'll leave it to you.

218
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,920
You lose, Light.

219
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,770
I told you when we first met

220
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,690
that I'd be the one writing your name
in my notebook when you die.

221
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,280
It's the agreement that's made between a Shinigami who brings a notebook to the Human World...

222
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,830
and the first human who picks up the notebook.

223
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,290
I don't know when you die if they'll put you in prison.

224
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,300
And it's too much of a pain to wait around.

225
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,300
It's all over.

226
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,080
You should die right here.

227
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,110
We've eased each other's boredom for quite a while.

228
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,170
It's been quite...

229
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,830
fun.
