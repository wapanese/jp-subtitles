1
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,400
Regardless of how she came to her conclusion,

2
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,800
she knows the truth.

3
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,270
If she gives this information to the police,

4
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,460
they'll figure out that I am Kira.

5
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,320
I have to finish her off.

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,210
What's wrong?

7
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,740
Oh, nothing.

8
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,320
I've been going over what you just told me

9
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
and I think that we should investigate that theory as soon as possible.

10
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,520
Really?

11
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,780
Yes.

12
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,930
Have you told this to anyone else?

13
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,780
No, you're the first.

14
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,350
You're lucky.

15
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,270
But how are you going to rub her out?

16
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,640
Wouldn't it be bad if you did it here?

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,740
I've already figured that out

18
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,160
without you telling me.

19
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,400
Wow! So out in the open.

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,040
Could you tell me the date and time of the bus-jacking incident?

21
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,730
It was on December 20th, in front of Asagao Hill.

22
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,930
At 11:02. Headed to Space Land.

23
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,260
December 20th...

24
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,760
Headed to Space Land, right?

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,810
Right.

26
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,920
Now no one will find her body.

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,700
Even if they do find her,

28
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,070
they'll assume that she killed herself because of her fiancé.

29
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,120
Ryuk, what's so funny?

30
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,130
I'm very sorry for questioning all of you individually.

31
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,700
Kira is not one of us.

32
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,010
Ryuzaki, how can you definitely say that he's not among us?

33
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,730
To be honest, I set some traps to check if you were Kira,

34
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,980
but I didn't feel the need to set them off on any of you.

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,580
Excuse me.

36
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,950
And he told us to turn off our cell phones!

37
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,640
I got it.

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,570
I'm just about finished.

39
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,640
Enter with your own key.

40
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,750
Watari is coming.

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,440
I understand.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,590
If it's all right, I'll report this incident.

43
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,070
No, I'd like to report it myself.

44
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,300
After talking to you, I've decided to do it as soon as possible.

45
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,650
I suppose you're right.

46
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,730
Just ten seconds until 1:15.

47
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,360
I want to see how this woman dies,

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,870
but I can't be caught following her.

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,850
Now... hurry to your death!

50
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,350
Kira will definitely be caught, won't he?

51
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,930
Huh?

52
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,930
What's wrong?

53
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,610
Time is already up.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
That's odd.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,280
Why isn't this woman leaving?

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,160
My tests have proven that I can make people kill themselves by writing "suicide."

57
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,620
The criminals I tested all hanged themselves at the times that I specified.

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,750
I've proven many times that I should be able to control her within these circumstances.

59
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,820
So why?

60
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,160
Ryuk...

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,980
Come to think of it, he was laughing oddly when I was writing in the Death Note.

62
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,930
That's not all.

63
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,650
The way he laughed when I asked for her name was also bizarre.

64
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,900
It occurred when it had to do with her name.

65
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,150
An alias!

66
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,540
Thank you all for working so hard.

67
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,780
Th-This person is Watari?

68
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,790
Um, where are your usual clothes?

69
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,220
If I had dressed as I usually do,
it would be like telling everyone I'm Watari.

70
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,890
It would also give away Ryuzaki's location in this hotel.

71
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,720
I see.

72
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,230
Showing my face in front of you all means you've won Ryuzaki's trust.

73
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,280
I-I feel kind of honored.

74
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Ryuzaki, I've brought what you requested.

75
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,640
Please pass them out to everyone.

76
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,620
Yes.

77
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,650
These are your new police IDs.

78
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,370
New?

79
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,880
An alias. That has to be it!

80
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,360
Ryuk can see her real name.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
That's why he was laughing.

82
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,890
This woman was being careful from the start.

83
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,570
That's right.

84
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,980
She believes that Raye died because he showed his ID.

85
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,980
That's why she's acting without revealing her identity.

86
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,970
This isn't good.

87
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,490
It's even harder to ask the real name of someone who has already given an alias.

88
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,020
If I keep asking her persistently, she'll get suspicious.

89
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,540
It's suspicious that I knew she was using an alias in the first place.

90
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,250
I should be getting back soon.

91
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,580
Huh?

92
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,720
Someone might have come back.

93
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,600
Oh, yeah. I suppose you're right.

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,590
Hopefully someone did.

95
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,980
Hopefully.

96
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,760
Dammit!

97
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,850
It would also be unnatural to try to turn her back.

98
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,610
What should I do? At this rate...

99
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,320
Oh no...

100
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,990
If my father calls...

101
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,110
I promised her that I'd let her talk to him!

102
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,410
It's all over if he calls!

103
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,160
What do I do?

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,230
Wh-Why am I panicking?

105
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,370
I can just turn off my cell phone.

106
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,640
Calm down.

107
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,380
I just have to find out her name.

108
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,680
Her purse, her pocket...

109
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,240
She's gotta have a driver's license or some sort of personal ID on her.

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,140
She's a woman. If things become desperate, I can resort to using force.

111
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,630
That's stupid!

112
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,940
I can't do anything that'll cause a stir in a place like this.

113
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
I've got to get her to somewhere isolated.

114
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,680
But where?

115
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,700
What explanation can I offer her?

116
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,460
She's too cautious.

117
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,900
No, I've got to change my plan of attack.

118
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,070
I can do this. I can get her name without setting any alarms off.

119
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,610
Light.

120
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,900
We can always do the eye deal.

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,310
It's no different from putting on contact lenses.

122
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,670
I'll be finished in a flash.

123
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,670
I won't have my remaining life halved by the likes of this woman.

124
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,820
No, I won't ever consider the deal!

125
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,200
Don't bother me.

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Shut up, Shinigami!

127
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,310
Excuse me.

128
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,390
Yes?

129
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,830
Do you still have business at the police department?

130
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,150
I'll be all right by myself.

131
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,480
I understand.

132
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,880
Our names and ranks are all fake.

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
Fake police IDs?!

134
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,740
Kira requires a name and a face to kill.

135
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,510
We are challenging Kira with that premise in mind.

136
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,920
This is a no-brainer.

137
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,420
B-But a police officer with a fake ID is...

138
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,510
No, if Kira needs a name to kill,

139
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,600
an alias would go a long way in protecting our lives.

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,720
We should carry these around.

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,440
I think so, too.

142
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Yeah.

143
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,450
When you have to give out your name to strangers,

144
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,450
use the alias in your IDs.

145
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,480
Got it.

146
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,820
Please be careful not to take them out
within the police headquarters.

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,710
It could cause problems.

148
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,330
Understood.

149
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,710
Well then...

150
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,500
I would like everyone to wear these belts.

151
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,780
Belts?

152
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,680
There is a tracking device in the buckle.

153
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,590
This way, Ryuzaki will know your whereabouts.

154
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,840
And when you press the buckle twice...

155
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,220
my cell phone will ring.

156
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,850
I'll follow-up by calling you back immediately.

157
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,550
In the morning, you will go to work at the police department.

158
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,110
Later, using this method,

159
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,720
I shall confirm our hotel and room number.

160
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,270
Please use this for emergencies as well.

161
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,620
This is kind of cool. It's like we're a special force chasing Kira!

162
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,910
Matsuda!

163
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,500
This isn't child's play.

164
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,890
Don't joke around.

165
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,870
Okay...

166
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,950
Thank you very much.

167
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,880
Thanks to you, I have gained confidence in my theory.

168
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,850
Not at all.

169
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,640
Ryuk started talking about the eye bargain again...

170
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,150
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, she's using an alias.

171
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,980
At this rate, with her theory that Kira was on the bus

172
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,440
and given the people whom Raye Penber
was in charge of investigating,

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,110
the police will immediately suspect me.

174
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,620
Hey, she's leaving. Is that okay?

175
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,480
It should be about five minutes
until she reaches the police headquarters.

176
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,620
Think...

177
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,630
How can I get her name within five minutes?

178
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,180
She's going to the police headquarters.

179
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,650
If someone from the task force has returned, I'm a goner.

180
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,860
Somehow, I've got to find out her real name, and finish her off.

181
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,240
Now I only have three minutes left.

182
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,680
All right.

183
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,450
What are you going to do?

184
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,840
Excuse me...

185
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,060
Yes?

186
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,390
There's something I haven't told you.

187
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,210
What is it?

188
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,590
It's impossible to contact anyone directly in headquarters.

189
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,710
Huh?

190
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,050
I have to conduct this conversation naturally
and connect it to something that she'll latch onto.

191
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,290
Within that time, I'll draw out her name.

192
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,560
I can do this.

193
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,810
What do you mean?

194
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,120
Don't you think it's odd that there's no one at headquarters?

195
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,960
Y-Yeah. I thought it was strange, but...

196
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,820
The team investigating Kira is structured so that no one knows who is involved.

197
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,280
If the public knows how the team is structured,

198
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,500
a tragedy like the one involving your fiancé may happen again.

199
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,180
I understand.

200
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,760
That's why you were told
that no one was at the headquarters.

201
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,680
In other words,

202
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,850
you will never be allowed to talk directly
to someone from headquarters.

203
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,940
That's pretty clever, as always, Light.

204
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Why do you know so much?

205
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,820
She's pretty sharp.

206
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,520
I guess I have no choice.

207
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,580
I shall tell you...

208
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,280
It's because I'm a detective from the task force.

209
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,140
You're a detective from the task force?

210
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,090
Yes.

211
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,590
L is currently in charge of the task force.

212
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,080
Yes. I thought so.

213
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,310
L was troubled because there weren't enough detectives at headquarters.

214
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,560
Many quit because they're afraid of Kira.

215
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm just a high-school student,

216
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,860
but I have helped the police solve two cases in the past.

217
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,940
So he was sold by that?

218
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,060
I can enter the headquarters whenever I wish,

219
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,330
and I'm allowed to investigate on my own.

220
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,950
In other words, the people who are currently at headquarters

221
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,620
are the chosen few whose abilities are reliable

222
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,210
and who can be trusted.

223
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,140
I understand.

224
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,850
But just in case, I think I'll visit the headquarters.

225
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,050
Thank you very much.

226
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,690
P-Please wait!

227
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,300
I just told you that you can't talk to anyone.

228
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,030
I would like to talk directly to L.

229
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,460
Come to think of it, who's at headquarters now?

230
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,380
No one is there now.

231
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,480
That's not good.

232
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,630
Have at least one person there at all times.

233
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,710
Understood.

234
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,890
Aizawa, if you could stay there for today.

235
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,120
Okay.

236
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,100
I can get there quickly from here.

237
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,470
Ms. Maki, please wait.

238
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,920
It's impossible to meet L.

239
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,730
It's useless.

240
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,190
He might... allow me to meet him.

241
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,200
I only followed his orders from beyond a computer screen,

242
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:40,340
but two years ago in America, I worked on a case under L.

243
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,670
You worked under L?

244
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,100
Until three months ago,

245
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,420
I was an FBI agent.

246
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,260
This is it... I can use this.

247
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Is that so?

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,950
It's no wonder. Your actions are not those of an amateur.

249
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,150
You move carefully and wisely as you get to the heart of the matter.

250
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,270
I'd like to learn from you.

251
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,110
It's amazing how you can line up all those lies like that.

252
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,240
I must approach this case in my own way.

253
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,730
I have to suspect the police and even the people within the task force.

254
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,120
But I trust L.

255
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:28,120
I thought that if I went to headquarters and have them verify my name and face,

256
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,960
I'd be able to speak directly to L.

257
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,830
I see.

258
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,600
But why did you tell me that you wanted to talk to L?

259
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,500
When I wasn't allowed to see someone from the task force, I became angry.

260
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,820
Then I ran into someone who claimed to be the son of the lead detective.

261
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,810
No, that's not it.

262
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,280
I'll tell you the truth.

263
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,240
You seemed like L.

264
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,660
I felt that you two are similar.

265
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,600
Shall we investigate the case together?

266
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,710
Huh?

267
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,720
Will you work as an agent in the task force?

268
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,220
Of course, not just anybody is allowed.

269
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,040
But we need people like you!

270
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,520
You could be doing more than gathering general information.

271
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,800
You were an FBI agent.

272
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,310
You're more talented than our current detectives.

273
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,530
Even L trusted you.

274
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,790
To join the task force,

275
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,830
you need proper identification,

276
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,360
a recommendation from a current detective on the team,

277
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,790
and at last, L's permission.

278
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,540
You want me to join the task force?

279
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,360
It must be fate to meet you here!

280
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,460
I'll recommend you!

281
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,460
Oh, sorry.

282
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,310
I got carried away.

283
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,390
N-No, it's okay.

284
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,200
Even if you can cooperate with the investigation,

285
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I understand you have personal circumstances to attend to.

286
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,860
Especially since you live in America...

287
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
I was planning to continue living with my fiancé in America,

288
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,580
and he and I were to get married this spring.

289
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,610
But now that he passed away,

290
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,330
I'm lost as to what I'll do.

291
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,260
All right.

292
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,500
Since I've come this far, I'll push a little.

293
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,840
But you're still very young and beautiful.

294
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,420
You shouldn't be involved in this.

295
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,250
No!

296
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,760
I don't have anything to lose.

297
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,330
I want to catch Kira!

298
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,760
It's all I want to do!

299
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,050
Please let me investigate with you!

300
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,460
Thank goodness.

301
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,570
Well, may I see something that may act as some form of personal ID?

302
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,280
About that...

303
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,530
Yes?

304
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,200
Actually, that name I gave you earlier

305
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,850
was not my real name.

306
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,950
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,030
Huh?

308
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,600
That's all right.

309
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
Amazing! Who would've thought you were being so careful?

310
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,500
You're one step ahead of me.

311
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,340
That's even further proof that you're qualified.

312
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,290
Is a Japanese driver's license okay?

313
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,180
Yes.

314
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
I made it.

315
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,470
Excuse me, but why do you always pay such close attention to your watch?

316
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,960
Oh, this?

317
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,600
It's because...

318
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,850
I'm Kira.

319
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,190
What's wrong?

320
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,850
There's something I have to do.

321
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,860
Oh...

322
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,470
My father's cell phone is on now.

323
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,190
Don't you want to talk to him?

324
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,190
I have nothing I want to talk about.

325
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,110
Good bye, Ms. Misora Naomi.

326
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,250
With Ryuk's information and my prior preparations,

327
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,470
I can kill criminals currently being broadcast

328
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,200
while masquerading as a regular high-school student.

329
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,760
Just watch, L!
