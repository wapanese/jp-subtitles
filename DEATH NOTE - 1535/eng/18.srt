1
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,620
Oh yeah! I gotta take off this belt.

2
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,240
<i>Huh? Again?</i>

3
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,170
He'll just have to get used to our security system.

4
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,830
<i>Enough!</i>

5
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,660
How's this?!

6
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,320
Good morning!

7
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,170
What happened to your forehead?

8
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,090
Oh, this?

9
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,470
Well, I got into a fight with my wife and...

10
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,690
My kid is still small, so it looks like I'll be commuting.

11
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,860
Yeah.

12
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,520
You should live at home.

13
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,480
What a waste...

14
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,690
These rooms are incredible.

15
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,860
You should move here with your whole family.

16
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,120
Don't lump me together with a carefree bachelor like you.

17
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,340
Where's Ryuzaki?

18
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,740
He's on a date.

19
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,870
The three of them are in Misa-Misa's room.

20
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,830
Surveillance cameras, huh?

21
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,390
Well, since we believe that Amane might be connected to the Second Kira,

22
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,430
I guess it's unavoidable.

23
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,680
And Matsuda, stop calling her Misa-Misa!

24
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,210
Oh, okay.

25
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,090
Hey... This doesn't feel like a date.

26
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,300
Just act like I'm not here.

27
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,220
Anyway, are you going to eat that slice of cake?

28
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,980
Sweets are fattening, so I try not to eat them too much.

29
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,940
If you use your head, you can still eat sweets without gaining weight.

30
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,230
Hey! You're making fun of me again!

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,570
How about I give you my slice
and you leave me alone with Light?

32
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,610
Even if I leave you two alone,

33
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,830
I'll be watching you on the surveillance cameras.
It's the same thing.

34
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,120
You pervert!
Will you stop doing these sick things?

35
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,250
Call me whatever you like.
Don't mind if I do.

36
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,150
Fine! I'll just close the curtains and turn off the lights.

37
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,420
We also have infrared cameras.

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,860
Changing the subject...

39
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,780
Despite moving into fully equipped headquarters,

40
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,760
you don't seem very enthusiastic, Ryuzaki.

41
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,600
Enthusiasm, huh?

42
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,800
I don't have any.

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,020
Actually, I'm kind of depressed.

44
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,270
Depressed?

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,520
Yeah...

46
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,840
All this time, I thought that you were Kira.

47
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,780
I'm just shocked that my deduction was wrong.

48
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,790
But I'm still suspicious of you.

49
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,620
Hence the reason for these...

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,090
Kira can control people's actions.

51
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,670
In other words, Kira was controlling you to make me suspect that you were Kira.

52
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,890
You and Misa were both controlled by Kira.

53
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,430
When I think about that, everything matches up.

54
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,310
By that reasoning,

55
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,230
Misa and I were controlled,
but doesn't that still mean that we're Kira?

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Yes, I don't think I'm wrong about that.

57
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,740
You're both Kira.

58
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,950
I think that when you were confined, you were Kira.

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,170
And while you were confined, criminals stopped dying.

60
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,270
You were Kira until then, so it works out.

61
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,160
But after two weeks,

62
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,010
criminals began dying again.

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,100
Based on that evidence,

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
I think Kira's power can pass from person to person.

65
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,360
That's an interesting idea.

66
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,220
But if that's the case, then catching Kira will be no small feat.

67
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,860
Yeah. That's why I'm at a loss.

68
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,690
Even if we catch those under Kira's control,

69
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,350
Kira's powers will be passed on to others and the former will have no memory of their actions.

70
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,990
Which means that it's useless to catch anyone.

71
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,270
But that's not set in stone, is it?

72
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,100
Cheer up.

73
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,540
Cheer up?

74
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,270
I can't.

75
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,550
In fact, it's better if we don't try so hard.

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,430
Our lives will be in danger if we desperately chase him.

77
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,200
Don't you think so?

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,720
Ryuzaki...

79
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,030
That hurt.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,660
Stop messing around.

81
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,410
You don't feel like doing anything

82
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,580
just because your deduction about me being Kira was wrong?

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,920
I may have phrased that poorly.

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,670
I meant that making the first move might work against us, so we shouldn't try.

85
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,380
There's no way we can catch him if we don't give chase!

86
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,640
Do you know how many innocent people
you've involved in this case?!

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,010
Besides that, you're the one who confined Misa and me!

88
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,230
I know that.

89
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,690
But whatever the reason...

90
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,270
An eye for an eye.

91
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,880
It's not that my deduction was wrong.

92
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,790
"Yagami Light is Kira"

93
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,970
and "Amane Misa is the Second Kira."
The fact is, the case isn't going to be solved as simply as that.

94
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,590
That's why I'm a bit depressed.

95
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,040
I'm human.
Am I not allowed to feel like that?

96
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,720
No, you're not.

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,390
The way you talk...

98
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,810
It's as if you won't be satisfied unless I'm Kira.

99
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,820
I won't be satisfied unless you're Kira?

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,570
That may be true...

101
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,040
I just realized...

102
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,050
I wanted you to be Kira.

103
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,440
An eye for an eye.

104
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll have you know I'm pretty strong.

105
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,150
L-Let's call the room and stop them!

106
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,670
Yes?

107
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,180
Please listen, Ryuzaki.

108
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,930
Misa-Misa is ranked first
in Eighteen Magazine's reader popularity poll!

109
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,060
Yes, I see.

110
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,270
That means she'll be starring as the heroine in the next film by the director, Nishinaka!

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,980
What's wrong?

112
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,150
Matsuda's acting stupid again.

113
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, Matsuda is a natural at that.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,160
I can hear you...

115
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,880
Ryuzaki, I know you're not feeling up to it,
but come over here for a second.

116
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,730
Take a good look at this.

117
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,630
Isn't it unbalanced?

118
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,970
All three of them were prominent Japanese businessmen.

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
They all died of heart attacks.

120
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,650
As a result, Yotsuba's stock prices rose and those of other companies dropped.

121
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,320
In other words, they're deaths that are in Yotsuba's favor.

122
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,490
Checking back, there have been as many as thirteen such cases in the past three months.

123
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,870
What do you think?

124
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,660
I can only conclude that Kira is supporting Yotsuba.

125
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,910
Yes... But if that's true,

126
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,420
then punishing criminals is not this Kira's true intent.

127
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
Yeah.

128
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,390
He's punishing criminals as a front

129
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,800
and killing people for the benefit of his company.

130
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,120
What do you think?

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,970
Do you feel a little more enthusiastic now?

132
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,280
It's amusing how well this has gone, without anyone suspecting us.

133
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,410
Yotsuba's benefits and stock prices
have been increasing slowly but steadily.

134
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,790
Indeed.

135
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,960
It's all proceeding according to our calculations.

136
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,690
I'm just worried about one thing.

137
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,820
Why did the three people we decided to kill last week

138
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,170
die of heart attacks?

139
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,630
Wasn't one of them supposed to die from an accident?

140
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,220
That was probably because

141
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,100
we chose the accident to occur on the Coastal Bay Route.

142
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,210
At the appointed time, he wasn't at his home,

143
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,730
but had snuck off to Italy with a woman.

144
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,940
In other words,

145
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,940
if the request is impossible...

146
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,820
...Kira kills the person by heart attack.

147
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,090
It's like I told you last week.

148
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,510
If you request only accidental deaths and death by disease,

149
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,330
they're finished in a natural way in the shortest amount of time.

150
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,410
Anyway,

151
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,040
the police should be too busy investigating the deaths of criminals.

152
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,940
If someone could trace the deaths of those others back to us,

153
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,920
he would be a god.

154
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,870
Besides, we've already taken precautions.

155
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,930
Chief! Oh, you too, Mogi! Great job!

156
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,610
This is amazing!

157
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,650
With Light's help, the theory that Kira is involved with the Yotsuba Group has become stronger.

158
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,030
Yotsuba?

159
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,680
Y-Yes...

160
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,890
That's probably the case, Matsuda.

161
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,530
Eh?

162
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,240
We just heard from the Director
that Kira has offered bribes to politicians.

163
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,750
Kira said...

164
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,040
As long as the police don't chase him,

165
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,730
he won't lay a hand on any politician.

166
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,260
The police caved in to Kira.

167
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,010
What?!

168
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,260
Mogi has already made up his mind, but...

169
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,250
Aizawa, Matsuda...

170
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,130
If you really still want to pursue Kira,

171
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,900
then turn in your letters of resignation to the NPA with Mogi and me.

172
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,280
We cannot pursue Kira anymore unless you quit the police force.

173
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
Wh-What do you mean?!

174
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,490
It's simple.

175
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,020
We were told that we would be fired if we were to pursue Kira with L.

176
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,080
S-So then, Chief, you really...

177
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,170
In a few hours, I'm no longer going to be your chief.

178
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,960
But you all have your own lives.

179
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,770
Please think long and hard before you make your decision.

180
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,390
You're right.

181
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,800
That's doubly true for those
who are married and have children.

182
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,350
I think you all should remain police officers.

183
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,990
I was alone to begin with,

184
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,650
and I'm grateful to all of you for sticking with me this far.

185
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,880
But I can do this by myself.

186
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,660
I'll be sure to visit you all at the police department

187
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,330
and bring you Kira's head as a gift.

188
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,080
Ryuzaki,

189
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,060
as long as I'm here, you won't be alone.

190
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,790
You have my promise!

191
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,980
That's right.

192
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,620
I'll have Light working with me until I catch Kira.

193
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,470
But everyone else should remain police officers.

194
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,970
But you told us that you needed the help of the police in this case.

195
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,980
That's because the police as an organization didn't bow to Kira, and hoped to arrest him.

196
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,530
I don't really think the help of two or three
civilians who quit the police force

197
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,110
can really count as the police.

198
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,090
Also, the police have decided
that they don't want to catch Kira,

199
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,320
so that's enough.

200
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,120
I-It's true that since we wouldn't be police officers anymore,

201
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,770
we wouldn't be of much help.

202
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,980
But what about our feelings?

203
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,330
We put our lives on the line to catch Kira.

204
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,960
We at least have the right to decide

205
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,590
whether we stay here or remain police officers!

206
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,760
I suppose you're right.

207
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,350
Then decide which you want to do.

208
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,480
B-But, Chief,

209
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
if you quit the police force, you'll be unemployed.

210
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,330
Suppose we <i>do</i> catch Kira,

211
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,020
what would you do afterwards?

212
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,730
Afterwards, huh?

213
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,280
I haven't thought about it,

214
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,340
but after we catch Kira...

215
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,490
I guess I'll be on the job hunt again.

216
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,120
I've decided!
I'm also going to quit the police and chase Kira!

217
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,580
I still have to do my job as Misa-Misa's manager!

218
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,670
Besides, if I remained a police officer, I'd feel like a loser...

219
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,010
Watch what you say, Matsuda.

220
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,650
How about if I remained a police officer and helped you in my spare time?

221
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,010
That's no good.

222
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,900
If you remain a police officer, please don't come back here.

223
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,980
I won't leak information.

224
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,400
I won't give you any information.

225
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,120
As detectives, you are free to chase Kira.

226
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,250
But I don't think it's right to give up your livelihoods and harm your families just to chase Kira.

227
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,090
It's as Ryuzaki says.

228
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,390
No one will blame you if you quit now.

229
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,140
That's right.

230
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,180
But, Chief,

231
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,410
you have a family too.

232
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,020
Our situations are different.

233
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,430
Th-That's not fair.

234
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,270
I want to stay here, too.

235
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,840
I was prepared to die at any time.

236
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,610
And if I quit here, how will I face Ukita?

237
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,160
Damn! Why can't a detective working for the police chase Kira?!

238
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,760
Ryuzaki.

239
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,610
In case anything happened to a member of the task force,

240
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,380
even if they were fired, you entrusted me to make preparations

241
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,440
so that financial support would be offered to their families,

242
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,760
and they would never be in need for the rest of their lives.

243
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,140
Why aren't you telling them that?

244
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,690
Watch your mouth, Watari.

245
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,220
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,980
Oh, so our livelihoods were secured?

247
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,130
Aren't you glad, Aizawa?!

248
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,810
Ryuzaki...

249
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,790
Were you watching to see if I would quit the police to join you?

250
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,110
I-It's not like that, Aizawa.

251
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,470
Ryuzaki just hates to say things like that to himself.

252
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,180
Th-That's right.

253
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,050
No.

254
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,830
I was testing you.

255
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,050
I was watching to see which you would choose.

256
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,300
Ryuzaki...

257
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,970
Fine then!

258
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,060
I'll quit and remain a police officer!

259
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,840
Aizawa!

260
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I couldn't make a decision quickly like you all did,

261
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,320
and I was leaning towards staying a police officer.

262
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,440
Don't be so stubborn.

263
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,910
No! I quit!

264
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,770
It's become clear to me once more!

265
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,770
I hate Ryuzaki!

266
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,050
I hate the way Ryuzaki does everything!

267
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,380
But I like people like you.

268
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,560
I also just can't stand

269
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,800
how he can say things like that so shamelessly!

270
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,970
I quit!

271
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,220
Thanks for all your hard work.

272
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,400
I found another.

273
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
The branch manager of Yotsuba's biggest rival bank

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,740
died on September 7th when he slipped on the steps of his home.

275
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,910
September 7th was a Friday.

276
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,440
I checked once more and discovered that the deaths

277
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,290
that are beneficial to Yotsuba are concentrated around the weekend.

278
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,920
Huh? Really?!

279
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,760
At first, the times of death were random.

280
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,490
But gradually, they became concentrated
around Friday nights through Saturday afternoons.

281
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,600
It's amazing you noticed that, Chief!

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
I told you, I'm no longer the Chief.

283
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,270
No, you'll always be the Chief to me!

284
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,230
This should be some sort of hint, Dad.

285
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,580
I haven't lost to you and Ryuzaki yet.

286
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,870
I don't want to be dead weight.

287
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,350
Dead weight?

288
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,330
Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

289
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,010
Or is Kira using Yotsuba?

290
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,750
I haven't figured that out yet,

291
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,840
but let's investigate this with the assumption that this is Kira's doing.

292
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,130
Let's thoroughly investigate Yotsuba!

293
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,930
I've compiled a list of all domestic employees in the Yotsuba Group.

294
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,260
Thank you very much.

295
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,620
300,000, huh?

296
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm surprised you compiled the list so quickly...

297
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,980
That's amazing, Mr. Mogi.

298
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,680
Mr. Mogi's been amazing from the beginning.

299
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,810
R-Ryuzaki!

300
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,520
Is there anything I can do

301
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,110
besides being a manager?

302
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,950
You want to be useful?

303
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes!

304
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,490
Then could you get me another cup of coffee?

305
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,040
What?

306
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,360
And for our guests over there.

307
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,800
Who are they?

308
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,750
And since when have they been here?

309
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,630
They're our new members.

310
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,340
I'm Aiber. A con-man. Pleased to meet you.

311
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,350
Wedy. I'm a thief by trade.

312
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,360
A con-man and a thief?

313
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,600
Yes.

314
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:37,910
Aiber has excellent social skills.
He's a con-man who can cozy up to our target.

315
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,860
We'll use him for infiltrative investigations.

316
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,360
Wedy is a thief who can crack any lock, safe, or security system.

317
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,080
As proof, she entered without any of us noticing.

318
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,820
W-We're going to be working together with criminals?

319
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,290
They're criminals,

320
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,570
but not the type who will surface and be killed by Kira.

321
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,090
Think of them as pros of the underworld.

322
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,430
I see. If we want to investigate Yotsuba,
we need people like them.

323
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,820
Let's all work together and give it our best!

324
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah!

325
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,940
Uh, right.

326
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,720
Huh?

327
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,570
It's Daddy.

328
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,570
What?

329
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,620
Daddy!

330
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,420
Yumi...

331
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,740
Eriko...

332
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,250
What are you doing here?

333
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,170
At least tell me if you're coming home.

334
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,050
I haven't bought enough for your dinner.

335
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,800
I'll give you half of my croquette!

336
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,180
Sorry...

337
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,140
I haven't had a break for quite a while now, so I got some time off.

338
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,370
Huh? Is a "time off" a break?

339
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,990
Yeah. That's what it is.

340
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,350
All right!

341
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,540
From now on, I can have a break every week.

342
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,140
So I can take you to this park.

343
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,780
No, the zoo...

344
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,620
or even the amusement park...

345
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,790
What's wrong?

346
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,620
Mama...

347
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,040
Papa is crying.

348
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,290
Secret meetings?

349
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,300
It sounds like they have one every Friday night.

350
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,420
Bingo!

351
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,130
I'm on it today!
