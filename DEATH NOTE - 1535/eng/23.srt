1
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,010
So one of these people is Kira, right?

2
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,790
Yes. I have a lot of proof.

3
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,070
The victim was Mr. H.

4
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,650
Kira's identity revealed at the end of this program!

5
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,300
If Higuchi, like the Second Kira,

6
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,480
can kill by looking at someone's face,

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,170
Mr. Matsuda will die.

8
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,710
I-It's him!

9
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,580
Don't fuck with me!

10
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,790
Remember the names of the people you hire!

11
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,920
I still have two hours.

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,960
I've confirmed Higuchi.

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,610
He's only got a bag on him.
I'm going after him.

14
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,610
I will kill him.

15
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm going to have everything!

16
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,120
Cosme Misa.

17
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,410
Devilish charm...

18
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,080
and angelic glitter...

19
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,430
The commercial's going to end, Ryuzaki.
Misa's winning rouge...

20
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,680
Sent to you...

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,630
Is that so?

22
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,920
So I ended up drinking with the eight of them, including Kira.

23
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,090
That's amusing.

24
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,030
If I say too much,

25
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,700
the people who were there will know who Kira is,

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,310
so I can't say any more.

27
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,650
Yes. Let's save that revelation until the end.

28
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,830
Make speaker one Higuchi's car and speaker two Sakura TV.

29
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,870
Higuchi's watching TV in his car.

30
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,170
According to what you said earlier, you've met Kira?

31
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,460
Yes. But at that time, I didn't know who Kira was.

32
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,970
I think it takes a lot of courage to appear
even though he's seen your face.

33
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,050
Are you all right?

34
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,560
Yes. As I was investigating,
I discovered the two things that Kira needs in order to kill.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,640
There are many rumors as to what they might be,

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,980
but I found out for sure.

37
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,770
A face and a name...

38
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,980
But Kira only knows one of those things about me.

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,570
He feels safe enough to step forward
just because I don't know his real name, huh?

40
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,030
Does that mean that there's nothing remaining
that connects him to his name?

41
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,910
If he already took his records into account,

42
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,790
is it pointless to go to Yoshida Productions?

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,210
Rem, what do you think?

44
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,800
What do I think? About what?

45
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,800
Rem?! Who's that?

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,130
He's in his car by himself.

47
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,470
I don't think that there's anyone else in that car.

48
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,310
He isn't using his cell phone either.

49
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,770
Could it be a radio or something?

50
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,480
No. There's no radio in that car.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,810
Only our wire-taps, cameras, and tracking devices.

52
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,190
That's Wedy's job, so I'm sure.

53
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,070
Could it be that there won't be a record
on him even if I go to Yoshida Productions?!

54
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,780
Is he talking to himself?

55
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,240
There's no way I would know.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,210
If he's smart, he would've destroyed everything

57
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,540
that connected him to his name before appearing on TV.

58
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,420
Also, don't you think that it's suspicious

59
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,510
for Yoshida Productions to just let me into their offices?

60
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,050
No, in this case, if there were a robbery,
the culprit would be me.

61
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,010
This sounds kind of bad...

62
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,770
It's all right. He'll go.

63
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,640
Even if he <i>does</i> have a record at Yoshida Productions,

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,600
what if it's filed under an alias?

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,110
Yes, there's a big possibility that he'd go that far.

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,490
It's probably Light and Misa's plan
to have Higuchi go to Yoshida Productions.

67
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,830
But if he knows that you're Kira,

68
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,370
then he'll end up announcing your name.

69
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,250
That is an inescapable fact.

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,500
All right, there's only an hour left until the announcement.

71
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,800
You have to go.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,630
Whether or not there's an alias on his record,

73
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,640
there's no way that you'll be suspected if you kill him with the notebook.

74
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,890
Yeah. I know.

75
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,310
But just in case,

76
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,650
I should kill the people I called
from Yoshida Productions, Misa, and her manager.

77
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,070
What?! No way, he said he'll kill me!

78
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,700
It's all right.
He means after he's killed Mr. Matsuda.

79
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,530
There's no point for him to do that unless he's killed Mr. Matsuda.

80
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,080
That's true, but...

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,660
Think hard.
You only have to kill him.

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,880
If you kill the people whom you just called,

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,050
your call history will implicate you.

84
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,420
Oh yeah...

85
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,800
Rem, you sure are smart.

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I'll kill them after I erase my call history.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
But the telephone company will still have a record of it.

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,730
He can't be talking to himself.

89
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,100
Who's "Rem"?
Who is he talking to?

90
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,860
If he <i>is</i> talking to someone, it would have to be with...

91
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,690
a Shinigami.

92
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,660
Do you suppose?

93
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,530
Perhaps I should ask him...

94
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,700
How about returning ownership of the notebook to me?

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,830
No. I'll only meet a pathetic end if I do that.

96
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,210
He says he has proof.

97
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,800
If he were to highlight Yotsuba's growth,

98
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,720
no one would doubt him.

99
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,220
The person he says is Kira will be marked as Kira.

100
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,680
Even if he doesn't have concrete evidence,

101
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,850
my life will be over.

102
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,980
I won't be promoted.
I won't even be able to stay with Yotsuba.

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,650
We have structured this show
under the premise that Kira is watching.

104
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,320
Then I'll call out to Kira.

105
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,580
Kira, turn yourself in.

106
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,580
He acts like an idiot,

107
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,210
but earlier he escaped death by making it seem like he died.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,290
I have to kill him.

109
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,840
He's arrived at Yoshida Productions.

110
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,430
It's about to begin.

111
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,570
To the left of the entrance...

112
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,030
In the desk farthest back...

113
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,660
In the bottom drawer...

114
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,520
Now, how are you going to kill?

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,850
Show me!

116
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,810
I'm ready to restrain Higuchi.

117
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,480
Just give me the order.

118
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,110
Got it.

119
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,870
It's no good!

120
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,750
He just made a note of his name and is leaving.

121
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,410
He's not going to kill him here?

122
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,790
Ryuzaki! Shall I restrain him?

123
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,840
I still don't know how he kills.

124
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,800
He might do something in his car.

125
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,550
Turn monitor one to Higuchi's car.

126
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:04,190
Higuchi is awfully calm despite wanting to kill Matsuda as soon as possible.

127
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,730
You're right.

128
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,230
If he needed a name, then he should've taken the personnel file with him.

129
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,690
But he just put it back in the drawer.

130
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,070
Thirty-six... Thirty-seven...

131
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,740
Thirty-eight... Thirty-nine...

132
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,240
Forty seconds.

133
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,160
Kira is a murderer,

134
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,200
so I cannot forgive him.

135
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,790
Damn! He won't die!

136
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,420
Wh-What's the meaning of this?!

137
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,290
He said, "He won't die!"

138
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,800
Did he just already try to kill?

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,550
Was writing his name all he had to do to kill?

140
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,140
What are you going to do?
Are you just going to keep watching him?

141
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,760
It seems like he can will a person to die with just their name.

142
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,930
What's going on?

143
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,690
I can't determine how he kills people.

144
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,940
But if I try to restrain him now and try to get him to confess...

145
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,780
There are only fifty minutes until the Kira announcement!

146
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Damn! I don't have any time!

147
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,990
He's making a phone call.

148
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,490
Probably Misa again.

149
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,120
You're right!

150
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,080
Hey!

151
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,790
I know his face...

152
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,590
If I go back to the office, there should be surveillance camera footage of him sneaking in.

153
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,630
If I had the Shinigami eyes...

154
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,640
Half of my remaining life, huh?

155
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,850
But if he makes the announcement, my life is finished.

156
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,640
Well then, better to have a life that's short and sweet.

157
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,230
Rem. Let's make the deal.

158
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,900
Deal?

159
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,190
Who is this "Rem" he's been talking to all this time?

160
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,200
Could Kira's power be from heaven or something?

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,580
I don't want to think that's the case.

162
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,040
Then who's Rem?

163
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,710
A Shinigami?

164
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,750
At any rate, we should watch him.

165
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,340
It looks like we can still find out more.

166
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,800
We may be able to find out how he kills.

167
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,590
Now I'm unstoppable...

168
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,350
With this, my options are limitless.

169
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,270
I'm going after him!

170
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,820
Stop your car!
Pull over to the side of the road.

171
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,940
Pull over and stop!

172
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,490
This is bad.
Higuchi has been caught by a motorcycle policeman.

173
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,620
I'm going to pass him by.
I'll leave this to Aiber and the others.

174
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,870
You were speeding.

175
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,080
Show me your driver's license.

176
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,630
Yeah, all right.

177
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,130
All screens on Higuchi's car.

178
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,180
Where did I put my license?

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,180
I can't waste time sticking around here.

180
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,520
Hey!

181
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,810
Higuchi is escaping!

182
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,980
That bastard!

183
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,320
This is the highway patrol.

184
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,830
Th-The motorcycle cop just rear-ended a truck! It's a collision!

185
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,370
A collision?!
An accidental death?

186
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,540
This is bad.

187
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,670
Higuchi put his hand in his bag.

188
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,000
Did he do something then?

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,510
No, that aside,

190
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,590
how did he obtain the name of that motorcycle cop?

191
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,100
Could he have killed him
by looking at his face like the Second Kira?

192
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,720
Rem... Deal...

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,970
No...

194
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,350
If he could kill just by looking at someone's face,

195
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,350
he should have immediately killed Mr. Matsuda.

196
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,940
What's going on?

197
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,360
But...

198
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,610
Everyone! It's too dangerous to let Higuchi alone any longer.

199
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,070
We will proceed to capture him!

200
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,780
Higuchi, like the Second Kira,

201
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,080
is now able to kill just by looking at someone's face,

202
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,080
We will capture him with that in mind!

203
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,390
Watari,

204
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,060
connect me to the chief of the police department.

205
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,810
Yes.

206
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,940
This is L.

207
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,440
We have narrowed down Kira to a single person.

208
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,610
Currently, he's heading from Hibiya to Shibuya

209
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,450
on Highway Route One in a red sports car.

210
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,820
We shall capture him.

211
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,200
So please instruct all officers not to approach that car.

212
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,790
Dad, after the next commercial, start stage seven.

213
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
All right.

214
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,550
Demegawa, during the next commercial,
switch Matsuda and the emcee with mannequins.

215
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,050
We'll make it seem as if the broadcast is still continuing using the audio we've prepared.

216
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,300
We'll leave the cameras and everyone will withdraw.

217
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,720
Now then, Yagami, shall we go?

218
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,850
Yeah.

219
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,150
Sorry, Misa,

220
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,650
but I'm going to restrain you for a while.

221
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,190
What?! What's this?!

222
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,940
Stop kidding around!

223
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,910
I never knew you could pilot a helicopter, Ryuzaki.

224
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,950
It's intuition.

225
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,540
Higuchi isn't heading towards Sakura TV.

226
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,840
He's going the wrong way.

227
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,510
By his route, I'd say he's headed to Yotsuba's main offices.

228
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,010
That's incredible courage.

229
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,850
No, I just did what was appropriate.

230
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,520
If I go to the main offices
and find surveillance footage with him on it, I can kill him.

231
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,890
Wedy,

232
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,270
everything relating to Matsuda
at Yotsuba's main offices has been disposed of, right?

233
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,190
Yes. Is he headed there?

234
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,400
How convenient.

235
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,910
That'll give me time
to go ahead of him and wait with Mr. Yagami.

236
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,660
Damn! He's nowhere!

237
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,170
No, he's been erased from these videos.

238
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,710
Did he come and erase himself?

239
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,880
Or has someone betrayed me?

240
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,390
No, doing that wouldn't absolve them of their crimes.

241
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,890
At any rate, I don't have time.

242
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,220
I've gotta hurry!

243
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,110
The time for the announcement is approaching.

244
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,070
Yes. I feel like saying it already.

245
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,900
I understand your feelings,

246
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,320
but we'll have just one more commercial break right now.

247
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,030
Damn!

248
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,530
I'll just have to go to Sakura TV and kill him.

249
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Dad,

250
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,880
Higuchi will arrive at Sakura TV soon.

251
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,420
He'll be there within fifteen minutes.
Are you all right?

252
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,090
I don't want my son to ask me if I'm all right.

253
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,590
I'm all right, Light.

254
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,050
Is there anything more you want to say before the announcement?

255
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,850
Well, I want everyone to think about Kira after he's caught.

256
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,190
Mr. Yagami, it's almost time.
Well, I want everyone to think about Kira after he's caught.

257
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,390
Kira is definitely evil.
Mr. Yagami, it's almost time.

258
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,100
Yeah.
Kira is definitely evil.

259
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,690
Here.

260
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,280
Aiber hates guns, so I'm the only one who's armed.

261
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,780
I'm no longer a police officer.

262
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm not allowed to have this.

263
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,330
You're also not allowed to use this in Japan.

264
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,950
Stubborn as usual, aren't you?

265
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,420
I made it!

266
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,930
Why isn't anyone here?

267
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,020
Are they being careful
because they're broadcasting the truth?

268
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,150
Well, this'll be easier, since no one's here.

269
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,570
We've arrived at Sakura TV.

270
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,860
I'm getting into position.

271
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,030
Let's go, Aiber.

272
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,400
Okay, Mogi!

273
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,830
We're getting lots of phone calls and faxes

274
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,790
showing support for what you're doing here.

275
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,830
Even the studio is empty...

276
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,670
Still, I have to watch out for the television cameras.

277
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,380
I'm sorry, but due to the circumstances,

278
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,720
we must end this program here.

279
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
What?!
we must end this program here.

280
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,760
Mannequins!

281
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,180
No way!

282
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,890
Stop right there, Higuchi!

283
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,560
Don't move!

284
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,690
Give up.

285
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,320
Y-You must be making some kind of mistake.

286
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,450
I had something I wanted to talk to Mr. Demegawa about.

287
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,910
They're wearing helmets.

288
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,450
They've taken anti-Kira precautions...

289
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,740
In that case...

290
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,040
I'm from Yotsuba Group's development department.

291
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,420
I'll show you my card.

292
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,210
Chief!

293
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,050
Aiber!

294
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,010
Damn! I didn't want to have to use this, but...!

295
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,980
Higuchi has a gun!

296
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,480
The Chief has been shot.

297
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,810
Higuchi is making an escape!

298
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,020
I'm all right.

299
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,820
Sorry, Ryuzaki.

300
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,150
If we give chase immediately, we can still catch him.

301
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,070
Hurry!

302
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,860
This is bad.
He's escaped from Sakura TV!

303
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,750
We have no choice.

304
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,670
We shall proceed to capture him as well.

305
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,760
Watari, are you ready?

306
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,420
Ready.

307
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,590
Yagami...

308
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,090
Hold on to this for self-defense.

309
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,260
It's Kira we're after.

310
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,810
No. Those aren't allowed in Japan.

311
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm sure your father said the same thing.

312
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,100
Yeah...

313
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,240
He's driving recklessly!

314
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,530
Don't lose sight of him!

315
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,240
Okay!

316
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,710
What was going on earlier?

317
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,050
It had to be a trap.

318
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,800
We now end our current broadcast to bring you the news.

319
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,850
The program ended, but I wasn't the one who ended it.

320
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,730
Damn... Who in the...

321
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,600
What's this?!

322
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
It was<i> a trap after all.</i>

323
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,030
Police cars with tinted windows?

324
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,080
The police have been taking anti-Kira measures.

325
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,790
What is this?

326
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,920
I told the police not to make any moves.

327
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,790
The only one who would do this is...

328
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,920
Yes, you're right.

329
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Damn! If I go this way...

330
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,540
Stop right there!

331
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,510
Don't come any closer!

332
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,890
Don't you come near me!

333
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,860
It's over...

334
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Yes. It is...

335
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,000
The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die.

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,750
This note will not take effect unless the writer
has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name.

337
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,840
Therefore, people sharing
the same name will not be affected.
