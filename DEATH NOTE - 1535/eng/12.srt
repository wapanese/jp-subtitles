1
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,150
Light, Ryuzaki says he wants you to help with the investigation.

2
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,450
If you're interested, come immediately.

3
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,690
Okay, Dad.

4
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,620
I was trying to find a way to get involved in the investigation.

5
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,080
I never thought L himself would ask me.

6
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,130
Now I can get inside information about the investigation

7
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,710
and about the Fake Kira.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,470
I need to find out about the Fake Kira

9
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,720
before anyone else at task force headquarters does.

10
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,720
Thank you, Yagami.

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Not at all.

12
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,180
Ryuga, we both want to catch Kira.

13
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,310
Please call me Ryuzaki here.

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,610
I'm Matsui.

15
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,730
I'm Aihara.

16
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,710
And I'm Asahi.

17
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,820
I see.

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,030
Well, would it be all right if I'm Asahi Light?

19
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,740
Please do.

20
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,950
I will call you Light here.

21
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,330
Now to business.

22
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,000
Take a look at our current information on Kira.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,960
I also want you to examine this video,

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,300
which was sent to the television station, but was never released to the public.

25
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,930
Taking any material from this room
or taking notes is forbidden.

26
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,800
I understand.

27
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,740
We shall now begin.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,060
Light...

29
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,940
We're going to hide the possibility that there is a second Kira,

30
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,900
and ask Yagami Light to investigate with us.

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,530
B-But wouldn't that make it difficult for Light to help with the investigation?

32
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,660
That's right.

33
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,370
Why do you want him to work with us anyway?

34
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,290
We're only going to hide that from him

35
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,960
until we have him watch this tape and ask him for his impression of it.

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,460
There's something amazing about Light's deductive skills.

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,880
When he sees this,

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,800
he may even deduce that there is a second Kira.

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,220
But the only basis for a second Kira

40
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,180
is your explanation that the victims
of those killings had committed minor crimes

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,140
that never would have been punished by Kira.

42
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,600
That's not all.

43
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,940
The Kira that we've presumed until now

44
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,860
needed a face and a name to kill.

45
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,820
But judging from the fact that Mr. Ukita was killed as soon as he arrived at the television station

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,200
and considering how Kira practically told me that he could kill me if I just appeared on TV...

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,790
That means the Second Kira

48
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,210
can kill by just seeing someone's face.

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,550
So, I'll ask Light to look at
the investigative facts and the video.

50
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,840
If he suggests that there may be a second Kira,

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,860
then he's almost completely cleared.

52
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,010
What do you mean, Ryuzaki?

53
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,270
If he's Kira, he'll want to kill me,
the one in charge of the investigation.

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,300
At this rate, if I go along with the Second Kira's demands

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,130
and appear three days later on TV, I will die.

56
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,780
I don't think that Kira would miss an easy chance to kill me.

57
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,730
So what you're saying is that if my son doesn't deduce that there is a second Kira,

58
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,660
you'll continue to suspect him?

59
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,670
No. In that case, it will remain below a five-percent chance.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,180
And we'll tell him that we are investigating
the possibility of a second Kira and have him assist us.

61
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,640
After seeing that, I trust you now believe that I am Kira.

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,340
On the given day and time...

63
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,350
Could the reason I feel so disgusted when I watch this

64
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,730
be that I'm the real Kira?

65
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,030
This is more than just about tarnishing Kira's reputation.

66
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,530
So why...

67
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,360
Why isn't anyone giving me
any explanation about this video?

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,990
That's a bit odd.

69
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,780
Well, whatever the case,

70
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,080
I won't say anything careless about this video.

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,870
If I leave the situation alone, L will die.

72
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,860
What do you think, Light?

73
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Did you get something from it?

74
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,010
Damn him!

75
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,350
There may be more than one person who has Kira's power.

76
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,620
K-Kira's power?!

77
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,140
What do you mean, Light?!

78
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,610
There is a good chance that this is not the Kira we know.

79
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,650
Up to now, Kira's never used suspects like these for his announced killings.

80
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,780
Furthermore, if Kira needs a face and a name to kill,

81
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,040
isn't it strange that he was able
to kill the detective and the officers

82
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,080
who happened to rush to the television-station building?

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,910
I-It's the same.

84
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,930
It's exactly the same deduction that
L — I mean, Ryuzaki, made.

85
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,400
G-Good job, Light.

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,300
You should be cleared now.

87
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,860
That's right, Light.

88
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,800
I also think we are looking at a second Kira.

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,470
I thought so.

90
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,970
So you knew, Ryuga—

91
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,570
I mean, Ryuzaki?

92
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,150
Did you test me, knowing that?

93
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,110
I didn't test you.

94
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,400
It's not convincing if I'm the only one who
argues that there is a second Kira.

95
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,650
With you coming to the same conclusion as I did,

96
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,320
my theory becomes more believable.

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,990
You've been of great assistance to me, Light.

98
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,160
Thank you so much.

99
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,160
So it's decided.

100
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,930
We first have to stop the Second Kira.

101
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,810
He obviously sympathizes with Kira,

102
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,960
and is not very bright.

103
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,800
I think he'll obey the real Kira.

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,180
So if we make a fake message from the real Kira, there is a good chance that we can stop him.

105
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,660
Great minds think alike, Ryuzaki.

106
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,770
I also thought that would be the best idea.

107
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,650
Light,

108
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,360
I would like you to play the part of the real Kira.

109
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,000
M-Me?

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,030
Yes.

111
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,260
With your intellect, you should be able to do it.

112
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,200
At any rate, we don't have any time to waste.

113
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,810
Could you script a message
from Kira to air on tonight's news?

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,710
Damn him...

115
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,840
He planned from the beginning to bring me here to play this role.

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,630
Ryuzaki, is this all right?

117
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,970
I think I've portrayed Kira convincingly.

118
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,100
I think this is very good,

119
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,940
though if we don't remove the part which says,
"You're free to kill L,"

120
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,400
I'll die.

121
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,480
Well, when pretending to be Kira,

122
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,700
I thought that he would demand that you be killed.

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,920
It's just a bit of a joke.

124
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,370
You can change that to whatever you like.

125
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,120
I will.

126
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,490
Mr. Aihara,

127
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,790
the script is ready, I leave it to you.

128
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,850
All right.

129
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,540
And now a shocking development.

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,260
In response to the video that was sent and aired on Sakura TV a few days ago,

131
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,760
another person claiming to be the real Kira has appeared.

132
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,350
He has ordered several television stations to air his message.

133
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,320
The police department has authorized us to broadcast this video.

134
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,230
Is this the real Kira?

135
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,770
Is this another Kira?

136
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,780
First, please take a look at the video.

137
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,360
I am Kira.

138
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,570
I did it!

139
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,860
Kira responded!

140
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,130
I am the true Kira.

141
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,710
The Kira who was shown on Sakura TV

142
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,580
is a fake.

143
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,110
I'm being lenient to the impostor

144
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:55,090
because I know he was only trying to help me.

145
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,470
However, killing the innocent is against my beliefs.

146
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,100
If the impostor truly sympathizes with me

147
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,940
and wants to help my cause,

148
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,320
I ask that he refrain from killing aimlessly, and accept my basic principles.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,390
If you ignore this warning and continue to be reckless...
All right! The video, the video!

150
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,060
If you ignore this warning and continue to be reckless...

151
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,490
What are you planning to do?

152
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,950
I'm going to reply to him, of course.

153
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,790
Ryuzaki,

154
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,960
it's a reply from the Second Kira.

155
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,670
What?

156
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,880
It's here!

157
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,250
I will bring the entire envelope there,

158
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,300
but I shall play a copy on the computer.

159
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,220
Mr. Kira, thank you for your reply.

160
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,480
I will do as you say.

161
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,640
Wow!

162
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
We did it.

163
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,640
"I will do as you say," huh?

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,360
I don't know if I can use him.

165
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,160
If he really knows Kira's feelings,

166
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,800
he would force L to appear on TV, and kill him.

167
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,570
Don't fall for something like this.

168
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,700
Dammit!

169
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,870
I want to meet you.

170
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't think you have the eyes,

171
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,500
but I won't try to kill you.

172
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,710
Please don't worry.

173
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,380
I-Is he stupid?

174
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,630
He talked about the Shinigami eyes
on a tape that the whole world will see?

175
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,970
He just said that he didn't have "the eyes," didn't he?

176
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,050
What could that mean?

177
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,060
Who knows?

178
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,140
Please tell me how I can meet you
without the police finding out.

179
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,900
When we meet, we can confirm our identities by showing our Shinigami to each other.

180
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,780
Shinigami?!

181
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,360
He's no good.

182
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,240
I have to do something about this guy quickly, or else...

183
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,240
What is it?!

184
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,620
R-Ryuzaki!

185
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,550
Are you all right?!

186
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,460
Sh—

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,630
Shinigami?!

188
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,050
Are we supposed to accept

189
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,920
the existence of something like that?!

190
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,410
Shinigami?

191
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,980
Are we supposed to accept

192
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,980
the existence of something like that?

193
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,860
I-Impossible...

194
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,070
There's no such thing...

195
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,910
That's right, Ryuzaki.

196
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,450
Shinigami don't exist.

197
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,500
Kira had those criminals in prison

198
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,960
write something about Shinigami.

199
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,970
So shouldn't we assume

200
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,060
that this is the same Kira?

201
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,610
It's the same person, so they say the same things.

202
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,820
That can't be, Dad.

203
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,650
If this is the same Kira from before,

204
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,430
he wouldn't have replied to our video.

205
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:55,040
There is no way that the real Kira would go through the trouble of getting L to appear on TV,

206
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,350
only to stop trying to kill him.

207
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,610
Then maybe the real Kira and the Second Kira
have already established a connection,

208
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,410
and decided to use the word "Shinigami" to throw off the investigation.

209
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,160
That's not possible.

210
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,890
It's as Light says.

211
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,550
If the two Kiras were connected,

212
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't think that he would stop trying to kill me.

213
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,860
The Second Kira is acting

214
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,660
independent of the first.

215
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,010
He wants to meet the real Kira.

216
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,630
That's right.

217
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,220
He's acting out of interest in Kira.

218
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,680
"Shinigami" probably refers to their killing power.

219
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,130
"We can confirm our identities by showing our Shinigami to each other," probably means

220
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,860
"We can confirm our identities
by showing each other our killing power."

221
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,200
That's right.

222
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
The word "Shinigami" is a word that has

223
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,170
some meaning between Kira and the Second Kira.

224
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,090
We should try to get him to tell us what it means.

225
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,260
So are you going to respond
and force him to be more direct?

226
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,050
If we don't ask him properly,

227
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,780
he may realize that we know nothing,

228
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,890
and that we're not Kira.

229
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,100
No, I shall leave the rest to Kira and the Second Kira.

230
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,320
Leave it to them?

231
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,460
The Second Kira has received a message from Kira

232
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,650
and is now content about the current situation.

233
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,690
He thinks that he has Kira's attention.

234
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,250
And he also used a word that only the two of them would understand.

235
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,480
This reply will air today on Sakura TV's six o'clock news.

236
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,290
Of course, Kira should be watching the exchange

237
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,750
between our made-up Kira and the Second Kira.

238
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,350
From Kira's viewpoint,

239
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,890
he'll want to prevent the Second Kira
from coming into direct contact with the police.

240
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,570
Maybe this time,

241
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,930
the real Kira will feel pressured to respond.

242
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,020
And if Kira doesn't?

243
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,110
Yes, I thought of what we could do with the Second Kira in that case.

244
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,740
But if he reveals more information
that Kira doesn't want the police to know

245
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,960
and makes Kira more nervous and furious

246
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,450
in order to pressure Kira into meeting him...

247
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,790
That would be interesting.

248
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
If Kira gets scared

249
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,210
and sends a reply in order to avoid that... That would be even more interesting.

250
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,380
In which case,

251
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,800
we might be able to obtain some physical evidence from Kira himself.

252
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,980
In the meantime,

253
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,680
let us pursue the Second Kira.

254
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,850
That's good!

255
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,900
Just like that!

256
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,570
That was great, just great, Misa.

257
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,660
That was wonderful!

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,740
I'm worn out...

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,740
Modeling sure uses a lot of energy!

260
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,110
Hey, Rem.

261
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,200
Hm?

262
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,920
Can I ask you something?

263
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,400
What is it?

264
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,860
Shinigami always have to have a Death Note.

265
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,710
So to give one to a human to play with,
the Shinigami needs to have two Death Notes.

266
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:14,470
That means that Ryuk, who gave the extra Death Note to Kira, was able to trick the Shinigami King, right?

267
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,180
Right.

268
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,550
Then you too?

269
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,640
No. The Shinigami King isn't easy to fool.

270
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,360
Then how?

271
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,070
I'm one of the few in the Shinigami Realm

272
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,030
who know how to kill a Shinigami.

273
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,780
Let's leave it at that.

274
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,910
Then you killed a Shinigami and gave his notebook to me.

275
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,720
No.

276
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,540
I didn't kill him.

277
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,910
I just happened to be around

278
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,930
when a Shinigami died.

279
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,050
So, tell me how to kill a Shinigami.

280
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't tell anyone, okay?

281
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,560
The way to kill a Shinigami

282
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,560
is to make them fall in love with a human.

283
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,490
What a beautiful way to kill.

284
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,940
There once was a Shinigami who used to watch a certain girl.

285
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,040
His name was Gelus.

286
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,550
Gelus was always looking at that girl,
from the Shinigami Realm.

287
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,920
It's today, isn't it?

288
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,600
The end of her life.

289
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,420
She looks so healthy.

290
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,220
I wonder why today?

291
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,480
Why...

292
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,740
today?

293
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,550
I wanted to know how she was going to die too,

294
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,540
and decided to watch with him.

295
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,350
The girl was walking alone at night on a street.

296
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,320
And then...

297
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,770
Suddenly from an alley, a man appeared

298
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,200
and confessed his love for the girl.

299
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,030
I love you more than anyone else in the world!

300
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,810
I'm always watching you!
I want to protect you forever!

301
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,920
It was a man she didn't know.

302
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,360
She turned him down, of course.

303
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Then...

304
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll kill you...

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,290
Then kill myself!

306
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
H-Hey.

307
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,010
Stop!

308
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,010
Gelus did something that a Shinigami should never do.

309
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,150
Gelus saved the girl

310
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,910
by using his Death Note.

311
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,530
But that was not good.

312
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,880
Shinigami shorten human lives.

313
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,210
They exist only to take lives.

314
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,760
At that moment,

315
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,080
Gelus became something which was neither sand nor rust,

316
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,380
and died.

317
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,620
Only his Death Note remained.

318
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,900
Then Gelus' remaining life

319
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,080
was transferred to the girl whose life he saved.

320
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,810
Does that mean that if he hadn't fallen in love
with that girl, he wouldn't have died?

321
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,370
That's right.

322
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,390
So...

323
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,450
It was a Shinigami named Gelus who saved me that day.

324
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,400
Yes.

325
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,900
Gelus was in love with you.

326
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,570
So that notebook is yours.

327
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,570
Yeah...

328
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,330
I see.

329
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,290
In order to kill a Shinigami, you need him
to fall in love with a human and save that person.

330
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,030
What about you, Rem?

331
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,300
Are you in love with me?

332
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,980
Give it up.

333
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,470
You can't kill me.

334
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,230
Oh, you figured it out?

335
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,240
But now I have something I can tell Kira.

336
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,650
I wonder if he knows?

337
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,480
How to kill a Shinigami?

338
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,650
I asked him on TV,
"Please tell me how I can meet you,"

339
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,110
but he hasn't replied.

340
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,660
Maybe I'll go and tell him something again.

341
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,900
This isn't good.

342
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,250
I can't leave the Second Kira alone like this.

343
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,770
If the Second Kira makes a fatal slip-up

344
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,880
and is caught by the police,

345
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
there is a chance that the police will find out about the Death Note.

346
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,440
Welcome.

347
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,130
A strawberry sundae please.

348
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,740
Certainly.

349
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,520
So what should I do?

350
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,030
How can I contact the Second Kira without L noticing?

351
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,120
Thank you for waiting.

352
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,030
I want to meet Kira soon!

353
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,100
But at any rate,

354
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,210
what kind of a person are you, Fake Kira?

355
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,120
What kind of a person are you, Kira?

356
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,330
May 22nd: my friend and I showed off our notebooks in Aoyama.

357
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,320
If the Fake Kira is caught,

358
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,940
I'll have to obtain his notebook.

359
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,220
In the worst-case scenario, I may have to kill everyone there.
