1
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,650
What?!

2
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,480
Th-There were another twenty-three heart attack victims yesterday?!

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,740
As soon as we began to suspect that Kira was a student,

4
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,740
the timing of the killings changed as if to contradict our theory.

5
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,700
Does that mean that Kira knows what the police know?

6
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,700
When L discovers that the findings from the investigation were leaked,

7
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,920
he's bound to search for leads on me within the police force.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,090
Someone's been following you all this time.

9
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,780
That's a problem.

10
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,140
I'll be sure to finish him off, Ryuk.

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,880
With Shinigami's eyes,

12
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,730
a human's name and life span can be seen above their head.

13
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,730
Also,

14
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,050
Shinigami can turn the eyes of whoever picked up their Death Note

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,780
into Shinigami eyes.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,240
The price for a pair of Shinigami eyes

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,030
is half of that person's remaining life span.

18
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,040
So... What'll it be, Light?

19
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,290
I haven't seen Ryuk around lately.

20
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,570
Did he really lose his Death Note in the Human World?

21
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,510
His Death Note was probably picked up by a human before he got to it.

22
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,140
Couldn't be... If that happened to him, he'd have to stick around

23
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,350
until that person dies or his Death Note is destroyed.

24
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,380
Yeah.

25
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,340
I can't picture Ryuk doing something so tedious.

26
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,440
I heard that he was carrying two Death Notes.

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Seriously? Why would he need two?

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,900
I don't understand what he's thinking.

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,950
In order for me to gain the eyes of a Shinigami,

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,040
I have to offer half of my life.

31
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,910
Is that right?

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,400
Yeah.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,920
What are you gonna do?

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,380
Do you wanna make a deal with me?

35
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,460
Ryuk.

36
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,090
This deal...

37
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,960
is out of the question.

38
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,020
Now listen.

39
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,860
I want to create an ideal, new world free from criminals.

40
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,450
I also intend to reign as the god in that world for a long time.

41
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,890
I would consider the deal if it lengthened my life,

42
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,910
but it's not worth talking about if it's going to shorten it.

43
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,290
You, most of all, should know that.

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,250
Yeah, I just felt I should tell you a deal like this exists.

45
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,260
I don't want you to complain that I didn't tell you about this earlier.

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,930
If you didn't tell me about this earlier?

47
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't you think you're too late already?

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,200
You should have told me this when we first met

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,140
or included this when you were writing instructions in the Death Note.

50
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,450
I-I guess you're right.

51
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,390
Even though I'm a Shinigami, he's not frightened nor does he try to suck up to me.

52
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,900
He has no problem giving me a hard time about things like this.

53
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,620
Well?

54
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,360
Hmm?

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,290
You sure there isn't anything else you want to tell me ahead of time?

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,250
Shinigami Ryuk...

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
Nope, nothing else.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,130
Probably...

59
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,510
Is that so? How disappointing.

60
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,760
Disappointing?

61
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,750
I may have seriously considered the deal

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,570
if you offered me wings rather than eyes.

63
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,100
Soaring around freely in the sky is very god-like.

64
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,730
It's a dream that man has had since ancient times.

65
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,610
You'd stand out if you sprouted wings and started flying around.

66
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,460
I'd bet you'd get arrested by the police just for that.

67
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,150
That was a joke, Ryuk.

68
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,160
However, if I continue to deal for eyes and wings,

69
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,370
I'm going to end up becoming a real Shinigami.

70
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,500
That could be amusing, don't you think?

71
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,440
Don't worry.

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,540
Even without all that, you're already...

73
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,510
a worthy Shinigami!

74
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,840
The Shinigami Realm is rotting these days.

75
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,850
They all live vacant lives

76
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,350
and only take human lives because they don't want to die.

77
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,850
No one even knows

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,860
why we exist.

79
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,240
I doubt there's any reason at all for our existence.

80
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,290
You're much more of a Shinigami than they are.

81
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,190
Well, from what you're saying,

82
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,450
it sounds like I'm doing a lot more work.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,000
But I don't want to be lumped together with the Shinigami.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,620
I am using this Death Note as a human <i>for humans</i>.

85
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,680
But I wouldn't say that the Shinigami Realm is meaningless to humans either.

86
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,200
What do you mean?

87
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,350
Well, think about it.

88
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:20,000
Whenever a Shinigami like you comes to the Human World once every hundredâ€”no, every thousand years,

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,480
the Human World changes greatly.

90
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,520
The Shinigami Realm's existence is fearfully meaningful.

91
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,200
I-Is that so?

92
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,930
You told me that the Shinigami Realm is rotten.

93
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,290
When you return from this world,

94
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,500
how about using what you've learned here to try to change it?

95
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,340
Light,

96
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,090
you may be quite the optimist.

97
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,970
Of course I am.

98
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,300
If I weren't,

99
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,850
I wouldn't be trying to use the Death Note to try to make the world a better place.

100
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,230
That's it!

101
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,710
I've got it!

102
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,150
What's up? What did you get?

103
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,900
How to find out the name of the guy who was following me today.

104
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,510
How are you going to do it?

105
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,500
I'm going to use the rules of the Death Note to my advantage.

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,400
If I write a cause of death, I have an additional 6 minutes and 40 seconds

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,910
to record specific conditions and time of death.

108
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,920
I wonder how free I can be with these conditions.

109
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,420
I'm going to test it out.

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,490
Yes, it's me.

111
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,130
Another six inmates...

112
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,690
Heart attacks?!

113
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,730
It's Kira.

114
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,520
What?

115
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,480
Three exhibited bizarre behavior before they died?!

116
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,200
Wh-What do you mean?!

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,320
They didn't just die from simple heart attacks?

118
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Well, they died of heart attacks, but before one of them died,

119
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,700
he drew a strange picture on the wall with blood from his finger.

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,330
Another left a letter that doesn't seem like a will or anything meaningful.

121
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,840
The third escaped just to go to the employees' bathroom.

122
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,380
What is it, Watari?

123
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,980
More victims, but their circumstances are unlike those we've had before.

124
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,020
Unlike those we've had before?

125
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,000
I shall send you an image of the picture and letter left at the scene.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,020
If you could.

127
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,450
A note describing a fear of Kira.

128
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,330
This can be taken as something a criminal might do,

129
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,330
but Kira can control the time of death.

130
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,840
If he can control actions right before death as well,

131
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,210
that would mean...

132
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,540
Chief!

133
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,600
It's about these current victims.

134
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,300
Don't let the media know anything aside from the fact that they died of heart attacks.

135
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,880
It's possible that Kira was performing some kind of test.

136
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,100
If that's the case,

137
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,670
we'd only be giving him the answer.

138
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,970
I see.

139
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,650
I-I understand.

140
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,280
Performing tests on criminals?

141
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,380
That's horrible.

142
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,910
He's playing with people's lives as if this were a game.

143
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,620
This is unforgivable!

144
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,660
If Kira is using criminals as test subjects...

145
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,290
what is he trying to achieve?

146
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,190
Look at this, Ryuk.

147
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,350
The results of yesterday's test have already been input into Dad's computer.

148
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,630
The results are just as I expected.

149
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,640
The Death Note will work for what I have in mind.

150
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,690
What do you mean by that?

151
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,780
One escaped and went to the bathroom I had designated in the Death Note.

152
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,320
Another drew the same picture I had drawn in the Death Note.

153
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,950
Yet another wrote the same letter I had written in the Death Note.

154
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,460
These three did exactly what I wanted.

155
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,210
I purposely wrote very difficult tasks for the other three.

156
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,000
The first was to "die in front of the Eiffel Tower in an hour."

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,720
It's physically impossible to go from a prison in Japan to France in an hour.

158
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,180
So this never happened and ended as just a regular heart attack.

159
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,440
The next was to
"draw a picture of L's face on the prison wall",

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,830
but one can't draw the faces of people they don't know.

161
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,610
I see.

162
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,910
For the final one,

163
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:45,120
I specified that he would write a note that would read,
"I know L is suspicious of the Japanese police".

164
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,330
I thought this one might work, but it didn't happen.

165
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,250
Which means that people can't write about

166
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,510
things they don't know or things they couldn't come up with on their own.

167
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,090
In short, it means that even the Death Note can't do the impossible.

168
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,420
But as long as it's something the person is realistically likely to do,

169
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,640
I can control them as much as I want before they die.

170
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,020
You've figured that out,

171
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,860
but what are you trying to do, Light?

172
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,440
L and the police will never figure out my true goal.

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,700
The great detective is probably trying to decipher the picture and the letter those criminals left.

174
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,710
It's an absolutely meaningless dying message.

175
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,630
If Kira used those criminals for a test,

176
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,920
he's about to start something.

177
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,760
If he moves now, there is the chance that the FBI will notice someone acting suspiciously.

178
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,270
But if he has a different goal in mind,

179
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,770
the letter and picture might be some kind of message.

180
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,940
Is this it?

181
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,320
Well, it's time for the real thing.

182
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
The real thing?

183
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,320
Yesterday on the news,

184
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
there was a drug addict who failed robbing a bank.

185
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,010
He attacked civilians and ran away.

186
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,830
I'll use him.

187
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,080
It's last minute, but I'm sure I can find someone.

188
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,250
I'll ask out several people.

189
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,560
Ask out several people?

190
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,420
Yeah.

191
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,840
Ryuk, I may not look it, but I'm pretty popular.

192
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,280
Hello?

193
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,200
Huh, Light?

194
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,980
G-Good morning...

195
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,340
He's still following me, isn't he?

196
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,130
That's perfect.

197
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,260
If I don't have my stalker, there would be no point in what I'm going to do next.

198
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,520
Light!

199
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,720
A date?

200
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
Yeah.

201
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,360
It's a date, no matter how you look at it.

202
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,500
Even to my stalker.

203
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,360
It's no normal date, is it?

204
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,160
You said you had a way to find out your stalker's name,

205
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,120
but what do you plan to do?

206
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,110
Huh? Ryuk, didn't you see what I wrote in the Death Note?

207
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,640
Nah. It would be boring to peek.

208
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,390
Then just be patient and watch what happens.

209
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,560
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

210
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,500
No, not at all!

211
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,680
Anyway, I haven't been to Space Land since junior high!

212
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,810
I'm so excited! And I get to be alone with you!

213
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,210
Yeah.

214
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,730
On weekdays, he only goes to school and his prep courses.

215
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,900
An occasional date on his days off.

216
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,110
He's pretty normal.

217
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,990
No, he's a serious high-school student.

218
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,030
Chief Yagami's son, Light.

219
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,260
I have no reason to suspect him.

220
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,870
At any rate,

221
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,090
I'll finish my surveillance of him today.

222
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,550
Light...

223
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,690
Didn't you say that you weren't going out until entrance exams were over?

224
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,100
Yeah, but I <i>did</i> score number one in the practice exams.

225
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,560
You're awful!

226
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,930
It's him! He's here!

227
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,270
Aside from him, there are seven passengers.

228
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,730
Everything will go smoothly.

229
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,350
Huh?

230
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,110
I'm taking control of this bus!

231
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,490
A bus jacking?! At a time like this?

232
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,110
Don't make a fuss!

233
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,820
I'll kill anyone who moves.

234
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,350
Driver, you know the phone number for Space Land's offices, don't you?

235
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,060
Call them!

236
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,830
All right.

237
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,790
This is Sasaki, the driver of bus number 174!

238
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,410
Tell them what's happening!

239
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,130
A man with a gun has bus jacked us!

240
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,300
Give me that.

241
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,010
You hear that? Listen carefully.

242
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,340
Bring Space Land's profits from yesterday to two bus stops away from there.

243
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,950
Have a woman bring it by car alone!

244
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,810
Do it before this bus gets there!

245
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,310
If you try anything funny

246
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,570
or call the police,

247
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll kill all the passengers one by one!

248
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,220
Yuri, don't worry.

249
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,830
I'll look for a chance

250
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,240
to grab his hand that's holding the pistol.

251
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,830
That's dangerous. Don't do it.

252
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,000
If it comes to that, I'll do it.

253
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,570
It's all right. We don't have to pass notes.

254
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,180
As long as we whisper, he won't hear us over the sound of the bus.

255
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,980
Do you have proof that you're not his accomplice?

256
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,550
A-Accomplice?

257
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,900
It's pretty common.

258
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,770
The culprit pretends he's alone

259
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,110
and just in case, he'll leave someone to keep watch in the back.

260
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,920
What's wrong?

261
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,160
No... you really think so?

262
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,330
I-I have no choice.

263
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,660
There is no way that Light Yagami can be Kira.

264
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,860
Kira could kill the culprit with a heart attack.

265
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,090
This is my proof. Take a look.

266
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,840
FBI?!

267
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,970
I see. L's using the FBI to investigate those connected to Japan's police force!

268
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,390
His name is Raye Penber.

269
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,730
I trust you.

270
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,570
I won't ask why an FBI agent is on this bus with us.

271
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,750
Do you have a gun?

272
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,900
I do.

273
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,320
So if something happens, I can rely on you, right?

274
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,410
Yes.

275
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,240
Shut up!

276
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,080
Do you want to die?!

277
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,580
That man was on the Japanese news two days ago.

278
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,000
He's a drug addict who tried to rob a bank,
killed three civilians, and ran away.

279
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,130
He's very dangerous.

280
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,480
It's all right.

281
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,590
He'll never shoot at us.

282
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,260
Oh!

283
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,010
Hey, you! Don't move.

284
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,770
What's that piece of paper?

285
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,100
Hey you!

286
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,940
You were planning something back here with notes, weren't you?

287
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,060
Damn!

288
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,690
If he sees that note from earlier,

289
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,120
he'll discover that Light was planning to jump him when he had the chance!

290
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,120
Heh. Plans for a date?

291
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,750
How stupid.

292
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,740
All right!

293
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,330
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

294
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,380
You in the back!

295
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,590
Wh-What are you trying to pull?

296
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,310
How long were you hiding back there?!

297
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,080
Huh? You mean me?

298
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,390
You can see me right now?

299
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,620
D-Don't move!

300
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,650
I-I'll shoot! You monster!

301
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,150
This isn't good! He's hallucinating!

302
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,150
Everyone, get down!

303
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,660
Oh, I get it!

304
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,990
That note that Light just dropped

305
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,500
was cut out of the Death Note.

306
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,750
So he has this guy touch the note and now, only he can see me.

307
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,540
That's so smart.

308
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,810
D-Don't come near me!

309
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,010
Sorry, pal.

310
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,350
I'm a Shinigami, so that's not gonna kill me.

311
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,470
"Anyone who touches the Death Note will be able to see me."

312
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,000
"I'm always hovering behind you."

313
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,920
"Shinigami can't die from gunshots."

314
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,500
That's all stuff I've told Light.

315
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,420
Pretty impressive. It's not surprising he's the top exam scorer nationwide.

316
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,420
He even used this bus jacking to get the name of the guy who was following him, without much hassle.

317
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,550
Stop the bus and open the door.

318
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,770
Exactly 11:45.

319
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,920
Everything went as planned.

320
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,700
Osoreda Kiichiro. Accidental death.

321
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,960
At 11:31 a.m.,

322
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,660
he will get on a bus heading to Space Land from the bus stop near the eastern entrance of the park.

323
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,810
He will enter with a gun,

324
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,020
but will see a phantom from another world

325
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,480
and fire all his bullets at it.

326
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,230
Then, he will flee from the bus.

327
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,760
Immediately afterwards, at 11:45 the same day,

328
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,530
he will die in an accident.

329
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,870
The Death Note never fails.

330
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,090
You're next, Raye Penber.

331
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,090
He doesn't suspect me at all.

332
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,340
The remaining agents will all die of heart attacks.

333
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,130
Farewell, Raye Penber.
