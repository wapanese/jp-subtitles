1
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,610
Matsuda! This isn't child's play.
Don't joke around.

2
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,480
Okay...

3
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,680
This is the Kira case!
Take it seriously!

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,990
S-Sorry.

5
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,450
Matsuda!

6
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,860
I mean, Mr. Matsuda.
Please stop.

7
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,700
Matsuda?

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,990
I don't want to be dead weight.

9
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,080
R-Ryuzaki!

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,330
Is there anything I can do

11
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,000
besides being a manager?

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,130
Then could you get me another cup of coffee?

13
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,670
What?

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,760
I too ... want to play a bigger role in this!

15
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,270
I love you.

16
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,060
So please...

17
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,360
don't say you're going home.

18
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,720
Stay by my side forever.

19
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,420
Oh, Director, I have a boyfriend. Can we cut the love scenes please?

20
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,900
What?

21
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,660
W-Wait just a second!
Where is this coming from?!

22
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,340
Can't we fake a kiss?

23
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,290
What?

24
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,870
We can't make a movie like that!

25
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,340
No means no!

26
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,060
<i>Yotsuba Group's main Tokyo branch...</i>

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,960
<i>Today is Friday.</i>

28
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,770
Deaths that benefit Yotsuba
are concentrated around the weekend.

29
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,690
I don't want to be dead weight.

30
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,070
Mr. Mogi's been amazing from the beginning.

31
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,530
Matsuda! This isn't child's play!

32
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,610
Take it seriously!

33
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,260
Matsuda is a natural at that.

34
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,090
Then could you get me another cup of coffee?

35
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,780
Matsuda!

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,290
Matsu!

37
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,420
Hey, Matsu!

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,260
He went somewhere.

39
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,420
Huh?!

40
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,480
Anyway...

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,680
Please check this list.

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,110
Understood.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,380
Would I punish evil-doers if I could kill

44
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,830
by seeing a person's face and name?

45
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,130
Indeed, there are people whom the world can do without.

46
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,300
But I don't think that I would become a killer

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
just to change the world.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,340
I'm thinking too hard about this.

49
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,930
How could someone murder so many people and not rememâ€”

50
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,640
What's wrong?

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,060
You're staring at me...

52
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,310
You're annoyed that I'm the only one with cake, aren't you?

53
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,020
No, that's not it.

54
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,970
Here.

55
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm not envious of you.

56
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,990
Ryuzaki.

57
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,940
What is it, Watari?

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,160
Detective Eraldo Coil has been asked to uncover L's identity.

59
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,330
Isn't Eraldo Coil the man
who's the next greatest detective after L?

60
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,210
Who in the world would send such a request?

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,480
The person who requested it is the V.P. of the Rights and Planning Department

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,220
of Yotsuba Group's main Tokyo branch, Kida Masahiko.

63
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,340
So it <i>was</i> Yotsuba!

64
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,170
Yotsuba is linked to Kira.

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,010
If they want L's identity,

66
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,350
then that means they probably want to kill him.

67
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,940
That's not good.

68
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,980
We're already shorthanded,
and now we have to worry about Coil too?

69
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,130
It's all right.

70
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,110
The detective known as Eraldo Coil is me.

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,640
Three of the world's greatest detectives,
L, Coil, and Deneuve

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,340
are all me.

73
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,880
Those who try to find me usually fall for this.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,210
I'll give you this strawberry, so please keep it a secret.

75
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,680
Just what I'd expect of you, Ryuzaki.

76
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,750
Maybe I should leave while I still have the chance.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,900
No, then this would be pointless.

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,030
Should I wait until everyone's gone and search the offices?

79
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,410
No, if I were caught doing that...

80
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Perhaps I'd better leave.

81
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,420
Not that again.

82
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,490
I'm beat.

83
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,670
But it's good that it's before the weekend.

84
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,040
We don't know how long our secret meetings will last.

85
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,620
If it were on a Monday,
I'd feel depressed about coming to the office.

86
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,340
Secret meetings?

87
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,350
Bingo!

88
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,520
The nineteenth floor!

89
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,690
I came this far!

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,070
So I'm going to do this!

91
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,360
Okay. I just have to get close to him, right?

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,450
Leave it to me.

93
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,160
And I just have to breach
the surveillance cameras and security system

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,500
at Yotsuba's main Tokyo branch, where this guy works, right?

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,250
Yes.

96
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,170
It is safe to assume that Kira and Yotsuba are connected.

97
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,370
We're going to check Yotsuba

98
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,010
to see who and how many have the power.

99
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,840
It is important that we gain a clear understanding quickly.

100
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,130
We must not allow anyone from Yotsuba figure out that we are investigating them.

101
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,990
If someone notices, please assume
that we'll no longer be able to catch Kira.

102
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,100
Damn. I can't hear them clearly.

103
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,680
If I only could hear just one tidbit...

104
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,270
Or rather, he's in the way.

105
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,060
Let's kill him and split up his stocks.

106
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,030
I just heard them say "kill"!

107
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,320
Kira sure is varied.

108
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,900
Kira?!

109
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
There it is! Kira!
There it is! What?!

110
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,200
"Let's have Kira kill him?" I heard it!

111
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,000
They really are<i> working with Kira.</i>

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,210
I did it!
I hit the jackpot!

113
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,750
Who are you?!

114
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,760
Please be sure not to act out of panic or haste.

115
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,220
And don't take matters into your own hands.

116
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,020
Ryuzaki.

117
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,020
What is it, Watari?

118
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,610
Matsuda has sent an emergency signal from his belt.

119
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,820
From where?

120
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,570
Well...

121
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,250
It seems it's coming from within Yotsuba's main Tokyo office.

122
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,580
My name is Matsui Taro.
An agent with Yoshida Productions!

123
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,080
How would you like to use
our top multi-talented star, Amane Misa,

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,960
as the new spokeswoman

125
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,960
for your company and for your commercials?!

126
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,340
Forget about everything I just said.

127
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,220
We'll need to rethink our strategy.

128
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Matsuda, you idiot!

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,070
Yoshida Productions...

130
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,520
Matsui Taro...

131
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,880
He doesn't have anything suspicious.

132
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,240
And he doesn't seem to be a corporate spy.

133
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,360
Yes, um...

134
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,460
Please take Misa-Misa into consideration.

135
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,220
These two are only lookouts.

136
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,230
The rest of them must be talking about how to dispose of me.

137
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,470
I'm a goner.

138
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,190
I wonder if they received my emergency signal.

139
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,130
Besides, will Ryuzaki even attempt to save me?

140
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,480
What's gonna happen to me?

141
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,410
You can answer it.

142
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't say that you're here.

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,580
Hold it away from your ear

144
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,360
so we can listen.

145
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,490
O-Okay.

146
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,700
Hello?

147
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,540
Yo! Matsui!

148
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,320
Ryuzaki!

149
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,230
It's me, Asahi.
It's been a while.

150
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,670
Oh, Asahi, it sure has.

151
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,370
You don't sound like you're out.

152
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,690
You home already?

153
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,760
Y-Yeah.

154
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,510
Are you by yourself?

155
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,520
Yeah, I'm by myself.
What's up?

156
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,860
Amane Misa is somewhere else.

157
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,280
Matsuda is alone.

158
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,980
Wanna go out drinking?

159
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,820
What? Now?

160
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,190
Sorry, I'll pass!

161
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,500
What?

162
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,380
Don't tell me your wallet's in trouble again?

163
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,860
In trouble?

164
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,210
Yeah, I'm totally broke.
That should be a given.

165
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,980
Matsuda's totally in trouble.

166
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,790
Oh well.

167
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,080
I'll take you out some other time. See ya later.

168
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,630
So then, how about Misa-Misa?

169
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,270
I think she'd be great for your company.

170
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,730
If you're pitching someone,
shouldn't you have brought them with you?

171
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,360
Are you really a manager?

172
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,950
Well, right now she's filming a movie nearby.

173
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,460
I'll call her here once she's finished.

174
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,780
Please make her the spokeswoman of your company!

175
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,250
I'd better keep stalling.

176
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,980
Misa's phone is on voicemail.

177
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,300
I left her a message to call us.

178
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,120
What are you going to do, Ryuzaki?

179
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,150
What indeed.

180
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,100
If Matsuda dies, that would justify the suspicion against Yotsuba.

181
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,770
Let's just watch how this all plays out.

182
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,460
What shall we do?

183
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,480
The question is whether or not he heard us.

184
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,490
There is a possibility.
We've got to kill him.

185
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,340
But did he really come to pitch us a talent?

186
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,730
Could he be a police officer?

187
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,370
He can't be.

188
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,870
The Japanese police have completely withdrawn from the Kira case.

189
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,460
It doesn't matter who he is.

190
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,460
We have to kill him.

191
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,050
It might be good to have her as the face of our company.

192
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,520
Right? Her shoot will finish soon,

193
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,050
so please remain patient.

194
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,310
I'm tired.

195
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,030
A message from Light!

196
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,000
Light (Knight)
Call History

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,660
He really worries about me if I'm late.

198
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,150
Misa...

199
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,540
Light! Sorry I've been working so much.
I'll be finished soon.

200
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,420
Misa, you're not with Matsuda, are you?

201
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,590
He's horrible!
He just abandoned me here.

202
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,720
Oh, I've got a call on my work phone.

203
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,390
It's from Matsu.

204
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,850
Misa got a call from Matsuda.

205
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,750
Tell Misa to let us listen in as well.

206
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,610
Misa-Misa, when you're finished filming, come to Yotsuba's main Tokyo offices.

207
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,620
You may be able to appear in Yotsuba's commercials.

208
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,110
I'm negotiating with them right now.

209
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,220
What? Really?
That's amazing, Matsu!

210
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,950
So that's what you've been up to!

211
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,240
I'll do my best!

212
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,910
Yeah. It's a short trip by taxi.

213
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,790
Yagami, we may be able to save Matsuda.

214
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,750
But we need Misa's help.

215
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,680
I'm sure she'll listen to you.

216
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,350
I'm Misa-Misa!

217
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,480
Going nude is off-limits,
but swimsuits and lingerie are A-okay!

218
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,730
Pleased to meet you!

219
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,110
Hmm... She's really cute in person.

220
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,240
That's not the problem right now, wouldn't you agree?

221
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,720
Matsu, since this is for Yotsuba,

222
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,850
I got the green light from the offices to have a special reception.

223
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,520
A special reception?

224
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,330
Good evening!

225
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,040
Pleased to meet you!

226
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,250
We'll be entertaining you with all the girls from the agency tonight!

227
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,210
Hey, don't you think this is heading in a weird direction?

228
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,470
It can't be helped.

229
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,070
Right now, we can't leave that manager alone.

230
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,980
Anyway, I'm just going to enjoy myself.

231
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,050
Ryuzaki and the others can see us from here.

232
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,400
I may be saved...

233
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,640
Yes, please drink! Drink!

234
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,280
This is Heaven on Earth.

235
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,290
Misa's pretty good.

236
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,960
Now then...

237
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,650
I need to go to the restroom.

238
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,600
Ryuzaki, are you watching?

239
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,030
Yes.

240
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,110
Um, sorry, I...

241
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,210
Never mind that already.

242
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,980
Okay.

243
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,360
The eight who came were having a meeting
to determine whom they would get Kira to kill for them.

244
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,870
I heard it clearly.
It's definitely them.

245
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,030
It's probably true.

246
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,540
But if you <i>did</i> overhear them,
then they should be trying to kill you.

247
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,450
Figures.

248
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,550
Is there anything I can do?

249
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,570
Luckily, you're still alive, so we may be able to save you.

250
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,550
But for that to happen,

251
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,180
you must die before they kill you.

252
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,650
What?

253
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,810
I want you to listen to me very closely.

254
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,860
What?

255
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,190
You can't mean...

256
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,200
That's impossible!

257
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,890
Isn't that so?

258
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,120
In other words...

259
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,870
No, there are some women
I've broken up with whom I still think about.

260
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,870
Our company is still expanding.

261
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,920
What's going on?!

262
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,970
Man... I am <i>so</i> wasted.

263
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,060
It feels good!

264
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,700
Hey, is everyone having fun?

265
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,810
That's no good.
You should be enjoying yourselves!

266
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,810
Now, everyone...

267
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,110
The thing you've been waiting for!

268
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,400
Showtime with Matsui Taro!

269
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,260
Hey, what are you doing?

270
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,120
What?!

271
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,620
Go for it, Mr. Matsui!

272
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
There we go...

273
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,970
Hey, you're drunk!
That's dangerous.

274
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,250
It's all right...

275
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,720
I always do this.

276
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,770
Come down from there!

277
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,470
Come down!
That's dangerous, you idiot!

278
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,770
It's all right...

279
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,290
He fell!

280
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,330
This isn't good...

281
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,340
Oh no!

282
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,480
I heard a loud thud and came out to see what happened! How horrible!

283
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,840
Man, this role sucks.
Someone call 911! Call 911!

284
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,890
Everyone, leave this to us and go home.

285
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,220
What? But...

286
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,180
It's all right.
But please consider me for the commercial.

287
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,890
Hurry.

288
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,350
It'd be bad if the press were to see us here.

289
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,860
Yeah.

290
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,610
What's going on?!
Did someone jump?!

291
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,180
Well, it's good that we saw him die right before our eyes.

292
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,140
Keep quiet!

293
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,450
I know we're shorthanded, but I don't like doing this.

294
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,680
Matsuda, you idiot.

295
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,320
Amane Misa's manager dies.

296
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,150
Yes?

297
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,310
You're the V.P. of the Rights and Planning Department

298
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,260
at the Yotsuba Group's main Tokyo branch,
Kida Masahiko, aren't you?

299
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,880
Yes, that's right.

300
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,050
Who's calling?

301
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,720
My name is Eraldo Coil.

302
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,970
I'd like to discuss my terms with you.

303
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,390
A two-million-dollar advance
and eight million upon completion?

304
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,120
Are you out of your mind?

305
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,270
And even if we don't commission him,

306
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,450
we have to pay him two million to keep him silent.

307
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,110
Hush money, huh?

308
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,030
We should assume that Coil knows quite a bit already.

309
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,740
That's pretty bad.

310
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,740
I want out of these meetings!

311
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,290
I don't know who Kira is,
but I don't want to get wrapped up in this

312
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,690
and get myself arrested!

313
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,880
Hatori...

314
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,710
You're going to die tomorrow.

315
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,530
Wait! I was just joking!

316
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,060
I'll do this!
I'll stay and do it properly!

317
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,880
So what are we going to do?

318
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,270
Coil is willing to accept our job despite what he knows.

319
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,930
He'll become partners with us as long as we pay him.

320
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,110
That's what it means.

321
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,240
We need to have someone as skilled as Coil on our side.

322
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
That's right.
Pay him, no matter the cost.

323
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,220
Yeah, pay him!

324
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,970
All right, we'll contract Coil.

325
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,460
No objections?

326
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,030
No objections.

327
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,020
L, are you listening?

328
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,310
I'm so disappointed.

329
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,160
The security level here is terrible.

330
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,150
They only have a contract with a security company.

331
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,530
There weren't even any wiretap detectors.

332
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,200
I-It's been one week since I sneaked in.

333
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,570
Things seem to be moving very smoothly.

334
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,230
We're almost there.

335
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,450
One of these people...

336
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,790
is Kira.

337
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,290
Now then, let's commence our regular meeting.

338
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,710
There only appears to be seven of them instead of eight.

339
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,670
Ryuzaki!

340
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,460
Even after I catch the current Kira,

341
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,170
do you think that I could become Kira, a murderer?

342
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,970
Do I look like that kind of person?!
