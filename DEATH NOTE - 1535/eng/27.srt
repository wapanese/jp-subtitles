1
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,940
What did you say, Roger?!

2
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,040
Say it again!

3
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,410
L is dead.

4
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,630
Dead?!

5
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,670
Why?

6
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,830
Did Kira kill him?

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Is that it?

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,340
Probably...

9
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,480
He said that he would get Kira executed, and was killed!

10
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,890
Is that what you're saying?!

11
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,220
Mello...

12
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,440
If you can't beat the game...

13
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,440
If you can't solve the puzzle...

14
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,940
You're nothing but a loser.

15
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,700
Me or Near?
So which one of us did L...

16
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,730
Neither one of you yet...

17
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,960
He can't choose if he's dead.

18
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,120
Mello, Near...

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,960
How about the both of you work together?

20
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,850
Sure. Sounds good.

21
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,560
That's impossible, Roger.

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,690
You know that Near and I don't get along.

23
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,220
We've always competed against each other.

24
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,230
Always...

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
It's fine, Roger.

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,110
Near should succeed L.

27
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,720
Unlike me, Near will solve this unemotionally, like a puzzle.

28
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,190
I'm leaving...

29
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,690
this institution.

30
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,350
Mello!

31
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm almost fifteen, anyway.

32
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,070
I'll live my life my own way.

33
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,410
A police officer who happened
to be nearby when Higuchi was arrested

34
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:50,400
heard that if you write the name of someone you know in the notebook, that person will die.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,620
Are you saying that's what the notebook of death is?

36
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,830
Yes.

37
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,920
The Japanese police should have it right now.

38
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,340
Mr. President,

39
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,590
the current L is one whom the Japanese police
have created to avoid confusion.

40
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,230
L is dead.

41
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,740
Director Mason,

42
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,700
who is he?

43
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,030
Well...

44
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,780
He is, shall we say... L's true successor.

45
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,520
But...

46
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,980
it's impossible to censor the Internet

47
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,320
and the Kira case has slowed to a dead-end lately.

48
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,490
Maybe those who show people
they want killed on the Internet should be killed.

49
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,540
But Kira gets some of his information from the Internet, so he won't kill them.

50
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,830
Matsu, your idea is full of contradictions.

51
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,040
If only people wouldn't do bad things...

52
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,280
Or rather, the world's become a good place for the innocent.

53
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,620
I suppose there are people who might believe that.

54
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,220
Look who's talking.

55
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,470
No, soon everyone will think in that way.

56
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:33,480
Are you talking about that again?
No, soon everyone will think in that way.

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,340
Are you talking about that again?

58
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,770
Stop it...

59
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,900
Dear, Light.

60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm home...

61
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,040
Welcome back!

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,430
Welcome home, Sayu.

63
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,200
Light, Misa.

64
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,120
It's unusual for both of you to be here.

65
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,340
Welcome.

66
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,870
Pardon the intrusion.

67
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,380
Mr. Matsuda, wasn't it?

68
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,840
Oh, yes!

69
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,560
It's been a while.

70
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,840
Thank you for taking care of my father.

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,900
S-Sayu...

72
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,050
Y-You've grown into a beautiful woman.

73
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,260
When I last saw you, you were this tall.

74
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,380
Matsu's beet red!

75
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,560
Huh? No way...

76
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,520
There's no way I'm letting Sayu marry a detective.

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,180
Huh?

78
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,980
That's right.
I definitely don't want that.

79
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,100
What? No way!

80
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,450
I never even got to propose or even confess that I love her...

81
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,600
Mom and Dad.

82
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
Dad?!
Mo...

83
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,070
Well, I think you're wonderful.

84
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,370
What? R-Really, Sayu?

85
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,340
Yes. I might have considered going out with you if you were a little younger.

86
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,470
You've sure learned how to talk.

87
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,220
Really. She's more mature than Matsu.

88
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,720
But, Light, you haven't changed one bit
and you're as wonderful as when I first met you.

89
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,060
Light, you've already found a career,

90
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,320
so stop living together in secret and get married already.

91
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,230
That sounds good!

92
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,720
What an unfortunate and heartwarming family.

93
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,660
How interesting!

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
What is it, Aizawa?

95
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,260
Yes.

96
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,470
All right.

97
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,630
Matsuda, Light,

98
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,860
come with me.

99
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,770
A kidnapping?

100
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,610
Who kidnapped whom?

101
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,360
Director Takimura of the NPA.

102
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,770
I don't know by whom.

103
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,350
Damn! As if the current situation with the Kira case wasn't enough...

104
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,240
Are you sure?

105
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,970
I got the phone call at 6:12.
Forty-five minutes ago.

106
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,210
We determined it was from the director's cell phone.

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,090
Did the kidnappers make any demands?

108
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,590
Well...

109
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,960
They wanted to trade the director...

110
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,850
for the killer notebook.

111
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,730
Who? For what purpose?

112
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,060
Do you suppose it's Kira?

113
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,580
Well, if the existence of the Death Note were leaked,

114
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,150
countless people would want it.

115
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,370
Dad,

116
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,650
how much does the director know?

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,880
We tried to keep the knowledge of the notebook within our group.

118
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,040
That's right. I never discussed it with the director.

119
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,540
The existence of the Death Note...

120
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,800
Someone knows that the NPA has it,
and they've come to take it.

121
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,810
Notify every bureau of the NPA
only about the director's kidnapping.

122
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,550
Yes.

123
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,410
Is it a call from the culprit?!

124
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,610
No.

125
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,310
There's someone who wants to meet Director Takimura.

126
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,360
What?

127
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,950
I'm an agent with the FBI.

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,910
The name's John McEnroe.

129
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,800
Of course, this is an alias...

130
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,160
since what I am doing concerns Kira.

131
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,420
Please forgive me.

132
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,780
Kira...

133
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,780
The Director is out at the moment.

134
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,550
If it's all right, I'll listen to what you have to say.

135
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,100
Well, that's fine.

136
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,650
Excuse me for getting straight to the point,

137
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,770
but the Japanese police is unreliable.

138
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,690
In order to solve the Kira case,

139
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,270
we want you to hand over the notebook to our country.

140
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,020
So it <i>was</i> the FBI!

141
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,400
Where have you taken our director?!

142
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,020
Wh-What are you talking about?

143
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,120
Don't act like you don't know!

144
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,250
This is a brazen criminal offense!

145
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,530
What would we gain by hiding the director of Japan's NPA?

146
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,090
Then how do you know about the notebook?!

147
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,200
What's going on?

148
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,670
It seems that the director of the NPA has been kidnapped by someone.

149
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,260
By someone who wants the notebook...

150
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,180
Commander Rester.

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,100
Suggest to him that we'd like to help rescue the director and apprehend the culprit.

152
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,430
We'll take the notebook when we have the chance.

153
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,850
All right.

154
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,460
Can you hear me?

155
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,930
This is headquarters.

156
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,320
These are your orders.

157
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,050
Has he said anything?

158
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,140
The Japanese police have begun to wimp out on Kira.

159
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:08,020
It seems that the only ones who are working with L are Yagami Soichiro, Mogi Kanzo, and Matsuda Touta.

160
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,320
Isn't that right?

161
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,560
Yeah...

162
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,070
There was another named Ukita, but he died.

163
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:21,070
Even though you were the director of the NPA,
you didn't know about the notebook?

164
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,440
The Japanese police really suck.

165
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,820
The highest ranking of the three is Yagami,
who was the chief detective of the task force, right?

166
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,370
Y-Yeah...

167
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,930
I think there are two notebooks.

168
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,010
Kira has one.

169
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,760
The NPA has the other.

170
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,550
We'll take both.

171
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,010
There's no mistake if Mello says so.

172
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,110
Has he ever been wrong
since he joined us a year and a half ago?

173
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,080
But why is the guy who brought us
the head of a mafia boss whom Kira couldn't kill

174
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
so fixated on the notebook?

175
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,020
I don't just want the notebook.

176
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,620
I want to kill everyone who stands in my way,

177
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,770
and be number one!

178
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
By whatever means necessary,

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,170
before Near does...

180
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,210
B-Boss!

181
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,300
What is it? Be quiet.

182
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,560
Sorry. Eddie and I were just talking

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,890
and Takimura hanged himself with his necktie!

184
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,380
You idiot!

185
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,470
What good is a dead hostage?!

186
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,370
No, that's fine.

187
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,100
If Kira is responsible for this,

188
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,350
he can't touch us, since he doesn't know our names or faces.

189
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,730
Thus, he went after Takimura.

190
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,530
Which means...

191
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,910
Kira is someone who knows about this kidnapping.

192
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,790
What are you going to do, Mello?

193
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,900
Kidnap Yagami Soichiro's daughter,

194
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,090
Yagami Sayu, next.

195
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,160
We still don't have any leads
on the director or the kidnappers.

196
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,100
Aside from that, why haven't they said anything since they kidnapped him?

197
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,980
Light,

198
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,190
there's no mistake that the FBI agent
John McEnroe's real name

199
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,450
is really Larry Conners.

200
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,190
Is that so? Thank goodness.

201
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,360
He's a real agent.

202
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,520
The director of the FBI

203
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,780
also said that he would help us rescue Director Takimura.

204
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,120
I think we can trust him.

205
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,620
The director should already be dead.

206
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,440
Why aren't they saying anything?

207
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,580
Would they give up on the deal just because he died?

208
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,100
I didn't think we were dealing with such weaklings.

209
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,180
Dad...

210
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,260
No, everyone here should be careful.

211
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,080
The director may not know about the notebook,

212
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,640
but he knows who was working with L.

213
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,240
If that gets out,

214
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,680
there's a chance that they'll come after us.

215
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,350
Light!
there's a chance that they'll come after us.

216
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,610
I'll be a good girl tonight and go to sleep alone, okay?

217
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,360
Yeah, good night.

218
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,490
Good night!

219
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,410
Then I'll stay here.

220
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,560
We're not the only ones in danger.

221
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,620
Our families and...

222
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,330
The director's cell phone...

223
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,340
It's from the kidnappers!

224
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,090
Aizawa!

225
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,710
Yes, tracing!

226
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,760
This is Yagami.

227
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,660
Mr. Deputy Director?

228
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,640
About the trade of the director for the notebook...

229
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,360
It's canceled.

230
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,930
Takimura is dead.

231
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,640
What?!

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,510
Wh-Why you...

233
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,760
However, it's only canceled with respect to the director.

234
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,110
We'll now trade the notebook

235
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,780
for Yagami Sayu.

236
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,480
You're the deputy director of the NPA.

237
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,830
It would be ridiculous to expect you not to tell the police.

238
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,810
But I want you to move by yourself.

239
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,480
I'll kill your daughter if I see the police do anything big.

240
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,840
That's right...

241
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,210
As swiftly as we killed the director.

242
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,220
I'll send you a picture of Takimura's corpse.

243
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,900
Take a good look.

244
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,010
I'll contact you tomorrow.

245
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,020
H-Hey!

246
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,640
They got me.

247
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,110
They used the death of the director as an opportunity to get Sayu.

248
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,900
Light, things have gotten interesting again.

249
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,400
Sir...

250
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,940
Why would they go this far?

251
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,700
Damn!

252
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,070
Yes, yes.

253
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,040
Dear,

254
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,960
you never call from your work phone.

255
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,330
Huh? Sayu?

256
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,630
Who knows?

257
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,170
Come to think of it, she's late.

258
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,010
Sayu...

259
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,130
Dad, are you all right?

260
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,810
I think that it was Kira,
not the kidnappers, who killed the director.

261
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,720
Huh?
What?!

262
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,480
He probably doesn't want
the notebook to be passed to criminals.

263
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,920
Kira is acting as an icon of justice,

264
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,240
so he doesn't want the notebook to fall into criminal hands.

265
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,740
If Kira killed the director,

266
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,560
it's possible that he has methods
to obtain information within the police department.

267
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,980
It's best if we were the only ones to investigate.

268
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,170
Otherwise...

269
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,210
...Kira will kill the hostage again.

270
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,230
That's right.

271
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,430
Near.

272
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,300
The kidnapped director of the Japanese NPA was killed.

273
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,170
By whom?

274
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,060
By whom you ask?

275
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,460
By the kidnappers...

276
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,150
It would be interesting if it were Kira.

277
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,960
Indeed.

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,250
They can't get the notebook if their hostage is dead.

279
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,740
Also, if it were Kira,

280
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,080
I can narrow down the suspects.

281
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,330
By the way, Commander Rester...

282
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,920
Have you tracked his whereabouts?

283
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,480
Well,

284
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,030
we're certain that he left the institution
four years ago, as you said,

285
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,260
but we don't know anything else after that.

286
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,070
Then it's decided.

287
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,120
Mello, you always overlook the most important things

288
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,100
because you become too emotional.

289
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,680
Or maybe...

290
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,520
you're not involved in this case at all?

291
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,110
How could you leave your picture at the orphanage?

292
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,120
This is Yagami.

293
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,570
Your daughter has finally arrived here.

294
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,690
Here?

295
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,830
You have a pretty good idea of where this is, don't you?

296
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,010
We'll do the exchange here.

297
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,550
At any rate, bring the notebook
to Los Angeles by yourself in two days.

298
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,550
I won't do the exchange
unless I know that my daughter's safe.

299
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,680
Let me hear her voice!

300
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,450
All right. All right.

301
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,770
I'll send you another picture.

302
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,020
Sayu!

303
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,340
Sir,

304
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,360
we've narrowed them down to Fifth Street in Los Angeles.

305
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,490
The TV show on in the background

306
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,860
is definitely being broadcast right now.

307
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,220
They showed us that on purpose to let us know she's all right.

308
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,420
Th-Thank goodness...

309
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,000
At least she's alive...

310
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,520
I'm taking the notebook to Los Angeles.

311
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,310
As the deputy director of the NPA
and as Yagami Sayu's father!

312
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,290
I'll make all the decisions and take full responsibility!

313
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,630
Dad!

314
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,630
We have to devise a plan first.

315
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,190
That's right, Deputy Director.

316
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,880
But I have to be in Los Angeles within two days.

317
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,070
Time is not on our side.

318
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,440
So you're saying that it was Kira,
not the kidnappers, who killed Takimura?

319
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,040
I'm just saying that it's a possibility.

320
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,920
If so, it means Kira gained information
from the Japanese police.

321
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,020
Yes?

322
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,390
This is L.

323
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,510
It's L. The current one.

324
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,460
Director, I've heard what Agent John McEnroeâ€”

325
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,730
no, what Larry Conners had to say from Deputy Director Yagami.

326
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,860
Will you help us with NPA Director Takimura's murder investigation?

327
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,850
Well...

328
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,740
Pass me the phone.

329
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,750
Nice to meet you, L Number Two.

330
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,080
Number Two?

331
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,290
What do you mean by that?

332
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,170
Who are you?

333
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,040
It's useless to try and hide it.

334
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:51,430
We are the SPK, a new organization
established to capture Kira without the help of L.

335
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,440
Seven of our top members know of L's death.

336
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,430
L's death?

337
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,780
From whom? From where?

338
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,250
And I am at the center of the SPK.

339
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,160
I guess I would be...

340
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,030
N.

341
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,610
N?

342
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,650
Is he joking?

343
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,950
But...

344
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,870
This strange feeling...

345
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,290
What is it?

346
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,640
Damn! What's going on?!

347
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,420
I checked the crew of today's flight ahead of time.

348
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,090
There wasn't anyone suspicious.

349
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,500
I can still make it.

350
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,760
At this rate,

351
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,300
is my only option to kill...

352
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,010
Sayu?
