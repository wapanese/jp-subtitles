1
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,280
Light, another message from
the Second Kira was sent to Sakura TV.

2
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,020
This time it's a video and a diary.

3
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,370
I thought I'd tell you.

4
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,290
A diary?

5
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,580
That imbecile is moving again.

6
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,370
Can't he just wait?

7
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,590
Did he want the diary to be shown on TV?

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,590
Yeah. This is it.

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
2006...

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Last year's diary...

11
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,640
Please take a look at the 30th.

12
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,890
I'm pretty sure he's saying he wants to do that on May 30th.

13
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,200
If we air this, the public will find out
that that's what he plans to do.

14
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,450
Furthermore, he won't be able to see
my Shinigami unless he touches my notebook,

15
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,910
so how does he plan to do that?

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,920
Hey, Rem.

17
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,230
Yes?

18
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,010
Why can't I see my own lifespan
even though I have the Shinigami eyes?

19
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,260
Tell me again.

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,830
Those who have Death Notes

21
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,680
only need to know the lifespan of the people they kill.

22
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,520
Just like Shinigami can't see the lifespan of other Shinigami,

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,520
people who hold a Death Note can't see each other's lifespans.

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,450
May 22nd:

25
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,120
my friend and I showed off our notebooks in Aoyama.

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,490
If "notebook" means "Death Note,"

27
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,410
then it would only be understood by me, Kira.

28
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,580
And the police

29
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,710
will probably focus on the May 30th entry

30
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:17,130
which says, "We confirmed our Shinigami at the home game at the Tokyo Dome."

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,630
I'm pretty certain that the "Aoyama" part of the message

32
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,710
is the real message.

33
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,200
But if that's the case...

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,390
What do you think,

35
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,970
Light?

36
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,390
I shouldn't say anything carelessly.

37
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,610
I should watch how he approaches this.

38
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,440
As of now,

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,530
I can only say that he's an idiot.

40
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,150
He is, isn't he?

41
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,530
It's obvious that he wants to meet Kira at the home game.

42
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,830
Doesn't he understand that if we air this,

43
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,000
there'll be a panic and the game will be canceled?

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,350
To be honest, it's so stupid...

45
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,990
that I'm not sure how to deal with it.

46
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,470
If the diary is broadcast,

47
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,530
then we'll have to announce that the game on the 30th is canceled.

48
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,310
If it isn't broadcast, the Second Kira won't make a move.

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,270
But if he gets angry that we canceled the game, there's no telling what he'll do.

50
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,900
That's all right.

51
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,990
The Second Kira seems to worship Kira.

52
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,910
He promised the Kira we created
that he'd refrain from killing carelessly.

53
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,030
We can believe that.

54
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,490
Anyway, we'll air the diary

55
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,040
and announce the cancellation of the game.

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,090
We'll also announce that we're going to close off and inspect all roads

57
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,420
around the Tokyo Dome.

58
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,300
Furthermore, our "own" Kira will respond with,

59
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,800
"Understood. I'll meet you there."

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,090
You don't really think that

61
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,060
they would go there even if we're inspecting the roads around the dome, do you?

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,010
I don't think that the real Kira will go,

63
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,060
but I'm not sure about the Second Kira.

64
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,300
I can't tell how stupid he is.

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,110
Also...

66
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,110
If I give him the benefit of the doubt,

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,990
I'll try to see if there might be another message within this diary.

68
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,590
If there is a code that only people who have the so-called Shinigami power can understand,

69
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,960
I won't be able to decode it.

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,710
But we should thoroughly check out
the places listed in the diary.

71
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,510
The 22nd,

72
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,120
he's meeting a friend in Aoyama.

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,510
The 24th,

74
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,720
he's meeting a friend in Shibuya.

75
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,470
We have to prepare for the possibility that our efforts will be fruitless.

76
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,060
We also have to be wary of people waiting with notebooks in Aoyama

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,230
and people lurking in clothing stores in Shibuya.

78
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,820
It's as I thought.

79
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,280
If the Fake Kira is caught,

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,990
I'll have to obtain his notebook.

81
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,830
In the worst-case scenario,

82
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,240
I may have to kill everyone there.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,950
All we can do

84
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,320
is place more surveillance cameras in Aoyama and Shibuya

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,670
and station undercover officers on the stated dates.

86
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,840
Then I'll go to Aoyama and Shibuya, since I'd fit right in.

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,050
I'll go too.

88
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,320
Light...

89
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,360
It's all right, Dad.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,970
I go to Aoyama and Shibuya occasionally.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,980
And I'd be the one who'd look most natural hanging out with Mr. Matsui.

92
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,480
Plus, the only person whom
the Second Kira is interested in is Kira.

93
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,540
So Mr. Matsui,

94
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,460
I'll talk to you tomorrow
about going to Aoyama and Shibuya.

95
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,340
All right, Light.

96
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,650
Be careful.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,670
This always happens as soon
as I go out and turn on my phone.

98
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,590
Yes?

99
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,140
This is Ryuzaki.

100
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,560
Please be sure to keep a watchful eye on Light.

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,810
Please keep this a secret.

102
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,390
Y-Yes.

103
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,820
I understand.

104
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,440
As long as there's still an inkling of doubt,

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,860
we still have to suspect him, eh?

106
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,530
I'm home.

107
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,280
Light, you're late today.

108
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,870
Yeah...

109
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm supposed to keep the fact that I'm helping with the investigation a secret.

110
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,250
I have a girlfriend at the university.

111
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,440
Oh my.

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,730
What?!

113
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,130
Light has a girlfriend? Wow!

114
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,720
Hey, I'm an 18-year-old college student.

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,100
Of course I have one.

116
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,510
You should work on it too, Sayu.

117
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,580
Huh?

118
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,510
I-I don't have to go for something like that.

119
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,960
Light, what about dinner?

120
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,390
The room service took care of that.

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
What's this about a hotel?!

122
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,400
What was that?!
A scandalous statement!

123
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,630
Now then, Ryuk,

124
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,210
I have something to ask you.

125
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,200
Oh, I thought so.

126
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,330
Answer me if you can.

127
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,910
Can Shinigami who come to the human world

128
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,210
talk to one another?

129
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,210
It's hard to say.

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,960
If I'm attached to someone,

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,590
I think that's against the rules unless I have the permission of the person I'm attached to.

132
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,590
We don't have a code against that,

133
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,090
so I guess another Shinigami

134
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,760
might start talking to me.

135
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,570
So does that mean if the Fake Kira's Shinigami sees you,

136
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,370
there's a chance that he'll tell the Fake Kira that I'm Kira?

137
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,770
That's usually not done, but it depends on his personality.

138
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,700
So I can just assume that you'll act how you usually do, right?

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,740
Yeah.

140
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,240
Even if I see someone with a Shinigami,

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,030
I won't tell you.

142
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,540
Well, I think what you're doing is right.

143
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Thanks.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,610
So, Fake Kira...

145
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,850
You thought this far ahead?

146
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,960
What's wrong?

147
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,470
Aoyama is pretty big.

148
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,340
I was searching for ways we could find each other,

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,270
but on the 22nd,

150
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,040
there's an event at a club called the "Note Blue" in Aoyama.

151
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,690
"Ao" means "blue".

152
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,420
And "note"...

153
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,570
That's pretty elaborate.

154
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,530
He might be smarter than I thought.

155
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,450
That means I need to be more careful.

156
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,770
But right now,

157
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,490
this Note Blue is worth checking out.

158
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,860
But you don't want him to know

159
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,750
that you're Kira, right?

160
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,680
Uh... Light?

161
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,610
What's going on?

162
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,510
These are my friends from school.

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,500
P-Pleased to meet you.

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,020
This is my cousin, Taro.

165
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,050
It's his first time in Tokyo

166
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,270
and he said he wanted to go have some fun in Aoyama and Roppongi.

167
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,530
I'll be counting on you guys!

168
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,650
He's also looking for a girlfriend.

169
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,940
Any takers?

170
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,120
Hey, Light...

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm impressed, Light.

172
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,640
No one would ever suspect
a detective within this group of kids.

173
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,550
Even if Ryuk is spotted,

174
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,550
no one could tell whom he's attached to if
I'm with this many people.

175
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,550
It's also defense against L's surveillance cameras.

176
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,270
And it's not such a bad way to investigate.

177
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,340
All I have to do

178
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,420
is watch the entrance of Note Blue when it opens.

179
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,950
Found him!

180
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,830
Yagami Tsuki... is it?

181
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,540
He's the only one whose lifespan I can't see.

182
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,250
He's Kira!

183
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,340
I never thought I would find him so easily.

184
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,000
All right, Rem.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,060
Let's go home.

186
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
Huh? You just found him.

187
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,180
Is that good enough?

188
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,050
I can't just greet him by saying,

189
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,020
"Mr. Kira, I'm pleased to meet you," in a place with all these people.

190
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,450
I know his name.
I can easily look him up later.

191
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,950
After all, it's such a unique name.

192
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,630
It's written as "moon," but read as "Light."

193
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,770
That's kind of cool.

194
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,720
He sure is amazing, this Yagami Light.

195
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,350
He won the national tennis competition
when he was in his second and third year of middle school.

196
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,610
He gave an address as the freshman representative at this year's entrance ceremony at To-oh University!

197
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,340
There's no picture of him,

198
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,490
but there can't be anyone else with a name like this.

199
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,750
Who would've thought that Kira would be so young and cool!

200
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,990
He's better than I ever imagined.

201
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,150
There are so many places that sell personal records.

202
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,160
The world is so twisted, isn't it?

203
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,000
I even know his home address now!

204
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,130
So in the end,

205
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,740
on both the 22nd in Aoyama and on the 24th in Shibuya,

206
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,220
there wasn't a single trace
of any suspicious activity occurring.

207
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,720
The only place left is the Dome on the 30th.

208
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,480
I didn't see anyone who could be the Fake Kira at Note Blue.

209
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,520
Could he really be going to the Dome?

210
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,020
Ryuzaki, Sakura TV just received

211
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,040
another message from the Second Kira.

212
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,490
It's postmarked on the 23rd.

213
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,690
I have found Kira.

214
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,730
To all of the people at the television station, and the police,

215
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,250
thank you very much.

216
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,500
I-It can't be!

217
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,880
Where? In Aoyama?

218
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,590
Did his Shinigami find Ryuk and tell him?

219
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,780
No...

220
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,470
There's no way that he could tell whom Ryuk was attached to.

221
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,470
I made sure that no one was following me.

222
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,290
If this is true,

223
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,730
the only thing that corresponds to this tape being mailed on the 23rd is the 22nd in Aoyama.

224
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,440
The only investigators who went to Aoyama
are Matsuda, and Yagami Light.

225
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,450
Is Light really Kira?

226
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,070
But we don't have concrete evidence that this happened in Aoyama.

227
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,290
He found him?
That's not good.

228
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,380
Yeah,

229
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,790
it means that the Second Kira and Kira have teamed up.

230
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,250
We're still not sure if they've teamed up.

231
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,290
The Second Kira is only saying that he found him.

232
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,550
He may not have contacted him yet.

233
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,880
Since we've come to this point,

234
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,220
the police will have to send a message to the Second Kira.

235
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Send a message?

236
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,410
Yes.

237
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,970
The police will have to reach out to the Second Kira

238
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,190
and offer him a deal in exchange for Kira's name.

239
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,460
Isn't this a really bad turn of events?

240
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,000
This isn't good.

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,120
I don't know how the Fake Kira would react.

242
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,120
But I have no reason to stop this.

243
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,630
If Kira doesn't know who you are yet, there is still time.

244
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,420
Do not approach Kira out of curiosity.

245
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,550
Kira will kill you if you contact him.

246
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,140
He'll just use you.

247
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,480
What you can do

248
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,330
is reconsider the value of human life,

249
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,640
atone for your crimes by giving us information on Kira,

250
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,550
and save the people of the world from Kira's reign of terror.

251
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,460
Where are you going?

252
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,820
I'm going to introduce myself.

253
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,530
Oh, here, huh...

254
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,930
Oh, I wonder if it's your father.

255
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,990
Coming!

256
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,830
Welcome home!

257
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,750
Huh?

258
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,560
Good evening.

259
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,710
My name is Amane Misa.

260
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,970
I came to give Light an important notebook

261
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,680
that he left at the university.

262
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,180
C-Could you wait for a second?

263
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,930
Light!

264
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,330
A notebook?!

265
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,600
Could it be...

266
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,240
P-Pleased to meet you.

267
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
My name is Amane Misa.

268
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,810
I thought you might be worried if you were watching TV.

269
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,750
I just couldn't take it any more.

270
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,540
This notebook...

271
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,170
A Death Note.

272
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,220
A Shinigami!

273
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,890
She's the Fake Kira.

274
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,480
Come on in.

275
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Huh? Is it all right?

276
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,770
I'm glad.

277
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,010
Mom, she came all this way to return my notebook to me.

278
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,240
Could you make us tea or something?

279
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,780
I-I suppose I should.

280
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,950
She's the one I was telling you about.

281
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,950
Have a seat.

282
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,380
Th-Thank you.

283
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,340
How did you find me?

284
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,270
Ah, I thought so.

285
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,350
You didn't do the eye deal, did you?

286
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,590
When you have the Shinigami eyes,

287
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,960
you can see a person's lifespan and age.

288
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,860
But you cannot see the lifespan
of someone who has a Death Note.

289
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,450
Well, that's new to me.

290
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,450
Okay, I understand that.

291
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,500
But what would happen if you were caught by the police

292
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,710
and Kira's secret was discovered?

293
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,360
It's all right.

294
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,160
I wasn't caught,

295
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,650
and if I continue to do as you say, I won't be.

296
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,800
Right?

297
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,760
And I will see L's name.

298
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,360
I shall become your eyes.

299
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,470
So...

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,350
So?

301
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,940
Please make me your girlfriend!

302
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,230
My girlfriend?

303
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,980
Yes.

304
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,360
If I'm not careful with her, she might kill me.

305
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,990
But...

306
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,400
That's impossible.

307
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,000
There were three times
the usual number of surveillance cameras.

308
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Anyone in Aoyama would have been caught on camera, including me.

309
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,070
If we remained together after that,

310
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,310
even being together here isn't good.

311
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,500
Try to understand.

312
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,260
Look.

313
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,270
This is a picture of me when I went to Aoyama.

314
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,440
I'm sure no one would recognize her like this.

315
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,310
So what about your fingerprints?

316
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,400
The tapes you sent to the television station

317
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,570
all have the same fingerprints.

318
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,820
Those aren't my fingerprints.

319
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,780
I put some thought into my actions.

320
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,870
A little while back, I lived in the Kansai region.

321
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,290
I had a friend who was into the occult.

322
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,460
When I told her that we should make fake ghost videos

323
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,460
and send it to several TV shows,

324
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,380
she agreed to help me.

325
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,180
I had her dub ten tapes and I made sure
not to leave any fingerprints.

326
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,930
I took those video tapes

327
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,220
and put the Kira picture on it and added sound.

328
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,230
And what is that friend doing now?

329
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,940
If you want me to kill her, I'll kill her right now!

330
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,570
If you really don't believe me,

331
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,910
you can hold on to my Death Note.

332
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,560
You're just holding on to it,

333
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,490
so I'll still have ownership

334
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,800
and I'll still have my eyes.

335
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,210
Isn't that right, Rem?

336
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,210
Indeed.

337
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,380
Now there's no way I can kill you.

338
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,240
If I'm of no use,

339
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,460
you can kill me.

340
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,200
Why would she go this far?

341
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,170
But you might have removed several pages from the Death Note.

342
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,350
You could be hiding them somewhere.

343
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,520
Why are you so suspicious of me?!

344
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,250
I don't mind if you just use me!

345
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,440
Believe me.

346
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,610
How can you say that?

347
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,440
Exactly one year ago,

348
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,370
my parents were killed by a robber right before my eyes.

349
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,810
I couldn't forgive him...

350
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,620
The trial was drawn-out

351
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,130
and some people started saying he was falsely accused.

352
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,490
That's when...

353
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,760
Kira punished him.

354
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,840
Kira means the world to me.

355
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,850
I just...

356
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,850
I just wanted to meet you so badly!

357
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,810
I wanted to thank you.

358
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,780
All these irrational methods just to meet Kira...

359
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,820
But at least she can get around surveillance cameras

360
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,880
and keep her fingerprints off the evidence.

361
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,790
She's not as stupid as I thought.

362
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,790
She even says that she'll obey me.

363
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,400
I understand.

364
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,560
I can't be your boyfriend, but I can act like I am.

365
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,970
Those eyes you gave up half of your life for,

366
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,830
to meet me and to help me, will be a valuable weapon.

367
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,840
Thank you...

368
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,840
I'll try hard to make you love me.

369
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,420
Yeah.

370
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,520
You're a friend I have much in common with.

371
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,340
I've been lonely since you've been taking breaks from school.

372
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,340
I'd like to play tennis with you again.
