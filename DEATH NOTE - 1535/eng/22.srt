1
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,730
And when you know I'm Kira, we'll get married!

2
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,730
And there you have it!

3
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,690
Higuchi is Kira.

4
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,200
If the killing of criminals stops,

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,340
then Higuchi probably has Kira's powers.

6
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,010
Still...

7
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,970
I knew that Amane would do anything for Yagami Light,

8
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,560
but I never thought she would go this far.

9
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,850
If the killing of criminals stops,

10
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,650
then it will become difficult to deduce the method of killing.

11
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,450
I have to think of a plan.

12
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,360
Misa,

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,650
how did you get Higuchi to say that?

14
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,690
Huh? He's head over heels in love with me.

15
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,360
I said I'd marry him if he was Kira.

16
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,080
And he thinks that I'm the Second Kira.

17
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,360
If I don't say this now,

18
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,830
I'll probably contradict myself later.

19
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,710
You idiot!
We told you to deny all of that.

20
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,990
B-But now we know that Higuchi is Kira,

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,760
so we can just catch him.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,220
I suppose you could call this a victory, right, Matsuda?

23
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,330
In our current situation,

24
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,190
we still don't know how he kills his victims.

25
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,570
That's right.

26
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,730
Before we catch Higuchi,

27
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,610
I want to know how he kills people.

28
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,280
If criminals stop dying,

29
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,780
we won't be able to figure it out, right?

30
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,870
Right. Even if we're going to arrest Higuchi,

31
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,080
we'll do it when we're sure
that criminals have stopped dying.

32
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,960
Please let me think for a moment.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Wedy.

34
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,060
Yes.

35
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,280
What's the current situation?

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,640
It's going smoothly.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,290
We should be able to track seventy percent

38
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,260
of the seven's actions with our cameras while they're in the building.

39
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,140
What about outside of the building?

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,020
That's impossible with just Watari and me.

41
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,920
How about just focusing only on Higuchi?

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,980
Higuchi?

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,530
I've only been inside five of their houses,

44
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,510
but Mido's, Namikawa's, and Higuchi's houses
have serious security systems.

45
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,740
Especially Higuchi's.

46
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,320
He's recently constructed an underground room
that blocks out electronic waves.

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,250
It took me two days to break in.

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,750
Higuchi is definitely suspicious.

49
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,590
Yeah.

50
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,830
All right.

51
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,220
In Higuchi's car rather than in his house, please install wire-taps, trackers, and cameras.

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,140
What? After doing this much?

53
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,220
Do you know how difficult it is to get inside someone's house?

54
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,270
Besides, how many cars do you think Higuchi has?

55
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,350
Six.

56
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,740
All right.

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,110
I just have to install them in all of his cars, right?

58
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,710
Please do.

59
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,030
Whoa... I would've been in trouble if he'd been wire-tapped earlier.

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,820
Yagami, sorry for coming back to this topic,

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,050
but I have to ask you again.

62
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,130
Ask me what?

63
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,630
Do you remember...

64
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,010
how you killed?

65
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,530
You're still accusing me of that?

66
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm not Kira.
How many times do Iâ€”

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,810
Just answer the question.

68
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,430
Do you remember?

69
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,460
I don't.

70
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,940
Misa, what about you?

71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,320
I don't remember, and I'm not Kira.

72
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,860
Yagami, please seriously analyze and deduce

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,870
what I'm going to say.

74
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,290
Your answer will determine if we can catch Kira.

75
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,110
Yagami Light was Kira.

76
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,090
And Kira's power passed on to someone else.

77
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,630
Right now, Yagami Light doesn't remember that he was Kira.

78
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,260
Give me your thoughts based on this premise.

79
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,400
Can you think about it in that way?

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,310
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

81
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,220
Yagami Light was Kira.

82
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,190
And Kira's power passed to someone else.

83
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,570
Was it because Yagami Light wanted that to happen?

84
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,410
Or was there someone behind
Yagami Light who gave him Kira's power?

85
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,370
Did that person pass Yagami Light's power to someone else?

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,280
Under those circumstances,

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,760
it would be Yagami Light's choice.

88
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,270
Of course.

89
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,970
If there were someone who was moving that power from person to person

90
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,230
and didn't want the method of murder to be discovered,

91
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,320
it's strange that he took so long to move it from you to someone else.

92
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,170
If we acknowledge the existence of someone
watching down on us from above,

93
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,060
he would be impossible to catch.

94
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,720
I'd either be dead already,

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,830
or forever be dancing in the palm of his hand.

96
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,110
It's highly unlikely such a being exists.

97
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,910
Even if Light Yagami were Kira...

98
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,020
Kira's power can only move
by the will of the person who has it.

99
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,910
Yagami,

100
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,020
thanks to you, I feel ninety-nine percent better.

101
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,700
We shall create a situation in which Higuchi cannot pass his power on to anyone else,

102
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,120
and have him show us how he kills.

103
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,920
What are you going to do?

104
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,660
I'm going to trick Higuchi using Sakura TV.

105
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,970
A hidden-camera show?

106
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,000
What's that?

107
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,840
The Kira Special that Demegawa airs every week...

108
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,230
We'll take up a three-hour time slot

109
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,970
and right at the beginning,
we'll say that at the end of the program,

110
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,830
we're going to announce who Kira is.

111
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,940
Will he believe that?

112
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,850
It's Sakura TV, isn't it?

113
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,480
Besides, Higuchi might not watch that program.

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,900
We'll contact Namikawa

115
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,780
and have him call Higuchi and say, "This is bad. Turn on your TV."

116
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,560
When Higuchi realizes
that the person on TV knows his secret,

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,780
he'll believe us.

118
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,290
I see. So we're going to use Aiber.

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
He'll reveal that he was really a spy.

120
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,700
Not by a long shot.

121
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,460
We won't use Aiber.

122
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,720
The person who appears on that show

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,640
has to be someone whom Higuchi thinks he can kill.

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,480
In other words, someone whose name

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,770
he can easily look up.

126
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,890
Is there someone like that?

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,800
There's only Mr. Matsuda.

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,700
Matsu!

129
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,360
Matsuda, huh?

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,650
Higuchi probably thinks
that you were listening in on their meeting.

131
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,580
He'll believe that the manager
he thought was dead would rat him out.

132
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,870
That's right. I'll have Sakura TV prepare the screen and voice filter they always use for witnesses.

133
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,210
Higuchi would probably realize from the announcement and the silhouette that it's Matsui, the manager.

134
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,250
We'll have the station make a mistake

135
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,550
and accidentally flash the face
of the person behind the glass screen.

136
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,740
Wow! Sounds fun.

137
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,930
Until the show ends,

138
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,810
Kira's identity revealed at the end of this program!

139
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,770
we'll keep saying that we'll reveal the real name of H, who's Kira.

140
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:08,190
In this situation, Higuchi will have to discover his name as soon as possible.

141
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,900
We can anticipate Higuchi's actions.

142
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,190
And we'll be able to see how Kira kills.

143
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,990
After that, we'll apprehend him.

144
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,410
Right now, the only problem in this plan

145
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,040
is if Higuchi, like the Second Kira,

146
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,500
can kill by looking at someone's face,

147
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,710
Mr. Matsuda will die.

148
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,200
Since you're still alive

149
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,220
and he still wants Misa, that probably won't happen.

150
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,830
Well, this is a plan for when the criminals stop dying.

151
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,060
We'll have to watch for two or three days
to see whether that happens.

152
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,660
In that time, Mr. Matsuda must decide if he wants to do it.

153
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,930
I don't need two or three days.

154
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,030
Please let me do it.

155
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,300
What did you want to talk to me about in secret?

156
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,850
Namikawa,

157
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,600
who do you think Kira is?

158
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,770
Why do you want to know?

159
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,150
Besides, he could be either of you.

160
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,190
No, Shimura's not Kira.

161
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,570
He was just crying to me about how he
can't keep up with Kira's evil deeds anymore.

162
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,450
Shimura, if Mido were Kira, you would've been killed.

163
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,800
No, you and Mido would've been successful on your own.

164
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,330
You two wouldn't need to hold
those stupid meetings with eight people.

165
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,730
I know at least that much.

166
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,970
We're all cooperating because
we're afraid that Kira's going to kill us.

167
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,160
But if we continue,

168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,040
the world will find out someday.

169
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,760
No, it won't end until that happens.

170
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,520
So, Shimura, let me ask you: who do you think is Kira?

171
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,560
Takahashi or Higuchi.

172
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,650
Takahashi is only there to make Kira look smarter.

173
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,570
He needs someone around
who's less sophisticated than he is.

174
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,410
It seems that everyone pretty much knows then.

175
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,410
It's probably Higuchi.

176
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,830
Yeah.

177
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,830
Higuchi is the one who lusts most for success and money.

178
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,610
The way he's always acting as if he's not interested in success

179
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,980
is proof of that.

180
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,260
Still, he's always making fun of people and doesn't know how to be a boss.

181
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,970
That's why he was demoted from being
the head of development to divisional head.

182
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,500
Was I the only one you called here?

183
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,770
I also called Ooi, but...

184
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,850
He said, "You can hold your silly secret meetings by yourself."

185
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,010
That sounds like the sort of impatient thing he'd say.

186
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,110
We know Kida isn't Kira because he provided the account to fund and commission Coil.

187
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,700
Namikawa, during the meeting after Hatori died,

188
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,570
you had a phone call.

189
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,790
Who was it from?

190
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,920
Shimura, you're really sharp.

191
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,670
Kira probably made you a member because he appreciates your caution.

192
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,800
It's Namikawa.

193
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,240
It's L.

194
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,430
Namikawa, are you by yourself?

195
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,610
No.

196
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,770
Then chime in as you see fit once again.

197
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,520
There's no need for that.

198
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,180
There's someone who got suspicious after you called me during the meeting.

199
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,400
Who called you, Namikawa?

200
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,060
L.

201
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,540
L, Mido and Shimura are here,

202
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,820
but I don't think they're Kira.

203
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,790
They seem to be sick of Kira.

204
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,080
Despite what they say, they choose to stand back and watch your face-off with Kira, just as I plan to.

205
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,880
That's fine.

206
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,900
Tonight, I'm going to catch Kira.

207
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,760
I want you to help me a little.

208
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,100
Higuchi's done, huh?

209
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,020
You knew?

210
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,500
It seems even L can be tricked.

211
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,380
Judging by your reaction,

212
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,770
now I'm absolutely sure it's Higuchi.

213
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,810
Namikawa is pretty good!

214
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,440
I was expecting that considering his looks.

215
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,040
No, Yagami just made a mistake.

216
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,040
We're going to make Higuchi move with a special on Kira
on Sakura TV which starts tonight at seven.

217
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,540
A few minutes into the program,

218
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,000
I want you to contact Higuchi and tell him to watch that show.

219
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,920
I won't do anything to the six of you.

220
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,690
If the others who aren't there â€” Kida, Takahashi, and Ooi â€”
try to do something, stop them.

221
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,340
Yes, all right.

222
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,710
So it really is Higuchi.

223
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,980
He'll probably be caught tonight.

224
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,360
It's been three days since I stopped killing criminals.

225
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,280
That should be good enough.

226
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Now, If I marry the Second Kira, Amane,

227
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,330
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.

228
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,380
And I'll control everything Yotsuba has!

229
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,580
Higuchi, this is bad.

230
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,100
Turn on your TV to Sakura TV.

231
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,660
So one of these people is Kira, right?

232
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,440
Yes. I have a lot of proof.

233
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,520
What is this?
It's probably a hoax.

234
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,940
It is Sakura TV.

235
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,100
At the beginning of the program,

236
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,300
he said that he came across a meeting of eight people.

237
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,710
Someone who knows about the meetings?

238
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,200
Who is it?
Did someone betray us?

239
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,920
One of them was killed and now there are only seven left.

240
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,250
The victim was Mr. H.

241
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,320
H?

242
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,550
Hatori...

243
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,600
If he knows this much...

244
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,260
Is he one of the other six?
No, is he Coil?!

245
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,640
He was killed by Kira because he wanted to leave the meetings.

246
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,770
No. There'd be no benefit in it for him.

247
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,440
But there's no one else who knows about those meetings.

248
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,020
No, this guy is...!

249
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,450
I-It's him!

250
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,030
Misa's manager...

251
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,340
I think his name was Matsui!

252
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,000
How is he still alive?!

253
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,830
He thought he was going to be killed.

254
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,850
He took a chance, pretending to fall out of the condo

255
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,380
and escaping to a veranda on the floor below.

256
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,230
No. Just in case,

257
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,810
I went home and wrote his name in the notebook using his business card.

258
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,060
How is he still alive?

259
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,460
Was he a former entertainer
who became a manager under his stage name?

260
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,560
I don't know!

261
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,000
Furthermore, he says that he's continued to investigate Yotsuba

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
and has figured out who Kira is.

263
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,820
I'm contacting everyone right now.

264
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,910
All right. I'm going to hang up.

265
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,080
Are you all right from that mishap just now?

266
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,010
Shall we stop?

267
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,460
No, I'm well aware of the danger.

268
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,640
For justice, even if I'm killed,

269
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,490
I shall give it my best until the end!

270
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,510
That's more like it!

271
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,100
Don't make the Kira announcement until the end of the program.

272
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,180
I have to kill him.

273
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,140
If the Second Kira is Misa, she knows his face,

274
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,690
so she should know what his name is.

275
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,990
Here it is...

276
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,410
What is this?!

277
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,580
To be honest, I've been debating whether or not I should make this announcement.

278
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,320
But now that I'm here, I've decided it's my duty to reveal it.

279
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,200
This is no good.

280
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,770
The announcement will come soon.

281
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,880
I don't know when he's going reveal it.

282
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,500
Don't change your channel.

283
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,290
Cosme Misa.

284
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,910
Devilish charm...

285
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,300
and angelic glitter...

286
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,010
Misa's winning rouge...

287
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,840
Sent to you...

288
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,060
Mido, it's me.
Something bad is happening on Sakura TV.

289
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,390
Get your father in the House of Councilors.

290
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,250
Have the Ministry of Internal Affairs stop this program.

291
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,610
I'm watching, but that's impossible.

292
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,340
No one trusts this program anyway,

293
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,850
and we'd just look suspicious.

294
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Besides, there's nothing to fear anymore.

295
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,370
That guy revealed his face.

296
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,250
We can confirm that it's Matsui Taro.

297
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,460
Namikawa is telling everyone to watch this show.

298
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,440
One of the seven of us is Kira.

299
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,430
So, Matsui Taro will die soon.

300
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,170
That's right!

301
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,300
I'm the only one who knows
that Matsui Taro is not his real name.

302
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,480
If I say that, then it'll reveal that I'm Kira.

303
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,760
Everyone! Kira's identity will become clear soon!

304
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,140
You're right. Talk to you later.
Everyone! Kira's identity will become clear soon!

305
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,190
Everyone! Kira's identity will become clear soon!

306
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,190
Stay with us!

307
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,610
Damn!

308
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,940
Ryuzaki.

309
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,660
Mogi, who's in front of Yoshida Productions, has received a call from Higuchi.

310
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes. The next stage has come,

311
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,700
just as planned.

312
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Moji, where's Misa?

313
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,790
Oh, Mr. Higuchi, a pleasure doing business with you.

314
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,290
Misa is taking a much-needed break right now.

315
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,770
She'll be back tomorrow... Yes.

316
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm asking you, where is she?

317
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Well, that's private information
that she doesn't want anyone to know.

318
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,770
I'm very sorry.
I can contact her tomorrow.

319
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,400
Damn... I know his face.

320
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,900
I could kill him at any time if I only knew his name!

321
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,160
Was her previous manager an ex-entertainer?

322
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,990
Pardon?

323
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,690
There was a guy by the name of Matsui Taro, right?

324
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, I came in as a replacement, so I don't know anything.

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,930
If that's the case, please contact someone at the office.

326
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh, but everyone's gone to Okinawa.

327
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,080
Could you call our president?

328
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,480
Wow. It's going so precisely as planned that it's almost scary.

329
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,210
Don't be scared.
Rejoice, Yagami.

330
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,590
I shall broadcast Higuchi's call
to Yoshida Production's president.

331
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,610
This is Higuchi from Yotsuba.

332
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,390
Matsui Taro's not the real name of the guy
who was with you earlier, is it?

333
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,060
He's getting more and more direct.

334
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,600
Ah, he was using his manager's name.
He's getting more and more direct.

335
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,170
Higuchi is an idiot.
Ah, he was using his manager's name.

336
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,790
It's proof that he's losing confidence.

337
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,850
I see.
It's proof that he's losing confidence.

338
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,020
So what's his real name?!

339
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,270
I believe it was Yamadaâ€”

340
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,620
no, Yamashita.

341
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,550
His first name...

342
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,570
I don't remember.

343
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,400
Don't fuck with me!

344
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,530
Remember the names of the people you hire!

345
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,200
What's with that tone?

346
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,040
I have his personal history back at the office.

347
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,080
Then go back there and tell me.

348
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,860
Give me a break!

349
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,590
I'm taking the first company vacation I've had in two years.

350
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,090
If you want to know that badly,
I'll tell you the security code for the office's door.

351
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,760
You can go right in and look around.

352
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,060
Personnel files are in the desk farthest back to the left.

353
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,390
They're alphabetized in the bottom drawer.

354
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,100
It's probably Yamashita.

355
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,610
If he's going to say it at the end of the program,

356
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,600
I still have two hours.

357
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,180
I wonder if he'll do it?

358
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,550
I've confirmed Higuchi.

359
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,140
He's only got a bag on him.
I'm going after him.

360
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,770
Everything's going according to plan, isn't it?

361
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,390
Yes.

362
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,050
I will kill him.

363
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,740
I've come this far.
I will not<i> be stopped!</i>

364
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,280
I'm going to have everything!

365
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,750
With this, I'm invincible!

366
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,300
Damn! I don't want to have to use this, but...!
With this, I'm invincible!

367
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,770
Higuchi has a gun! The Chief's been shot!
Damn! I don't want to have to use this, but...!

368
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,420
This sounds kind of bad.
Higuchi has a gun! The Chief's been shot!

369
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,800
Higuchi! Hold it right there!
This sounds kind of bad.

370
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,500
We'll get 100% ratings!
Higuchi! Hold it right there!

371
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,380
Give it up!
We'll get 100% ratings!

372
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,190
Think it over carefully.
We'll get 100% ratings!

373
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,070
Think it over carefully.

374
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,880
I made it!
