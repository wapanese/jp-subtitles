1
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
Because you're...

2
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,940
my first friend ever.

3
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,020
Misa.

4
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,910
Yes?

5
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,370
Then could you ask Rem

6
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,370
to kill L?

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
Rem...

8
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,710
I want Light to love me.

9
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,960
That would be my happiness.

10
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,090
Fine.

11
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,380
I'll kill L for you.

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,300
L will die...

13
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,900
this easily?

14
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,600
So when should I kill him?

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,040
If you take me to wherever he is, I can kill him immediately.

16
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,000
It should be done as soon as possible.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,940
Tomorrow if you can.

18
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,760
But it's still too soon to make a decision now.

19
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,080
I'll give you an answer after I think
of a way to kill him tonight.

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,410
All right.

21
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,120
Listen, no matter what, don't kill him until I give the order.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,160
No matter what!

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,420
All right.
I promise.

24
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,010
Only about L, though.

25
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,900
Misa, give me your cell phone number.

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,760
It's about time!

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Give me yours, too!

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,260
No, I can't give you mine.

29
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,640
Why not?! We're lovers!

30
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,230
I told you, I'm under surveillance by the police.

31
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,690
The police these days can listen in on specific phone conversations.

32
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,030
In that case, here!

33
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,160
I'll give you one of my own cell phones.

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,480
I ended up with three after using them for different things.

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,890
That's a good idea.

36
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,840
Using your phone would probably be all right.

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,830
All right!

38
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,170
I'll give you a love call every day and text you all the time!

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,450
No, I'll keep it off.

40
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,670
I'll be the only one making calls,
and you'll be on a need-to-know basis.

41
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,430
What? No way...

42
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,470
When are you going to call?

43
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,380
Probably tomorrow.

44
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,760
I'll call even if I'm not going to execute L.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,460
What? Tomorrow?

46
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,900
It doesn't sound like something a lover would call about,

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,610
but we can talk about love afterwards.

48
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,180
Well, Misa,

49
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,550
go home for today.

50
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,080
What? Why?
It's only seven o'clock.

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,120
The time for lovers has just begun, hasn't it?

52
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,970
We can go get dinner, look at the night sky,

53
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,360
and after that, the main event!

54
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,700
Misa.

55
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,090
Okay?

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,070
Go home for today.

57
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,890
Okay...

58
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,010
Also, when you're talking outside with Rem,

59
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,800
whisper, and make sure that no one's around.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,960
That's what Ryuk and I do.

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,980
All right...

62
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,290
Sorry for the intrusion...

63
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,740
Misa, come again tomorrow!

64
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,660
That kiss was so sudden, it surprised me.

65
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,410
I need to keep Misa madly in love with me.

66
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,210
Oh?

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,840
Besides that, I need to decide if I should kill L tomorrow.

68
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,450
L hasn't made himself public yet,

69
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,570
so if Ryuga dies, I have to prepare
for people to be more suspicious of me.

70
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,850
I see.

71
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,330
I thought you were hesitating

72
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,980
because he said that you were his friend.

73
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,770
His friend?

74
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,770
I was just giving him what he wanted.

75
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,210
From the beginning, I've said that if it's friendship he wants,

76
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,280
then I'll give it.

77
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,030
Ryuga is Yagami Light's superficial friend.

78
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,140
But L is Kira's enemy.

79
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,250
That's right.

80
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,020
L is my enemy.

81
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,340
Since Ryuga's revealed that he's L, I must kill him.

82
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,300
If I kill L with an accident,

83
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,800
there won't be many who would suspect that I'm Kira.

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Even if someone does suspect, there's no proof.

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,110
I can only speculate what will be done after L dies.

86
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,060
This is all a wager now.

87
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,000
Tomorrow will be L'sâ€”

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,840
no, Ryuzaki Ryuga's date of death.

89
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,080
Hair.

90
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,810
Snack crumbs.

91
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,540
Hair.

92
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,090
Mr. Yagami.

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,610
If I die within the next few days, your son is Kira.

94
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,600
Another hair.

95
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,650
What did you just say?!

96
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,020
Yeah. What are you talking about?!

97
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,220
I'll make sure that you have ready access to Watari,

98
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,900
I'm counting on you.

99
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,670
Ryuzaki!

100
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,120
You said he was almost entirely cleared, but I want the truth.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,820
How likely is it that he's Kira?!

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,260
Even I don't know how I truly feel.

103
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,610
This has never happened before.

104
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,260
If Kira and the Second Kira are working together,

105
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,250
I'm in big trouble.

106
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,880
So I might not be analyzing the situation calmly.

107
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,890
I might be considering him a suspect just because there's nobody else.

108
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,720
Despite that,

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,140
if I'm killed now,

110
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,770
please assume that your son is Kira.

111
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,820
I have no choice but to make a sneak attack.

112
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,280
This is all a wager now.

113
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,500
That's not true.

114
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,630
I just know how to swim with the tide.

115
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,300
What's wrong?

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh, Yagami!

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,690
Hello.

118
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,220
Takada, I want to talk to him for a bit.

119
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,260
Could we continue this later?

120
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,150
Oh, yes...

121
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,180
Was that okay?

122
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,050
More importantly, didn't you say that you were afraid to appear in front of people?

123
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,350
Are you all right out here?

124
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,750
I realized that as long as you're not Kira, it's okay.

125
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,260
You're the only one on the outside who knows I'm L,

126
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,840
so I've told everyone at headquarters that if I die in the next few days

127
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,150
to assume that you're Kira.

128
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,560
Damn him...

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,100
You told me that you've been lonely because I've been taking breaks from school,

130
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,060
so I came out for a change of pace.

131
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,740
As long as I don't die, college is a fun place.

132
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,730
Yeah. When you're not here,

133
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,970
it's so boring because there's no one who can match my level of conversation.

134
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,340
So that explains why you're with the "brilliant" Takada.

135
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,290
Well, something like that.

136
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,300
Is it really all right to kill him today?

137
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,950
No... As soon as I decided I should kill him,

138
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,760
he suddenly appears to distract me
from my decision to prevent me from killing him.

139
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,390
I'm playing into his hands.

140
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,340
Shall we have some cake in the cafeteria?

141
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,250
Sure. My next lecture was canceled.

142
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,230
That's good.

143
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,150
I wonder if they have shortcake?

144
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,760
Well... who knows.

145
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,910
Light!

146
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,990
There you are!

147
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,750
I came because I had a photo shoot nearby!

148
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,960
Misa! You idiot...

149
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,670
Is he a friend of yours?

150
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,950
He's so unique and cool.

151
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,590
No... I've won!

152
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,260
Misa can see Ryuga's real name!

153
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,580
I'm Light's girlfriend, Amane Misa. Pleased to meet you.

154
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,010
I'm Ryuga Hideki.

155
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,070
Huh? Ryuga Hideki?

156
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,730
Yeah, he has the same first name and last name as that idol.

157
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,940
Isn't that funny?

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,940
But it's different from the name I'm seeing...

159
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,720
Ryuga,

160
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,740
coming out this time has backfired on you!

161
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,450
Why's he chuckling?

162
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,830
Has he noticed?

163
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,750
But if he's guessed that she's the Second Kira,

164
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,210
there's no way he would be chuckling...

165
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,210
Yagami...

166
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,550
I'm envious.

167
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,460
I've been a huge fan of yours
since the August issue of "Eighteen."

168
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,770
Really?! I'm so happy!

169
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,260
Hey, that girl is Misa-Misa, isn't she?!

170
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,390
You're right!
It <i>is</i> Misa-Misa!

171
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,100
Misa-Misa?!

172
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,930
For real?!
Misa-Misa?!

173
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,730
Figures I'd be discovered with all these young people around.

174
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,420
I see you every month.

175
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,830
Keep up the good work.

176
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,240
Yeah. Thank you.
I'll do my best!

177
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,070
What's going on?

178
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,700
Hey! Who touched my butt?!

179
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,600
How disgraceful!

180
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,960
I can't forgive anyone who would take advantage of this situation.

181
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,500
I'll find the culprit.

182
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,470
Ryuga! You're so funny!

183
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,670
I wanna cop a feel, too.

184
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,380
As if!

185
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,470
At any rate, I want to ask Misa
what L's name is as soon as possible,

186
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,600
but these people are in the way.

187
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,810
Misa!

188
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,870
It's time!

189
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,340
Are you planning to be late again?!

190
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,230
Oh, sorry, Yoshi.

191
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,340
Let's go!

192
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,980
Oh, yeah.

193
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,600
That's good.

194
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,530
Once Misa's out of here,

195
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,240
I just have to give her a call and ask her for L's name.

196
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,520
See you after work, Light!

197
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,460
Now then, shall we get going, Yagami?

198
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,500
Yeah.

199
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,840
Sorry, could you go on ahead?

200
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,570
I need to use the restroom.

201
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,700
I see. Well then...

202
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,620
It's over.

203
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,650
It's been fun, L.

204
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,120
I'm glad that I could discover your name and kill you myself.

205
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,050
It's been fun, L.

206
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm glad that I could discover your name and kill you myself.

207
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,120
Yes?

208
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,750
Hello?

209
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,420
What do you mean, "Hello"?

210
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,720
Oh, someone must have dropped their cell phone during all that commotion earlier.

211
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,880
Bastard...

212
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,510
He must have...

213
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,110
Hello?

214
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,560
Yeah. That's Misa's cell phone,

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,900
so I'll return it to her.

216
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,440
I see.
I understand.

217
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,960
Ryuga...

218
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,510
You probably think you've won,

219
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,080
but Misa has another phone.

220
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,870
If I call that one...

221
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,410
Oh...

222
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,080
This time it's my cell phone.

223
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,420
Yes?

224
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,290
Yes. I see.
We did it.

225
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,470
I understand.

226
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,180
This may be good news <i>and</i> bad news to you,

227
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,190
but Amane Misa has just been taken into custody under suspicion of being the Second Kira.

228
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,700
<i>When in the world did he find out about Misa?!</i>

229
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,450
<i>I never thought he'd catch her this quickly.</i>

230
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,950
When the Second Kira sent
the video tapes from Amane's room,

231
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,490
they left a great deal of evidence, such as hairs and clothing fibers,

232
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,790
stuck to the masking tape used to seal the envelopes.

233
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,700
There will probably be a riot if we charge her
with being the Second Kira, so we're telling the public

234
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,510
that she's voluntarily coming with us
because her manager is suspected of drug possession.

235
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,800
The truth will probably never go public.

236
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,230
I was careless.

237
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,540
That video...

238
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,230
I should've destroyed all the evidence.

239
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,370
In the end, Ryuga chose to protect himself by being with me instead of hiding.

240
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,820
He confronted the heart of the matter.

241
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,280
This wager is my...

242
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,360
My...

243
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,250
No!

244
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,830
Not yet...

245
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,840
The challenge is just beginning, L.

246
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,320
Watari, has she said anything?

247
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,780
No, nothing yet.

248
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,640
Get me a visual of her.

249
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,070
Are you sure?

250
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,310
Yes, quickly.

251
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,070
R-Ryuzaki!

252
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,320
What's the meaning of this?!

253
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,750
I've apprehended her as the Second Kira.

254
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,490
This, at the very least, is necessary.

255
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,170
Indeed, there was enough evidence in Amane's room

256
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,500
to mark her as the Second Kira, but...

257
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,970
Yes. There's no mistake.

258
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,670
Now all we have to do

259
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,360
is make her tell us whether she knows Kira, and if so, whether she knows who he is,

260
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,430
and how she kills.

261
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,850
Watari, take the proper precautions, but do whatever needs to be done

262
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,450
to get her to confess.

263
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,960
Yes.

264
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,010
Also, Mr. Yagami,

265
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,900
I'm probably going to bring in Light to testify, as the prime suspect.

266
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Please be prepared.

267
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,720
Ryuzaki, Amane's talking.

268
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,560
Give me visuals and sound! Quickly!

269
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,100
Finally after three days, huh?!

270
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,540
I can't take it anymore...

271
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,900
Kill me.

272
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,450
Kill me.

273
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,280
Hurry up and kill me!

274
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,680
I guess it was too much for a young girl.

275
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,840
She must be at her limit.

276
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,760
Amane Misa, can you hear me?

277
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,400
I can hear you.

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,550
Please kill me now...

279
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,790
Is this because you admit to being the Second Kira?

280
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,640
No! I don't know anything about the Second Kira.

281
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,040
I can't take this anymore...

282
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,860
I'd rather die...

283
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,810
Now, hurry! Kill me!

284
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,190
You should be able to kill me immediately, right?!

285
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,700
Misa, do you mean...

286
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,780
Yes, kill me.

287
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,660
You want me to kill you?

288
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,870
Yes... Kill me...

289
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,370
I can't take it anymore...
Kill me...

290
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,910
If I kill you, I'll kill Yagami Light.

291
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,600
This is all his...

292
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,820
No!

293
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,340
No... Kill me!

294
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,560
Misa, you want so badly... to die for him?

295
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,430
That's enough!

296
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,810
If you won't kill me...!

297
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,020
This isn't good!
Watari, don't let her bite her tongue!

298
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,260
Could it be that these are just actions controlled by Kira before death?

299
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,740
Oh, Rem.

300
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,490
What's the matter?

301
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,620
Yagami Light,

302
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,780
I offered to help Misa escape, but she refused.

303
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,200
She probably thought it would get you in trouble,

304
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,050
since the police think that she has special powers.

305
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,550
And when she was at her wit's end,

306
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,220
she started to ask me to kill her.

307
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,230
This is all because she wants you to love her.

308
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,070
No matter how much she asked, I couldn't kill her.

309
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,750
I couldn't bear watching her.

310
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,370
There was only one way to save her from that suffering.

311
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,620
Forfeiting ownership of the Death Note.

312
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,740
That's right.

313
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,210
If she forfeits ownership of the Death Note,

314
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,750
all memories related to the Death Note will disappear.

315
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,550
All memories of murders she committed with her notebook,

316
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,510
along with the fact that you are Kira, will disappear.

317
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,760
Misa will not reveal your secret.

318
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,850
Also, Misa will no longer be able to see Ryuk or me.

319
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,690
Misa...

320
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,150
You will forget everything about Shinigami.

321
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,180
It's all right.

322
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,880
The human you love is Yagami Light.

323
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,450
Those emotions will remain.

324
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,750
So, Misa, forfeit ownership of the notebook

325
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,500
and leave everything to Yagami Light.

326
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,500
Misa no longer owns the Death Note.

327
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,910
You did well, Rem.

328
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,380
I was beginning to think that was the only way.

329
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,780
If her memories of the Death Note are erased,

330
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,630
then it's not impossible to release Misa.

331
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,870
Yagami Light, I knew this was the method you would have desired the most,

332
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,560
and that's why I proposed it to Misa.

333
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,860
If you don't save Misa,

334
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,650
I'll kill you.

335
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,020
I understand, Rem.

336
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,040
I think I have a good idea of what L's next move is.

337
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,370
I have an idea.

338
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,050
This is good-bye, Ryuk.

339
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,050
What?

340
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,710
Yeah,

341
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,710
I know I probably look pretty bad in here.

342
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,300
But this useless pride...
I'll just have to...

343
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,420
get rid of it.
