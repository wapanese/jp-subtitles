1
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,990
I am L.

2
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,910
He's L?

3
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,500
He's different from what I imagined.

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,050
I am Detective Superintendent Yagami of the National Police Agency.

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
Uh, I'm Matsuda.

6
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,790
I'm Aizawa.

7
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,780
I'm Mogi.

8
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm Ukita.

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,110
I'm sorry we're late.

10
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,760
These five are our current...

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,570
Bang!

12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,140
What are you doing?!

13
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,230
If I were Kira, you would be dead, Mr. Yagami Soichiro.

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,780
You already know that all Kira needs is a face and a name, don't you?

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,660
Please don't give out your name so carelessly.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,950
Let's value our lives.

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,080
I've heard about him needing a face,

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,770
but I haven't heard anything about him needing a name.

19
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:40,490
Criminals whose names were unknown or whose names were broadcast incorrectly were all spared.

20
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,800
It was discussed at task force headquarters.

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,060
Let's not stand around and chat.
Please come right this way.

22
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,730
Oh, right.

23
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,500
Please turn off all cell phones, laptops, and other electronic devices and place them on that table.

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,350
L, do you think that we'd make calls on our
cell phones and leak our information to the outside?

25
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,410
Just do as he says.

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,670
I know he's cautious,

27
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,500
but I still can't tell whether or not he trusts us.

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,460
No. I just can't stand it when people's cell phones go off when I'm talking.

29
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,420
Let me start by saying...

30
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,490
Please do not take any notes on anything we say at this headquarters.

31
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,470
Keep all of it in your head.

32
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,840
Please, sit wherever you like.

33
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,330
O-Okay.

34
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,560
Um, L...

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,120
When you refer to me from now on, I wish to be called "Ryuzaki," not L.

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
Just to be safe.

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, then, Ryuzaki...

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,460
If you know that a face and a name are needed,

39
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,920
then couldn't we cut down the number of victims by censoring crime reports?

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,720
If we were to do that, then ordinary people would be killed.

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,350
Ordinary people?

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,020
Why?

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,860
Kira is childish and hates to lose.

44
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,210
He's childish?

45
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,730
And he hates to lose?

46
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,420
Yes.

47
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,980
I'm also childish and hate to lose.

48
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,550
That's how I know.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Ryuzaki,

50
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,790
could you elaborate?

51
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,750
When I declared war against Kira on television...

52
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,090
Until then, we thought that Kira was only after criminals.

53
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,090
But he didn't hesitate to kill my double.

54
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,300
Also, as soon as I said he was hiding in the Kanto region,

55
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,010
as if to say, "So what if I am?"

56
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,930
he started drawing most of his victims from Japan.

57
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,850
He's met each of my challenges without flinching.

58
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,720
What do you think would happen...p

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,610
if we tried to use media restrictions to hide criminals from someone like this?

60
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,070
Well...

61
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,120
"If you won't give me your criminals,
then I'll kill those who've committed lighter crimes

62
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,440
or even the innocent!"

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,250
"The whole world is my hostage!"

64
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,900
"I'm not the evil one."

65
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,260
"Those who oppose me and hide evil-doers are!"

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,070
This is how Kira's mind works.

67
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,610
Speaking of the mass media,
let's think of ways we can use it to our advantage.

68
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,020
For example?

69
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,980
How about this?

70
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,620
"U.S. furious over deaths of FBI agents."

71
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,860
"Kira's antics have angered the whole world,

72
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,070
the leading nations send a total of 1,500 investigators into Japan."

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,030
It would be different from his recent experience with the FBI.

74
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,190
He would begin to see everyone as a threat.

75
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,370
When he's at his limit, it should cause some sort of response.

76
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,690
Th-That's interesting.

77
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,630
1,500 instead of the actual group of seven, huh?

78
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,420
And unlike those FBI agents,
they don't exist, so they can't be killed!

79
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,140
This could work!

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,970
Well then, I'll tell you my thoughts on the Kira case.

81
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,510
Kira works alone.

82
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,620
He was accessing inside information from the investigation before.

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,280
Why do you believe he's working alone?

84
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
Aizawa, wait.

85
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,740
Let's hear Ryuzaki's entire theory first.

86
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,360
Kira needs a name and a face to kill.

87
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
To a certain degree,

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,410
he can even control the victim's time of death and the actions the victim takes before his death.

89
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,670
With all of that in mind...

90
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,490
Please listen closely to the following.

91
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,210
On December 14th,

92
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,260
twelve FBI agents entered Japan.

93
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,720
On December 19th,

94
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,360
Kira began using prisoners to conduct tests concerning actions a victim can take before death.

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,730
In other words, during just this five-day period,

96
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,220
Kira became aware of the FBI's presence and felt threatened.

97
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
Because he didn't know their faces or names,

98
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,530
in order to eliminate all of the FBI agents,

99
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,910
he had to see how far he could control the deaths of his victims.

100
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,960
Finally, on December 27th...

101
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,400
After making sure the FBI agents received the file

102
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,430
with all the names and faces of the other agents,

103
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,130
I succeeded in killing all of them.

104
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,880
It is nearly impossible to figure out whose files Kira saw.

105
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,930
But...

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,850
I can't let anyone know that I came into contact with Raye Penber.

107
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,530
Huh? You're not using the Death Note today?

108
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,680
Are you studying for the entrance exams?

109
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,070
It's no use practicing for those at this point.

110
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh? So what is it?

111
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,290
From December 19th through the 27th...

112
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,860
That's when I worked the most.

113
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,760
Within this time, twenty-three people died of heart attacks as we all know.

114
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,840
They were all wanted criminals, ex-convicts,

115
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,780
and people who were suspected of crimes.

116
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,650
People obviously different from those Kira usually targets.

117
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,770
Indeed.

118
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,270
It means that in order to kill the FBI agents,

119
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,610
he needed to control those with even lesser crimes.

120
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,840
He killed twenty-three people

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,260
so that we couldn't tell whom he used.

122
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,780
He actually probably only used a few.

123
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,160
He left eight days after the tests

124
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,160
to allow the FBI to gather information on other suspects.

125
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,290
He wanted to draw attention away from himself.

126
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,830
Thus, I suspect that Kira was one of the people

127
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,760
who was being investigated by
the FBI between the 14th and the 19th.

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,980
This is data from the FBI.

129
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,410
It contains other important information.

130
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,880
You can't take these out of this room, butâ€”

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,980
Amazing!

132
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,470
This is amazing!

133
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,880
If we have this much information,
our small group can do more than enough on our own.

134
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
Let's split into two groups.

135
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,780
One will trace the FBI agents, and the other will research those who had heart attacks.

136
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,080
There are only a few people

137
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,480
who were able to get info from headquarters,
whom the FBI were investigating during their first five days!

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,620
Yeah.

139
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,540
Well, does anyone have any questions?

140
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,290
Well then, Ryuzaki,

141
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,680
I have a question.

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,100
You said earlier that you hate to lose.

143
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,720
But you've shown us your face.

144
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,470
Doesn't that mean that you've already lost to Kira?

145
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,090
That's right.

146
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,000
The fact that I've shown my face

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,440
and that I've sacrificed twelve FBI agents are both losses.

148
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
But I will win in the end.

149
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,200
This is the first time I've put my life on the line.

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,660
Let's show Kira that we're willing to risk our lives...

151
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,580
because justice will definitely prevail.

152
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,330
Th-That's right.

153
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,060
Justice will prevail!

154
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,340
Let's give it our best!

155
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,710
Let's do this, Ryuzaki!

156
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,610
When I first saw him, I was suspicious.

157
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,720
But there's no mistake. This man is L.

158
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,840
First off, in order to make sure that Kira is not among us,

159
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,300
I would like to talk to each of you individually.

160
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,480
Huh? Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,390
So he doesn't trust us?

162
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,440
It's understandable.

163
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,550
If Kira's been gathering information from headquarters from the beginning,

164
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,470
chances are high that he's here.

165
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,440
I get it!

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,040
Because we've stayed on the case, we've seen Ryuzaki's face.

167
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,250
Even this is a risk, huh?

168
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,400
Things have been going well so far.

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,750
If only I had one more thing...
Just one more decisive clue...

170
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,890
If there was just one thing I missed...

171
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,760
Just one piece of evidence that would come to light...

172
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,510
It could cost me my life.

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,470
Just one thing...
Just one thing...

174
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,640
Have you finished studying?

175
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,710
Yeah.

176
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,100
It's all right.

177
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,480
There wasn't anything I missed.

178
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,210
My biggest gamble was the bus-jacking incident,

179
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,970
but it's impossible to connect it to Kira.

180
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,100
The police and L don't know

181
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,270
that Kira can kill people by means other than heart attacks.

182
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,770
But if anyone were to discover that fact,
it would be a huge problem for me.

183
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,440
What? Right now?

184
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,360
Dad's been pulling overnighters.
He needs clean clothes.

185
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,950
You've got to give this to him.

186
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,080
I promised I'd go to the first
New Year's Shrine Visit with my friends!

187
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,370
I'll go.

188
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,680
I could use a break.

189
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,810
How lucky!

190
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,370
Thank you, Light!

191
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,540
That means that you can spy on the Police Department.

192
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,040
I'll only be able to go as far as the receptionist's desk, though.

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,070
Oh? You're bringing a page?

194
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,800
An outing to kill?

195
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,700
Lately, I've been doing this when I go out.

196
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,470
Just in case.

197
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,060
That day...

198
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,530
Raye said that he was going to go to Shinjuku.

199
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,020
On that same day, there were
four heart attacks in the Shinjuku area.

200
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,820
And...

201
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,040
a bus-jacking...

202
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,560
It's not a coincidence.

203
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,210
Kira can...

204
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,050
kill by means other than heart attacks.

205
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,040
That's unusual for Dad.

206
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,190
I wonder if he's at an important meeting.

207
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,110
Please help me!

208
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,110
I must speak directly to someone from the task force.

209
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,750
I told you already.

210
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,090
There is no one at the Kira task force headquarters.

211
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,610
There's no one at headquarters?

212
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,340
Dad's phone is off.

213
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,010
What's going on?

214
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,080
Is there any way I can contact them?

215
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,000
It's something very important relating to the Kira investigation.

216
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,130
The Kira investigation?!

217
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,390
Well, I'll try to call their headquarters once more.

218
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,250
I'm Detective Superintendent Yagami Soichiro's son, Light.

219
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,980
I brought my father's change of clothes,

220
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,310
but it doesn't look like he's here. Could you hold on to these for him?

221
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,810
Sure. Light, I haven't seen you around in a while.

222
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,240
Oh, sorry. Uh...

223
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,820
Remember? We solved that insurance murder with your advice.

224
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,700
I was the receptionist then, too.

225
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,290
Really? I'm sorry.

226
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,580
I just write my name here, right?

227
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,700
Does this mean that you're going to help the Kira case, too?

228
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,510
Yes.

229
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,750
If all goes well, I may be able to beat L.

230
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
Beat L?

231
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,750
Nobody's at their headquarters.

232
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,920
Please trust me on this.

233
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,440
I'll be sure to give them your message.

234
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,620
That won't do.

235
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,100
It must be in person.

236
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,430
Excuse me...

237
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,840
My father is leading the Kira investigation.

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,230
Do you want to leave a message with me?

239
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,270
His cell phone is off,

240
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,230
so I can't tell him immediately.

241
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,830
A bunch of FBI agents were killed,

242
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,760
and a lot of detectives quit the case because they were afraid of Kira.

243
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,100
Light, you shouldn't be telling civilians that.

244
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,000
People are already talking about it.

245
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,630
Besides, this person is trustworthy.

246
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,650
I can tell by looking at her eyes.

247
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,500
She's a very wise and careful person.

248
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,840
You've heard about the FBI incident,

249
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,630
and you figured out that there's a problem within the Japanese police force itself.

250
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,760
That's why you want to speak directly to headquarters.

251
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,520
Did I get that right?

252
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,720
I'll probably get a call from my father

253
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,190
once he gets the message I left on his phone.

254
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,380
You can talk directly to him at that time.

255
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,820
Is it all right?

256
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,290
Of course.

257
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,340
I can't give you my father's cell phone number,

258
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,050
but you can use my phone.

259
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,530
Of course, it's no use if you don't trust both of us.

260
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,500
What's up with that cheery attitude?

261
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,630
I leave it to you.

262
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,780
You've managed to lead her along well, Light.

263
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,760
You're pretty brave...

264
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,680
to involve yourself in the Kira case.

265
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,200
Not at all.

266
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,190
You think that Kira is...

267
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:11,610
Uh, may I ask what your name is?
My name is Yagami Light.

268
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,770
Yagami as in "night god,"
and Light as in the character for "moon."

269
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,100
It's a strange name, isn't it?

270
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,680
I'm Maki Shoko.

271
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,710
Maki as in "space" and "tree,"
and Shoko for "shining child."

272
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,880
Ms. Maki, right?

273
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,390
Ms. Maki,

274
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,130
I think that Kira's powers

275
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,430
enable him to control his victims before he kills them.

276
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,970
I thought so too!

277
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,270
That's exactly what I was thinking!

278
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,970
Kira can control the actions of a person before death.

279
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,150
But that's not all.

280
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,520
If my analysis is correct,

281
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,400
Kira can also kill people by means other than heart attacks.

282
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,410
<i>Who is this woman?</i>

283
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,740
I don't think anyone's noticed yet.

284
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,080
But I think this is what's going to help us catch Kira.

285
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,800
I hadn't even thought about that.

286
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,290
But if that's the case,

287
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,950
Kira would make sure not to give his victims heart attacks when he's intent on hiding a murder.

288
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,120
Yes. Someone I know may have met Kira.

289
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,010
They've met Kira?!

290
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,400
Oh, sorry.

291
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,440
Meeting Kira is definitely something that the police would have a hard time believing.

292
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,760
Right. That's why I have to explain it in detail to someone from the task force headquarters.

293
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,780
But wouldn't it be better
if that person spoke to them instead?

294
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,080
That person is no longer alive.

295
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,660
He was one of the FBI agents who came to Japan.

296
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,300
An FBI agent who met Kira.

297
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,510
Could it be...

298
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,670
He was also my fiancÃ©.

299
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,850
He said that he witnessed a bus-jacking incident.

300
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,430
He probably met Kira on that bus.

301
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,890
Raye Penber!

302
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,770
What's wrong?

303
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,160
Nothing.

304
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,290
I'm sorry your fiancÃ© passed away.

305
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,700
So what makes you think he met Kira?

306
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,820
Eight days after the bus-jacking...

307
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,830
He died, along with the other FBI agents.

308
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,170
That bus-jacker robbed a bank two days earlier.

309
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,630
He died in an accident.

310
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,090
An unusual and rare set of events...

311
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:46,060
I think that Kira set up the bus-jacking to steal information from my fiancÃ©

312
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,610
in order to kill the FBI agents who had come to Japan.

313
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,690
The bus-jacker died in an accident.

314
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,070
In other words, heart attacks aren't the only way that Kira can kill.

315
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,170
The bus-jacker didn't die of a heart attack.

316
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,920
So that's why you think that Kira can kill
by means other than heart attacks?

317
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,320
Yes.

318
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,750
I think that's a bit of a leap.

319
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,840
No, it's not.

320
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,040
I can't help but think that the bus-jacker was being controlled by Kira.

321
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,940
Why?

322
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,880
I've been wondering about the bus-jacking ever since my fiancÃ© told me about it.

323
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,950
I asked him about it more when he was relaxed.

324
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,530
He didn't name names, but he did tell me this.

325
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,450
What did he say?

326
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,370
That he reluctantly showed his FBI ID to someone.

327
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,710
Because it was an investigation conducted in secret by the Japanese police,

328
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,510
he wasn't supposed to show his ID.

329
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,430
So whoever saw his ID was the one who let it slip that the FBI was in Japan.

330
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,430
She's right on the money!

331
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,100
So this would be the oversight that Light was worrying about!

332
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,570
I see.

333
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,600
It's a conclusion you came to

334
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,610
with your singular knowledge and your desire to avenge your fiancÃ©.

335
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,330
You believe that Kira can murder his victims by means other than heart attacks.

336
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,400
Yes.

337
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,900
You have some amazing deductive skills,
but you can't deny that

338
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,860
you have personal interests in this case. Your argument seems a bit forced.

339
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,960
But...

340
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,460
This theory is definitely worth investigating.

341
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,530
Your testimony will be very important to the case.

342
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,460
R-Right.

343
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
If what you said is correct,

344
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,640
Kira will be caught soon.

345
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,750
Because...

346
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,140
Kira was the one your fiancÃ© showed his ID to on that bus.

347
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,230
Yes.

348
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,280
That was close.

349
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,790
If this woman had spoken to the police before she met me...

350
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,660
But...

351
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,040
It seems that a god other than a Shinigami...

352
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,540
is on my side.

353
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,330
I want to see how this woman dies,

354
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,170
but I can't be caught following her.

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,090
Now...

356
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,630
hurry to your death.
