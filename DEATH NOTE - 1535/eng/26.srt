1
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,230
Wh-What's this?!

2
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,910
Everyone, the Shiniga—

3
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,270
Try and kill me!

4
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,980
I told you that this is a live broadcast worldwide,

5
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,490
but this is only being broadcast in the Kanto region of Japan.

6
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,280
The first victim was the killer in Shinjuku.

7
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,410
Furthermore, his crime was only broadcast in Japan.

8
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,670
I have been able to deduce this much.

9
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,390
You are in Japan

10
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,960
and your first victim was your guinea pig.

11
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,570
Kira has found a way to obtain information from task force headquarters.

12
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,930
There are 141 people within the police force alone

13
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,520
who have access to classified information
on the Kira investigation.

14
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,940
But one of the 141 people

15
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,650
or someone close to them...

16
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,670
Kira is definitely among them!

17
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,440
On December 14th,

18
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,990
twelve FBI agents entered Japan.

19
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,720
December 19th...

20
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,590
Kira began using prisoners to conduct tests concerning actions a victim can take before death.

21
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,550
In order to eliminate all of the FBI agents,

22
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,970
he had to see how far
he could control the death of his victims.

23
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,220
Thus, I suspect that Kira was one of the people

24
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,270
who was being investigated
by the FBI between the 14th and the 19th.

25
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,490
Raye Penber's fiancée?

26
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,910
Misora Naomi...

27
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,780
So that's it...

28
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,540
She worked under me on that case and now she's in Japan.

29
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,120
She was with Penber.

30
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,830
She might have found a clue.

31
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,860
If that's the case, did Kira get to her first?

32
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,730
Everyone,

33
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,310
from now on, we'll focus our investigation on the people whom Raye Penber was investigating while in Japan.

34
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,230
Deputy Director General Kitamura and his family,

35
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,280
and Detective Superintendent Yagami and his family.

36
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,490
I also wish to place wiretaps and surveillance cameras in both households.

37
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,910
Ryuzaki, are you telling me that you suspect my son?

38
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,830
I suspect him.

39
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,540
I'm L.

40
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,110
Don't worry, Yagami.

41
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,550
Kira hates to lose,

42
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,100
but most people don't like to lose. It's not just Kira.

43
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,650
See, you came in for the win.

44
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,570
Yagami, I suspect that you're Kira.

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,150
I'm Kira?

46
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,330
Ryuga.

47
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,660
Is there any way that I can get you
to believe that I'm not Kira?

48
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,870
It's all right.

49
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
We'll know in time if you aren't Kira.

50
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,880
Four days ago, our program director was sent these four tapes.

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,220
Our audience rating could go up sixty—no, seventy percent.
Four days ago, our program director was sent these four tapes.

52
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,590
One tape predicts the killings,
Our audience rating could go up sixty—no, seventy percent.

53
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,340
One tape predicts the killings,

54
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,600
and the other sends a message to the people of the world.

55
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,600
I am Kira.

56
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,150
The anchor, Mr. Hibima Kazuhiko,

57
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,270
will die of a heart attack at exactly six o'clock.

58
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,990
Something terrible will happen if we don't stop this broadcast!

59
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,780
You moron!

60
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,530
Ukita!

61
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,790
Kira shouldn't be able to kill without a name!

62
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,560
But from what I just saw,

63
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,210
it's not entirely impossible
that he may only need a face to kill.

64
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,380
This is the police!

65
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,010
Stop this program!

66
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,180
There is a high possibility that this Kira is a fake.

67
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,720
No,

68
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,100
we should call him the Second Kira.

69
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,770
Mr. Yagami.

70
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,310
May I ask your son to cooperate in this investigation?

71
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,190
There is a good chance that this is not the Kira we've known until now.

72
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,950
It's exactly the same deduction that L — I mean, Ryuzaki, made.

73
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,220
When we meet,

74
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,990
we can confirm our identities
by showing our Shinigami to each other.

75
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,990
What is it?!

76
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,000
If there is a code that only people who have the so-called Shinigami power can understand,

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,210
I won't be able to decode it.

78
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,550
But we should thoroughly check out
the places listed in the diary.

79
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,100
Please be sure to keep a watchful eye on Light.

80
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,560
In the event that Light is Kira,

81
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,390
the Second Kira might try to contact him.

82
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,100
Also, Mr. Yagami...

83
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,610
I would like Mr. Mogi to keep watch over Light's activities.

84
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,410
Light! There you are!

85
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm Light's girlfriend, Amane Misa.
Pleased to meet you.

86
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm Ryuga Hideki.

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,950
Huh?

88
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,470
Ryuga Hideki?

89
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,920
This may be good news <i>and</i> bad news to you,

90
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,970
but Amane Misa has just been taken into custody under suspicion of being the Second Kira.

91
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,220
When the Second Kira sent
the video tapes from Amane's room,

92
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,430
they left a great deal of evidence, such as hairs and clothing fibers, stuck to the masking tape used to seal the envelopes.

93
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,890
R-Ryuzaki!

94
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,600
What's the meaning of this?!

95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,690
Now, hurry! Kill me!

96
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,480
You should be able to kill me immediately, right?!

97
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,860
Is this because you admit to being the Second Kira?

98
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,700
No! I don't know anything about the Second Kira...

99
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,870
Ryuzaki, I told you over the phone,

100
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,080
but I think I may be Kira.

101
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,790
But for him to say that he may be Kira?

102
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,860
It's an act.

103
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,290
It's not that you may<i> be Kira, but that you </i>are<i> Kira.</i>

104
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,170
Light, are you all right?

105
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,860
Yeah, I know I probably look pretty bad in here.

106
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,050
But this useless pride... I'll just have to...

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,140
get rid of it.

108
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,810
Ryuzaki!

109
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,480
I know I agreed to be detained

110
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,100
and chose to do this.

111
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,150
But now I just clearly realized...

112
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,230
I'm not Kira!

113
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,940
Get me out of here quickly!

114
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,610
What's going on? Two weeks worth of criminals
were murdered all at once yesterday!

115
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,370
I can't make sense of anything that's happening.

116
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,960
It seems like all three of them are at their limit.

117
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,830
Ryuzaki,

118
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,960
why are you still confining Light?

119
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
It's already been fifty days.

120
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm going to kill you here and then kill myself.

121
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,300
Wh-What are you talking about, Dad?!

122
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,550
Stop it already! You're crazy!
Wh-What are you talking about, Dad?!

123
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,050
Th-That's crazy!

124
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,570
It would be better if we ran away.

125
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,860
It's too late, Light.

126
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,720
Stop, Dad! I'm not Kira!

127
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,100
Light...

128
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,470
From one murderer to another, I'll see you in hell.

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,490
Dad!

130
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:05,900
From one murderer to another, I'll see you in hell.

131
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,400
Stop!

132
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,860
It was a convincing performance.

133
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,240
As I promised, I will end their confinement.

134
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,250
Also, Light, I will arrange things so that

135
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,730
you and I will be together 24 hours a day,
working on the investigation.

136
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,100
They're deaths that are in Yotsuba's favor.

137
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,220
Checking back,

138
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,560
there have been as many as thirteen such cases in the past three months.

139
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

140
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,820
Or is Kira using Yotsuba?

141
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,540
I haven't figured that out yet,

142
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,480
but let's investigate this with the assumption that this is Kira's doing.

143
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,260
Let's thoroughly investigate Yotsuba!

144
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,610
Please be sure not to act out of panic or haste.

145
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,540
And don't take matters into your own hands.

146
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,370
My name is Matsui Taro.

147
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,660
How would you like to use
Amane Misa in your commercials?!

148
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,670
Ryuzaki, are you watching?

149
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,840
The eight of them who came were having a meeting to determine whom to have Kira kill for them.

150
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,170
If Matsuda dies, that would justify the suspicion against Yotsuba.

151
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,380
Is there anything I can do to save myself?

152
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,220
Matsuda, you idiot.

153
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,760
Good luck, Misa-Misa!

154
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,480
I'll be waiting to celebrate when they decide
to put you in their commercials!

155
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,020
It's my dream to become Kira's bride.

156
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,110
Because I'm...

157
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,190
the Second Kira.

158
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,370
Well then, I'm Kira, so marry me, Misa!

159
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,160
And there you have it!

160
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,950
Higuchi is Kira!

161
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,700
What are you going to do?

162
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm going to trick Higuchi using Sakura TV.

163
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,880
A hidden-camera show?

164
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,250
Higuchi, this is bad.
Turn on your TV.

165
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,380
So one of these people is Kira, right?

166
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,800
Yes. I have a lot of proof.

167
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,550
I-It's him!

168
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,010
How is he still alive?!

169
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,940
I've confirmed Higuchi.
I'm going after him.

170
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm going after him!

171
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,470
Stop your car!

172
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,760
Pull over and stop!

173
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,070
Rem. Let's make the deal.

174
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,080
Deal?

175
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,140
You were speeding.
Show me your driver's license!

176
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,410
Yeah, all right.

177
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,620
Shiraba Yukito              Accident

178
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
Hey!

179
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,290
Higuchi is escaping!

180
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,630
This is the highway patrol.

181
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,380
Everyone!

182
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,530
It's too dangerous to let Higuchi alone any longer.

183
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,100
We will proceed to capture him.

184
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,310
Higuchi, like the Second Kira,
is now able to kill just by looking at someone's face,

185
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,060
We will capture him with that in mind!

186
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,360
Stop right there!

187
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,860
Don't you come near me!

188
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,950
Higuchi,

189
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,070
how do you kill people?

190
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,980
You may not believe me,

191
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,000
but if I write the name of someone whose face
I know in that notebook, that person dies.

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,010
Yeah, there's one in Higuchi's bag.

193
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,390
What's wrong, Mr. Yagami?

194
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,470
I-It's a monster!

195
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,270
That's a Shinigami...

196
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,610
There are more than two notebooks in existence!

197
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,520
This isn't finished yet.

198
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,400
How to use...

199
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,320
The human whose name is written in this note...

200
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,910
shall die.

201
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,740
And this last sentence...

202
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,830
If the person using the note

203
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,130
fails to continuously write names of people to be killed

204
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,340
within 13 days of each other, then the user will die.

205
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,710
Yagami Light and Amane Misa are alive.

206
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,470
Thirteen days...

207
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,930
This is the only...

208
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:22,500
The following is the record which contains everything
I have investigated on the Kira Incident.

209
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,930
The fact that now you are reading this message

210
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,750
means I am no longer alive at this moment.

211
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:38,580
I hereby leave this record as my firm achievement.

212
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,480
It's been ten days since Ryuzaki's secret funeral.

213
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,530
It looks like we aren't going to die.

214
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,170
We now know Watari's identity, but in the end,

215
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,650
we didn't find out anything about Ryuzaki.

216
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,930
It seems Watari was actually an amazing inventor.

217
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,460
He created orphanages worldwide with the fortune he made from several of his patents.

218
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,630
He's a hero! A hero!

219
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,030
But we can't continue investigating here
now that L and Watari are gone.

220
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,140
This is tough...

221
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,590
Yeah...

222
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,010
Light, how is it going?

223
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,350
I can remove the entire system here by tonight.

224
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,020
I don't feel good about it.
It feels like stealing.

225
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,460
I've created a voice like the one that Ryuzaki used.

226
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,050
We can act like he's still alive

227
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,490
and control the police as we've been doing.

228
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,060
But who will replace L?

229
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,540
Where will we do it?

230
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,500
What'll we do with the killer notebook?

231
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,350
What are you talking about, Light?!

232
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,500
The only one who can play the role of L is you!

233
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,270
If Ryuzaki was killed by Kira for challenging him,

234
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,010
I don't feel comfortable about it.

235
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,970
Besides that, it'll be tricking the people of the world.

236
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,620
I understand your feelings,
but you're the only one who can do this.

237
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,350
That's right.
Ryuzaki said it as well.

238
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,560
You'd be capable of succeeding L.

239
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,460
How facile...

240
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,860
It's no fun without Ryuzaki.

241
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,120
Yeah, all right. I'll do it.

242
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,180
But I won't do anything dangerous
like challenging Kira directly to gain clues, like Ryuzaki did.

243
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,380
Is that okay?

244
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,500
Yes.

245
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,120
That would be better and safer.

246
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,750
Ryuzaki may have been too confrontational.

247
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,880
In that case,

248
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,840
I can do about the same work with this computer and my own.

249
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,720
It's also possible to be L from my room at home.

250
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,600
I'll also be Watari.

251
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,230
But it would be difficult to do this with my mom and little sister around.

252
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,900
It would be good if I could rent a one-room apartment.

253
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,990
There's nothing suspicious about renting a room for my son to live on his own.

254
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,410
That's right. Then the place he'll be renting out will be task force headquarters.

255
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes.

256
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,420
All that's left is what to do with the killer notebook.

257
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,000
There's no need to think too hard.

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,190
We'll just have one of the five of us,

259
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,510
whom we trust will never use the notebook, hide it somewhere where no one can get to it.

260
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,890
Chief, please do this!

261
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,320
We can count on you!
You're a pillar of justice!

262
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,740
Me, huh?

263
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,770
All right...

264
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,180
Let's avenge Ryuzaki!

265
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,110
Yeah.

266
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,010
Yes. Kira's still here.

267
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,610
Let's catch him!

268
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,620
Well then, let's have a party
to celebrate Light becoming the second L.

269
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,480
Quit fooling around, now's not the time.

270
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,540
Now, now...

271
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,260
Light!

272
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,540
It's our first date in a while.

273
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,760
Enjoy yourself a little more...

274
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,320
Misa...

275
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,680
Let's live together.

276
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,580
Huh?!

277
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,280
R-Really?!

278
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,930
Yeah. I've already rented a room.

279
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,890
All right! We're living together! Misa wins!

280
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,940
Misa wins?

281
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,030
You know, against Kiyomi and Mari and Yuri.

282
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,300
It's all right, Light.

283
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,000
You just used them to trick L, didn't you?

284
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,590
I understand.

285
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,250
You won't see them anymore, right?

286
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,720
Right...

287
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,010
Say...

288
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,510
Is your score finally settled with L?

289
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,010
Yeah.

290
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,310
Then I can't expect anything interesting anymore.

291
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,020
That's not true, Ryuk.

292
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,820
Hm?

293
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,030
From now on...

294
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,110
I'll show you the creation of a new world.

295
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,700
Oh?

296
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,520
Papa!

297
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,900
Papa!!

298
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,000
Yotsuba's reconstruction is just beginning.

299
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,870
Y-Yeah.

300
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,630
Let's do our best!

301
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,810
Hm?

302
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,580
H-Hey, Namikawa?

303
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,500
Huh?! I-Impossible!

304
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,970
In April, 2012, Yagami Light, age twenty-three, joins the National Police Agency.

305
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,940
In the summer of 2012,

306
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,230
Kira's judgments gain momentum.

307
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,690
The world screams in fear of Kira,

308
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,940
but privately it cheers for him.

309
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,610
Slowly but surely, their true thoughts arise,

310
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,490
and some countries even express their acceptance of Kira.

311
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,600
The world continues towards a dark era where Kira is the law.

312
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,890
What is it, Roger?

313
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,670
L is dead.

314
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
About L's death?

315
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,290
From whom?

316
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,290
From where?

317
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,620
A kidnapping?

318
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:40,630
Who kidnapped whom?
A kidnapping?

319
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,250
Who kidnapped whom?

320
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,380
Are they joking?

321
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,800
But...

322
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,960
This strange feeling...

323
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,470
What is it?
