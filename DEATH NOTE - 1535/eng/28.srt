1
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,770
Nice to see you.

2
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,070
Thank you for taking care of my father.

3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,230
S-Sayu...

4
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,870
Y-You've grown up...

5
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,030
This is Yagami.

6
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,580
Mr. Deputy Director?

7
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,370
About the trade between the chief and the notebook...

8
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,420
It's canceled.

9
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,200
What?!

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,540
We'll now trade the notebook

11
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,210
for Yagami Sayu.

12
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,590
At any rate, bring the notebook

13
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,590
to Los Angeles by yourself in two days.

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,690
Nice to meet you, L Number Two.

15
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,970
I am at the center of the SPK.

16
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,910
I guess I would be...

17
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,810
N.

18
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,320
N?

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,940
Is he joking?

20
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,310
But...

21
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,180
This strange feeling...

22
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,940
What is it?

23
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,510
N... He's similar to...

24
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,330
This feeling... He's like L...

25
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,780
I said I wouldn't rely on L.

26
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,610
That means that the CIA and the FBI rely on me rather than L

27
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,960
to make their decisions.

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,380
However, the murder of the Director
of the Japanese NPA is an unforgivable crime.

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,310
I think there is a possibility
that this case could lead to the arrest of Kira.

30
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,810
So I will lend you my full support.

31
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,010
Lead to the arrest of Kira?

32
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,810
Just who does he think he is?
This confidence...

33
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,320
What's wrong, L?

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
Nothing.

35
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,400
Actually, after the director was murdered,

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,960
Deputy Director Yagami's daughter was kidnapped by someone
whom we believe to be the same person who killed the director.

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,120
They contacted us to make a deal in Los Angeles.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,150
A deal? In exchange for the notebook, right?

39
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,960
That's right.

40
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,370
I understand. I'll gather as many investigators as I can
in Los Angeles without telling them the details.

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,510
And I'll use a satellite to monitor the L.A. area.

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
No...

43
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,460
I'll let you have total authority on this, L.

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,980
Thank goodness.

45
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,000
We make the decisions.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,820
But what was that about
the Americans not trusting L anymore?

47
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,950
Near, are you sure about leaving this to a fake L
who hasn't succeeded in catching Kira?

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,330
So much the better.

49
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,950
It means that there's a chance we can take advantage of him.

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,480
Of course, people's lives are our first priority.

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,960
But as the SPK, our goal is simply

52
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,510
to get the notebook and capture Kira.

53
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,080
Light...

54
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,050
I don't care if it costs me my life.

55
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,030
Just save Sayu...

56
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,140
please...

57
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,310
Don't be foolish.

58
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,380
You may be satisfied with that,

59
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,490
but do you know how painful it would be
for everyone you'd leave behind?!

60
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,490
You cannot die in front of Sayu.

61
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,200
You may lose contact with me.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,500
So if you ever come across a situation
where you have to make a decision by yourself,

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,210
do whatever you need to do
to make sure that both you and Sayu live.

64
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,920
Promise me that.

65
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,220
Light...

66
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,470
What? No way!

67
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,180
I can really go with you?!

68
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,180
Yeah. I may need your eyes this time.

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,060
All right! Thank you!

70
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,900
I have to start packing immediately!

71
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,600
Hmm... I can't decide...

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Say, Light... Which do you like?

73
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,680
If things take a turn for the worse,

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,850
I'll have to kill Sayu.

75
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,150
Dad...

76
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,160
I'll go on ahead to Los Angeles and make preparations.

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,660
Mr. Ide and the rest of you, please come after us.

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,800
We'll take different planes.

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,880
So just in case, Mr. Aizawa will follow
my father and ride the same plane as him.

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,040
All right.

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,620
As a disguise, I'll cut my hair.

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,030
I'm counting on all of you.

83
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,640
Mr. Yagami.

84
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,830
Who are you?
Are you one of the kidnappers?

85
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,750
You will take flight SE333.

86
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,610
I have your ticket.

87
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,750
Hurry. It's Gate 18.

88
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,500
A-All right.

89
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,380
A man has intercepted him at Narita!
Should I arrest him?

90
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,880
Mr. Aizawa, calm down.

91
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,180
It won't do us any good if you arrest him right now.

92
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,780
At any rate, don't lose sight of him.

93
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,850
Oh no!

94
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,190
The Deputy Director got on a different flight
with that man than the one he was supposed to catch.

95
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,220
This is an emergency.

96
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm going to get on as a police officer...

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,690
Calm down, Mr. Aizawa.
I'm going to get on as a police officer...

98
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,210
If you do that, it will be as bad as if you were discovered.

99
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,690
Do you know where it's going?

100
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,700
Uh... Oh...

101
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,700
It's also going to Los Angeles.

102
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,620
Impossible, they even have a plane?

103
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,290
This is bad...

104
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,080
Flight SE333, Flight SE333, can you hear me?!

105
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,720
You are off course!

106
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,310
This is Flight SE333.
I can hear you.

107
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,780
We are not off course.
I changed course.

108
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,150
What are you talking about?
What's wrong? Are you joking?

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,700
This is not a hijacking.

110
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,910
We're just going to take a little detour
and drop off a passenger.

111
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,910
You can track me by radar.
But if you do anything to interfere,

112
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,420
I will not hesitate to crash this plane and take all the passengers with me.

113
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,340
Light... I mean, L.

114
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,130
The plane has gone
on a different course than to Los Angeles.

115
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,220
Someone's going to be dropped off somewhere.
It's probably the Deputy Director.

116
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,680
Damn! What's going on?!

117
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,600
I checked the flight crew ahead of time.

118
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,100
There wasn't anyone suspicious.

119
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,970
The pilot is a veteran of over fifteen years.

120
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,030
There's no problem with the co-pilot, either.

121
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,400
So the enemy is powerful enough
to control even normal people like them.

122
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,070
Damn. I've got no choice.

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,910
Director, this is L. Get me N.

124
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,910
Yes.

125
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,380
N, I think you know the situation.

126
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,920
Can you notify the airlines, police, and military not to make a move yet?

127
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,930
What is L doing?

128
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,180
How unreliable...

129
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,700
All right, L.

130
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,430
We'll figure out where he'll land

131
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,600
and keep surveillance over the area by satellite.

132
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,400
If there's anything else we can do, please let me know.

133
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,690
Take this PDA...

134
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,480
Place the wireless earphone in your ear.

135
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,630
Yagami,

136
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,000
only you can hear my voice.

137
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,840
Listen closely.

138
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,630
I'm the one who kidnapped your daughter.

139
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,840
I have no interest in the lives of you or your daughter.

140
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,100
At this moment, the only thing I want is...

141
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,380
the notebook.

142
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,060
If you do as I say, I won't kill either of you.

143
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,660
I've even arranged an exchange procedure
that you'll be satisfied with.

144
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,450
Do not fight me.

145
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,120
I am trading the killer notebook for my daughter's life,

146
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,870
with an unknown person.
I am trading the killer notebook for my daughter's life,

147
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,120
with an unknown person.

148
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,610
When that time comes,

149
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,130
what should I do?

150
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,850
As a police officer...
As a human being...

151
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,280
As a parent...

152
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920
L,

153
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,880
we have pinpointed where
they have landed with our satellite cameras.

154
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,510
I'll send you footage of what we are watching.

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,320
Dad...

156
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,340
What's going on?

157
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,770
How is he going to make the exchange there?

158
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,750
You see it, don't you, Yagami?

159
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,120
Enter from there.

160
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,540
Underground, huh?

161
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,960
This is interesting...

162
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,820
Damn. Underground, huh?

163
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,590
That means he predicted that there'd be satellite surveillance.

164
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,470
Now I can't watch him...

165
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,720
It's bulletproof glass.
You understand.

166
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,760
Up until a few years ago,

167
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,000
a certain syndicate used this place to make shady deals.

168
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,340
We've made some modifications.

169
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,310
Slide the notebook through here.

170
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,600
When you slide it in, I'll release this handle.

171
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,240
We'll step back and spin the glass door.

172
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,020
The notebook will be passed this way

173
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,390
and your daughter that way.

174
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,310
If you don't go through with the trade, I'll shoot your daughter from here.

175
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,870
L, do you have a plan?

176
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,540
Or do you really think it's all right to let the notebook fall
into the hands of someone you don't know?

177
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,710
Y462, begin.

178
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,590
Now open the notebook
and slide it into the slot in the glass door

179
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,390
to the left.

180
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,460
Damn. I'm being set back even further.

181
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,490
I've just arrived in L.A.

182
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,810
I'm not in any situation to be giving orders to the police agencies around the world as L.

183
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,650
At this rate, the notebook will...

184
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,960
Light, what's wrong?

185
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,060
Are you all right? You're pale...

186
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,070
Misa, shut up and just do as I say!

187
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,750
I want you to take more care than usual
in killing the criminals in Japan.

188
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,360
He's investigating Kira.

189
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,670
You know something bad will happen
if the punishing gets delayed, don't you?

190
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,380
O-Okay... But who's <i>he</i>?

191
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,850
Just do as I say!

192
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,660
You're just taking out your anger on her.

193
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,690
I can still make it.

194
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,690
At this rate, is my only option to kill Sayu?

195
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,280
Now then, I shall test the notebook.

196
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,940
Test?! You're going to kill someone?!

197
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,420
That's...

198
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,190
Hey, hey...

199
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,950
We can't trade without testing it out.

200
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,950
Do you want your daughter to die?

201
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,930
It's no good!

202
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,720
Only the police know about this case.

203
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,680
I can't blame Sayu's death on Kira.

204
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
What's wrong?! Are you all right, Miller?!

205
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,110
That's what you get when you steal and sell our drugs behind my back.

206
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,990
He was a worthless guy,
but this is the first time he's been useful.

207
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,160
Y462, the target is dead.

208
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,160
It seems the notebook is real.

209
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,680
Now let go.

210
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,210
We'll exchange it for your daughter.

211
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,720
<i>Sayu... Dad...</i>

212
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,850
Oh, they've been saved.

213
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,100
The perpetrator is headed for a helicopter.

214
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,480
We can assume that's his means of escape.

215
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,400
This means that the notebook was definitely exchanged.

216
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,360
I still don't know what I'm going to do afterwards.

217
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,370
Follow their helicopter the best you can until it lands.

218
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,290
Don't let it out of your satellite's view.

219
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,020
That's easier said than done.

220
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,290
All right. I'll try my best.

221
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,220
It's no good. We've been tricked, L.

222
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,260
A missile?!

223
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,230
Whoa!

224
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,230
That's one that can't be tracked by radar.

225
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,640
The notebook is on a missile?

226
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,200
The missile's been launched!

227
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
The helicopter or the missile?
Which one is the notebook on?

228
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,440
Boss, I'm sure you were watching.

229
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,260
I followed your orders to the letter.

230
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,820
Yeah, good job.

231
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,970
So now my past mistakes will be wiped clean, right?

232
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,970
Yeah. I'll wipe them clean all right...

233
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,350
Do it!

234
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,660
Near, the helicopter has...

235
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,770
I thought so...

236
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,110
This means that the notebook was definitely on the missile!

237
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,990
The missile can't be tracked!

238
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,720
I've completely lost sight of the target.

239
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,070
It won't be difficult to retrieve the missile

240
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,170
if it falls in an unpopulated area.

241
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,340
He should be getting his hands on the notebook right about now.

242
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,550
When he does, I have a good idea of what he'll do first.

243
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,290
L.

244
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,460
Yes?

245
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,660
They got us.

246
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,020
They got you?

247
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,880
Yes.

248
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,890
Most of the members of the SPK

249
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,310
have been killed.

250
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,540
L,

251
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,440
you helplessly handed over the notebook.

252
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,180
N,

253
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,980
are you saying that if you were in command,

254
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,990
you wouldn't have handed it over?

255
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,330
No, with that kind of preparation,

256
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,580
it would have been taken either way.

257
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,460
There's no point in our quarreling.

258
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,500
Let's help each other and tell each other what we know.

259
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,130
I have some idea of whom the culprit may be.

260
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,760
I think the person who is behind this

261
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,060
goes by the name Mello.

262
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,140
The name Mello?

263
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,300
I don't have his photograph, and I don't know his real name.

264
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,730
I only know that until four years ago,

265
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,030
he was at an orphanage
called Wammy's House in Winchester, England.

266
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,360
Wammy's House?

267
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,530
That was the institution Watari established.

268
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,390
I think that Mello is playing a game with me.

269
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,370
To see who can catch the last boss, Kira, the fastest...

270
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,590
Armo Justin...

271
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,510
It's Armonia Justin.

272
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,290
I went to the old man, the king, to report that I lost my notebook,

273
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,020
but when I described what it looked like,

274
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,260
he said that Ryuk said it was his and that he dropped it, and took it.

275
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,070
What should I do in this case?

276
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,160
In this case, you've got to get it back from Ryuk.

277
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,160
I thought so...

278
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,980
So I have to go...

279
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,540
to the Human World, huh?

280
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah, you have to go...

281
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,010
I see...

282
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,770
Please calm down and listen.

283
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,590
On November 10th, at 11:59 p.m.,

284
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,800
all the Mafia will die.

285
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,430
That moment will be your best chance
to retrieve the notebook.
