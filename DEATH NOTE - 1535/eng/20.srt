1
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,770
Let's begin our meeting.

2
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,920
Only seven of the eight are present.

3
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,860
That means that...

4
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,160
They probably killed one of them.

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,830
To further the growth of the Yotsuba Group,

6
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,710
whom should we kill?

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,960
See? It's like I said.

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,540
This is bad.
If this keeps up...

9
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,170
Before that, we have several topics which we should discuss.

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,820
The first is Hatori's death.

11
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,640
That couldn't be helped.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,520
To be honest, I'm relieved that he's dead.

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,300
Kira has clearly shown what'll happen

14
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,330
to whoever tries to leave these meetings.

15
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,320
Yeah...

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,150
I think we all know what Hatori's death means.

17
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,700
Take it to heart.

18
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,330
Next, Eraldo Coil's report...

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,750
One of their partners just died. Is that it?!

20
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,750
Five million dollars just for this report, huh?

21
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,260
He hasn't found anything important about L, like his face and name.

22
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,150
Is this Coil really of any use?

23
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,350
Well, wait.

24
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,100
At the end of this report,

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,360
Coil warns us that we shouldn't take L's existence lightly.

26
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,880
It reads, "If you continue with your current pace of killing,

27
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,030
for Yotsuba's benefit, every week on Fridays and Saturdays,

28
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,030
L could possibly connect you to Kira."

29
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,830
It's impressive that Coil has figured out what we've been doing.

30
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,050
At any rate, we should stop killing on every weekend.

31
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,260
Th-This is amazing.

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,750
It's like they're confessing.

33
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,340
Yeah.

34
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,720
As long as we have this video,
we could probably arrest all seven of them.

35
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,100
This is definitely bad...

36
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,250
Kira isn't very flexible either.

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,310
It would be nice if he killed at various times during the week.

38
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,570
The fact that Coil noticed this makes it dangerous
to continue killing at our current pace.

39
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,860
From now on, we should be even more careful

40
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,490
and make sure nobody ever notices.

41
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,540
Now, on to the main topic.

42
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,630
Whom shall we kill?

43
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,960
We must stop E.L.F. Insurance from expanding their business into the Japanese market.

44
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,150
Yotsuba and many other companies' clients will be swept away.

45
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,470
Agreed.

46
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,240
So, is it all right for these people
from E.L.F. to die by accidental deaths?

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,430
No objections.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,710
What is this?

49
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,650
They're so nonchalant.

50
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,310
Another person is protesting
Yotsuba's plans for the resort development.

51
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,030
His name is Zenzai Santaro,
a member of the Kugisawa Group.

52
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,160
Zenzai suffers from high blood pressure.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Therefore, it is possible to have him die of a stroke at a designated time.

54
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,380
Is this all right?

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,570
No objections.

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,060
Kira... death by accident... death by disease...

57
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,340
designated times of death.

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,640
It's as we thought.

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,170
There's no mistaking it.

60
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,560
No. Unfortunately,

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,260
we can only say that after those people they named die.

62
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:56,850
As long as we continue to monitor what these seven say at their meetings,

63
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,080
their actions, and whether the people they name die,

64
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,510
we'll definitely catch Kira.

65
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,240
Ryuzaki!

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,480
Ryuzaki!
Ryuzaki!

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,870
What is it?
Both of you in unison...

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,730
I can't go along with your idea!

69
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,890
It's wrong!

70
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,080
Here it comes...

71
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,050
You seem to plan on catching Kira
by allowing these seven to continue to kill,

72
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,710
but I can't let them!

73
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,710
That's right. It's clear as day
that these seven are committing murder!

74
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,510
Can't we prove it's them from Matsuda's testimony and this footage?

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,470
This is problematic.

76
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,670
If we catch them now,

77
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,900
everything we've done will have been in vain.

78
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,650
So the E.L.F. will be three weeks later.

79
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,780
We'll ask Kira to have Zenzai killed this weekend.

80
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,600
How about it?

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,650
No objections.

82
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,910
If it's this weekend, there's not much time left!

83
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,210
Light, you know the cell phone numbers of those seven, right?

84
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,410
Yeah.

85
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,150
Any one of them will do.

86
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,130
I'm going to call one of those seven and stop the killing!

87
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,260
Please wait.

88
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,130
If we do that just three days

89
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,720
after Aiber's made contact with them, we'll arouse suspicion that our investigation is catching up to them.

90
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,700
It's also highly likely

91
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,270
that we won't be able to figure out who Kira is.

92
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,200
We've come this far, but we'd have to go back to square one.

93
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,070
In order to catch Kira,

94
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,950
we need proof.

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,650
Ryuzaki.

96
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,690
If Kira is among these seven,

97
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,960
isn't it fair to assume that if we call one of them,

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,090
there's a one-in-seven chance that that person is Kira?

99
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,370
At most, I would think there's two of them.

100
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,510
So it's two out of seven...

101
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,220
If we're prepared to let them know
that the investigation is catching up to them,

102
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,470
then let's risk it on those odds.

103
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm going to borrow the name "L," Ryuzaki.

104
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,120
From the looks of it,

105
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,980
the one who seems the least likely to be Kira and who carries some weight on the board is...

106
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,320
Ooi!
Namikawa.

107
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,820
If you're going to make a call, use this phone.

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,300
It can't be traced or tapped.

109
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,790
I really think it would be faster if we killed
the executives of our rival companies one by one.

110
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,790
That would be going a bit far.

111
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,500
Let's kill them and split their stocks.

112
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,860
You're the V.P. of Yotsuba Group's Sales Department One,

113
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,630
Namikawa Reiji, aren't you?

114
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,820
Yes. What about it?

115
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,010
Listen and respond as you see fit.

116
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,610
I am L.

117
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,870
I have cameras and wiretaps planted in that meeting room

118
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,780
and I'm recording footage of your entire meeting.

119
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,060
The opening topic was Hatori's death.

120
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,780
Now, you're debating whom to kill.

121
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,030
Isn't that right?

122
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,790
He's been watching everything.

123
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,760
If you aren't Kira,

124
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,290
or if you aren't someone who can contact Kira directly,

125
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,090
then let's make a deal.

126
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,290
A deal?!

127
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,460
Delay the death of E.L.F.'s president and Mr. Zenzai one month.

128
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,760
This shouldn't be difficult for you.

129
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,170
If we want to randomize the deaths, we should just throw darts at a calendar.

130
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,660
Yes, I see...

131
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,100
Yes... Go on...

132
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,680
If you do this,

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
and cooperate with us from now on,

134
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,610
your crime â€“ no,

135
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,920
everyone other than Kira

136
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,340
will not be charged under the belief that they were threatened by Kira into participating in the meetings.

137
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,950
Ah... I see...

138
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,560
My only option is join L.

139
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,280
No, I'll be killed if Kira finds out that I've sided with L.

140
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,580
What should I do?

141
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,180
If you reveal this conversation, it'll cause a panic.

142
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,140
There would be no advantage for you.

143
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
Everyone would be caught.

144
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,300
But my goal is to go one on one against Kira.

145
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,810
Listen...

146
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,730
If L wins against Kira, you'll be acquitted.

147
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,320
If Kira wins against me,
you'll carry on with your luxurious life.

148
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,810
Or you can remain a spectator

149
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,100
and go along with either side.

150
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,940
Whoever wins, L or Kira, it's no loss to you.

151
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,130
However, it would be a loss to you

152
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,080
if you were caught right now.

153
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,160
He already knows the answer I would have given.

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,950
That's all.

155
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,040
Okay. On Monday...

156
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,190
What's wrong, Namikawa?

157
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,730
Who was it?

158
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,380
Nothing, a subordinate of mine
messed up and I'll have to fix it on Monday.

159
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,940
Sorry for interrupting.

160
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,640
Let's get back on topic.

161
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,570
Regarding when we should kill those E.L.F. guys and Zenzai...

162
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,820
How about this?

163
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,440
We give Coil one month to discover L's identity.

164
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,940
If he fails,

165
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,190
we'll be forced to kill them at various dates.

166
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,320
Next, we'll give him another month and repeat the process.

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,700
Once we've dealt with L,
we'll go back to two or three people a week.

168
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,450
In other words, we should make dealing with L our first priority.

169
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,500
I see...

170
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,230
Indeed. If we kill L, we'll be unobstructed.

171
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,250
Until then, we should be careful.

172
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah. It sounds good to me.

173
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,770
Well, we've got to be extremely careful.

174
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,950
Then we'll give Coil one month.

175
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,180
No objections.

176
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,060
L, you're probably satisfied with this.

177
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,740
But we'll still hold these meetings every week.

178
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,610
That's all for now.

179
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,190
It went well.

180
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,400
Yeah...

181
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,200
You really are amazing.

182
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,950
Not only did you delay the killing,

183
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,950
but we may be able to get information from Namikawa.

184
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,610
Furthermore, it looked like something I would do.

185
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,790
You thought of it faster than I did.

186
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,380
At this rate...

187
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,880
If I die,

188
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,420
it's quite possible you would be capable
of succeeding the title of L.

189
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,630
Why are you talking about such morbid things?

190
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,500
We have a month to figure out Kira's identity
and gather evidence against him.

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
The challenge is just beginning.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,140
Yes...

193
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,230
But you're the one who first noticed Yotsuba.

194
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,900
You may be more capable than I am.

195
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,990
You might be able to do it.

196
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,580
If I die...

197
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,580
would you take over for me as L?

198
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,590
If I die, would you take over for me?

199
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,270
As L.

200
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,980
<i>If this is all an act and he is Kira, he's sure to say yes.</i>

201
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,780
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

202
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,360
As long as we're handcuffed, won't we die togetheâ€”

203
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,950
I see...

204
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,340
Ryuzaki...

205
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,950
Sorry, but I'm going to tell everyone what you were thinking.

206
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,620
Ryuzaki thinks that if I'm Kira,

207
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,130
either I'm just pretending I'm not him and putting on an act,

208
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,910
or Kira's power has passed to someone else

209
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,260
and I have no memory that I was Kira.

210
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,220
Those two possibilities.

211
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,420
If it's the first...

212
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,980
If I'm putting on an act, these handcuffs will never come off.

213
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,970
No, even if it were the other possibility, he probably wouldn't take them off.

214
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,020
Ryuzaki thinks that I'm Kira.

215
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,900
Even if that power has been passed to someone else,

216
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,870
he assumes that I would've planned things to have it return to me.

217
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,540
In other words, he doesn't think I was being controlled.

218
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,310
I passed the power on

219
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,380
and planned for it to come back to me once I've been cleared.

220
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,190
Amazing...

221
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,380
It's like you've read my mind.

222
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,470
Ryuzaki's line of reasoning is
"Light will become Kira once he steals L's position."

223
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,350
Correct.

224
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,770
To acquire the position of L

225
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,190
and be able to freely control the police,
while being Kira in secret...

226
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,190
That would be the ultimate.

227
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,890
I could do that...

228
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,410
No, I <i>would</i> do it.

229
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,020
That's what you meant, didn't you?

230
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,740
Yes.

231
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,740
But what about now?

232
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,700
You should know by now that I'm probably not acting.

233
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,800
If you were acting and trying to steal my position,

234
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,050
there's no way that you'd reveal your plan in front of everyone.

235
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,600
Is that what you mean?

236
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,800
Ryuzaki...

237
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,430
Even after I catch the current Kira, do you really think

238
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,390
that I'd become Kira, a murderer?

239
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,360
Do I look like that kind of person?

240
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
I think so.

241
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,930
You look it.

242
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,160
A-Again?

243
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,520
Okay! Once is enough!

244
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,500
Let's just leave it as a draw!

245
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,520
I-I guess so.

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,010
At any rate, we have to catch the Kira before us.

247
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,030
As long as I'm handcuffed,
you shouldn't have any complaints.

248
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,220
I suppose so.
We only have a month.

249
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Ryuzaki...

250
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,810
Yes?

251
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,520
If we can use that meeting as evidence against those seven,

252
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,440
won't the murders of criminals stop?

253
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,490
Not again...

254
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,990
Unfortunately, they won't.

255
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,920
They won't?

256
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,700
We're not sure if Kira is among those seven.

257
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,710
If they only have a connection to him,
Kira will simply kill them.

258
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,260
We have to be absolutely sure that Kira is among them,

259
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,430
or there's no point in catching them now.

260
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,920
Even if he is among them,

261
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,260
it's difficult to determine who's Kira right now.

262
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,800
I think it's still too early.

263
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,510
B-But, if you can't say that he's definitely among the seven,

264
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,270
there's still a chance
that the killings will stop if we arrest them.

265
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,350
It's like my dad says.

266
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,650
There's a chance.

267
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,110
Uh...

268
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,780
On second thought, I think I'll go after Kira by myself.

269
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,510
You can use these headquarters,

270
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,180
as will I.

271
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,690
You can do things your way

272
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,580
and arrest them if you wish.

273
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,930
I shall investigate as I wish in my own way.

274
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,690
We'll only get into arguments otherwise.

275
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,520
Let's split, and act separately.

276
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,680
In other words, you only want to figure out who Kira is, huh?

277
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,140
Yes. This case will never be solved if we don't capture him.

278
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,560
I won't say that stopping the deaths of people before us is pointless.

279
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,080
But if we don't find the truth,

280
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,310
Kira will appear again and the number of victims will pile up in the end.

281
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,870
That's why...

282
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,450
I think it's more important to figure out who Kira is.

283
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,070
I'm opposed to arresting those seven.

284
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,350
If you want to do that, then you take responsibility for it.

285
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,880
I will pursue Kira by myself.

286
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,460
We only have one month.

287
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,650
I wonder who will catch him first.

288
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,010
Ryuzaki...

289
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,450
Where are you going?

290
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,850
Amane's room.

291
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,430
Sorry, Light, I know you're on your father's side.

292
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,500
But I can't remove these handcuffs,
so you're going to have to come with me.

293
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,320
Light! Was today a day we could go on a date?

294
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,070
Along with Mr. Ryuzaki...

295
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Misa...

296
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,060
Do you love Light?

297
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,830
Huh?

298
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,410
Y-Yes... very much...

299
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,750
But you also worship Kira.

300
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,210
Yes...

301
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,000
So...

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
Whom would you pick, Light or Kira?

303
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,630
Huh?

304
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,370
Light, of course.

305
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,010
I'm grateful to Kira and wanted to meet him, but that's not love. Light wins by a landslide.

306
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,890
Light wants to catch Kira.

307
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,830
Isn't that right, Light?

308
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,060
Yeah. Of course.

309
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,270
He wants to catch him.
Now what'll you do?

310
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,150
If Light wants to catch him, then I want Light to catch him.

311
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,130
So would you want to help Light
by working with him on the investigation?

312
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,090
R-Ryuzaki!

313
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,780
Yeah! I'll do anything for Light!

314
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,370
Wait a second.
What are you thinking of doing?

315
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,920
Aiber will pose as Eraldo Coil

316
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,820
and tell those seven that he learned Amane Misa might be able to identify L.

317
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,970
And that L brought her in for questioning
because he suspected that she was the Second Kira.

318
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,930
Well, that's true.

319
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,220
If they know that Amane Misa might know L,

320
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,650
they'll have her appear in their commercials

321
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,860
and ask her about various things.

322
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,240
Since Mr. Matsuda's screw up,

323
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,990
there were talks about using her in their commercials.

324
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,340
Go on.

325
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,490
That's no good.

326
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,630
Why?

327
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,570
Because it would subject you to danger.

328
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,440
Huh? You're worried about me?

329
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,330
All right!

330
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,340
But this is nothing if it's for you.

331
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Listen, Misa,

332
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,510
if they know that you might know who L is,

333
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,220
we don't know what means they'll use to get that information out of you.

334
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,070
It's all right.
I won't say anything under any kind of torture.

335
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,520
Yes. That's true...

336
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,980
Besides, Kira can control his victim's actions before death.

337
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,150
There is a good chance that he might try to get her to talk, and kill her.

338
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,930
No, if he kills L, then he won't have any use for her

339
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,460
and Kira would kill Misa to keep her silent.

340
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,160
I wouldn't like that...

341
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,420
Light.

342
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,990
If we win, Misa won't die.

343
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,870
Besides,

344
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,960
as long as we're handcuffed, we share the same fate.

345
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,610
If I die, you'll die too.

346
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,970
In that case, Misa is the one who would grieve the most.

347
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,290
It's either we both die,

348
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,180
or we catch Kira.

349
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,250
Now which will it be?

350
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,180
Catch Kira!
I wouldn't be able to live in a world without Light.

351
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,410
Yes, that's correct.

352
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,270
Hey, Ryuzaki, that's messed up.

353
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,460
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

354
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,280
Besides, Amane Misa's...

355
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
bravery and love for you...

356
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
have no equal.

357
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
R-Ryuzaki...

358
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,970
I think I've misunderstood you all this time.

359
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,580
I called you a pervert and stuff.

360
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,180
You really <i>do</i> understand me!

361
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,190
Yes. Misa is the perfect, most worthy woman for Light.

362
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,220
Yay!

363
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,440
Thank you, Ryuzaki.

364
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,220
I could fall in love with you, you know.

365
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,250
Uh... That's a little...

366
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,940
How about being friends, Ryuzaki?

367
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,440
Sure.

368
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,400
I've made another friend.

369
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,230
Yeah. All of Light's friends are my friends.

370
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,310
Let's all be friends!

371
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,870
And I won't ever betray any of my friends.

372
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,910
With our powers combined, let's arrest Kira!

373
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,500
No, but...

374
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,920
Yagami is taking a different investigative approach
from us and will be working with his father and the others.

375
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,550
You and I will be together, Misa.

376
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,330
Huh? What's with that?

377
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,090
That's dirty, Ryuzaki.

378
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,010
Now my only choice is to join your investigatioâ€”

379
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,530
No, that's quite all right.

380
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,600
What are you talking about?
Light will be joining us!

381
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
No, it's not like that...

382
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm opposed to this investigation.

383
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
It's too dangerous for you.

384
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
Light...

385
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,480
Thank you for thinking about me.

386
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,200
But let me do this.
I want to be of use to you.

387
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,660
Not only that, but I want you to love me even more.

388
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,450
Besides that,

389
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,770
I would gladly die for you.

390
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,960
Arresting seven people in this situation is difficult.

391
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,760
Mogi, Matsuda, do you have any good ideas?

392
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,860
Well, I <i>am</i> an actress.

393
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,170
Director Nishinaka, Light, the others...

394
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,250
And now even the Shinigami's asking me to act!

395
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,670
This is a lot of work.

396
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,670
It looks like I might be in a big commercial.

397
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,710
I'm so popular!
