1
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,320
The Second L, and the one
whom I think is Kira, is Yagami Light.

2
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,740
Good evening.
This is Takada Kiyomi.

3
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,530
Kira's words, which I am about to tell you now,
are to become the law of this world.

4
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,200
About our investigation...

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,040
I think we should incorporate Takada Kiyomi from now on.

6
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,960
Sorry.

7
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,960
Kira...

8
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,710
Remove the wiretaps?

9
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,380
It can't be helped...

10
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,110
Listen, Kiyomi...

11
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm Kira.

12
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,890
Yagami is... Kira.

13
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,800
All the pieces are set.

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,730
Now that things have gone this far,
it's my turn to head to Japan.

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,980
Commander Rester.

16
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,940
Yes.

17
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,990
Can you return to New York now?

18
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,890
Now?

19
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,870
I've decided to go to Japan.

20
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,370
Does that mean that I'll be standing by
in New York while you're gone?

21
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,520
No.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Then why do I have to return to New York?

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,000
I've never been on an airplane by myself.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,860
I want you to return now, and come with me to Japan.

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,930
All right.

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,440
As we expected, Yoshida Productions and NHN jumped at the chance.

27
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,530
The Great Misa-Misa Comeback Plan!

28
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,250
It's difficult to enter NHN right now,

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,410
but this will allow us to do it without looking suspicious.

30
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,950
Yes. Mogi can go as her manager.

31
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,450
We definitely want someone who can freely enter NHN.

32
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,960
I'll also investigate through Takada.

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,130
This is Near. Give me L.

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,510
This is L. What do you want?

35
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm going to arrest Kira,

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,430
and I'm here in Japan.

37
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,260
He's in Japan?

38
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,930
Why is he taking the time to tell me that?

39
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,640
L,

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,310
you've contacted Takada and are investigating Kira, right?

41
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,690
Yes. I'm investigating her myself.

42
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,670
I thought so.

43
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,520
Right now, it's a given that we must investigate

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,120
NHN's Takada Kiyomi if we want to find Kira.

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,330
So, tell Takada that

46
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,340
SPK members have entered Japan in order to arrest Kira.

47
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,380
Why?

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,170
In order to lure Kira out.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,580
I also want you to add this:

50
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,350
there are only four members of the SPK, including myself.

51
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,100
Kira won't run away.

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,350
He'll definitely try to kill us.

53
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,860
We're...

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,860
going to use that to beat him at his own game.

55
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,940
Beat me at my own game, huh?

56
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,880
Fine, Near...

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,790
I'll accept your challenge!

58
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm in Japan.

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,580
I'm also in Japan.

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,170
Then we may meet face-to-face soon.

61
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,260
You're right.

62
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,430
That will be something to look forward to.

63
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,680
Yes.

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,890
We'll bring this business with Kira to an end once and for all.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,540
Definitely.

66
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,020
Come to think of it, since the beginning...

67
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,690
this has been a one-on-one battle against L.

68
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,660
Only now, it's shifted to someone who's influenced by L.

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,830
Fine, Near. I'll come out if you're coming out.

70
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,290
When we meet,

71
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,840
we'll see who's more prepared and who can surpass the other.

72
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,400
When that happens, the battle will end.

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,880
That's when I'll begin my reign at the top!

74
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,300
First, we have to figure out our current situation.

75
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,680
L is Light Yagami.

76
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,850
And Kira...

77
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,810
Let's assume that there is an L-Kira.

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,980
And there's another.

79
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,440
X-Kira. He holds the notebook and is using it.

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,450
Judging by X-Kira's killings,
he definitely has the Shinigami eyes.

81
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,790
L-Kira and X-Kira plan to communicate through Takada.

82
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:03,090
So I believe there are approximately two ways to win against Kira.

83
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,800
Our first option...

84
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,300
is to kill L-Kira and X-Kira and take the notebook.

85
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,220
But we will never resort to this method.

86
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,430
Why not?

87
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,230
That is not how we do things.

88
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,770
We?

89
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,340
That's right.

90
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,360
Killing people and getting ex post-facto justification

91
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,890
just by the fact that the killings have stopped...

92
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,650
That's not the way that L and I do things.

93
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,640
L wouldn't be able to rest.

94
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,370
There would be no meaning
to entrusting this case to his successors.

95
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,850
Takada, it's become well known that you receive an enormous amount of fan mail every day.

96
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,560
Yes. I've heard it's about an average of 200 letters a day.

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,600
200 letters a day... I'm kind of jealous.

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,190
I don't even have time to read them.

99
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,320
With just audio and no video, it's quite boring.
I don't even have time to read them.

100
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,200
I think you should look through them
even if they're fan letters.

101
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,330
You're right.

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,050
Keep calm when you read the following note.

103
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,340
Make sure not to let the people listening to this conversation detect your surprise.

104
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,900
The SPK has started to move.

105
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,640
For your safety, you should not only accept messages,

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,730
but make demands to Kira as well.

107
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh, Light has moved on to the main topic.

108
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,360
You shouldn't remain just a representative.

109
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,700
Why don't you reach out to Kira?

110
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,890
There's a different job that T must to do.

111
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,790
In order to create the perfect world for Kira,

112
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,290
I want you to punish as Kira.

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,470
It's all right.

114
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,800
You'll do it well...

115
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,200
If you do, you can give information to Kira

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,470
that you don't want the SPK to know.

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,940
All right. I'll do it.

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,960
We did it.

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,990
As I expected of Light. He's good.

120
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,370
Delete. Delete.

121
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,170
Delete.

122
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,970
Takada Kiyomi...

123
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,290
Yes?

124
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,700
Here's your message.

125
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,110
Send me a fan letter that I can tell is from you.

126
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,220
Place within it... five blank notebook pages.

127
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,370
Continue killing as usual until I receive them.

128
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,230
What about after you receive them?

129
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,180
Continue killing using a fake notebook.

130
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,380
A fake?

131
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,110
Yes.

132
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,040
Make a notebook that looks
as close to the original as possible,

133
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,990
and act as if you're killing using the fake.

134
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,000
I understand.

135
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,770
God, what are you doing?

136
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,870
No, there's no need to question Him.

137
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,920
God is absolute.

138
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,890
My job is to do as God wishes.

139
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,390
What is this show?

140
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,690
It's the program after <i>Kira's Kingdom</i>.

141
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,740
They're as unscrupulous as always.

142
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:11,210
Today, Miss Takada will introduce her four female bodyguards
who have passed a rigorous screening process.

143
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,720
The 22nd Karate Title Champion, Ooyama Tatsumi.

144
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,140
Former CIA agent Hal Lidner.

145
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,610
If there's an SPK member among these people,

146
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,430
it would have to be Hal Lidner.

147
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,020
Near is also trying to investigate Takada.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,640
A phantom killer has stabbed six people
in Shinjuku's busy quarters.

149
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,330
Who would I choose to be X-Kira?

150
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,030
There has been another slaying.

151
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,630
There is nothing more important.

152
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:48,910
Children are to be taught about Kira's existence and teachings as mandatory education.

153
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,420
Takada was chosen because she is a Kira-worshiper.

154
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,840
X-Kira is someone who knows that Takada is a Kira-worshiper.

155
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,350
Someone who has a close, intimate relationship with Takada.

156
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,330
Kira will not forgive any small crime.

157
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,100
From now on,

158
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,270
assume that any living person is a target.

159
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,790
I'd like to hear Kira's voice and thoughts once more.

160
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,740
I think that following Kira's teachings exactly as ordered

161
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,050
is the quickest path to world peace.

162
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,570
Reconstruction of Japan
Thinking about the
21st-Century Discussion

163
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,260
I think it is of the utmost importance that young people do everything

164
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,660
in their power to contribute to society from now on.

165
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:46,760
If there are no orders or words from Kira,

166
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:46,810
21st-Century Discussion
Thinking about the
Reconstruction of Japan

167
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,060
If there are no orders or words from Kira,

168
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,400
we need to believe that it's all part of Kira's plan,

169
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,980
and make our own decisions and take action.

170
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,760
L-Kira is Yagami Light.

171
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,520
Kira's orders. Kira's Kingdom<i>.</i>

172
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,940
It was Mikami Teru's own decision to contact
Takada Kiyomi in order to stop Demegawa's rampage.

173
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,730
...spokesperson. Close since college. Coincidental past. Secret meetings.

174
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,530
...had notebook before our surveillance.

175
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,330
Everything seems to fit.

176
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,750
I've been saying...

177
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,680
Why aren't I the headlining performer?

178
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,400
You said that I was the highlight
of this year's East-West Song Festival.

179
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,260
No, the highlight is the highlight.

180
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,720
But the headlining act is usually a leading figure.

181
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,440
We should take precautions.

182
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,440
<i>Takada Kiyomi...</i>

183
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,450
She sure is stupid. She doesn't know
that Light is just using her for his investigation.

184
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,220
Don't say that.
You'll be killed if you do.

185
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,160
I know. That's why I whispered it.

186
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,500
Hey!

187
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,380
She snickered at me!

188
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm going to kick her ass!

189
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,630
Don't!

190
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,450
What were you trying to do?

191
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,060
What was I doing?
What about <i>you</i>, lady?

192
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,900
Lidner, she's a good friend of mine.

193
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,400
Please don't be rough with her.

194
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,490
Understood, Miss Takada.

195
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,950
I'm very sorry.

196
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,530
M-Misa-Misa!

197
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,180
Are you all right?

198
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,910
That was so frustrating!

199
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,420
L, if Mr. Aizawa is there,

200
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,420
may I talk to him?

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,430
Near, this is Aizawa. What is it?

202
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:54,430
Do you videotape and wiretap L and Takada's meetings?

203
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,340
No, we only have wiretaps now.

204
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,560
I see. Only wiretaps now.

205
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,150
Thank you very much.

206
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,940
If it's only wiretaps,

207
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,490
then we can assume that L-Kira and X-Kira are contacting each other through Takada.

208
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,500
If that's the case, then Lidner is in increasing danger.

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I know.

210
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,360
What's important is for L to turn his attention to Lidner and Takada.

211
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,010
We'll investigate Mikami while his attention is on them.

212
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,800
How are things, Gevanni?

213
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,640
About Mikami... It's strangely easy to shadow him.

214
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,640
He doesn't try to hide and has been living normally
in the same place for the past four years.

215
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,140
He's prosecuting people enthusiastically at his job.

216
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,650
I don't think that he can be X-Kira.

217
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,280
No. There is a high possibility that Mikami is X-Kira.

218
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,660
Please be careful.

219
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,680
Don't enter his room yet.
Just keep watch over him.

220
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,660
Got it.

221
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,320
Jeez. How many meetings do I have to attend with NHN?

222
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,400
And how many times have only I been told,
"Be careful about what you say"?

223
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,510
What's with that?

224
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,290
Yes. I'll ask her.
What's with that?

225
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,340
Yes. I'll ask her.

226
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:16,220
Misa-Misa. Takada is asking
if you would like to have dinner with her.

227
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,470
Huh?

228
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,650
<i>That Kiyomi... What does she want?</i>

229
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,640
That's fine.

230
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,360
The Song Festival emcee and the main headliner
should have dinner together at least once.

231
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,230
Tell her, "Okay."

232
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,370
Hello?

233
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,740
Miss Takada, she agreed.

234
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,080
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

235
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,100
Lidner, book a nice private room.

236
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,960
Also,

237
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,420
I would like you to attend as well.

238
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,420
Okay.

239
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,410
Miss Amane, I'm sorry for keeping you out so late.

240
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,200
It just had to be after News 9 finished.

241
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,410
I don't mind.
I'm a night owl anyway.

242
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
So what do you want?

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,540
It's hard for me to say if you ask,

244
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,390
but your boyfriend seems busy.
Do you still see him?

245
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,510
Why that... She knows that she can see him, but I can't.

246
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,940
She's such a...

247
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,200
I do. He's a lot more affectionate than he looks.

248
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,450
He clings onto me so much
as soon as he comes home every night!

249
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,580
I see. You're doing well.

250
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,890
Thank goodness.

251
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,790
Also, since you're the emcee,
I wanted to tell you this in advance:

252
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,130
I'm going to announce my engagement to him at the Music Festival.

253
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,070
Does he know?

254
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,140
Of course.
It's an engagement,

255
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
I can't do it by myself.

256
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,440
He promised me more than a month ago.

257
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,360
Don't you think it would make things more exciting
if I announced it at the Music Festival, Miss Emcee?

258
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,700
I guess so.

259
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,830
It would be great if you could.

260
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,540
What do you mean, "if I could"?!

261
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,290
You're not going to let me?

262
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,920
Or are you...

263
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,920
going to have Kira kill me?

264
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,380
Of course not.
Only Kira decides whom to punish.

265
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm not involved.
I think of you as a friend.

266
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,390
Don't say such sad things.

267
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,520
I don't have any intention of killing anyone, no matter how horrible they may be.

268
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,240
Well, whatever.
I used to like Kira as well,

269
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,820
but Light's going to catch him soon enough.

270
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,210
When he's caught, nothing good will happen to him.

271
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,830
And you'll probably get...

272
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,080
executed.

273
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,590
Miss Takada!

274
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,310
Are you all right?

275
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,490
Listen, Kiyomi...

276
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm Kira.

277
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,610
With me,

278
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,150
you're going to become the goddess of the new world.
you're going to become the goddess of the new world.

279
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,420
Miss Amane.

280
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,070
Yes?

281
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,200
That was unpleasant.

282
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,160
Well, the same goes for you!

283
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
I should have waited to invite you to dinner

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,080
until after you had become more mature

285
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,140
and learned some manners.

286
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,170
Oh my...

287
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,260
I'm older than you are, little Kiyomi.

288
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,850
Besides, doesn't leaving the table
over something like this make you the more childish one?

289
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,410
Mochi!

290
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,930
Thanks for waiting! How are you?

291
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,890
A-Are you all right?

292
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,910
Of course. I won!

293
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,760
You won?

294
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,500
Yeah. It was a cinch!

295
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,780
About tonight's conversation between Takada and Amane...

296
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,990
I could only assume that they were fighting over

297
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,500
which one was Yagami Light's girlfriend.

298
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,540
Near...

299
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,480
All that I can say from this is...

300
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,810
Yagami Light is popular.

301
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,480
Takada and Amane adore Yagami Light.

302
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,350
Near, take this seriously!

303
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,150
It's a problem if they seriously like him.

304
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,910
They won't easily betray him.

305
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,030
They're at his beck and call.

306
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,670
Please stop!

307
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,130
What's up with that, lady?

308
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,590
You're wearing such a short skirt even though it's winter.

309
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,030
You were tempting me, weren't you?

310
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,180
S-Someone...

311
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,110
A cell phone?

312
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,440
Mikami has taken out a notebook.

313
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,490
Delete.

314
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,330
He's writing in it.
Could that be it?

315
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,740
Mikami's getting off.

316
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,080
Mikami is talking to himself!

317
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,380
He seems to have reacted to the scrap of paper at his feet.

318
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,500
He's entered the gym.
I'm sneaking into the locker room.

319
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,630
I've opened his bag lock!

320
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,680
I'm going to touch the notebook!
