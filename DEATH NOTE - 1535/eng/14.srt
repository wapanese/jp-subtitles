1
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,090
I understand.

2
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,400
I can't be your boyfriend, but I can act like I am.

3
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you...

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,910
I'll try hard to make you love me.

5
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,440
I'll have her meet L to find out his name

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,400
and eliminate the entire task force headquarters.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
I'll kill her afterwards.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,490
That's right.

9
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,650
She's the only person who knows Kira's identity.

10
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,800
I can't let her live for long.

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,100
So you'll just act like my boyfriend, huh?
That's good enough to start with.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,240
So then,

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,440
could you show me your Shinigami?

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,450
I suppose it's necessary to make her trust me.

15
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,820
Yeah. All right.

16
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,860
Could you turn around?

17
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,990
Okay.

18
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,290
You can face me now.

19
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,040
Okay.

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,880
Hi!

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
Wow!

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,690
He's a completely different type of Shinigami from Rem, isn't he?

23
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,930
I already know your name, Ryuk.

24
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,220
Pleased to meet you!

25
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,560
Yeah, pleased to meet you.

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,080
Oh yeah, Light, do you know?

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,900
How to kill a Shinigami?

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,980
You're already calling me by my first name?

29
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,110
Then could I call you "Knight" instead?

30
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,120
Because you're like my knight in shining armor!

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,610
Light is fine.

32
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,990
Are you planning to check all the videos of Aoyama on the 22nd by yourself?

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,770
Yes. It is very likely that Kira and the Second Kira made contact with each other there on that day.

34
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,000
I want to check them all.

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,060
Also, Mr. Yagami...

36
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,880
Yes?

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,300
I would like Mr. Mogi to keep watch over Light's activities.

38
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,050
Light's activities?

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,980
In the event that Light is Kira,

40
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,860
the Second Kira might try to contact him.

41
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,980
I understand.

42
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,760
So when does Ryuzaki sleep?

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,400
I saw him sleeping in that exact same position the other day.

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,530
No, I'm serious...

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,250
So when a Shinigami has feelings for a certain person,

46
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,470
and kills someone in order to extend that person's life,

47
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,460
the Shinigami dies, huh?

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes.

49
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,560
I can't imagine there's a Shinigami who would do that.

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,790
That's right.

51
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,880
It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that you would do.

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,100
By the way,

53
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,310
from where have you been sending your tapes to the television stations?

54
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,380
Um... The first time was Osaka.

55
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,540
Then it was Tokyo.

56
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,130
This other time was from Nagano.

57
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,740
I used the Bullet Train so my location couldn't be pinpointed.

58
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,880
So you still have videotapes and envelopes with your friend's fingerprints on them, right?

59
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,740
Yeah.

60
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,660
Then you should dispose of everything used to create the videos.

61
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,170
But only after sending one last video from yet another location tomorrow.

62
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,550
You should say:

63
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,280
"I will stop trying to meet Kira."

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,170
"I'd like to thank the police for their advice."

65
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,810
"But I'm going to help Kira erase evil from the world."

66
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,230
"I'm going to cooperate with him and get his acceptance."

67
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,600
"I will begin by punishing criminals whom Kira hasn't punished yet."

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,230
Also...

69
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,250
"I plan to make this world
a better place by sharing this power

70
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,990
among those who are worthy."

71
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,120
Share the power?

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,820
It's a line to throw off the investigation.

73
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,690
There are already two people with this power.

74
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,420
It's not too far of a stretch that there may be more.

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,880
And if they believe that they'll multiply, it'll create a panic.

76
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,390
Can you do it?

77
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,370
You don't have to ask.
Just tell me to do it.

78
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,180
I'll do whatever you say.

79
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,280
Also, one more important thing.

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,970
Okay!

81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,880
If you're caught by the police...

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,260
If you're arrested as a suspect,

83
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,360
don't say anything about us or the notebook.

84
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,110
There's no proof against you as long as they don't get a hold of the notebook and verify it.

85
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,070
Can you promise me that much?

86
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,740
I promise!

87
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,080
So then, we're officially boyfriend and girlfriend, right?

88
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,580
Well, I guess so.

89
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,410
Now for my conditions.

90
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,170
Go on a date with me at least once a week.

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,900
She really doesn't understand.

92
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,750
That's impossible.

93
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,920
Wh-Why?

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,610
It doesn't seem like you'll understand unless I spell it out for you.

95
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,930
L already suspects that I'm Kira.

96
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,120
What?

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,910
L's pretty amazing...

98
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,440
Everyone's saying that he doesn't understand or that he's stupid.

99
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,580
So he's actually figured out that much.

100
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,940
But thanks to that,

101
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,950
I've also been able to get close to L.

102
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,490
Huh? L and Kira are in contact with each other?

103
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,680
You're both amazing.

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,870
It's making me kind of excited.

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,020
Even if I'm Kira,

106
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,770
L thinks he's safe as long as he hides his name.

107
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,130
He came out and told me he was L in order to directly investigate me.

108
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,510
But he's only positive because there isn't anyone else who could possibly be Kira.

109
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,480
And if I play my cards right, he'll trust me

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,320
and we'll investigate together.

111
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,170
So all you have to do is take me to where L is, right?

112
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,360
It's not that simple.

113
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,820
It was difficult enough for me to get close to him.

114
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,410
Besides,

115
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,170
if suddenly someone close to me steps into the picture,

116
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,780
and the actions of Kira and the Second Kira change,

117
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,290
that person will be suspected of being the Second Kira.

118
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,830
In addition, I'll end up casting more suspicion on myself.

119
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,450
It would be bad if we get together,

120
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,020
and he makes the connection that we're intimate.

121
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,430
Do you understand?

122
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,050
Kind of...

123
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,240
So does that mean we can't go on dates?

124
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,410
We can't meet in public because
you're afraid that he'll suspect you more?

125
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:39,890
No.

126
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,440
We should take some time to think of a plan

127
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,770
so that you can see L
without letting him know you're around.

128
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,650
Yeah.

129
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,420
I'll need you in order to eliminate L.

130
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,680
I want to be able to keep in direct contact with you.

131
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,030
Thank goodness.

132
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,770
So...

133
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,150
In order to make sure that our meetings don't stand out,

134
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,830
I'm going to see other girls.

135
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,760
Huh? What do you mean by that?

136
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,050
You're going to date other girls?

137
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,550
Well, pretty much.

138
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,710
I don't want you to!

139
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,620
If I see you with another girl,

140
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,510
I'll kill her.

141
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,540
Scary...

142
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,620
Listen, Misa sweetie...

143
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,890
Sweetie, huh?

144
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,770
This isn't a game.

145
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,550
We're both risking our lives to change the world, aren't we?

146
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,010
Yeah, but...

147
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,280
I love you... more than I love the world.

148
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
What are you talking about?

149
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,200
I thought your feelings towards me were those of just a Kira admirer.

150
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,950
It's only the first time we've met.

151
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,100
Haven't you ever experienced love at first sight?

152
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,000
Never.

153
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,410
Well, yes, I wanted to meet Kira

154
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,220
out of gratitude and approval, not out of love.

155
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,010
But when I first laid eyes on you, I...

156
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,290
What's with this girl?

157
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,920
You're popular as always.

158
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,260
Then if you love me, you'll obey me.

159
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,980
You told me before that you didn't mind being used

160
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,880
and just earlier, you insisted that you'd do as I say, right?

161
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,330
But I won't allow you to date other girls.

162
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,280
Those are two very different things.

163
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,860
I have both notebooks.

164
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,530
If you won't obey, I'll kill you.

165
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,470
I won't let you do that,

166
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,290
Yagami Light.

167
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,530
If you try to kill her,

168
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,750
I'll write your name in my notebook,

169
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,550
and kill you.

170
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,130
I can see her lifespan.

171
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,770
If she dies before that date,

172
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,140
I'll assume that you killed her.

173
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,040
If you used your notebook to save her,

174
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,030
wouldn't you die?

175
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,500
That's right! Then you'll die!

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,570
That's true.

177
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,360
But I couldn't care less.

178
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,640
Is this Shinigami serious?

179
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,120
Then that means, from now on...

180
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,240
Light?

181
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,400
What is it, Mom?

182
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,240
It's already 11:30.

183
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,030
It's not nice to have a girl stay out so late.

184
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,780
Yeah, you're right.

185
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,340
We lost track of time.

186
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,180
Sorry, Mrs. Yagami.

187
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm sorry for staying so late.

188
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,820
Light, see you later.

189
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah.

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,900
Light, walk her to the station.

191
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,270
It won't be good to walk outside with her now.

192
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,740
Oh!

193
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,270
It's all right!

194
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,360
Good night!

195
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,160
She's cute.

196
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,910
Oh yeah. I was a bit worried at first, but she sure is cute.

197
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,860
I like her!

198
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,370
That Shinigami is going to kill me if I kill the girl?

199
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,170
Does that mean I have to deal with her until she dies?

200
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,610
Not only that,

201
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,480
but I'm forced to protect her

202
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
so she doesn't get caught by the police.

203
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,640
Thanks to you, Light really became my knight.

204
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,060
So it seems.

205
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,270
But don't kill him for real, okay?

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,910
In order to kill a Shinigami,

207
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,250
that Shinigami has to use a Death Note
to save the life of a human

208
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,980
with whom it has fallen in love.

209
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,840
I can't kill Rem

210
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,760
by using a Death Note to control someone to attack Misa.

211
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,060
If Misa's put in danger,

212
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll be suspected first and be killed.

213
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,060
Right now, she's an even bigger nuisance than L is.

214
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,570
Sh-She...

215
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,990
She does something visible like this?

216
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,360
What'll happen if it's discovered that I met with someone like this?

217
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Damn! She's in the way no matter you slice it.

218
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,080
What should I do?

219
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,200
No, besides that,

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,080
I should think of a way to use Misa's eyes to kill L.

221
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,880
If I just eliminate L...

222
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,170
Good morning, Light!

223
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,550
Good morning.

224
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,250
Mom, Sayu,

225
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,350
could you keep Misa a secret from Dad?

226
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,530
All right.

227
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,330
I also want you to keep your lips sealed, not just from Dad,

228
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,270
but from everyone.

229
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,660
She's actually an up-and-coming model,
so it would be problematic if people found out about us.

230
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,560
What? Really?!

231
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,780
No wonder I thought she was cute!

232
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,610
Just what I'd expect for your girlfriend!

233
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,370
I'll keep it a secret... for 5,000 yen.

234
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,400
Silly...

235
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,670
On page 246...

236
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,210
Misa's final message will arrive today.

237
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,990
Instead of going to the television station,

238
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,260
it should be routed to task force headquarters.

239
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,300
I have to go to headquarters in order to see L's reaction.

240
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,760
Yagami... Yagami...

241
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,370
You told me that you'd go out with me, right?

242
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,120
Yeah, I did.

243
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,190
That's why I'm sitting next to you at this lecture.

244
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,940
Okay.

245
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,040
But you don't seem happy at all.

246
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,320
You've been completely inattentive to me.

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,240
That's not true at all.

248
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,360
I was just thinking about how we're going to be the talk of the town.

249
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,210
To think that I'm going out with Takada, the famous Miss To-oh University...

250
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,890
It's obvious, you truly are beautiful.

251
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,780
Please don't think about such things.

252
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,580
I don't like being called Miss Whatever.

253
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,560
Yeah. You're right.

254
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
What's with this woman?
She actually likes it.

255
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,110
Let's just take things at our own pace, Takada.

256
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,980
Okay.

257
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Good evening.

258
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,110
Light,

259
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,030
good timing.

260
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,280
A video message from the Second Kira just arrived.

261
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,360
Another one?

262
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,740
That's fast.

263
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,860
Yes.

264
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,750
I think this is the last one.

265
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,620
Well, take a look at this.

266
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,140
I will not contact Kira.

267
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,590
I'd like to thank the police for their advice.

268
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,720
But I'm going to help Kira erase evil from the world,

269
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
and gain his approval.

270
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,940
I will begin by punishing criminals whom Kira hasn't punished yet.

271
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,160
Also, I will share this power among those who are worthy

272
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,690
and make this world a better place.

273
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,530
Watching this

274
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,530
makes me suspect that Kira and the Second Kira have joined forces.

275
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,410
How so?

276
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,030
Didn't you sense it?

277
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,130
I thought you would get the same impression.

278
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,510
First of all, his attitude towards meeting Kira completely changed.

279
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,500
Also, he now says that he wants to punish criminals

280
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,520
whom Kira didn't punish, in order to gain his approval.

281
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,520
Why didn't he do this before?

282
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,530
He probably never thought that far,

283
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,740
so it's likely that he's working with Kira and was told to say that.

284
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,290
He was also ordered to hide the fact
that they're working together.

285
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,490
I see.

286
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,330
That probably means that Kira isn't thinking about his actions very much.

287
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,290
Indeed.

288
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,240
Did Kira encounter something he couldn't overcome?

289
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,200
He probably was trying to scare us

290
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,830
by making it obvious that he'd recruited the Second Kira.

291
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,090
Their union is really threatening.

292
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,700
But...

293
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,660
this lessens the suspicion I had of Light.

294
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,850
What do you mean, Ryuzaki?

295
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,740
If Light were Kira,

296
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,770
then he wouldn't have sent in a video like this.

297
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,360
He would've tried to threaten me, L, into appearing on television again.

298
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,790
Maintaining the lie that they aren't working together,
he would've placed all the responsibility on the Second Kira.

299
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,410
This is what he'd have him say:

300
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,840
"I stopped because Kira told me to,

301
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,560
but I don't think that warning would come from the real Kira."

302
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,300
"Kira would be happy if L died."

303
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,180
"There's no way he'd stop me."

304
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,380
Ryuzaki...

305
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,220
Yes?

306
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,230
If I were Kira,

307
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,220
I would never do that.

308
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,230
Why?

309
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,690
If you really <i>are</i> L,

310
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,810
then I know your character.

311
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,790
No matter how you were threatened,

312
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,570
you wouldn't be caught dead appearing on TV.

313
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,400
You wouldn't want to die in someone else's place.

314
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,410
You'd think of some way to escape.

315
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,490
You figured it out.

316
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,740
Light,

317
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,140
even hypothetically,

318
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,250
stop saying, "If I were Kira...".
I don't like hearing it.

319
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,150
Oh, sorry, Dad.

320
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,970
But I want to tell Ryuzaki what I think.

321
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,210
I have to pose the scenario hypothetically

322
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,430
in order to solve this case quickly and to clear my name.

323
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,920
Besides, I can talk in that way

324
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,020
precisely <i>because</i> I'm not Kira.

325
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,850
You're right.

326
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,980
You aren't Kira.

327
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,480
No, it would be a problem if you <i>were</i> Kira.

328
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,610
Because you're...

329
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,700
my first friend ever.

330
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,210
Yeah. You're a friend I have much in common with.

331
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,300
Thank you.

332
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,340
I've been lonely since you've been taking breaks from school.

333
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,460
I'd like to play tennis with you again.

334
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,060
Yes. By all means.

335
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,310
Friends?

336
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,010
Friends, huh?

337
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,490
Aren't you glad, Light?

338
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,040
That damned Ryuzaki...

339
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,860
He immediately noticed the connection between Kira and the Second Kira.

340
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,110
I've got to eliminate him quickly.

341
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,160
Oh really?

342
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,330
This makes it all the more dangerous for me to see Misa.

343
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,130
Light!

344
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,010
I just couldn't wait two weeks!

345
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,000
I was just about to go to your house!

346
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,770
This is the first time I've really wanted to hit a woman.

347
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,620
I-I just wanted to see you so badly...

348
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,840
Well...

349
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,330
Come over to my house.

350
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,650
Okay!

351
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,910
Another girl?

352
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,160
Welcome, Misa!
Welcome, Misa!

353
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,330
I saw you in a whole bunch of magazines!

354
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,920
Welcome.

355
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,620
Sorry for the intrusion.

356
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,960
Mom, please get some tea.

357
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,690
Rem.

358
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,550
You're Misa's ally, aren't you?

359
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,670
Yeah.

360
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,090
I've watched her many times from the Shinigami Realm.

361
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,400
I've developed a bit of affection for her.

362
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,560
Affection, even though you're a Shinigami?

363
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,040
You don't seem to like that

364
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,570
I said I'd kill you if you tried to kill her.

365
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,720
Does this mean that if Misa's happy,

366
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,910
you'll feel fine?

367
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,560
Well, you could say that.

368
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,260
I just can't bear to see her unhappy.

369
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,750
Misa is...

370
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,500
madly in love with me.

371
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,540
Light...

372
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,830
Misa.

373
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,010
Yes?

374
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,560
Would seeing me happy

375
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,260
make you happy?

376
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,270
Yes.

377
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,300
Then could you ask Rem

378
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,300
to kill L?

379
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,130
Rem wants you to be happy.

380
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,560
If L catches one of us,

381
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,060
we'll both be unhappy.

382
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,240
A Shinigami can't tell a person's name to someone who has a notebook,

383
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,950
but there's no restriction against Rem killing anyone.

384
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,120
Yeah.

385
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,240
If you kill L,

386
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,530
I think I'll be able to love Misa more and I would be grateful to you.

387
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,130
Above all, it'll make us both happy.

388
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,790
Rem...

389
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,930
I want Light to love me.

390
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,010
Light and I will be grateful.

391
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,590
That would be my happiness.

392
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,310
Fine.

393
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,980
Fine, Yagami Light.

394
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,130
I despise you.

395
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,530
Even if this ends up lengthening your lifespan,

396
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,660
I won't die.

397
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,910
I'll kill L for you.

398
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,290
L is a human who means nothing to me.

399
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,000
All right!

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,170
Thank you, Rem!

401
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,000
That's my Rem!

402
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,510
L will die...

403
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,880
this easily?

404
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,380
That's right.

405
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,550
Since Ryuga's revealed that he's L, I must kill him.

406
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,710
This is all a wager now.

407
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,840
Tomorrow will be L'sâ€”

408
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,970
no,

409
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,800
Ryuzaki and Ryuga's date of death!
