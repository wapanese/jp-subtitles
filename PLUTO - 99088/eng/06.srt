1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,882
Hey, mister!

2
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,676
Have a look,
and I'll give you a good price!

3
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,807
Believe it or not, these rugs
were woven by humans, not robots!

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,517
Hey, mister!

5
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,187
These are electronic parts
found on the battlefield!

6
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,772
They're still usable!

7
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>Gesicht, that's enough. Come back!</i>

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>We'll handle all matters
related to Darius XIV's attempted suicide.</i>

9
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,074
<i>The United States of Thracia
is too self-righteous.</i>

10
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>We'll confront them head-on.</i>

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,039
<i>I'm fed up with that president's methods.</i>

12
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,751
<i>Either way, we're concerned about
your physical condition.</i>

13
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,420
<i>Professor Hoffman is worried
that your Zeronium's strength</i>

14
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,006
<i>might have been compromised
by the cannon blast.</i>

15
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,470
Thank you for your concern,
but I'm about to make a break in the case.

16
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,388
<i>What? Are you sure?</i>

17
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,682
<i>So you have an idea
of who's behind all this?</i>

18
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,646
Yes, I think it is
what you humans would call "a hunch."

19
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>"A hunch"? How can a robot have a...</i>

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,736
<i>Huh? Hey, Gesicht. Gesicht!</i>

21
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,745
Are you all right?

22
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,498
Can you stand? Here, grab onto me.

23
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,542
Thank you, mister.

24
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,461
Ever since I got damaged in the war,
my balance has been off.

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,755
I see. Take care of yourself.

26
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,383
Mister, please buy some flowers!

27
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,178
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

28
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:21,141
I take credit cards, you know.
Here's my reader.

29
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,768
I'm only passing through here.

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,813
I'll be leaving soon,
so I have no use for flowers. Bye now.

31
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,356
Mister!

32
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,328
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

33
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,831
No, you're actually right on time.

34
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,000
I am Gesicht of Europol.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,045
I'm Abullah, head of the Republic
of Persia's Ministry of Science.

36
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,179
Something the matter?

37
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:00,930
No.

38
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,475
Oh, I'll have coffee.

39
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,188
You can relax around me. I'm a scientist.

40
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,024
They also have energy drinks here.

41
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,984
I'm fine, sir.

42
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,405
The look on your face tells me

43
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:22,452
you're wondering if I'd prefer
an energy drink myself.

44
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,123
Your identification system
didn't malfunction.

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,003
I lost most of my body in the last war.

46
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,339
Please excuse my rudeness.

47
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,885
Not at all.
Thank you for coming all the way here.

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,429
I wanted you to see it.

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,770
<i>I wanted you to see how this country
is starting to rise from the ashes of war.</i>

50
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:55,235
The nation had been reduced to rubble,
but now the bazaars are reopening.

51
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,238
A friend of yours?

52
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,867
No.

53
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,661
I met him earlier.

54
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,872
It is those children I feel pity for.

55
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,416
Our economy is starting to recover,

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,044
but the kids
in the margin of society still suffer.

57
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:19,884
What we must do now
is provide them with a better life.

58
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,220
I'm sure you understand.

59
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,806
I do.

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,017
So, what is it that you wanted to ask me?

61
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,272
Yes, I'll get right to the point
since we don't have much time.

62
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,817
What was your relationship
with Darius XIV?

63
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,696
We got along fine.

64
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,992
To his loyal subjects, he was a kind man.

65
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:50,039
He often talked about turning this desert
into a country of green fields.

66
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,583
Do you mean "fields of flowers"?

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,295
Yes.

68
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,923
Do you know a person named Goji?

69
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,217
Can't say that I do.

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,387
There's no way the head
of the Ministry of Science doesn't know.

71
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,850
I've heard that it was a genius scientist
named Goji who enabled you to build

72
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,769
such an advanced robot army
during Darius's reign.

73
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
Only a rumor, no?

74
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,817
That name does show up in the report
by the Bora Inquiry Commission,

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,070
but his existence was never confirmed,

76
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,992
as evidenced by the fact
that I don't know such a person.

77
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,455
And what about the Tenma model AI
that was imported here?

78
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,707
Tenma model.

79
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,086
Since we're discussing rumors,
let me tell you a story that I've heard.

80
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,423
Dr. Tenma and this genius scientist
you mentioned

81
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,217
managed to create
the ultimate artificial intelligence.

82
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,636
The ultimate artificial intelligence.

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,554
Yes.

84
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:52,435
However, said artificial intelligence
was so advanced, the robot didn't wake up.

85
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:57,023
Rumors say the robot is still sleeping
somewhere in Darius's former palace.

86
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,070
Why don't you look for
this marionette yourself?

87
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,031
Oh dear.

88
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm afraid our time is up.
Please forgive me.

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,119
Thank you for your time
from your busy schedule.

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,996
One last question.

91
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,291
Please take a look at this image.

92
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,423
Have you ever seen this man before?

93
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,719
Can't say that I have.

94
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,139
Thank you.

95
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,226
I appreciate your cooperation.

96
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,144
I hope you solve the case soon.

97
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,399
I apologize for my confusion
about whether you were a human or a robot.

98
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,609
No, it's quite all right.

99
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,195
I've experienced it once before

100
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,073
when I met Atom.

101
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,160
I see.

102
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,456
So Atom was that advanced of a robot.

103
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,791
Yes.

104
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,545
But just now, my system
finally identified you as a human.

105
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,674
Because you lied.

106
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,678
You said you've never seen
the man in the field of flowers.

107
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,140
My system determined that to be a lie.

108
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,892
And robots can't lie.

109
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,159
Mister! Please buy some flowers!

110
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,494
You're still here?

111
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,788
Just one is fine. Please?

112
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,458
If you stick too long
to customers like me,

113
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,543
your boss will get mad.

114
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,255
Hey, mister.

115
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,549
How about a good luck charm?

116
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:52,388
Keep this on you, and it will help you
find the answers to life's problems.

117
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,267
This is a charm of Goji,
the sage of the sands.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,603
Goji?

119
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:03,107
Yes. God gave life to the sand.

120
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:08,404
He's a legendary sage
who turned back to sand

121
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:13,117
after showing the truth of life
to the king of the ancient Uzbek.

122
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,077
The sage of the sands,

123
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,537
Goji...

124
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,792
Artificial intelligence was so advanced,
the robot didn't wake up.

125
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,297
Just one is fine. Please?

126
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,968
Okay, then. Just one.

127
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,428
Thank you!

128
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,180
What is your name?

129
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,389
Muhammad Ali.

130
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,767
That's a great name.

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,436
Do you think I can be great like my name?

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,396
Of course you can.

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,815
I want to be a scholar!

134
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,193
You can be if you study a lot.

135
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,153
Do you think I can be like Sahad?

136
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,030
Sahad?

137
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,325
Yes. You showed a photo of him earlier.

138
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,913
You mean this man?

139
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:03,084
Yes! He studied abroad in the Netherlands
so he could turn this land

140
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,752
into a field of flowers.

141
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,255
He's my hero.

142
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,716
You think I can be like Sahad?

143
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,719
What's wrong?

144
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,388
Oh, it's nothing.

145
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,014
Sure, you can.

146
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,432
Never lose hope.

147
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,142
Hope?

148
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,603
Yes, hope.

149
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,526
Mister!

150
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,779
Will I see you again?

151
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,034
Yes. I'm sure we'll meet again.

152
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,792
Yes, of course! I know Sahad very well.

153
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,502
He used to be one of my lodgers.

154
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,463
There, that room on the third floor.

155
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,050
See those beautiful flowers
on the windowsills?

156
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,845
Sahad planted all of them.

157
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
They're beautiful.

158
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, so even a robot like you can tell.

159
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,269
Sahad was studying botany, right?

160
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,187
Even after so many years,

161
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,316
the flowers he planted
are still going strong.

162
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,775
One time,

163
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,196
I asked him if there were any flowers that
bloomed year-round and never withered.

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,282
Those would be easy
to take care of, right?

165
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,075
And what did he say?

166
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,371
He said that after producing seeds,
flowers ought to wither away.

167
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,624
He's right, I suppose.

168
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,339
Flowers ought to wither away, huh?

169
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,051
Ma'am, do you happen to have
a photo of him?

170
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,764
I'm sure I have one somewhere,
but all my old data is on my old computer.

171
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,975
It must be in storage. I'll take a look.

172
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,435
Come by again later.

173
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,394
Thank you.

174
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,689
But if someone from Europol
is asking about him,

175
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,691
should I be concerned about Sahad?

176
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,151
No, ma'am.

177
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:57,114
Of course not. Someone like him
would never get into trouble.

178
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,492
I mean, Sahad was a truly nice person.

179
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,329
So much so, you'd never be able to tell
he was a robot.

180
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,918
He was an excellent student.

181
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,838
No, excellent isn't the right word.

182
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,382
Passionate.

183
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,843
Yes, almost as if his life depended on it.

184
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,762
Depended on it?

185
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,392
Yes, because Sahad
loved his country above all else.

186
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,979
He was devoted to filling
the Persian desert with flowers.

187
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,025
His research was truly innovative.

188
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,152
One day, he said to me,

189
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,073
"Professor, look how strong
Igor has become."

190
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,116
Igor?

191
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,078
Or another time,
he'd say how Janus is getting sick.

192
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,331
Or how Ishtar is getting better.

193
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,793
They are the names of his tulips.

194
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,964
He named all of his tulips.

195
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,509
He said that they grew better that way.

196
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,679
No offense, but he was a robot.

197
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,474
The most advanced robot in Persia is made
from the best technology available.

198
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,603
And yet, he would say
the most unscientific things.

199
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,938
Unscientific...

200
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,440
I see.

201
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,235
Yes, things for which
there was no substantive basis.

202
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,449
There's something I'd like to show you.

203
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,161
This is it.

204
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,249
A tulip?

205
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,585
Sahad was growing it.

206
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,379
And it continues to bloom
without ever withering.

207
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,757
It never withers?
How many years has it been?

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,216
Three years.

209
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,596
He asked me not to plant it in the ground
until he got back.

210
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:49,143
If he never returns,
we will end up studying this.

211
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,647
You know, it feels as if this tulip
is waiting for him too.

212
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:55,983
Oh dear.

213
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,487
Now I've said something unscientific.

214
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,698
Does this tulip have a name?

215
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,702
Yes, I'm sure there must be one.

216
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,165
Thank you for your business as always.

217
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,128
Anton.

218
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,089
Could you deliver this
to Mr. Van Dyke's shop?

219
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,549
Okay!

220
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,178
He's a hard worker.

221
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,764
He's been a huge help.

222
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,061
Before I came here,
I met a little flower peddler in Persia,

223
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,730
but he wasn't working as happily as that.

224
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,566
Persia. Sahad's country.

225
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,361
I understand he came to this shop often?

226
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
Yes, every day.

227
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,741
He'd help me with the shop
when he had time off from school.

228
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,828
He didn't seem to have friends.

229
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,331
But he would talk to me
about all kinds of things.

230
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,793
Like how he wanted to fill
his homeland with flowers.

231
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,340
Hearing a robot like Sahad
talk about dreams made me happy.

232
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,676
But one day,

233
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,220
something was different about him.

234
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,598
Out of nowhere,

235
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,935
he told me he was going back
to his country to enlist in the army.

236
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,980
I tried to stop him
because someone like him

237
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,692
should never have to become a soldier,
despite how long the war raged on.

238
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,235
And then,

239
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,655
he told me his father died in the war.

240
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,365
His father...

241
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
I couldn't say anything.

242
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,079
Then, with a sad look in his eye,
Sahad said,

243
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,333
"I might end up like him."

244
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,043
Him?

245
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,380
What was the name of that tulip again?

246
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,676
Yes, I heard
that he named all of his tulips.

247
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,094
That's right.

248
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,138
At the research site in Zaandam,

249
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:54,101
he repeated many experiments to develop
a flower that could survive the desert.

250
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,855
A stronger, more resilient flower.

251
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,190
He wanted more and more.

252
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>But then, one day,</i>

253
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,531
<i>Sahad went to the field
to check on his flowers as usual and saw...</i>

254
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,869
<i>just one tulip standing.</i>

255
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,041
All the flowers around it had withered.

256
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,713
I believe the name

257
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,673
of that flower was...

258
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,052
Pluto.

259
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,021
I found the photo of Sahad.

260
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,357
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

261
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,110
No problem. Let's see.
How do I do this again?

262
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,656
Like so.

263
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,241
Oh, that's right.

264
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,495
I ask for photos
when I accept lodger applications.

265
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,788
Ah, here it is.

266
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,001
See? He had such a gentle smile.

267
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,421
This photo has been cropped.

268
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,923
Ah, yes.

269
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:10,010
I think he said it was a photo
taken with his father.

270
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:10,970
His father?

271
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:15,391
Well, since he's a robot, he likely meant
the person who created him...

272
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,725
This man is

273
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,811
Professor Abullah?

274
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,357
His father, who had supposedly died?

275
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,405
Gesicht is getting closer.

276
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,740
Very impressive.

277
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,409
Don't you think so?

278
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,746
His investigative skills are amazing,
but that's not all.

279
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,250
His ability to fulfill missions,
the weaponry he possesses,

280
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,335
and his Zeronium.

281
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:49,717
Gesicht is the most powerful weapon
of mass destruction to date, so to speak.

282
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,845
Pluto may lose.

283
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,304
It's true.

284
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,223
But you know,

285
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,977
there is one good way to kill him.

286
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,146
Shall I tell you?

287
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,648
Well...

288
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,694
From Persia to the Netherlands, huh?

289
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:13,323
As I am a prisoner here,
I can't help but be jealous.

290
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:18,495
But with this body,
I couldn't go anywhere even if I was free.

291
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,209
So, you know who's behind this?

292
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,586
Yes.

293
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,130
Professor Abullah.

294
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,509
<i>He was truly a great scientist.</i>

295
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,054
<i>Dr. Ronald Newton-Howard.</i>

296
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,474
<i>The Photon Energy he developed</i>

297
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,895
<i>will brighten our future
like the rays of God.</i>

298
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,440
<i>His achievements will never be forgotten...</i>

299
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,569
You must be Epsilon.

300
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,783
I never imagined we'd meet like this.

301
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,494
My name is Abullah.

302
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,580
You came all the way
from the Republic of Persia?

303
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,458
It is truly regrettable.

304
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,254
I wish I could have met Dr. Newton-Howard
while he was still alive.

305
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,926
His achievements developing
Photon Energy will go down in history.

306
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
As a Bora Inquiry Commission member,

307
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,139
he helped end dictatorial rule
in the Kingdom of Persia

308
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,141
and restored peace to the country.

309
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,852
To lose someone like that in such a way...

310
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,775
But then, he did leave you behind.

311
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,487
The level of your perfection
amazes me, Epsilon.

312
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,907
You as well, Professor Abullah.

313
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,701
I've heard about you.

314
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,622
How you lost most of your body
in the last war.

315
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,464
It is nothing compared to losing family.

316
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,511
I see. Abullah, huh?

317
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,849
It's also just like you
to have a lack of direct evidence.

318
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,478
But that's not all
you came here to discuss, is it?

319
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,692
Suppose that an ultimate
artificial intelligence exists.

320
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,822
If a robot were equipped with
an artificial intelligence too advanced,

321
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,657
what would happen?

322
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,119
It wouldn't wake up.

323
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,370
And why is that?

324
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,124
Because it would not know what to become.

325
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,794
In order to simulate all
9.9 billion personalities on the planet,

326
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,338
it would take an eternity.

327
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,299
As such, it wouldn't wake up.

328
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,010
Then how could it be woken up?

329
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,975
By introducing extreme emotions to it.

330
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,937
Extreme emotions?

331
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,274
Hatred.

332
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,734
That's right.

333
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,195
Anger.

334
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,446
Yes.

335
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,156
Sorrow.

336
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,532
Correct!

337
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,868
Then, it would wake up.

338
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,622
Now,

339
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,834
what kind of robot
would it turn out to be when it awakened?

340
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,508
It looks like it's about to rain.

341
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,179
Your powers weaken
on a day like this, don't they?

342
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,513
Yes.

343
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,975
Well, you have no need
for such mighty powers anyway.

344
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,270
You refused to participate in that war,

345
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,564
and you were right to do so.

346
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,025
There is no such thing as a just war.

347
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,404
You lost your family in the war.

348
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:44,201
My wife, my children...
The war took everything from me.

349
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,210
Tears.

350
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,758
The rain has started.

351
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,177
And it appears the funeral is over.

352
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,637
Yes.

353
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,391
Epsilon.

354
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,852
What is most important to you?

355
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,032
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!
The funeral is over, so let's go home!

356
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,284
Okay, Epsilon!

357
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,493
Epsilon!

358
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,911
We saw a squirrel over there!

359
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,746
- Really?
- I found an acorn!

360
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,123
You can have it, Epsilon!

361
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,749
How wonderful.

362
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,169
I had heard that you adopted war orphans.

363
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,758
Please take good care of these children.

364
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:47,222
Love these children,
for me and the ones that I've lost.

365
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,146
I must attend
the European Robotics Conference.

366
00:21:55,272 --> 00:22:00,277
The restoration of Persia requires that
we create more wonderful robots like you.

367
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,954
Hey, I don't see Wassily.

368
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,872
Yeah!

369
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,333
Wassily!

370
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,835
- Wassily, where are you?
- Wassily!

371
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,794
Oh!

372
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,504
There he is!

373
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,215
Wassily, we're going home.

374
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,511
What's wrong, Wassily?

375
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,805
Bora.

376
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,309
Bora.

377
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,853
It's all right.

378
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,689
This is not a battlefield.
Don't be scared.

379
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,860
Bora.

380
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,571
It will lie.

381
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,700
Once this robot gained consciousness,
it would tell lies.

382
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,454
To others, of course, but also to itself.

383
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,167
You are close to solving this case.

384
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,670
Where is Pluto now?

385
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,549
He must be undergoing maintenance
to tend to the damage he received

386
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,134
in the fight with Hercules.

387
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,178
He's probably back home.

388
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,513
Home?

389
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,182
Sahad's homeland, Persia?

390
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,560
No, Pluto's home.

391
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,232
The tulip.

392
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,280
<i>Abullah's whereabouts?</i>

393
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,492
Yes, we must take him
into custody right away.

394
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,702
<i>Don't be ridiculous, Gesicht!</i>

395
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,954
<i>He's a VIP!</i>

396
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,249
It doesn't matter!
I need to know where he is!

397
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,668
<i>And what do you intend to do?</i>

398
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,587
I will go to where Pluto is.

399
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,756
<i>Pluto? Where he is?</i>

400
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,301
The Kingdom of Persia has an agricultural
research facility in the Netherlands.

401
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,430
It's in Zaandam,
on the outskirts of Amsterdam!

402
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,658
<i>Just one tulip standing...</i>

403
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,828
All the flowers around it had withered...

404
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,414
The name of that flower was

405
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,207
<i>Pluto.</i>

406
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,251
It's close.

407
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:23,879
Pluto...

408
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,386
<i>What a fantastic speech!</i>

409
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,266
You absolutely deserved
that standing ovation, Professor Hoffman.

410
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,393
Thank you very much.

411
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,897
Despite the hardships
you've faced recently,

412
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,859
we truly appreciate you attending
the European Robotics Conference.

413
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,404
Did you find
the security we provided satisfactory?

414
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,325
Yes. Thanks to them,
I was able to carry out an important duty.

415
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,037
Professor Hoffman,
your helicopter is here.

416
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,000
As you can see, these brawny bodyguards
are giving me door-to-door service.

417
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,003
I'll go check the heliport.

418
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,215
No, I'm sure they have
their own security there.

419
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,926
Still, you can never be too careful.

420
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,763
Professor Hoffman, the entire world
of robotic engineering depends on you.

421
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,016
Thank you. Goodbye.

422
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:18,975
Please, take care.

423
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,812
Uh, I need to use the bathroom.

424
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,980
I've checked it.

425
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,233
Then I will be fine on my own.

426
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,919
Well, that was a wonderful speech.

427
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,716
I was especially moved by your remarks
about the potential for Zeronium

428
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,552
to contribute to peace.

429
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,095
And you are...

430
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,181
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Professor Hoffman.

431
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,184
I'm Abullah from the Republic of Persia.

432
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,617
Just a regular power generator
in the basement.

433
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,040
<i>They're faint,
but these electromagnetic waves</i>

434
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,669
<i>are the same as those recorded by Epsilon
during the fight with Hercules.</i>

435
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,462
<i>It's close.</i>

436
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,473
You!

437
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,604
I've always wanted to speak with you.

438
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,232
After all, you're the one
who brought Gesicht into this world.

439
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,400
The pleasure is mine.

440
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,862
If there's anything I can do
to help with the restoration of Persia...

441
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,114
Zeronium is the perfect metal.

442
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,576
Perhaps you could consider
deregulation of Zeronium imports.

443
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,660
Right...

444
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:06,082
Even the culprit who's going around
destroying the most advanced robots

445
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,834
wouldn't win against Gesicht.

446
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,711
I suppose not.

447
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,671
I heard a rumor

448
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,716
that Gesicht was recently damaged
by a cluster cannon.

449
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,137
Oh, yes, you're very well-informed.
But please do not worry.

450
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,805
It wasn't serious.

451
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,891
Wonderful.

452
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,310
Even damage to that degree
will not affect him?

453
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,269
Yes.

454
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,771
I see.

455
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,732
Then, Gesicht has no weaknesses.

456
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,234
No, he does have flaws.

457
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,445
It's just that layers and layers

458
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,614
of advanced control systems
are built into him.

459
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,326
I see. So you're saying
that prevents error?

460
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,786
Error?

461
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,790
Well, he doubts and struggles,
just like we do.

462
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,751
Is that what you meant by "flaws"?

463
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,712
Those systems are the source
of his strengths and flaws.

464
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:57,926
Given his superiority, what would you do
if he were to make an irreparable mistake?

465
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,844
For example...

466
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,973
if he killed someone.

467
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,201
You lot!

468
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,496
What are you protecting?

469
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,916
A robot that kills humans.

470
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,378
There was such a robot once,
was there not?

471
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,797
Brau1589.

472
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,176
Apparently, he described what he did
as an "execution."

473
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,347
The same logic humans use
when they commit murder.

474
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,850
What are you trying to say?

475
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,312
Well, is that not
what the world did to Persia

476
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,525
after you and other Bora Inquiry
Commission members entered the nation?

477
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,029
Please forgive me. I've gone too far.

478
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,117
After all, democracy has taken root
in Persia, thanks to you.

479
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,664
But if a robot did happen to kill a human,

480
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,376
I think that robot should be executed.

481
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,215
If Gesicht ever did such a thing,

482
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,718
what would you do?

483
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,595
That would never happen!

484
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,308
A robot as advanced as Gesicht
could even take his own life.

485
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,935
- Nonsense!
- No.

486
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,731
Perhaps the authorities would erase such
memories from Gesicht before he did so.

487
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,278
Did you do something to him?
His artificial intelligence--

488
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,782
All you need to do
is to maintain him properly.

489
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,325
Director!

490
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,994
What did you do to Gesicht?

491
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,874
Robots' memories can be deleted.

492
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,084
I can't help but envy them.

493
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,880
I wish I could do the same.

494
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,178
<i>Gesicht, this is Europol Headquarters.
Can you hear me?</i>

495
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,846
Yes, I can.

496
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,766
<i>We've located Abullah. He's in DÃ¼sseldorf.</i>

497
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,976
<i>He's attending
the European Robotics Conference.</i>

498
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,646
Understood. Take him into custody
as soon as possible.

499
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,942
<i>The thing is, Professor Hoffman
is also attending that conference.</i>

500
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,859
What?

501
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,611
Professor Hoffman?

502
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,613
Thank you for waiting.

503
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,114
Let us get going, sir.

504
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,540
Is everything okay, sir?

505
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,876
Oh, no, I'm fine.

506
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
It is the same thing.

507
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,257
The same thing.

508
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,134
What the world did to Persia.

509
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,053
They must be executed.

510
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,396
Please confirm Professor Hoffman's safety.

511
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,772
I'll be there soon--

512
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,709
This is Europol!

513
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,627
This building is now on lockdown!

514
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,713
What? What's going on?

515
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,339
Nobody goes in or out!

516
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,759
Stay where you are
until instructed otherwise!

517
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,555
Excuse me! Please take a look
at the elevator monitor!

518
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,102
Professor Hoffman!

519
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,398
The elevator is heading toward
the heliport on the top floor.

520
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,692
Damn it! Get up there now!

521
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,111
None of the other elevators are working!

522
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,279
What?

523
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,407
What the hell is that thing?

524
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:55,038
Aren't you supposed to be
my robot bodyguard?

525
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:59,375
Did something else
hijack your artificial intelligence?

526
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,879
<i>Professor Hoffman, can you hear me?
Please stay calm, and don't--</i>

527
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,385
Are you the one who killed
all those scientists?

528
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,097
You must be executed.

529
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,477
Gesicht. Can you hear me, Gesicht?

530
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,772
<i>Professor Hoffman
has been abducted. Gesicht!</i>

531
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,441
I can hear you.
I'm headed there as soon as I can.

532
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,902
However, right now,

533
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,489
right in front of me is...

534
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:41,584
Is this because of
what the commission did in Persia?

535
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,714
I do feel responsible.
But what would killing me achieve?

536
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,219
Open up! Open the door!

537
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,974
That's your partner.
He's on your side too, isn't he?

538
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,392
I'm opening the door now!

539
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,853
Professor, run!

540
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,825
Horns.

541
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,664
That's how you're going to kill me too?
Just what are you?

542
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,250
Bora...

543
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,085
What?

544
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,548
Bora...

545
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,427
Squad A here.
We're almost at the heliport!

546
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,347
What the hell is with these cockroaches?

547
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,107
Target sighted. He has captured
Professor Hoffman and is on the move.

548
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,068
We do not have a clear shot as it stands.

549
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,030
<i>- Do it anyway.</i>
- What?

550
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,990
It's fine. Take the shot!

551
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,412
But what about Professor Hoffman's safety?

552
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,424
What about the professor?
Is Professor Hoffman safe?

553
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,513
My body is made of Zeronium.

554
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,308
Thermal and magnetic rays
won't work on me!

555
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,980
If you move, I'll shoot!

556
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,106
Freeze!

557
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:42,622
Its combat capabilities plummeted
from 1,200,000 to 5,800.

558
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,126
It buried itself alive, huh?

559
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,630
This is Gesicht!
I have captured the target.

560
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,757
Is Professor Hoffman safe?

561
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,386
What do you want us to do, Captain Becker?

562
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,599
Yes, he's fine.

563
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,018
<i>Destroy the target.</i>

564
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,746
Illusions like this won't work
on my artificial intelligence!

565
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,707
A field of flowers...

566
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,209
- Pluto...
- Huh?

567
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,254
Pluto...

568
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,925
- Pluto!
- No!

569
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,844
You are not Pluto!

570
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:43,474
Pluto!

571
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,018
Your name is Sahad!

572
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,496
Yes. You are Sahad.

573
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,874
Sahad.

574
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,042
Sahad.

575
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,758
Father.

576
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,970
You're alive, Father.

577
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,305
I'm so glad.

578
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,350
I received news that you were
also killed in the airstrike.

579
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:27,935
Thank God.

580
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,103
Yes.

581
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,898
But I've lost everything.

582
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,359
As a robot, I'm sure
that you understand this.

583
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,904
I've lost most of my body.

584
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,114
But more importantly,

585
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,993
my wife, Fatima, my daughter, Lola,

586
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,205
and your robot brother, Murat.

587
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,624
Those barbarians.

588
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,045
They took the family I held precious!

589
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,923
My most beloved treasure!

590
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,091
Father...

591
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,928
Now, all I have is you.

592
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:07,225
You are all I have left, Sahad!

593
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,268
You understand, don't you?

594
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,103
How I feel.

595
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,274
Hatred.

596
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,154
I have a favor to ask of you.

597
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,241
Please save this country.

598
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,621
Do not let them kill
any more of our people.

599
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:35,002
Do not let our people
experience sorrow like I have.

600
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,465
We must take revenge.

601
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,677
This war will soon be over.

602
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,346
Revenge only begets more revenge.

603
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,641
The hatred would never fade away!

604
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,600
That's right.

605
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,521
Hatred never fades.

606
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,613
Let me install your brain
into the strongest of bodies.

607
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,450
The strongest of bodies?

608
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,540
What is this, Father?

609
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,879
I love you, Sahad.

610
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,340
Father...

611
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,094
I love you.

612
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,602
<i>Gesicht!</i>

613
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,188
<i>What are you doing? Shoot it now!</i>

614
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,648
I give my authorization!

615
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,275
<i>Destroy the target!</i>

616
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,740
<i>No.</i>

617
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,159
What did you say?

618
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:52,872
I am not programmed to destroy a robot
that has no intention of attacking.

619
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,540
What the...

620
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,334
Gesicht, listen to me.

621
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,378
You destroy that thing,
and the case is solved.

622
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,338
This is an order.

623
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,380
<i>Take the shot!</i>

624
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,298
I refuse.

625
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,509
Gesicht! How could you say that?

626
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,761
In the past, you've...

627
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,725
Listen, Gesicht.
I'm ordering you once again.

628
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,394
<i>Destroy the target at once, and--</i>

629
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,687
I said no. That's final.

630
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,356
<i>Gesicht!</i>

631
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,737
<i>Captain Becker,</i>

632
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,656
<i>do I have the right to resign?</i>

633
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,574
Huh?

634
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,951
<i>Stop with the nonsense.</i>

635
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,122
<i>You were developed as a robot detective.
You do not have a choice!</i>

636
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,751
Then I'd like to request
a leave of absence for one year.

637
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,919
<i>You what?</i>

638
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,546
I've had enough.

639
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,219
Right?

640
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,974
<i>Is Professor Hoffman safe?</i>

641
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,435
<i>He is safe.</i>

642
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,353
That's a lie.

643
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:03,025
I just accessed the camera
of the Science Forum's heliport.

644
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,361
<i>What is that robot?</i>

645
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,322
<i>The robot that has Professor Hoffman.</i>

646
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,282
It's...

647
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>Captain Becker.</i>

648
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:18,457
You ordered me to fire even though
Professor Hoffman was in such danger.

649
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,961
<i>Gesicht.</i>

650
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,964
<i>Let's make a deal.</i>

651
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,298
Who are you?

652
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,759
<i>Let's exchange hostages.</i>

653
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,971
<i>Release my beloved Pluto.</i>

654
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,556
Who are you?

655
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:39,603
<i>Step away from there,
and I will release Professor Hoffman.</i>

656
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,816
<i>Gesicht!</i>

657
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,026
Do not act without permission!

658
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,950
Gesicht!

659
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,953
<i>Your actions are in violation of</i>

660
00:40:56,036 --> 00:41:00,958
<i>Article 1, Clause 3 and Article 15,
Clause 2 of the Robot Laws,</i>

661
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,710
<i>and you will be penalized severely!</i>

662
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,627
<i>Gesicht!</i>

663
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,049
This is from the heliport.

664
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,595
The robot that had Professor Hoffman
suddenly collapsed!

665
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,681
I've secured the professor!

666
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,029
Sahad.

667
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,702
Your father does not love you.

668
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,212
Are you crying?

669
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,687
Oh, Gesicht.

670
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,398
<i>Hey, Helena. You're still working?</i>

671
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,733
Yes.

672
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,527
But I'm ready for a break soon.

673
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,487
- How about you?
<i>- Right.</i>

674
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:14,949
<i>It's finished.</i>

675
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,408
Really?

676
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,619
<i>Yes. Really.</i>

677
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:23,082
You say that now, but I know you'll be
on your next assignment in no time.

678
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,333
<i>This time is different.</i>

679
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,294
<i>Let's take that trip to Japan
for real this time.</i>

680
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,172
<i>From now on, I will have plenty of time.</i>

681
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:35,261
You sound as if you're going to quit
being a detective.

682
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,308
<i>Shall we apply
for permission to adopt a child?</i>

683
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,147
We've tried before.

684
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,652
<i>Yes, but we couldn't find
a good match for us back then.</i>

685
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,654
<i>Things are different now.</i>

686
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,866
<i>Robotics has advanced,
and the regulations have been relaxed.</i>

687
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,870
I wonder if I'll make a good mother.

688
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,706
<i>Of course you will.</i>

689
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,332
<i>I know it.</i>

690
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,876
- What?
<i>- Um, well...</i>

691
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,631
<i>Besides, if we had children,
you wouldn't feel lonely.</i>

692
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,216
I'm not lonely.

693
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,677
I have you.

694
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,140
<i>We'll talk more when I get home.</i>

695
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,350
Okay. Come home soon.

696
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:24,810
<i>I will.</i>

697
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,323
<i>Professor Hoffman, are you all right?</i>

698
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,576
Yes, I'm all right, Gesicht.

699
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,245
I'm more worried about you.

700
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,663
<i>I'm not injured.</i>

701
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,333
And the monster?
I was told you cornered it.

702
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,544
<i>Yes, it's only a matter of time
until it gets captured.</i>

703
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,214
Good. There's no need for you
to confront it face-to-face again.

704
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,258
Your body is not in optimum condition.

705
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,176
<i>Yes.</i>

706
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,303
Anyhow, now we know who's behind it.

707
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,764
- Just as you said...
<i>- Abullah.</i>

708
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,226
Yes, the robot bodyguard
that attacked me was hijacked by him.

709
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,354
It was all Abullah's doing.

710
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,773
<i>What bothers me is
Professor Ochanomizu's statement.</i>

711
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>He said the true culprit is Dr. Goji.</i>

712
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,653
Goji and Abullah, huh?

713
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,740
For now, leave things to the others.
You must rest.

714
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,700
I hate to repeat myself,

715
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,454
but because of that cluster cannon blast,
your Zeronium body has metal fatigue.

716
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,956
If you experience
another shock like that, then--

717
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,999
<i>Professor Hoffman.</i>

718
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,295
<i>About the dreams
I've been telling you about...</i>

719
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,254
Yes?

720
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,008
<i>I may not have them anymore.</i>

721
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,426
What do you mean?

722
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,430
<i>I'm not sure. I just have a feeling</i>

723
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,434
<i>that I've figured out
the true nature of my dreams.</i>

724
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,021
What? Wait, does that mean
your memory has...

725
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,815
<i>Until next time, Professor.</i>

726
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,650
Wait, Gesicht!

727
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,576
<i>Zaandam Agricultural
Research Facility to base.</i>

728
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,869
<i>Squad D has arrived.</i>

729
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,538
<i>We're heading underground.</i>

730
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,166
<i>Squad F here,
currently doing a search underground.</i>

731
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,503
<i>We're almost at the spot where
Detective Gesicht cornered the target.</i>

732
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,216
<i>The target's combat capabilities
have declined significantly,</i>

733
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,342
<i>but keep your guard up.</i>

734
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,427
<i>Destroy it on sight!</i>

735
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,179
I repeat! Destroy it on sight!

736
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,557
- Director.
- Where's Gesicht?

737
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,809
He's on his way to Amsterdam.

738
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,854
I heard the report.
Contact Gesicht immediately!

739
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,732
Yes, sir. As soon as
things are ready at Zaandam--

740
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,816
Do it right now!

741
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,238
<i>Gesicht, why are you acting on your own
without permission?</i>

742
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:45,200
Not only are you disobeying orders,
you say you want to resign?

743
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,996
<i>And if you can't resign,
you want an extended leave of absence?</i>

744
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,372
<i>I will not allow either!</i>

745
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,125
<i>Your artificial intelligence
is malfunctioning.</i>

746
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:57,629
<i>You must undergo maintenance right away
and then report to the advisory committee.</i>

747
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,715
<i>Are you listening, Gesicht?</i>

748
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:03,177
There's something that must be done
before any of that, isn't there?

749
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,638
Why didn't you punish me?

750
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,563
<i>I committed a crime
deserving of execution.</i>

751
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,149
Why did you erase my memory?

752
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,736
My precious...

753
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,619
Don't you dare cut out, Gesicht!

754
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,329
<i>Gesicht!</i>

755
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,424
You're such a hard worker, Anton,
working so late.

756
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,803
Yes! I'll be done after this delivery.

757
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,596
Hello, Gesicht.

758
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,057
Hello. I'd like
a bouquet of flowers, please.

759
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,226
Of course. Who is it for?

760
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,560
For my wife.

761
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,521
How nice. I'm jealous.

762
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,440
What kind of flowers would she like?

763
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,652
He's alive, you know.

764
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,030
Sahad is alive.

765
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,658
Is it true?

766
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,452
Did he do something wrong?

767
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,664
He didn't do anything bad.

768
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,124
It's not his fault.

769
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,612
Hello, Anton.

770
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,697
We meet again.

771
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,373
You are

772
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,167
Ali from the bazaar in Persia.

773
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,714
Why are you in Amsterdam?

774
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,682
You can have the whole body for 500 ZEUS.

775
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,229
He walked.

776
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,732
He walked, Gesicht.

777
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,618
You're...

778
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,006
Ali, come here.

779
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,716
No need to be scared.

780
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,470
You heard the gunshot, right?
It's dangerous here.

781
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,263
Come this way.

782
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,728
You know, I have a little one like you.

783
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,649
Ali!

784
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,692
What's wrong, Ali?

785
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,702
<i>Last night, in Amsterdam's Old Town,
a robot agent was murdered.</i>

786
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:01,707
<i>The victim was one of the most
advanced robots in the world, Gesicht.</i>

787
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,418
<i>A deactivated small D-class robot</i>

788
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,045
<i>with a cluster cannon on its arm
collapsed nearby.</i>

789
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,010
<i>Detective Gesicht suffered damage
from the same weapon a few weeks ago,</i>

790
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,972
<i>and he was involved in an intense battle
hours before his death.</i>

791
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,141
<i>His strongest...</i>

792
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,909
Welcome. It's been a long time,
Professor Hoffman.

793
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,621
Since the inquiry commission,
Professor Ochanomizu.

794
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,165
Allow me to introduce you.

795
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,834
I'm Helena, Gesicht's wife.

796
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,758
I don't know what to say.
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

797
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,594
If there's anything I can do to help...

798
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:59,639
Oh, I'm truly grateful
that you invited me here.

799
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:04,770
Gesicht was looking forward
to visiting Japan again together.

800
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,815
In fact, he made reservations
for the trip on the day he died--

801
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,486
Minister Ochanomizu, we should get going
before the media finds us.

802
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:13,904
Ah, yes.

803
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,492
She's put on a brave face.

804
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:23,080
You think Gesicht is another victim
of the series of robot destruction?

805
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,708
Yes, though Europol refuses
to reach a conclusion just yet.

806
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,921
Our lives may still be in danger as well...

807
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,172
Professor Ochanomizu?

808
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,966
It's just as Gesicht said.

809
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,967
What is?

810
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:41,932
He told me that the air in Japan
has a faint trace of soy sauce.

811
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:49,106
KAMINARIMON

812
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,419
She's trying to act like
she's enjoying herself in order to forget.

813
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,005
That is
some extremely sophisticated behavior.

814
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,507
Indeed.

815
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,887
Even though robot memories are permanent
unless you erase them from their AI...

816
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,184
It seems that Europol tampered
with Gesicht's memory.

817
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,811
"Tampered"?

818
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,605
Was it within the standards
of the Robot Laws?

819
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,858
No, as an extrajudicial measure.

820
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,734
That's not good.

821
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,405
I looked into it,
but I couldn't get to the truth.

822
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,160
It's wrong for humans to tamper
with robot memories as they please.

823
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,288
But now, I want...

824
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,293
to erase them for her.

825
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,296
I actually asked her

826
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,007
if she wanted to erase
any parts of her memory.

827
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,468
Then she said to me,

828
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,764
"Please don't erase my memories of him."

829
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,573
Mr. Hoffman, your room is the Maple Room.

830
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,659
Miss Helena, your room is the Pine Room.

831
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,288
This is the room Gesicht booked for us.

832
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,582
Will you be okay alone?

833
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,211
- Yes.
- Right this way, ma'am.

834
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,640
I can find my own way from here.

835
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,308
Very well, ma'am.

836
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,444
You must be Dr. Tenma.

837
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,238
I am.

838
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,405
Do you have it?

839
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,122
Will this help find the culprit?

840
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,666
Of course.

841
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,795
Dr. Tenma.

842
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,590
What's the matter?

843
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,760
I can't process it all.

844
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,262
Process what?

845
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,556
The overwhelming amount of grief.

846
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:34,020
Memories of Gesicht
just get clearer and clearer.

847
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,732
I don't know what to do.

848
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,361
Helena, go ahead and cry.

849
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,741
When things like this happen, humans cry.

850
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:50,996
Yes.

851
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,541
You can start by imitating.

852
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,504
That's right.

853
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,974
Very good.

854
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,559
You're doing great.

855
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,230
It may be an imitation,
but eventually, it becomes the real thing

856
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,607
like it did for me.

857
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,861
You'll be able to truly cry.

858
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,655
These are

859
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,992
real tears.

860
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,372
Atom is dead,

861
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,834
and I am heartbroken too.

862
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,081
