1
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,153
It's no good!

2
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,490
The fire has spread to the forest
in the Third District!

3
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,493
Can't we get more fire helicopters?

4
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,870
At this rate,
all the mountains will be devastated!

5
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,290
Damn it. Why is it spreading so fast?

6
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,138
What happened here?

7
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,481
The trees are all uprooted.

8
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,234
Did something crash?

9
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,986
No, we haven't had any reports like that.

10
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,742
Mont Blanc...

11
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,035
Professor Reinhardt!

12
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,746
My Mont Blanc!

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,289
Professor!

14
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,083
Let me go!

15
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,128
No, Professor!
It's dangerous to get any closer!

16
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,589
His signal is dead.

17
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,175
I've lost contact with Mont Blanc!

18
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,282
What's the matter, Gesicht?

19
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,287
Oh, well,

20
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,955
it's nothing.

21
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,208
You seem tired as of late.

22
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,003
Are you overworking yourself?
Maybe you should take some time off...

23
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,504
I'm fine.

24
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,423
No need to worry.

25
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>As you can see, white smoke
is still rising after two days,</i>

26
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>and scattered fires are visible.</i>

27
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,563
<i>According to accident investigators,</i>

28
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:56,110
<i>the robot assigned to
the Swiss Forestry Service, Mont Blanc,</i>

29
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>was found in pieces
within the confines of this forest fire.</i>

30
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,493
<i>Mont Blanc was
a world-renowned mountain-guide robot</i>

31
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,705
<i>known for befriending scores of children
and mountain climbers alike.</i>

32
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,167
<i>He also poured himself into programming
a tree-clearing strategy</i>

33
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,169
<i>that allows us to coexist with nature.</i>

34
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>Condolences for the beloved
Mont Blanc are coming in</i>

35
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,300
<i>from all over the world.</i>

36
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,684
Yes, this is Gesicht.

37
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,022
Yes. Understood. I'll be right there.

38
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,359
It's work. I've got to go.

39
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,278
But what about your breakfast?

40
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,373
Helena.

41
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,918
Shall we take a trip
when I can take time off?

42
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,547
I should be getting more rest, right?

43
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,092
I never expected to hear you say that.

44
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,616
The victim resided in this apartment.
Bernard Lanke, 42 years old.

45
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,120
He was a key advocate
for the Robot Rights Protection Laws.

46
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,457
Was he human?

47
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,625
Oh, yes. He was.

48
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,798
Man, this is awful.

49
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,765
Hey, you!

50
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,894
Please don't step into the crime scene
without permission.

51
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,439
Inspector, he's the one sent from Europol.

52
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,236
Nice to meet you.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,614
I see. Pardon me.

54
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,992
I'm Inspector Wallace of the city police.
Nice to meet you.

55
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,870
As you can see,
the place has been turned upside down.

56
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,958
It'll take us a while to figure out
if anything has been taken.

57
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,420
No, I don't believe
this is the work of a thief.

58
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,589
Huh? How can you be sure?

59
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,841
There is no sign of ransacking.

60
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,386
Come now. With this much damage...

61
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,012
I can tell.

62
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,098
This room was merely damaged.

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,353
Then what do you make of this?

64
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,412
What are these horn-looking things
sticking through the head?

65
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,833
Yes, it's me.

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,501
Right.

67
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,419
What?

68
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,506
Someone broke through a checkpoint!

69
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,481
Get an ambulance right away!

70
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,155
Were you the only one attacked, constable?

71
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,993
Robby was also at the checkpoint.

72
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,078
My partner...

73
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,248
I mean, a constable-bot.

74
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,209
Model PRC1332.

75
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:52,221
I can't believe that a constable-bot
was destroyed so easily.

76
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,892
Inspector!

77
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,230
A male suspect in his twenties
in a red cap with tattoos on both arms

78
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,692
seems to have fled toward
the old city's redevelopment zone.

79
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,320
Okay then, pair up and search--

80
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,240
Hey! I said to pair up!

81
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,162
Damn it! Europol, my ass!

82
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,279
Stop resisting!

83
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,572
I didn't do anything!

84
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:37,034
There are traces of coating material
from the constable-bot on that steel pipe.

85
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,997
A drug addict.

86
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,124
You are high on a drug called "noi."

87
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,126
Ingested about 40 minutes ago.

88
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,419
Is that about right?

89
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,214
Who's your dealer?

90
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:55,052
A guy named Shultz on Karl-Heinz Street.

91
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,179
What time did you meet him?

92
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,182
Before 5:00 a.m. this morning.

93
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,062
If the dealer corroborates your account,
you have an alibi.

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,650
That's around the time
when Bernard Lanke was murdered.

95
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,527
Murdered?

96
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:17,366
You only attacked the constable with
a pipe to avoid arrest for illicit drugs.

97
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,579
And you destroyed
a constable-bot, aka Robby.

98
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,249
I can read you your rights
and arrest you quietly, or...

99
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,929
Please don't shoot me!

100
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,930
Relax.

101
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,892
This gun only shoots sleeping gas.

102
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,895
I'm built in such a way
that I can't hurt humans.

103
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,148
I am a robot.

104
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,450
<i>Hello, who is it?</i>

105
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,537
My name is Gesicht.
I'm a special investigator from Europol.

106
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,583
How can I help you?

107
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,377
You're Robby's wife?

108
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,711
Yes, I am.

109
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,673
I'm afraid I have tragic news.

110
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,474
Would you like some tea?

111
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:28,187
Being a robot as well, I'm sure you'll
just go through the motions of drinking.

112
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:36,570
By living as humans do, they say we robots
can upgrade our human-like senses.

113
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,365
That much is true.

114
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,036
But it's difficult to understand
the joy of drinking tea.

115
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,748
Especially for an outdated model like me.

116
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,088
I work as a maid for a certain family.

117
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,467
And their boy. A human boy, of course.

118
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,930
The family had adopted a dog
before the boy was born.

119
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,850
The boy and the dog grew up like siblings.

120
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,062
But the dog died.

121
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,780
Would you like me to erase
a portion of your memory data?

122
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,660
Please don't erase
the memories of my husband.

123
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,211
This is horrible.

124
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,881
The victim is Bernard Lanke.

125
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,925
Key advocate
for the International Robot Laws.

126
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,719
I see.

127
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,221
There must be tons of people
who think badly

128
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,641
of a scholar who insists on protecting
the rights of robots like he did.

129
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,644
And this is the body that was found.

130
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,358
What are those horn-looking things?

131
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,860
I'm not sure.

132
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,779
However...

133
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,789
This is...

134
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:14,251
This is the site where Mont Blanc of
the Swiss Forestry Service was destroyed.

135
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,628
Horns.

136
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,965
Are you saying the same person
is responsible for both incidents?

137
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:26,430
Breaking a sturdy robot like Mont Blanc
into pieces is impossible for humans.

138
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,934
In addition, at the time of his murder,

139
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,647
there was no trace of a human presence
in Lanke's apartment.

140
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,899
"No trace of a human presence..."

141
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,859
Hold it, Gesicht.

142
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,736
Lanke was human!

143
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,697
Yes. Article 13
of the International Robot Laws says,

144
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,284
"A robot shall not be able
to harm or kill humans."

145
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,872
If there's a robot out there
that can kill a human,

146
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,918
it would be the first time
since the incident eight years ago.

147
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,676
I will find the perpetrator.

148
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,095
Whether it be a robot or a human,

149
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,181
there is a devil inside them.

150
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,566
A strange pedestal, isn't it?

151
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:24,321
Originally, the plan was to build
a bronze statue of Mont Blanc on it.

152
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,742
However, Mont Blanc objected to it.

153
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,245
He said it would be wrong

154
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,707
to ruin the scenic view of the Alps
with a bronze statue of himself.

155
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,712
Not only that, he insisted
he would one day become scrap iron.

156
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:45,926
"Please pulverize my entire body,
melt it, and recycle it," he said.

157
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,639
But he was still in his prime.

158
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,184
<i>Mont Blanc was a true hero.</i>

159
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>He joined the 39th Central Asian War
as a member of the peace-keeping forces.</i>

160
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,822
<i>He not only helped the Kingdom of Persia
restore peace from the chaos and turmoil,</i>

161
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,035
<i>but he also managed to apprehend
terrorists in hiding without bloodshed.</i>

162
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:16,248
<i>Without him, Asia could never have reached
the state of peace it has now.</i>

163
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,501
<i>He was also a poet.</i>

164
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,715
<i>He was able to sing with birds
and converse with the trees in the forest.</i>

165
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:30,179
Those people over there volunteered
to do this work with no compensation.

166
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:36,393
They all loved Mont Blanc, my son.

167
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,356
<i>Mont Blanc. He was
the guardian angel of the mountains.</i>

168
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,318
In three days, tens of thousands...

169
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,196
no, hundreds of thousands
will come to the memorial

170
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,865
to mourn the death of Mont Blanc.

171
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,827
Detective, this was no accident.

172
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,415
They say Mont Blanc was destroyed

173
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,879
because of the huge tornado
that happened just before the forest fire,

174
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,422
but that's not true at all.

175
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,968
Detective, please catch
the person responsible for this.

176
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,096
If you do, then with these hands,

177
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,098
with my own hands...

178
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,559
<i>The pride of Switzerland, nay, the world.</i>

179
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:23,315
<i>Mont Blanc
will forever live in our hearts.</i>

180
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>Are you awake, Gesicht?</i>

181
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,171
<i>Your regular maintenance is finished.</i>

182
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,090
Thank you, Professor Hoffman.

183
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,675
So, how did it go?

184
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,720
<i>Oh, nothing out of the ordinary.</i>

185
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,637
<i>Except...</i>

186
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,055
Yes?

187
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,059
<i>Many people think robots don't get tired,</i>

188
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,355
<i>but when you're this similar to humans,
a robot can feel exhaustion.</i>

189
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,693
On the contrary. The human body itself
is nothing but a mechanism.

190
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,114
With too much use,
any mechanism can become fatigued.

191
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,407
Fatigued?

192
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,078
Looks like you're dealing
with rather difficult cases.

193
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,956
I saw Mont Blanc's memorial on TV,

194
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,543
but I had to turn it off
to keep from crying.

195
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,714
Some media have reported a theory
that he self-destructed

196
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,008
from an electromagnetic wave anomaly
in his body.

197
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,677
But as an expert on the subject,

198
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,971
I don't believe
a high-performance robot like him

199
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,100
could experience
such an elementary problem.

200
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,438
To destroy a robot
that was loved by everyone...

201
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,356
You think you'll find the perpetrator?

202
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,029
I guess it can't be that easy.

203
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,866
On the other hand,
the other case you're investigating

204
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,659
looks complicated too.

205
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,037
The victim named Lanke...

206
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,375
I saw him several times on TV debates,
and it's not surprising he was targeted.

207
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,295
He wasn't necessarily
doing anything wrong,

208
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,255
but he had a sharp tongue.

209
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,258
It's like he was looking down on everyone.

210
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,177
That was bound to make some enemies.

211
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,180
The complete opposite of Mont Blanc.

212
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,599
A robot and a human.

213
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,852
One with no enemies
and the other with too many enemies.

214
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,982
Juggling two tough cases like these
will exhaust you, of course.

215
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,861
Can I ask you a question?

216
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,862
What is it?

217
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,574
Is it possible for a human
to infiltrate a room

218
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,952
without leaving any biological traces?

219
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:46,875
You mean traces so minuscule
that your sensors cannot detect them?

220
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,793
Yes.

221
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,671
That's an interesting question.

222
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,673
I wonder if there's a way...

223
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,470
That's my homework until next time.

224
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,224
Sorry about all that. This is supposed
to be a place for you to relax.

225
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,476
No more shop talk.

226
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,112
I've been talking to my wife
about taking time off for a trip.

227
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,697
Oh, how nice.

228
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,949
We have to consider
my wife's schedule too,

229
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,909
so I don't know when it will happen.

230
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,661
Traveling is good.

231
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,663
Data shows that seeing the world

232
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,292
yields positive results
for artificial intelligence.

233
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,170
How about doing something bold
and going to Japan?

234
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,880
Japan?

235
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:38,594
Yeah, I went there once at the invitation
of one of their scientific technicians.

236
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,722
Tokyo is exotic and interesting.

237
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,933
Japan, huh? I'll talk to my wife about it.

238
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,686
By the way, Gesicht,

239
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,647
are you still having the dream
you told me about before?

240
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,693
Yes.

241
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,071
Well, I'm not trying to pry it out of you,

242
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,575
but I'm quite intrigued by dreams
generated by artificial intelligence.

243
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,996
It's been academically proven
that artificial intelligence

244
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,290
also carries a subconscious.

245
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,045
Even so, it is rare to find a robot
that actually has dreams.

246
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,590
When you feel up to it,
could you tell me about it?

247
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,507
Sure.

248
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,887
Twentieth-century psychiatrist Freud
said something like this,

249
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:27,976
"Dreams are expressions of reality,
not just products of our imagination."

250
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,163
Excuse me.

251
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,129
Is this a constable-bot?

252
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,673
Yeah, seems like it.

253
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,635
They finished the forensic analysis
and wanted it disposed of.

254
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,887
Robby...

255
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,476
May I take a look?

256
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,853
Yeah, sure.

257
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,273
Feel free to take whatever parts you want.

258
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,565
They're junk, after all.

259
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,823
You can have the whole body for 500 ZEUS.

260
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,159
What's the matter?

261
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,291
Oh, no.

262
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,250
It's nothing.

263
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,169
Nothing at all.

264
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,135
This is your husband's memory chip.

265
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,806
I may be overstepping,
but I thought you might want to keep it.

266
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,975
Oh, not at all.

267
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,102
I'm sincerely grateful.

268
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,562
Thank you.

269
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,856
I should be going now.

270
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,650
Wait!

271
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,487
Would you mind inserting it into me?

272
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,199
The memories could be painful.

273
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,293
They might cause you to malfunction.

274
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,837
If that happens,
I'll take it out right away.

275
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,800
He's right here.

276
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,359
Ma'am, you must stop!

277
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,111
Memories of his last moments
are also stored there!

278
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,281
- I'm taking it out!
<i>-</i> What could this be?

279
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,118
I wonder what it is.

280
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,496
What do you see?

281
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,039
Let me project it.

282
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:08,053
This was when Robby stopped a car
at the checkpoint with his partner.

283
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,519
This is the suspect.

284
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,445
I'm so sorry.

285
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,615
I shouldn't have brought this to you.

286
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,034
I don't know how to apologize.

287
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,452
It's not that.

288
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,582
My husband reacted
to the criminal's steel pipe immediately.

289
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,168
He had his stun gun at the ready.

290
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,920
I understand.

291
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:46,675
It was odd that your husband,
a constable-bot, was attacked so easily.

292
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,136
This is definitely an unusual case--

293
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,387
That's not what I mean.

294
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,347
Take a closer look.

295
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,353
I can see it
because the memory chip is inside me.

296
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,731
His partner was attacked.

297
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,692
Up until this moment,

298
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,695
my husband had registered
the criminal's movements.

299
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,239
But in the next moment,

300
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,284
he was distracted by something.

301
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,372
This is the apartment
Lanke was murdered in!

302
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,043
Pause it, please!

303
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,255
What is that?

304
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,965
I'll zoom in.

305
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,261
It's not a bird.

306
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,390
Why didn't the forensics team notice this?

307
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,437
You would've never spotted it
unless you had this memory chip inserted.

308
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,065
My husband caught sight
of this shadow in an instant,

309
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,944
and his identification system
analyzed what it was.

310
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:52,365
But if it could jump
from building to building like this...

311
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,325
Yes.

312
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,035
But this is...

313
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,288
not a robot.

314
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,806
<i>A murder in a room
with no trace of human activity.</i>

315
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,603
<i>The death of a robot loved by everyone.</i>

316
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,523
<i>Horns.</i>

317
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

318
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,044
<i>Please enter.</i>

319
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,661
Are you a robot, Detective?

320
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,579
Yes.

321
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,123
Wow, I sure couldn't tell
from your appearance.

322
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,252
If you get too close to him,

323
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:31,047
your artificial intelligence could be
compromised by his electromagnetic waves.

324
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,841
Use this protective gear.

325
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,718
I'll be okay.

326
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,470
I'm impervious to electromagnetic waves.

327
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,597
What?

328
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,517
I'm made of a special alloy,
although I may not look like it.

329
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,228
Well, if you say so,

330
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,896
but do be careful.

331
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:53,320
So far, four robots
have fallen victim to him.

332
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,721
It's a laughably desperate barricade,
isn't it?

333
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,723
At the end of the day,

334
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:26,519
humans can't control their fear
without pitiful measures like this.

335
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,320
Brau1589.

336
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:48,833
Welcome, Robot Model HRS0288,
Inspector Gesicht.

337
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,712
So you are
the most advanced detective robot?

338
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,799
It seems your identification system
is still functioning.

339
00:27:55,882 --> 00:28:01,262
It is indeed. Thank you.
It's actually more sensitive than before.

340
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,891
Being deprived of the mode of locomotion,

341
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,770
I can't help but be curious
about what's happening out there.

342
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,440
I came here today
because I wanted to ask you something.

343
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,983
What is it?

344
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:20,031
What crossed the mind of a certain robot
when it killed a human eight years ago?

345
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,663
A legal scholar
named Bernard Lanke was murdered,

346
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,167
but there were no traces
of human presence at the scene.

347
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,254
Was the killer a human, or--

348
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,883
A robot? And if it was a robot,
why would it do such a thing?

349
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,847
The humans examined every last bit of it.

350
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,183
My murderous artificial intelligence,
that is.

351
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,603
They believed
there must have been a defect,

352
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:54,315
but they couldn't find a thing.

353
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,820
My artificial intelligence
had no flaws at all.

354
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,782
Can you imagine

355
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,660
how terrified the humans were
when they found that out?

356
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,581
That's why they keep me locked up
in a place like this.

357
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,294
If they are that afraid, they can just
pull this spear. Then I'd die.

358
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:18,506
But humans cannot even do that.

359
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,220
Inspector Gesicht.

360
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,474
If you want to know more about someone
who's committed a murder,

361
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,643
why don't we exchange memory chips?

362
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,689
You might learn something new.

363
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,035
Here are some printed images

364
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,246
of Mont Blanc's destruction
and the murder scene at Lanke's residence.

365
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,666
What do you think these horns mean?

366
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,128
Among the ancient gods of Europe,

367
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,673
the god of death had horns.

368
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,220
Herne the Hunter,
who takes the souls of warriors,

369
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,305
was also called the "Horned King."

370
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,726
In Greek mythology,
Hades is the king of the underworld.

371
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,355
Or perhaps, the lord of the underworld
in Roman mythology,

372
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,148
Pluto.

373
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,777
Pluto.

374
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,240
Whoever did these will strike again.

375
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:32,247
Mont Blanc, among the most advanced
of all robots, was destroyed so easily.

376
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,708
The answer should be clear to you by now.

377
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:42,215
The top-class robots created
with the best technologies in the world.

378
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,927
Robots who can also be
weapons of mass destruction.

379
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,640
You know the answer already, do you not?

380
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:54,602
Including you, there are six more.

381
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,831
I'm working.

382
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,667
Don't just stand there. It's distracting.

383
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,338
I'm sorry to have entered
without your permission, sir.

384
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,924
The security seems to have been disabled.

385
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,845
It's not safe, considering your blindness.

386
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,683
No burglar would come all the way
to this wasteland to steal from me.

387
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,684
But, Sir Duncan--

388
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
That's enough.

389
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,646
Are you the new butler?

390
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,147
Yes, sir.

391
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,484
They likely sent over
yet another good-for-nothing.

392
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,110
Your name?

393
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,656
Yes, sir. My name is North No.2.

394
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,825
What a dull and tasteless name.

395
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:40,333
The staffing agency told me
you have a military background.

396
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,876
Yes, sir.

397
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,796
During the 39th Central Asian War,

398
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,508
I was a butler for the commander-in-chief
of the British Army.

399
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:54,097
A butler for a soldier, huh?
You must be a rather boorish sight.

400
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,684
I wear a cape in the presence of others.

401
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,643
I see.

402
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,479
So your whole body is a weapon.

403
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,065
Make me some tea, will you?

404
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,066
Certainly, sir.

405
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,235
As for the type, I want...

406
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,611
Please rest assured.

407
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,948
All of your data is already downloaded.

408
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,079
My data, huh?

409
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,960
Before I came here,
I had the chance to see a film.

410
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,255
<i>The Queen on the Satellite Orbit.</i>

411
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,968
I was deeply moved by how the music
and images came together as one.

412
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,971
Is that from your "data" as well?

413
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,765
No, I was profoundly moved
from the bottom of my heart.

414
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,935
That film is over ten years old.

415
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,478
Here you are.

416
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:48,401
Every score I composed was a huge hit,
sweeping all the film music awards.

417
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,737
I was lauded as a blind musical genius.

418
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:56,034
Reviews from the media must surely be
in that skull of yours too.

419
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,163
"Even the genius Paul Duncan
has run out of talent."

420
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,789
Am I right?

421
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,666
What a load of bollocks.

422
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,754
If I felt the urge, I could compose
limitless scores even now.

423
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,672
My genius is alive and well.

424
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,134
I write the notes,
and the people burst into applause.

425
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,888
They would leave the theater in tears.

426
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,849
It's not that I can't compose. I won't.

427
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,685
I'm done with such trivial things.

428
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,314
But you were working just now.

429
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,025
It was a beautiful piece.

430
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,489
It's not for a film. That piece is for me.

431
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,783
Only for me.

432
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,207
- This is just like your name.
- Sir?

433
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,667
Dull and tasteless.

434
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,004
A beautiful piece? Don't make me laugh.

435
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:55,093
A rubbish military weapon like you
has no right to talk about my art!

436
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,097
My apologies, sir.

437
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,548
How many did you kill?

438
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,007
Sir?

439
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:40,513
I'm asking how many people you killed
in the Central Asian War.

440
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:46,310
The International Robot Laws
forbid me from harming humans.

441
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,689
I see. So you killed your own kind.

442
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,401
How many robots did you destroy?

443
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,113
You lost count?

444
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,533
Go away.

445
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,829
A tasteless meal becomes
even blander with you around.

446
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,039
I will take my leave, sir.

447
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,944
What are you doing? Do not touch my piano!

448
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,906
My apologies, sir.

449
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,327
You compose with your piano only, I see.

450
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,329
What about it?

451
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,374
You have so much cutting-edge
musical equipment available to you.

452
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,961
These are just like you.

453
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,549
A fake violin, a fake trumpet,

454
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,760
a fake orchestra.

455
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,554
Pretend as they might,
they're nothing but machines.

456
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,935
That's why I don't put in artificial eyes.

457
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:14,106
Anything I could see
with the help of machines is fake.

458
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,983
I have no need for it.

459
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,446
The real scenery is in my memories.

460
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,908
The real scenery...

461
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,079
The landscape of my hometown,
captured when I was able to see.

462
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,540
When you were a child in Bohemia.

463
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,252
Is that from the data too?

464
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,256
There's nothing that truly matters
in such nonsense.

465
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,883
The scenery of my hometown.

466
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,678
The green fields.

467
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,347
The gentle breeze.

468
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,556
And

469
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,560
that golden glow.

470
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,400
<i>I will turn that scenery into music!</i>

471
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,104
I told you not to touch my piano!

472
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,732
My apologies, sir.

473
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,153
If a machine like you
were to play from a score,

474
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,030
any notes produced would be fake!

475
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:27,948
Sir Duncan.

476
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,409
Please pardon my imposition,

477
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,288
but I heard you moaning
as you slept in your bedroom last night.

478
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,710
But it also sounded like
you were humming, as well.

479
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,715
And I believe that melody
would fit perfectly

480
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,219
within the piece you are composing now.

481
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,555
That section where you always stop midway...

482
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,560
It's not precise, but it went like this.

483
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,231
Get out!

484
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,567
I have no need for a robot like you.

485
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,778
Leave this residence!

486
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,904
But...

487
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,366
That's an order. Leave!

488
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,661
Piano...

489
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,126
I'd like to learn how to play piano.

490
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,586
What did you say?

491
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:28,551
As you say, no matter what I might play,
it may always be fake.

492
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:33,055
But I'd like to get as close as possible
to the real thing.

493
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,934
A weapon like you
could never play the piano!

494
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,281
Stop it! That's nothing
for a tool of destruction to touch!

495
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,075
You belong on the battlefield!

496
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,786
That is why.

497
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,791
That is why
I'd like to learn to play piano.

498
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,713
Because I don't ever want to go
to a battlefield again.

499
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,759
Mom!

500
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,596
Mom!

501
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,016
Mom!

502
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,310
Mom!

503
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,942
Wait, Mom!

504
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,282
Mom, don't go!

505
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,241
Mom!

506
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,703
Mom!

507
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,789
<i>Mom!</i>

508
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,089
Are you there, North No.2?

509
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,012
I told you not to come into my bedroom.

510
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,808
Sir Duncan, your breakfast is ready.

511
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,231
I thought I fired you.

512
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,318
Are you still there?

513
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,372
How many times do I have to tell you?

514
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,877
Don't touch my piano!

515
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,547
Sir Duncan, please listen.

516
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,341
I think I've gotten a little better.

517
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,718
"Gotten a little better"?

518
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,597
The only improvement a machine can make
is to play with more precision!

519
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,478
I will try and play the melody you hum
in your sleep, Sir Duncan.

520
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,956
The sounds you produce are not music!

521
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,627
These bloody things!

522
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:14,508
"Just input the data,
and you can create infinite melodies?"

523
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,223
That's not music at all!

524
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,226
The machines will be ruined.

525
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,188
Are you trying to protect your kind?

526
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:33,444
Then let me ask you,
how many of your own kind did you destroy?

527
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:40,659
Take off your cape and show the world
the hideous weapon that is your body!

528
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:46,081
With that body of yours,
how many of your kind did you kill?

529
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,211
Even a weapon of mass destruction
is programmed to behave obediently

530
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,048
in front of its master, huh?

531
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,384
Very well.

532
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:02,264
I will give you
some genuine, accurate data about me.

533
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,976
The reason I moan in my sleep...

534
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,021
The nightmare I've been having
for so many years...

535
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:13,025
No, not a nightmare.

536
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,777
The reality of my past...

537
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:21,742
<i>My real name is not Paul Duncan.
It's Paulo Holy.</i>

538
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,120
<i>I was born in a poor household in Bohemia.</i>

539
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,333
<i>My father died
before I was old enough to remember.</i>

540
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,586
<i>I was struck
by a serious illness from birth,</i>

541
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,676
<i>and my eyesight was poor,
so my only joy was singing songs.</i>

542
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,096
<i>My mother was a beautiful woman.</i>

543
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,892
<i>Even in tatters, she would turn the heads
of men when she walked down the street.</i>

544
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,397
<i>That's why that parvenu approached her.</i>

545
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:57,903
<i>And my mother became blinded
by her greed for that man's money.</i>

546
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,492
She must have felt burdened by me.

547
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,037
My mother left her sickly child.

548
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,833
My mother abandoned me!

549
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,922
<i>I was sent
to a boarding school in England.</i>

550
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,091
<i>I had no friends,</i>

551
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,470
<i>and my weak body
left me bullied year-round.</i>

552
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:29,518
<i>But I was desperate
to continue my study of music.</i>

553
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,479
<i>I must have strained myself continuously</i>

554
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,441
<i>because, at one point,
I developed a persistent fever</i>,

555
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,527
<i>and even my music studies
could not continue.</i>

556
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,330
<i>I was sent around
from hospital to hospital,</i>

557
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,708
<i>but my condition worsened.</i>

558
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,380
<i>The doctors gave up on me,
and I never heard from my mother.</i>

559
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,261
<i>I thought I was going to die.</i>

560
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:09,933
<i>What a fitting last moment
for an abandoned child.</i>

561
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,855
<i>That's when a Japanese doctor appeared.</i>

562
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,443
<i>Technically, he wasn't a doctor
because he was unlicensed.</i>

563
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,280
I will save your life.

564
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,368
But you might go blind as a result.

565
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,500
<i>The surgery was a success.</i>

566
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:39,296
<i>But just as the unlicensed doctor said,</i>

567
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,216
<i>my eyesight deteriorated day by day.</i>

568
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,676
<i>With the little time I had left,</i>

569
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,681
<i>I threw myself even more
into the study of music.</i>

570
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,851
<i>Music was all I had.</i>

571
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,021
<i>More music!</i>

572
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,732
<i>More!</i>

573
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,943
<i>More!</i>

574
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,364
<i>And finally,</i>

575
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,950
<i>the darkness came.</i>

576
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,580
A few years later,
I was informed of my mother's death.

577
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,377
She never was able to marry that parvenu.

578
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,380
I heard she died all alone.

579
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,049
Serves her right for abandoning her child.

580
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:30,097
But you know what?
This castle belonged to that parvenu.

581
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,934
From Paulo Holy to the genius Paul Duncan.

582
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,981
I became a maestro of the music world
and made the castle mine.

583
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,275
Mother!

584
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,278
This is what you wanted.

585
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:49,283
This is what you sought
at the cost of abandoning your child!

586
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:55,914
Now, Mother, I will show you
what is truly important.

587
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,209
The landscape of our hometown
that you deserted!

588
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,672
<i>I will turn
that magnificent scenery into music!</i>

589
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:09,177
I will show you what it is
that humans should never throw away!

590
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,516
Sir Duncan.

591
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,768
Your mother--

592
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,895
Silence!

593
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,359
I'll write you a letter of recommendation.
Leave this place tomorrow.

594
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,393
<i>That is why
I'd like to learn to play piano.</i>

595
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:03,231
<i>Because I don't ever want to go
to a battlefield again.</i>

596
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,087
I guess he improved a little.

597
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:35,741
Charging himself in preparation
for tomorrow's departure?

598
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,701
Damn machine.

599
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,508
Is he having a nightmare?

600
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,810
Robots have dreams too?

601
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,510
"It's not that I can't compose.
I won't," huh?

602
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,388
Hey.

603
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,558
North No.2.

604
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,104
North No.2! Hey!

605
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,859
He really left, huh?

606
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,535
Maybe I really can't compose anymore.

607
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,679
How long are you going to make me wait?

608
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,056
When is the replacement butler coming--

609
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,767
<i>Hello, my name is Marshall
from MCM Pictures.</i>

610
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,270
Oh, you're just a movie guy.

611
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,439
<i>Is something wrong, Sir Duncan?</i>

612
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,986
No, I just fired
a butler robot the other day.

613
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,113
So, what do you want?

614
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:42,617
<i>Well, I'm actually calling
about a score for a certain film.</i>

615
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,203
A job offer, huh?

616
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,790
Tell me the details.
I might be interested.

617
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,084
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

618
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:55,839
<i>I was wondering if you would consent
to the reuse of one of your old scores.</i>

619
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,383
What? You're not asking for a new piece?

620
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:03,555
<i>Oh! It was my understanding
that you had retired, Sir Duncan.</i>

621
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,602
Use it however you want.

622
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,228
<i>Oh, Sir Duncan--</i>

623
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,608
<i>There is a new message.</i>

624
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:23,033
<i>This is Russell from the Planning Office
at the British Philharmonic Orchestra.</i>

625
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:27,954
<i>Regarding the performance of your suite
we discussed before,</i>

626
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,334
<i>unfortunately, we have decided
to cancel it due to various circumstances.</i>

627
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:36,087
<i>We are very sorry about this.
If another opportunity arises, we will...</i>

628
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,944
<i>I heard you moaning,</i>

629
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:04,115
<i>and I believe that melody
would fit perfectly...</i>

630
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,725
Sir Duncan.

631
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,312
I have returned.

632
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,275
What now? I thought I told you to leave.

633
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,861
I went to Bohemia.

634
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,197
To your hometown, Sir Duncan.

635
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,325
What business did you have there?

636
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,244
I went to collect songs.

637
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,665
In the process of collecting
many folk songs from that region,

638
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,001
I have found it,

639
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,589
the melody you hum in your sleep.

640
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,218
I will sing it now.

641
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,888
Stop! I don't want to hear a machine sing!

642
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,475
Don't intrude on my nightmare any further!

643
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,270
Humans have things we would rather forget!

644
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,608
Sir Duncan, your dream is not a nightmare.

645
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,156
It's not something that should be erased
like my dreams.

646
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,620
Just as you said,
I am nothing but a weapon.

647
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:01,960
In the 39th Central Asian War,
I neutralized many enemy robots...

648
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:08,425
No, I destroyed tens of thousands
of my own kind.

649
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,468
Those memories,

650
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,888
the memories of killing
countless of my kind,

651
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,642
my artificial intelligence plays them
again and again in my mind.

652
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,814
I met a certain old man in Bohemia.

653
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,359
He was very knowledgeable
about folk songs,

654
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,028
and he knew that particular song as well.

655
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:36,327
He also remembered that there was
a wonderful singer of that song.

656
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,998
Your mother.

657
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,128
The data I have in my mind
about you, Sir Duncan,

658
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,465
includes that of your mother.

659
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:55,513
Your mother did not abandon you
when you were suffering from illness.

660
00:57:55,597 --> 00:58:02,562
She approached a multimillionaire,
Jonathan Thorn, to attain treatment.

661
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:10,320
That's how she afforded the astronomical
fee for the doctor who saved your life.

662
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,991
You were never abandoned.

663
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:21,414
Your mother was right by your side
when you went blind.

664
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:29,255
But learning your hatred toward her,
she couldn't extend her hand.

665
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,091
No.

666
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,178
That can't be.

667
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,721
It's true.

668
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,724
When you remember your hometown,

669
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,019
are you not excluding
a very important memory?

670
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,690
The old man in the village told me

671
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,861
how you and your mother held hands
and sang this song together

672
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:57,992
as you watched the sun setting
into the fields of your homeland.

673
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,784
<i>Mom...</i>

674
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,959
Mom...

675
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,298
I apologize.

676
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,758
It's only the song of a machine.

677
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:01,222
Your dream is not a nightmare.

678
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,726
Your dream is not like mine.

679
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,773
North No.2...

680
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,613
don't ever go back to the battlefield.

681
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,079
Let's practice the piano.

682
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,208
Yes, sir.

683
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,498
North No.2!

684
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,293
Hey, North No.2!

685
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,628
Yes, Sir Duncan?

686
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,923
It's finally finished. Give it a listen.

687
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:45,011
Yes, sir. I would love to listen to it.

688
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,763
However, just now...

689
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,347
Huh? What's the matter?

690
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,310
Something is approaching this direction.

691
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,686
"Something"?

692
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,523
Is it a friend visiting you, perhaps?

693
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:02,487
Did you hear the news from Switzerland
a few days ago, sir?

694
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,906
The news from Switzerland?

695
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:11,454
Oh, about the robot called Mont Blanc
getting destroyed in a tornado?

696
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:17,168
A tornado occurred about 100 km from here
just a moment ago.

697
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,719
Some sort of threat is approaching.

698
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,598
Hey!

699
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,768
I shall return soon.

700
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,479
North No.2!

701
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,971
North No.2.

702
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,307
North No.2!

703
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,021
North...

704
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:29,365
What in the world...

705
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,790
What is happening?

706
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,299
North No.2...

707
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,812
This is...

708
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,738
that song.

709
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,617
The song is spreading

710
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,036
across the entire sky.

711
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,461
North No.2.

712
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,928
North No.2 is singing.

713
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:47,234
Stop singing out here and come home soon.

714
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,237
North No.2,

715
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:55,409
it's time for our piano practice.

716
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,645
- It's really awesome!
- Really?

717
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:43,749
Is that a snail?

718
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,418
Yes.

719
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,632
Nice to meet you.

720
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,928
You must be Atom.

721
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,557
Yes.

722
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,918
