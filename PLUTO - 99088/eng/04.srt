1
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,970
Hey there.

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,888
Yes, sir?

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,350
Why don't you quit standing there
and take a break?

4
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,520
No, not while I'm on duty, Professor.

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,315
Protecting you is of utmost importance.

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,650
Nothing is going to come after me.

7
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,779
Not on such a peaceful Sunday.

8
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:15,742
But if something
were to happen to you, Professor...

9
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:21,456
A few incidents involving
Bora Inquiry Commission members

10
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,208
do not warrant overreacting.

11
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,004
I don't see why anyone
would want to kill me.

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,550
More importantly,
I can't enjoy this rare day off

13
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,469
with you stuck to me like glue.

14
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,513
Please forgive me, sir.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,681
Oh, no, never mind.

16
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,851
There's no need for you to apologize.

17
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,149
Do you have a name?

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:53,029
Yes! It is PPB49881327, sir!

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,949
I don't mean your registration number.

20
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,120
You have a name, don't you?

21
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,497
Yes. It's Yujiro, sir.

22
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,835
Yujiro. That's a name
that will bring you success.

23
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,002
Sir?

24
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,505
Perhaps you'll become
head of the criminal division.

25
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,139
It's not safe, Professor Ochanomizu!

26
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,478
This is...

27
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,901
A robot dog. Someone abandoned it.

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,195
Please step away.
It could be an explosive.

29
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,534
I'm sure it's fine.

30
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,870
It does not seem to be an explosive.

31
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,958
Looks like it's in pretty bad shape.

32
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,461
Let's take this little one
to my home, Yujiro.

33
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,423
Excuse me,

34
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,551
but what are you planning to do
with the robot dog?

35
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,386
Fix it, of course.

36
00:02:59,095 --> 00:02:59,929
Fix it?

37
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,184
I'm the head
of the Ministry of Science, aren't I?

38
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,737
Hang in there. You'll be better soon.

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,783
The damage to your actuator
is pretty severe,

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,453
but your computerized brain circuits
are the issue.

41
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,544
This is Ochanomizu.

42
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,964
<i>Oh, Professor.
I'm sorry to trouble you on your day off.</i>

43
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,091
It's you again
from the Ministry of Defense.

44
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,469
<i>I apologize for bothering you so often,</i>

45
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,890
<i>but the matter must be discussed
at next week's committee meeting.</i>

46
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>To send more troops
to the Kingdom of Persia,</i>

47
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,980
<i>we desperately need your permission
to approve the increase.</i>

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,859
No matter how many times you ask,
I will not change my mind!

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,777
<i>But, sir--</i>

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,197
There can be no more bloodshed,
whether it be human or robot!

51
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>But the United States of Thracia's request
is unchanged!</i>

52
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,701
That doesn't matter!

53
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,205
A scientist does not create robots
to be used as weapons!

54
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,166
For crying out loud.

55
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,879
Don't you know when to give up?

56
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,840
<i>What's the matter, Grandpa?</i>

57
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,928
Oh, it's you, Takashi. It's been a while.

58
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,305
<i>If you're busy, I can call back later.</i>

59
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,558
No, it's fine. What did you need?

60
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,646
<i>Well, there was a tornado
offshore earlier.</i>

61
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,025
<i>But now, I'm just playing with Bobby.</i>

62
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,027
Are you two getting along?

63
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>You bet! You gave him to me two years ago.</i>

64
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>I know there are newer models now,</i>

65
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,537
<i>but he's better than any of them!</i>

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,372
<i>He plays with me a lot!</i>

67
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,748
Is that so?

68
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>What are you doing now, Grandpa?</i>

69
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,212
I'm fixing a robot dog,

70
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,715
one that's much older than Bobby.

71
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,051
<i>Older than him?
Are you sure you can fix it?</i>

72
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,094
I sure can.

73
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,555
<i>I know you can fix anything, Grandpa.</i>

74
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,974
You can count on it.

75
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,517
<i>Talk to you later, then.</i>

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,435
Okay.

77
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,063
Now, then...

78
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,612
I'm looking for a KD-8083 booster

79
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,867
and an RSC-2969 router.

80
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,660
<i>Those are quite outdated.</i>

81
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,164
I've tried several other places, but...

82
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,292
<i>Ah, looks like they're both discontinued.</i>

83
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,045
Any stock at Nakamine Trading?

84
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,256
<i>Unfortunately, no. They're too old.</i>

85
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,507
I see.

86
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,970
<i>The specs for these things
were overhauled four years ago.</i>

87
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,474
<i>What would you like to do?</i>

88
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,976
No, it's okay. Thank you for your help.

89
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,775
I suppose it was us scientists
who changed the specs.

90
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,739
Let's see how much I can do on my own.

91
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,820
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,781
I was hoping to help you.

93
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,285
You really hung in there.

94
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:57,458
I know. Your owner
took really good care of you, didn't they?

95
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,754
That's why you lasted as long as you have.

96
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,715
You must have been loved.

97
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,638
Are you

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,600
still trying to play with me?

99
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,230
It's all right.

100
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,023
You've done enough.

101
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,796
Who could be here so early in the morning?

102
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,173
<i>Um...</i>

103
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,508
Oh, it's you, Yujiro.

104
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,886
Unfortunately, that robot dog...

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,640
<i>A gentleman is here who says
he is the owner of the robot dog.</i>

106
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>I'll check his ID
and do a full-body search.</i>

107
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,353
No, there's no need. Show him in.

108
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,938
<i>But</i>, <i>sir...</i>

109
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,981
It's fine.

110
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,197
Thank you so much
for everything you've done.

111
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,074
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help.

112
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,826
Not at all.

113
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,622
I was looking for him with his GPS,

114
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:22,126
but I never dreamed he would be seen
by the great Professor Ochanomizu.

115
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,086
Please have some tea.

116
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,005
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

117
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,425
You are a robot too?

118
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,346
Did it make you sad?

119
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,263
What?

120
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,268
When the dog, the robot dog died,
did it make you sad?

121
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,024
Were you sad during the war as well?

122
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,652
Who exactly are you?

123
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,987
Me?

124
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,949
My name is Goji.

125
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,619
Goji?

126
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,331
The one said to have created
the robot army for the Kingdom of Persia?

127
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,252
Your life is in my hands now.

128
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,796
Please summon Atom.

129
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,798
There's someone I want him to fight.

130
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,635
You think I'd summon Atom
because I fear for my life?

131
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,264
You will never force me
to make Atom fight like that!

132
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,850
- I'm not asking you to summon him here.
- What?

133
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:26,232
You must send Atom to the one location
in Japan where a tornado is occurring.

134
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,401
Hey, Mom!

135
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,944
Check this out.

136
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,782
<i>It's the same location as your grandson.</i>

137
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,743
There's no point in threatening me!

138
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,456
No matter what happens, I will never
let Atom do battle with another robot!

139
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,418
You claim to be Goji, yes?

140
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,130
Does that mean the genius scientist
of the Kingdom of Persia was a robot?

141
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,842
I don't know if I'm a genius or not.

142
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,305
<i>At the very least, I can create
a robot that generates tornadoes.</i>

143
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,265
Bobby?

144
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,937
And one that's extremely lethal.

145
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,273
Robots won't kill humans.

146
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,983
Why?

147
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,527
Because that's how we made them.

148
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,780
In accordance
with Article 13 of the Robot Laws,

149
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,992
we've developed a security system
with multiple layers.

150
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,953
To eliminate
even the most remote possibility.

151
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:27,793
Wonderful. Professor Ochanomizu,
you truly are a remarkable scientist.

152
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,048
You have developed
so many advanced robots.

153
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,176
And now robots are more human than ever.

154
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,888
What do you think happens
when robots are almost human?

155
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,266
Even then, robots will never kill humans!

156
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:48,439
What would be
the Japanese word for your attitude?

157
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,525
<i>Seizensetsu,</i> like innate goodness?
Or <i>gizen,</i> meaning hypocrisy?

158
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,156
Shall we test your hypothesis
right here and now?

159
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,241
Whether I will kill you.

160
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,994
Just who are you?

161
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,623
Dr. Goji...

162
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:11,087
The 39th Central Asian War
started because of rumors about you.

163
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,757
It was said that you built an advanced
robot army in the Kingdom of Persia,

164
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,303
along with robots that could be
weapons of mass destruction.

165
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,014
And who said that exactly?

166
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,974
The United States of Thracia.

167
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,311
Is everything that Thracia says correct?

168
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,064
That's why we formed
the inquiry commission.

169
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,982
And did you find anything?

170
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,442
No.

171
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,238
All we found
was a huge pile of discarded robots.

172
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,200
So despite not finding anything,
the Kingdom of Persia was burned to ashes.

173
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,744
Are you out for revenge?

174
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:48,916
You're seeking revenge against the former
members of the Bora Inquiry Commission?

175
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,586
Is that why you're trying to destroy Atom

176
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,840
and the other advanced robots
in the world?

177
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,844
See? You've admitted it yourself.

178
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
It's possible for robots
to seek revenge, right?

179
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,813
<i>Oh, Grandpa.</i>

180
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,189
<i>Something's weird.</i>

181
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,525
<i>Is there a type of tornado
that doesn't move?</i>

182
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,321
<i>And Bobby's eyes haven't stopped glowing.</i>

183
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,199
Now you have no choice but to call Atom.

184
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,994
You do as Bobby tells you, Takashi.

185
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,537
I'll call you later.

186
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,291
It seems they've come.

187
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,295
The police.

188
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,715
You destroyed Yujiro outside, didn't you?

189
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,135
<i>Squad B, go around to the back!</i>

190
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,848
The police are dispatched
when his transmission stops.

191
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,850
<i>Squad C, get under the veranda!</i>

192
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,436
Professor Ochanomizu,

193
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,313
were you stalling for time?

194
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,732
<i>Squad A has secured the entrance.</i>

195
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,788
Professor!

196
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,997
Oh, Atom!

197
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,171
Wait!

198
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,798
- Wai--
- Let him go, Atom!

199
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,758
Fire!

200
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,471
Go after him! Don't let him get away!

201
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,389
Professor, are you all right?

202
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,559
Never mind that. What are you doing here?

203
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,939
I caught the alarm signal
from Takashi's dog, Bobby.

204
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,027
So I contacted the police
and was told something was happening here.

205
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,654
I see.

206
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,947
Thank goodness.

207
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,740
That's why you came here.

208
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,244
What do you mean "thank goodness"?

209
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,703
It's nothing.

210
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,747
And what's going on with Bobby?

211
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,249
Damn it!

212
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,545
We've found him!

213
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,303
Cockroaches?

214
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,894
They carried something away.

215
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,062
Hey, look at this.

216
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,274
His computerized brain is missing.

217
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,442
Uran did what?

218
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,779
It was after she received
the warning from Bobby.

219
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,741
<i>I tried to stop her,
but she flew off to Takashi's home.</i>

220
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,163
Takashi! We have to go
to the basement now!

221
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,041
Grandpa told you too, didn't he?

222
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,126
Yes.

223
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,465
Okay, Bobby.

224
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,431
What's going on, Professor?

225
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,352
What's happening at Takashi's house?

226
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:13,871
Fatima!

227
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,789
Fatima!

228
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,085
Fatima!

229
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,883
Fatima! Open your eyes, Fatima!

230
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,135
Fatima.

231
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,556
Where are the kids?

232
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,475
Murat!

233
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,517
Lola!

234
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,235
Murat.

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,616
Murat!

236
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,381
Where's Pluto?

237
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
His transmission cut off.

238
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,385
So his system overloaded.

239
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,720
That's fine.

240
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,474
Everything's been taken over

241
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,267
by hatred.

242
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,318
Ouch.

243
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,532
Mom! Wake up! Mom?

244
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,868
You can't die, Mom!

245
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,580
What do I do, Bobby?

246
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,961
We gotta go to the basement!

247
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,172
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

248
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,258
Bobby?

249
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,224
Is anyone here?

250
00:16:59,101 --> 00:16:59,977
Bobby?

251
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,939
I'm glad you're safe.
Where's Takashi and his mom?

252
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,865
It's all right now.

253
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,825
See, it's quiet now.

254
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,787
It's like we're in the eye of the storm.

255
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,999
Takashi is in the basement?

256
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,626
Bobby?

257
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,462
What is it?

258
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,883
Any word from the local police?

259
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,094
<i>We can't get through to them.
The signal is too weak!</i>

260
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,513
Please do not worry.

261
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,515
We'll do everything to protect your dau--

262
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,309
Contact Europol!

263
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,603
- Huh?
<i>-</i> I know who's responsible.

264
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,690
The one who's been targeting
the world's most advanced robots

265
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,859
and killing those people.

266
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,486
The real culprit is Goji!

267
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,071
Goji?

268
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,699
He's the man who built the robot army

269
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,661
for the Kingdom of Persia
in the 39th Central Asian War.

270
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,579
It's Dr. Goji.

271
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,124
The designated Europol agent
is Detective Gesicht.

272
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,459
Gesicht?

273
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,504
Patch me in
to Detective Gesicht right now!

274
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,047
I will speak with him directly.

275
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,008
Hurry. If we don't move quickly...

276
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,930
<i>Atom is already on his way!</i>

277
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>Uran!</i>

278
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,148
Atom?

279
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,567
<i>I'm headed your way.</i>

280
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,402
Atom!

281
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,113
Your signal's too weak!

282
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,489
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

283
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,075
Atom.

284
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,036
<i>Uran, what...</i>

285
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,584
What was that?

286
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,588
You can have the whole body for 500 ZEUS.

287
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,382
Gesicht?

288
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,008
<i>Atom!</i>

289
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,010
What's wrong, Uran?

290
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,053
<i>...n't come here...</i>

291
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,556
What's wrong, Uran?

292
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,599
<i>No! You have to stay away!</i>

293
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,147
Uran, I'm coming!

294
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,733
No.

295
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,611
Stay away!

296
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,994
Run, Uran!

297
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,829
Atom!

298
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,290
Take Bobby and get down to the basement!

299
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,334
- Okay, but what about--
<i>-</i> Go now!

300
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,465
What is that?

301
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,930
Atom, what is this?

302
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,223
Stand back, Uran!

303
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,025
Atom!

304
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:21,929
Atom.

305
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,475
Atom!

306
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,146
Atom!

307
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,484
Atom is

308
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,487
dead?

309
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,625
What's wrong, Gesicht?

310
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,758
You had another bad dream?

311
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,052
Yeah.

312
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,805
I'm okay, Helena.

313
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,598
Don't worry.

314
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,308
It's just...

315
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,479
it was different from the usual dream.

316
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,858
You should contact
Professor Hoffman in the morning.

317
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,903
Yeah, I'm sorry to make you worry.

318
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,447
Were you still awake?

319
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,658
Our trip starts tomorrow, you know?

320
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,911
There are a few drawings I need to finish
before we leave.

321
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,454
I see.

322
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,290
You're working hard.

323
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,125
Want me to stay with you for a bit?

324
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,128
Is something wrong?

325
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,922
No, it's nothing.

326
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,590
I'm okay now.

327
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,768
Damn it!

328
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,520
I can't stop shaking.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,233
He's just a robot!

330
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,739
Damn it.

331
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,993
I've tailed him for a while.
There's no mistaking it.

332
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,204
Adolf is trying to kill Gesicht.

333
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,001
That's not good.
We can't let Gesicht die now.

334
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,588
It must be public opinion
that kills Gesicht.

335
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,922
You are correct, sir.

336
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,926
Dispose of Adolf.

337
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,138
I'm sorry, Professor Hoffman.

338
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,350
I know how busy you are.

339
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,351
No worries.

340
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,062
So tell me about the dream
from last night.

341
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,774
Right. It was different
from the usual one.

342
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,151
A new dream, huh?

343
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,819
What was it about?

344
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,615
Well, I'm kind of afraid to revisit it,

345
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,035
so I've placed it in my trash box
and haven't opened it.

346
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,329
I think it's best that you don't open it.

347
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,747
You think so?

348
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,749
There's a chance that it's a virus.

349
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,335
Plus...

350
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,925
Professor?

351
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,177
Oh, uh,

352
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,390
when unpleasant memories come up,

353
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,142
we humans also put them
in our emotional trash cans.

354
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,561
Don't pay too much attention to it.

355
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,898
May I ask you another question, Professor?

356
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,194
There is a human
who's constantly monitoring me.

357
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,571
Monitoring you?

358
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,367
When I'm traveling in my car
or when I'm at home.

359
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,160
Is it some kind of stalker?

360
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,078
I'm not sure.

361
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,497
I'm sure your line of work

362
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,708
will generate all sorts
of emotional reactions from others.

363
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,383
But I highly doubt that this stalker
would follow you to Japan.

364
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,635
You're leaving tonight, aren't you?

365
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,345
Yes.

366
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,764
Relax and enjoy your time.

367
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,226
If this person is still bothering you
after you return,

368
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,686
we'll talk some more.

369
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,312
Until next time.

370
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,067
I'm looking forward
to hearing all about your trip,

371
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,570
like about the science
and technology in Japan.

372
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,749
<i>Director, that doesnâ€™t answer my question!</i>

373
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,752
Did you do something to him?
His artificial intelligence--

374
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,881
We made a huge investment
in Gesicht, you know!

375
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,803
All you need to do
is to maintain him properly.

376
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,764
That's all.

377
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,528
<i>Today, for sure.</i>

378
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,781
<i>I've got to do it today.</i>

379
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,077
<i>Before he goes on his trip.</i>

380
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,752
Change to Route 82.

381
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,880
To my brother's grave.

382
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,056
<i>Brother,</i>

383
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,017
<i>give me strength.</i>

384
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,896
<i>Give this coward the push he needs.</i>

385
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,491
What the...

386
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,955
<i>...passengers, please proceed to gate 68.</i>

387
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,915
How are you feeling?

388
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,918
What? Oh. I'm all better.

389
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,212
Really? That's a relief.

390
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,840
It's our first vacation in a long time.
Let's take it easy and relax.

391
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,883
Yes.

392
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,635
What's wrong?

393
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,595
I'm sorry. It's an emergency call.

394
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,806
Yes, this is Gesicht.

395
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,225
What, an explosion?

396
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,560
<i>Breaking news.</i>

397
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,852
WORLD-FAMOUS ROBOT ATOM IS DEAD

398
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,104
<i>According to the UPB Network,</i>

399
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,523
<i>around 2:00 a.m.
Central European Time last night...</i>

400
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,192
- And what kind of explosive was used?
- Dear...

401
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,735
Gesicht.

402
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,655
Um, excuse me for a moment.

403
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,159
- What's the matter?
- Look at the news.

404
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,622
<i>...the world-famous robot, Atom,
was confirmed dead.</i>

405
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,374
Atom is

406
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,376
dead?

407
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,963
<i>...around 2:00 a.m.
Central European Time last night,</i>

408
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,132
<i>or 10:00 a.m. local time...</i>

409
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,633
Dear?

410
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,510
Was it...

411
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,138
Was it him who did it?

412
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,639
Gesicht!

413
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,604
So he's still alive.

414
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,647
The dream last night!

415
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,024
Atom's time of death!

416
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,818
It wasn't a dream at all?

417
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,279
Unlock the trash box!

418
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,196
Dear...

419
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,702
<i>Gesicht...</i>

420
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,038
<i>Atom!</i>

421
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,456
<i>Gesicht...</i>

422
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,501
<i>You and Pluto are the same.</i>

423
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,673
<i>Are you the one who killed me?</i>

424
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,136
<i>You can have the whole body for 500 ZEUS.</i>

425
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,847
Gesicht!

426
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,891
Gesicht!

427
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,776
There's been an accident!

428
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,402
Someone call an ambulance!

429
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,822
Tobio.

430
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,200
Tobio!

431
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,124
You'll be fine.

432
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,210
Try and walk, Tobio.

433
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,049
Tobio walked!

434
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,012
He walked.

435
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,598
He walked, Gesicht.

436
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,155
The only ones here were children!

437
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,038
<i>- It keeps crashing!
- Artificial neurons are firing!</i>

438
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,458
<i>- There's no virus!
- Scan his memory and prepare to reformat--</i>

439
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,881
<i>Are you all right, Gesicht?</i>

440
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,426
Um, yes.

441
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,637
All functions are back to normal.

442
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,144
Just lie down and rest a little longer.

443
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,938
Gesicht, you collapsed at the airport--

444
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,356
<i>No, I have to go.</i>

445
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,734
<i>Go where?</i>

446
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,153
I'm getting an emergency call
from the station.

447
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,449
I'm so glad you're okay.

448
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,579
I'm sorry, Helena,
that our vacation turned out like this.

449
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,873
It's all right, dear.

450
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,084
I'll be back.

451
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,052
I know you must be worried.

452
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,514
Him going back to work
right after what happened.

453
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,976
No, I'm sure it's better for him
to go back to work

454
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,146
rather than going to Japan,
where Atom died.

455
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,610
I still can't believe that Atom is...

456
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,030
Let me ask you again, Mr. Haas.

457
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,492
You can't recall any reason why someone
might have a grudge against you?

458
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,204
Please stop asking
the same questions over and over!

459
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,291
But your car was blown up on purpose.

460
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,169
It was most definitely
an attempt on your life.

461
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,630
I'm telling you, I have no idea!

462
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,257
And the forensics report?

463
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,676
It was just as we had expected.

464
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,431
We found parts of an MZ-390
from the wreckage of his car.

465
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:13,603
A compact missile launcher that was
designated as an inhumane weapon.

466
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,813
What's his occupation?

467
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,857
He says he works in import and export.

468
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,275
Maybe an illegal arms dealer?

469
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,737
The bigger concern is who he's related to!

470
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,198
So tell us, Mr. Adolf Haas.

471
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,952
With all due respect, your brother was...

472
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,789
Don't you know
the Blomberg Civil Rights Law?

473
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,793
"Crimes committed by a suspect's relatives
cannot be used in questioning"!

474
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,545
That is illegal to ask me!

475
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,297
As ordered,
we will keep him under surveillance.

476
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,009
But, sir, Adolf Haas's brother was...

477
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,306
A weapon as severe
as the MZ-390 is mixed up in this case.

478
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,141
Do we have any other choice?

479
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,977
Yes, sir.

480
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,687
But at this rate...

481
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,731
Of all people, he's going to be...

482
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,610
The prosecutors are in the dark,
and so are the individuals involved.

483
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,324
There's no problem.
We are the only ones who know.

484
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,039
All right. That will be all for today.

485
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,096
He left for Japan already, damn it.

486
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,644
<i>Received at 8:23 p.m.</i>

487
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,399
<i>You didn't come home
last night either, dear. Are you okay?</i>

488
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,403
<i>I know you're busy with work,
but at least give me a call.</i>

489
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,491
<i>Received at 12:13 p.m.</i>

490
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,995
<i>For reasons you will understand,
I won't be sharing my image.</i>

491
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,957
<i>Adolf, this is a warning.</i>

492
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,375
<i>You are in danger.</i>

493
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,547
<i>Your actions have become
a liability for the organization.</i>

494
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,886
<i>The leader wants you disposed of.</i>

495
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,764
The leader?

496
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,266
He wants to dispose of me?

497
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,436
That bomb today...

498
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,188
<i>Received at 3:45 p.m.</i>

499
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,316
<i>Adolf.</i>

500
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,151
Leader!

501
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,779
<i>I heard you were targeted.</i>

502
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,573
This was right after the explosion.
How did he know?

503
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,535
<i>It's not safe outside.
You should stay put there.</i>

504
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,122
<i>We are all in this together.</i>

505
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,128
There could be another bomb right here!

506
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,665
I am Gesicht from Europol.

507
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,045
I've been assigned
as your personal protection.

508
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,594
Wow! And then what happened
to the bad guy?

509
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,558
Did you get him by shooting a rocket
out of your arm or something?

510
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,019
Dad!

511
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,355
Check this out, Dad! It's so cool.

512
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,691
He's a real super robot detective!

513
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,193
He's so nice too.

514
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,779
I've become a big fan!

515
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,449
Good morning.

516
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,785
Time to go.

517
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,162
Yes.

518
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,084
"A super robot detective"?
Give me a break.

519
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,295
Stop feeding my child stories, all right?

520
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,839
That was not my intention.

521
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,051
So how come
a world-class robot detective like you

522
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,511
was assigned to protect someone like me?

523
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,223
I'm only following orders.

524
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,684
Even if it meant giving up your trip?

525
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,439
How did you know that?

526
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,860
Your boss told me.

527
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,819
Mr. Haas,

528
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,155
do you hate robots?

529
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,578
I'm sorry that you ended up
being protected by a robot like me.

530
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,962
Let me check for any explosives here.

531
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,097
It's all clear. No abnormalities.

532
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,932
Right.

533
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,560
I've checked the entire office.

534
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,315
I'll be in the other room, so please
let me know if you need anything.

535
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,487
Brother.

536
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,157
If only I had the tools to destroy him!

537
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,701
He is so close!

538
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,371
Damn it!

539
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,377
I know that you cops think I'm suspicious.

540
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,753
Mr. Haas...

541
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:35,258
You think I did something sketchy
to deserve having my car blown up?

542
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:40,596
You keep saying you're here to protect,
but I know you're here to investigate!

543
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,809
Investigate me all you want.

544
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,810
You don't mind?

545
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,395
No.

546
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,523
But I want you out after you're done.

547
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,987
What do you handle
in your export-import business?

548
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,488
See for yourself.

549
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,368
You mainly handle
computer parts and systems.

550
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:09,000
You went to Persia
during the 39th Central Asian War.

551
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,169
So what?

552
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,963
Post-war reconstruction
provides opportunities.

553
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,966
Tens of thousands of businesses
took similar steps.

554
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:23,973
But not many companies can handle
Class A confidential projects like mine.

555
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,227
We are trusted
because of our steady track record.

556
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,150
TV, on.

557
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:39,530
<i>The body of renowned robotics expert
Ronald Newton-Howard</i>

558
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,825
<i>was found at dawn on the fifth
in a Canberra, Australia suburb.</i>

559
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,202
DR. NEWTON-HOWARD FOUND DEAD

560
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,412
<i>Dr. Howard was known
for his discovery of Photon Energy...</i>

561
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,247
Hey, listen, it's big news.

562
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,917
<i>...murder weapons
were placed on his head like horns...</i>

563
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,543
Hey, they said horns!

564
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,671
I received the report earlier.

565
00:36:56,172 --> 00:37:00,509
Wasn't Dr. Howard the scholar
who made Epsilon?

566
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,680
Don't you have to go?

567
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,476
A scholar who made
one of your friends got murdered.

568
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,187
My mission is right here.

569
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,900
I wonder if Epsilon would even be sad.

570
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,361
I'm sure he would.

571
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,946
He would?

572
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,822
A robot?

573
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,450
Then why don't you go visit him?

574
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,870
Go and comfort him, robot to robot, huh?

575
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,539
My mission is right here.

576
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,043
No matter how you look at it,
it's the same killer as the other cases!

577
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,754
Weren't you the designated agent
on the case?

578
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,507
Ever since then,
there have been several copycat murders.

579
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,594
We don't have conclusive evidence
they were committed by the same person.

580
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,097
Let me show you something interesting.

581
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,102
They mentioned
the Bora Inquiry Commission on TV earlier.

582
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,438
You know of Kara-Tepa Prison, don't you?

583
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,356
Yes.

584
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,860
<i>It's a prison in Persia
run by the United States of Thracia.</i>

585
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,281
<i>My company was contracted
to install all of its systems.</i>

586
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,199
<i>But there was a problem.</i>

587
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,493
<i>Someone tried to erase</i>

588
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,870
<i>surveillance footage
in solitary confinement,</i>

589
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,664
<i>so we were called in for maintenance.</i>

590
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,250
Initially, we thought
it would be an easy fix,

591
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,294
but it turned out to be rather serious.

592
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,089
We ended up having to swap out
some of the hard disk drives.

593
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,425
This is one of them.

594
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,302
Are you not interested?

595
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,636
I am.

596
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,347
What is that? A human voice?

597
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,599
This should clean it up a bit.

598
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,062
<i>Lanke. Tazaki.</i>

599
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,485
<i>Lanke. Tazaki. Howard.</i>

600
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,529
This footage is...

601
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,740
What do you think?

602
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,492
He's repeating people's names, right?

603
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,455
Repeating the names
of the murder victims like a curse.

604
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,375
Perhaps I can enhance it
with my image stabilization function.

605
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,336
Didn't I tell you?

606
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:03,215
You shouldn't be hanging out here,
protecting me.

607
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,884
Mr. Haas,

608
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,179
you do know what type of place
Kara-Tepa Prison is, don't you?

609
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,891
It's where they keep war criminals, right?

610
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,892
Correct.

611
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,353
The most dangerous ones at that.

612
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,731
Good, it's clearer now.

613
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,943
<i>Tazaki. Howard. Ochanomizu.</i>

614
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,653
Isn't this...

615
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,615
<i>Reinhardt. Lanke.</i>

616
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:32,661
Mr. Haas! Why did you keep
such important information to yourself?

617
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,206
It's nothing but a video
of some crazy inmate!

618
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,832
How would I know?

619
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,585
- Don't you know who this is?
- Huh?

620
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,463
He's the supreme leader
of the former Kingdom of Persia,

621
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,049
Darius XIV!

622
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,011
He has aged
from the long incarceration, but...

623
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,223
<i>Ochanomizu. Hoffman.</i>

624
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,682
Hoffman?

625
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,853
Coming!

626
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,232
Professor Hoffman is in danger!

627
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,788
My lab!

628
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,878
You're Epsilon!

629
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,507
Professor Hoffman, you're being targeted.

630
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,634
We must get you far from here.

631
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,721
Aren't you supposed to be
a pacifist robot?

632
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,348
This sure is rough treatment.

633
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,852
My creator was murdered.

634
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,942
I'm on the verge of losing control.

635
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,529
So?

636
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,615
Did you get a hold of Professor Hoffman?

637
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,869
No. I'm not sure where he is yet.

638
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,329
I asked for an emergency deployment.

639
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,166
Then why don't you go yourself?

640
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,710
Didn't he help bring you into this world?

641
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,379
I'm more concerned
about the data you have.

642
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,635
There is a possibility
that Darius XIV is involved in this case.

643
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,514
I'll have you submit it
as a crucial piece of evidence.

644
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,641
But...

645
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,479
Could it not be connected
to the attempt on your life as well?

646
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,898
Am I wrong?

647
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,407
Get down!

648
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,340
A Photo-Thermal Smart Bomb.

649
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,383
I've seen that before.

650
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,304
During the Central Asian War,
they instantly vaporized people...

651
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,264
Where did it come from?

652
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,768
Help me! I'll tell you everything!

653
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,980
I'll talk! Just get me
into the witness protection program!

654
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:11,195
I'm a member
of an anti-robot organization!

655
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,032
That is who's been trying to kill me.

656
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,492
They think I'm a traitor.

657
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,953
An anti-robot organization.

658
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,873
Remember that robot judge
who was killed in an explosion in Berlin?

659
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,792
That was our organization.

660
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,671
What made you become their target?

661
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,590
I promise I'll testify.

662
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,885
So, please, get me
into the witness protection program!

663
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,347
If we don't hurry,
they'll kill my wife and my son!

664
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,433
Please calm down, Mr. Haas.

665
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,813
It seems you're telling the truth.
I'll make arrangements right away.

666
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,276
We'll take your family into protective
custody too. Please rest assured.

667
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,362
Anyhow, we must leave here right away.

668
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,326
Adolf Haas is being protected by Gesicht.

669
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,204
Ironic, isn't it?

670
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,374
But now, it's only a matter of time.

671
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:09,295
Surely, Adolf will reveal information
about our organization.

672
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,216
Use this.

673
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,093
What is it, sir?

674
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,180
It's the same model that Adolf had.

675
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,311
Death to machines and death to traitors.

676
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,231
The safe house is just ahead.

677
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,650
You'll be safe there.

678
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,402
What about my wife and Hans?

679
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,447
We've secured them.
They're on their way here.

680
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,909
And Professor Hoffman?

681
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,622
We have not been able to locate him yet.

682
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,340
This is no distance to fly
while carrying a living person.

683
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,468
Have some water, Professor.

684
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,345
Thank you.

685
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,185
I needed to bring him this far
for his protection.

686
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,813
You don't want to fight,
so you're leaving him with me, huh?

687
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,943
It's fine. Just what I needed, actually.

688
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,697
With this much bait in one spot,
the enemy will be lured into the open.

689
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:24,411
I'm not sure how much I can rely
on someone who keeps running away,

690
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,955
even after his creator has been murdered.

691
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,711
Professor Hoffman,
there's something I'd like to ask you.

692
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,966
It's about the secret conference you
and two other scientists had at Kimberley.

693
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,677
Kimberley.

694
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,470
Seven years ago,

695
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:46,141
you met Dr. Ronald Newton-Howard there.

696
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,559
Oh, yes.

697
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,941
I had always wanted to meet
the inventor of Photon Energy, Dr. Howard.

698
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,112
And there was another scientist
at the conference, correct?

699
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,947
Yes.

700
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,617
A Japanese scientist who invented
the ultimate computerized brain,

701
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,577
<i>Dr. Tenma.</i>

702
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,539
What was the purpose of this conference?

703
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,418
We wanted to share our research
with each other.

704
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,669
"Share"?

705
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,588
Our hope was to create a robot

706
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,551
that could help end wars
and save the planet.

707
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,762
<i>Professor Hoffman,
the inventor of Zeronium,</i>

708
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,390
<i>Dr. Howard,
the discoverer of Photon Energy,</i>

709
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:30,769
<i>and Dr. Tenma, the leading authority
on computerized brains, gathered together.</i>

710
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,272
What happened at the conference?

711
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:38,318
Dr. Newton-Howard and I
put all of our cards on the table.

712
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,821
Everything.

713
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,739
However...

714
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,699
However?

715
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:48,162
Dr. Tenma didn't disclose his research.

716
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,292
This is what he said.

717
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,753
A perfect computerized brain...

718
00:45:56,336 --> 00:46:01,967
a perfect computerized brain will be
capable of suffering, hatred, and error.

719
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,512
Without revealing any of his research,

720
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,932
he understood all of ours in an instant.

721
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,100
He took it and ran?

722
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,770
It's not that simple!

723
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,733
Our research was not at the level
where he could just take it and run.

724
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,778
Yet, he understood it all in a glance.

725
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,615
We humans
call someone like him "a genius."

726
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,620
No, I suppose I should say
he was the one with the perfect brain.

727
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,417
As he was leaving,
he left us with these words.

728
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,836
Let this be a warning to you.

729
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,296
You should be careful.

730
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,801
Stop trying to make robots more human.

731
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,261
Something terrible will happen.

732
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,765
Though, it may already be too late.

733
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,689
Where is he now?

734
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,946
Where is Atom's creator, Dr. Tenma?

735
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,788
Patch me in, please.

736
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,748
<i>Who should I connect you to?</i>

737
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,209
To Dr. Tenma.

738
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,461
Dr. Tenma!

739
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:24,341
I've been put in charge as your successor
of the Ministry of Science.

740
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,759
My name is Ochanomizu.

741
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:31,765
It's regretful to see the creator
of the ultimate computerized brain

742
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,392
leave the Ministry of Science.

743
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,605
Computerized brains
are not something you create.

744
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,733
They grow.

745
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,862
Profound sorrow, frustration.

746
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,614
These are the things
that develop computerized brains.

747
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,993
To comply
with Article 13 of the Robot Laws,

748
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:55,706
robots are equipped with a control device
to suppress their emotions.

749
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,293
This hinders the growth
of their computerized brains.

750
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:04,756
But, Dr. Tenma, you created Atom,
an absolute masterpiece.

751
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,259
Atom?

752
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,303
A masterpiece?

753
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,682
Atom is...

754
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,519
a failure.

755
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,150
Tenma.

756
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,612
<i>I was unable to find
the line you were looking for.</i>

757
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,115
<i>I was unable to find
the line you were looking for.</i>

758
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,369
Dr. Tenma had withdrawn
from the main stage

759
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,331
and disappeared
into the underbelly of society.

760
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,211
When we set up
the conference at Kimberley,

761
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,214
all we could do was reach out to him
through the Internet,

762
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,008
knowing that he might not respond.

763
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,553
Looking back now,
I'm surprised that he even showed up.

764
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:56,558
Anyway, he's been missing ever since.

765
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,645
Do you think he came to warn you?

766
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,690
"Stop trying to make robots more human."

767
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,735
"Something terrible will happen."

768
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,197
Do you think he did it?

769
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:16,620
Do you think Dr. Tenma
actually built his ideal robot?

770
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,624
I think he did.

771
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,297
Detective Lieman, I've confirmed
that Professor Hoffman is safe.

772
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,383
Yes.

773
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,095
I just received word from Hercules.

774
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,972
Yes.

775
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,264
I'm glad that he's safe.

776
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,933
Truly.

777
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:42,437
And how goes the analysis
of the video data from Mr. Haas?

778
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,690
Hey, let me hear it too!

779
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,445
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

780
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,366
<i>It is footage of Darius XIV
at Kara-Tepa Prison.</i>

781
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,452
<i>And the words he keeps repeating</i>

782
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,706
<i>are the names of members
of the Bora Inquiry Commission.</i>

783
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,792
<i>Three of them have already been killed.</i>

784
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:08,588
<i>But we can't be sure if this is
an actual assassination order.</i>

785
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:13,802
Did Darius XIV have a grudge against
the Bora Inquiry Commission members?

786
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,137
<i>Yes.</i>

787
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,683
<i>After all, Persia was plunged into war
after the commission pulled out.</i>

788
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:25,480
But they never found any robots
of mass destruction in Persia, did they?

789
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,817
They found nothing,
yet Persia was attacked?

790
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,194
That must be why Darius hates them.

791
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,530
<i>I wouldn't say they found nothing.</i>

792
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,116
<i>This is classified information,</i>

793
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,202
<i>but included on a list of materials
that the commission found</i>

794
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,165
<i>is a special chip for creating
a highly advanced computerized brain.</i>

795
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,167
<i>Then again,</i>

796
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,920
<i>that does not prove they were
trying to develop a robot weapon.</i>

797
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,131
What is the model of this chip?

798
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,594
<i>Well, let's see.
It's called the Tenma chip.</i>

799
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,387
The Tenma chip.

800
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,555
<i>By the way, Mr. Haas.</i>

801
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,057
Yes?

802
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,770
<i>We're still investigating the anti-robot
organization that is targeting you,</i>

803
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,607
<i>but they may not be
the only ones who want you dead.</i>

804
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,486
<i>You were in possession
of such dangerous data, after all.</i>

805
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,448
<i>We'll ask about the details later.</i>

806
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,660
<i>For now, please head
to the safe house with Gesicht.</i>

807
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,622
How are my wife and son?

808
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,793
<i>They're in our protective custody,
so please rest assured.</i>

809
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,336
<i>I'm counting on you, Gesicht.</i>

810
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:30,921
Understood.

811
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,972
What's wrong?

812
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,557
I feel nauseous.

813
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,935
Let's take a break.

814
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,898
Let me check if the bathroom's safe--

815
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,863
No sign of weapons.

816
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:01,952
Inside is just a general-purpose
cleaning robot with no computerized brain.

817
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:10,877
It's occupied.

818
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,590
I said it's occupied!

819
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,301
What the hell?

820
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,512
Just a cleaning robot.

821
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,347
Message for you.

822
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,306
Huh?

823
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,017
If you want to save your family,

824
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,187
kill Gesicht.

825
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,110
I repeat. If you want to save your family,

826
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,612
kill Gesicht.

827
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,740
Mr. Haas!

828
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,502
Mr. Haas!

829
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,045
You have to stop, Mr. Haas!

830
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,430
I said stop!

831
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,567
There it is.

832
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,821
You've finally shown your true colors.

833
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,493
Did you have the same look
in your eyes back then?

834
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,495
Back then?

835
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:32,167
Is that how you looked when you did it?

836
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,002
What do you mean?

837
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:37,130
You're the one

838
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,341
who killed my brother!

839
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,767
<i>He is not a failure!</i>

840
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,939
Atom is a masterpiece,
the pinnacle of human technology!

841
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,857
Professor Ochanomizu.

842
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,903
You don't understand a thing
about computerized brains.

843
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,115
Frustration, intense hatred.

844
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,536
Seething hatred
that could lead one to murder.

845
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,830
These help computerized brains grow.

846
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,707
You're wrong.

847
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,544
Dr. Tenma, you are mistaken!

848
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,672
A brain that is capable of error.

849
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,424
That's what it means to be perfect.

850
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,887
And that is what will give birth to...

851
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,684
the Greatest Robot on Earth.

852
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,872
