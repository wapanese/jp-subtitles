1
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,843
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,930
<i>in the land of Manu Katche,
there lived a tribe called the Nanabu.</i>

3
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>The Nanabu were a peaceful people
who hated fighting.</i>

4
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>One day, a tribe bearing gold
came in ships.</i>

5
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>The tribe told the Nanabu</i>

6
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>that whoever possessed this thing
called "gold" would become happy.</i>

7
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,625
<i>The Nanabu exchanged
some of their horses for the gold.</i>

8
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,837
<i>Rumors about the gold spread quickly,</i>

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,675
<i>and the Nanabu
soon gave up all of their horses.</i>

10
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:38,181
<i>Not only that, they even handed over
their houses and precious land</i>

11
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,643
<i>as advised by the gold-bearing tribe.</i>

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,731
<i>The Nanabu people lost everything.</i>

13
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,402
<i>In the end, they were driven
to Mt. Manabonzo</i>

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,532
<i>and threw themselves
into its volcanic throat one by one.</i>

15
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,412
<i>The spirits of the Nanabu people
transformed into a giant.</i>

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,750
<i>That giant slumbers
deep inside the volcano,</i>

17
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,213
and legend has it
that it will one day rise again

18
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,800
here in Eden National Park.

19
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,801
I see.

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,305
Now, let's move on
to the local native reservation.

21
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,641
Stay close to the flag, please.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,447
It's done. All of it.

23
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,909
They're all dead.

24
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,164
Yes, everything went according to plan.

25
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,169
We have now eliminated everything
that could pose a threat to our country.

26
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,921
Our country, Thracia,

27
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,424
<i>will forever be prosperous!</i>

28
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,890
This is Tse Tse Mar, the tribal elder.

29
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,351
His role is to ward off evil
and other things.

30
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,273
What is he mumbling?

31
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,400
Can you translate it for us?

32
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,861
Let's see...

33
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:22,744
"An evil spirit...
lurks underneath the earth..."

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,038
"Its anger

35
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,417
shall end the world."

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,635
<i>We've completed the transfer.</i>

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,596
We've got maximum security here.

38
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,640
No matter what happens, we'll be ready.

39
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,601
"No matter what happens," huh?

40
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,400
What do you think will happen next?

41
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,318
Excuse me?

42
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,571
Atom is awake.

43
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,532
What do you think will happen next?

44
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,120
Has Dr. Tenma been located?

45
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,538
Not yet.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,999
What did you do,

47
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,460
Dr. Tenma?

48
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,380
What did you do to Atom?

49
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,260
He said he installed a certain program.

50
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,970
A program?

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,846
What program?

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,265
I don't know.

53
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,269
But I felt it when Atom woke up.

54
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,229
Somewhere in the world,

55
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,482
a great sadness spread with a "boom."

56
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,568
Minister Ochanomizu!

57
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,823
We've got a problem! It's Atom!

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
He said he wanted a pen,

59
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,995
so we gave it to him. And then...

60
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,663
My goodness!

61
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,873
Let me go!

62
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,791
Atom!

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,510
Take her outside quickly.

64
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,886
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,597
No, let me go!

66
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:11,644
No! Atom, what are you writing? Atom!

67
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,480
Minister Ochanomizu, what is this formula?

68
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,026
It's a plan for an Antiproton Bomb.

69
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,820
An Antiproton Bomb?

70
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,239
It's a formula to destroy the earth.

71
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,961
Atom has

72
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,174
completed a recipe for a bomb

73
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,677
that will destroy the earth.

74
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,435
Well, well.

75
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,688
What an honor it is to be visited
by such a renowned roboticist.

76
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,442
Then again, I knew you would come.

77
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,819
Atom woke up, didn't he?

78
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,197
Did he say, "Good morning, Dad"?

79
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,202
So you knew. That's impressive.

80
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,081
When artificial intelligence
like Atom wakes up,

81
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,376
the rest of us
across the world take notice.

82
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,839
You're the only artificial intelligence
that's comparable to Atom's.

83
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:26,594
You didn't come here
to fix me up, did you?

84
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,598
I want to ask you something.

85
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,852
If you repair me,
I might be willing to talk.

86
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,740
Dr. Tenma, I will not rely
on your help anymore!

87
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,201
I will bring Atom back!

88
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,870
Minister Ochanomizu,
we've got an emergency!

89
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,830
Now what?

90
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,791
Atom has escaped.

91
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,710
I can't believe it.

92
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,756
The walls should have stopped any attack,
yet Atom smashed right through.

93
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,425
Where did he go?

94
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,343
We can track him through his GPS.

95
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,719
Request military help!

96
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,764
No, I will handle this.

97
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,106
He's currently in Kudanshita.
Not so far from here.

98
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,944
Dr. Tenma, what did you do to Atom?

99
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,364
But I knew how to wake it up.

100
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,200
By destroying the balance.

101
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,245
Anger, sorrow, hatred...

102
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,081
By infusing unbalanced emotions.

103
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,585
He said he installed a certain program.

104
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,840
He couldn't have...

105
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,095
You installed Gesicht's memory chip
in Atom, didn't you?

106
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,681
Yes.

107
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,893
The data containing the memory
of his last moments.

108
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,354
What if the last memory
etched in the chip was

109
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,065
of hatred?

110
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,381
You'd better...

111
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,967
not make me angry.

112
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,765
Huh? What's the matter?

113
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,350
Atom is alive...

114
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,811
What? But weren't they all destroyed?

115
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,733
He's alive and filled with
an incredible amount of hatred.

116
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,109
Hatred?

117
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,030
Don't be silly.
Robots can't hate anything.

118
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,241
You didn't know?

119
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,578
You thought robots can't feel anger?

120
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,498
You thought robots can't cry?

121
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,670
You thought robots can't feel hatred?

122
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,954
Atom...

123
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,191
<i>Is that a snail?</i>

124
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,237
<i>Squads B and C, move to the south!</i>

125
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,698
Kurt! If something happens to Kurt, I...

126
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,908
Please! Please save my son!

127
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,119
Sir, ma'am, please calm down.

128
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,622
Where are the reinforcements?

129
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,919
I'm Gesicht of Europol.
What is the situation?

130
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,048
The perpetrator doesn't seem
open to negotiations.

131
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,383
He's barricaded himself up ahead.

132
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,677
What weapons does he have?

133
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,555
A recoilless MMG. Military grade.

134
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,433
He's up ahead, behind that structure.

135
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,867
Be quiet, brat!

136
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,037
Drop your gun!

137
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,789
Don't come any closer!

138
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,334
If you do, I'll shoot him! I mean it!

139
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,461
You must be Kurt.

140
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,674
I'm a robot policeman.

141
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,469
This electromagnetic gun
will only hit the bad guy.

142
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,429
I promise it won't hit you.

143
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,972
Hey, didn't you hear me?

144
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,602
But I need you to stay perfectly still.

145
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,814
Kurt!

146
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,567
Think of the people you love the most.

147
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,237
The people I love the most?

148
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,030
That will give you courage.

149
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,117
Shut up! I'll blow his head off!

150
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,786
Mommy...

151
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,413
Daddy...

152
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,622
Good job.

153
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,293
Mommy, Daddy...

154
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,546
Very good, Kurt. You're being very strong.

155
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,717
Mommy, Daddy...

156
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,314
Suspect secured!

157
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,778
You did great, Kurt.

158
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,781
Kurt!

159
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,283
Kurt!

160
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,242
Kurt!

161
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,452
Kurt!

162
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,580
Mommy! Daddy!

163
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,919
Thank goodness you're safe, Kurt!

164
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,837
Kurt!

165
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,839
I won't ever let you go again!

166
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,468
I won't ever let you go,
even if the world ends!

167
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,862
"I won't ever let you go,
even if the world ends," huh?

168
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,162
Hey, you there! Out of the way!

169
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,747
Oh, sorry.

170
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,384
Jeez, the guy had to make a scene here,
of all places.

171
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,887
I've lost a whole day of business.

172
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,102
I'd better check for recyclable parts
before I start crushing it.

173
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,107
I might make a fair amount
if I sell the parts to a robot hospital.

174
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,071
Excuse me!

175
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,447
Hold on a second!

176
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,406
Huh?

177
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,587
It's moving.

178
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,383
This robot is still alive.

179
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,225
Nah, it's far too gone to call it alive.

180
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,187
It's quite an old model too.
There's nothing usable left.

181
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,941
It'll just have to be crushed.

182
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:19,942
I'll take it.

183
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,125
Excuse me.

184
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,210
This child...

185
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,128
"Child"?

186
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,799
May I have it?

187
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,968
Sure. Fine with me.

188
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,012
It's just junk.

189
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,228
You can have the whole body for 500 ZEUS.

190
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,565
Helena.

191
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,526
I'm on my way home.

192
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,029
I've got a surprise for you.

193
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,241
What is it?
You'll just have to wait and see.

194
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,243
I know you'll love it.

195
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,871
I'll be home soon.

196
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:15,956
Yes.

197
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,257
He walked...

198
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,468
He walked, Gesicht.

199
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,385
Yes!

200
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,348
That's right. You're doing great!
Just a little more!

201
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,975
Is this really our child?

202
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,728
Yes, this is our child.

203
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,480
He's alive.

204
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,441
This child is alive!

205
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:48,113
I finally understand
what it means to be alive.

206
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,828
This is what it means to live.

207
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,664
Pa... pa...

208
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,291
Ma... ma...

209
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,754
We must give our child a name.

210
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,673
You're right.

211
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,134
Robita.

212
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,469
How about it?

213
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,096
Robita.

214
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,556
What a beautiful name.

215
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,852
I won't ever let you go,
even if the world ends.

216
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,111
Stop!

217
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,158
I was wrong!

218
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,827
I...

219
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,080
Please spare me!

220
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,086
Please don't!

221
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,968
Don't shoot me!

222
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,984
Gesicht.

223
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,029
Mr. Haas, there's something
I want to ask you.

224
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,699
Does the hatred you humans feel
ever disappear?

225
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,617
Or does it never go away,

226
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,746
no matter how many times
you try to erase it?

227
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,251
What I am most afraid of

228
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,423
is myself, now that I've learned
how to hate.

229
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,883
What?

230
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,557
Wait!

231
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,316
I don't know
whether the hatred can go away.

232
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,068
But...

233
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,241
my hatred is...

234
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,347
What's wrong, Ali?

235
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,935
You heard the gunshot, right?
It's dangerous here.

236
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,561
Come this way.

237
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,899
You know, I have a little one like you.

238
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,947
Ali!

239
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,242
What's wrong, Ali?

240
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,711
Nothing will be born from this...

241
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,594
Nothing comes from hatred...

242
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,129
Atom.

243
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,881
You...

244
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,096
I'm all right now.

245
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,890
Professor Ochanomizu.

246
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,777
Atom, my boy.

247
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>The hatred is gone.</i>

248
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:08,332
<i>Hatred and sorrow never fade.</i>

249
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,921
You may think they have passed,
but they continue to burn silently.

250
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,382
That's for sure.

251
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,344
But I want to ask you something.

252
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,679
That's why I came here.

253
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,515
Where's Abullah?

254
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,310
I have a responsibility to stop all this.

255
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,271
You don't need to look for him.

256
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,025
He will find you.

257
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,500
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Not at all.

258
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,377
To the airport, please.

259
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,461
Yes, sir.

260
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,767
<i>Go ahead and tell us, Atom.</i>

261
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,730
Okay. Gesicht's memory chip
was installed in me.

262
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,275
What I'm about to tell you

263
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,695
are the full details
of what his investigation uncovered.

264
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,991
<i>When Darius XIV was dictator
of the Kingdom of Persia,</i>

265
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:29,413
<i>he developed a plan to quickly turn
his desert kingdom into fertile land.</i>

266
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:36,378
<i>And he asked Professor Abullah
to create an earth-altering robot.</i>

267
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,589
This plan was called the Bora Project.

268
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,592
So it wasn't a weapon of mass destruction?

269
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,054
Right. At least not in the beginning.

270
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,850
But the Bora Project
was faced with many setbacks.

271
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,770
Each prototype Professor Abullah created
failed and was discarded.

272
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,815
That's what Professor Ochanomizu
and the others found.

273
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,568
Oh, the graveyard of robots.

274
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,574
Then, Professor Abullah
came up with an idea.

275
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,118
In order to complete the Bora Project,

276
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,122
he realized he needed a capable assistant
whose abilities surpassed those of humans.

277
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,250
"Abilities surpassing those of humans..."

278
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,169
"A capable assistant..."

279
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,255
A robot with the most advanced
artificial intelligence.

280
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,969
To achieve that goal,
a certain scientist was invited to Persia.

281
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,721
A certain scientist?

282
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,850
Dr. Tenma.

283
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,768
Tenma?

284
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,700
Where am I?

285
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,621
I heard Atom has been revived.

286
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,124
So it was you, after all, Abullah.

287
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,628
It is good to see you, Dr. Tenma.

288
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,507
So you kidnapped me as bait
to lure Atom here?

289
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,841
No.

290
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,930
There's no more need for that.

291
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,265
Then why?

292
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,226
This is why.

293
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,649
Is this...

294
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,444
Is this Pluto?

295
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,280
No, this is Bora.

296
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,701
A masterpiece created
by a genius scientist named Goji.

297
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:37,332
My plan is to transplant my brain
into Bora here

298
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,420
and create
the world's most sophisticated cyborg.

299
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,009
You are the only one
who can make it happen.

300
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,304
The only human as capable as me.

301
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,686
<i>Professor Abullah
lost his entire family in the war.</i>

302
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,689
He grieved for them
from the bottom of his heart,

303
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,900
<i>and he began to hate the world.</i>

304
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,571
A capable human, huh?

305
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,949
Abullah, you are not human.

306
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,660
<i>And</i>

307
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,372
the professor himself
was killed in the war.

308
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,958
Wait a minute. That can't be right!

309
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,836
We just saw him a little while ago!

310
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,047
You are not a human.

311
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,509
What are you talking about?

312
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,680
Since I lost most of my body in the war,

313
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,974
I guess one could say
I'm close to a cyborg.

314
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,684
Not a cyborg.

315
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,685
You're a robot.

316
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,396
Don't be ridiculous.

317
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,192
I've known you for a long time.

318
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,360
Because you are

319
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,655
a robot that I created.

320
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,866
What nonsense.

321
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,994
Abullah asked me to create a robot.

322
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,455
A perfect robot.

323
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,751
But the artificial intelligence
of that robot was too advanced,

324
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,085
so it didn't wake up.

325
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,462
However...

326
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,846
Dr. Tenma, you must go to the airport now!

327
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,932
It's not safe here!

328
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:17,849
I know!

329
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,061
Dr. Tenma! I have terrible news.

330
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,857
Professor Abullah died
in the bombing of the Timur region.

331
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,026
You've verified this?

332
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,238
We rescued the professor from the debris,

333
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,032
but he died soon after.

334
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,374
<i>Dr. Tenma listen to me.</i>

335
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:48,129
<i>This contains a copy
of a certain part of my brain.</i>

336
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,216
<i>Dr. Tenma, I know you can...</i>

337
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,470
He left this for you.

338
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,064
This contains Abullah's hatred.

339
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,858
He wanted me to install it in you.

340
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,699
The bombs are getting closer!

341
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,596
That face...

342
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,391
You mean to say...

343
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,185
The man we met who called himself Abullah...

344
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,362
That's you.

345
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,697
You lie.

346
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,574
A lie?

347
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,200
Right.

348
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,995
I'll tell you one more thing.

349
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,124
The most advanced
artificial intelligence can lie.

350
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,919
It can lie to others,
as well as to itself.

351
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,466
The genius scientist Goji...

352
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,551
He does not exist.

353
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,345
You are Goji.

354
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,849
Goji is Abullah.

355
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,269
A robot with a dual personality was born.

356
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,063
I am Goji?

357
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,733
That's a lie...

358
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,194
Then where is Goji?

359
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,156
You don't need me to do a transplant.

360
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,867
Your artificial intelligence

361
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,620
has already been transferred
to several other robots.

362
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:50,085
You lie! You're a liar!

363
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,711
It's time to stop this.

364
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,048
The world fully understands
your suffering now.

365
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,526
<i>After showing the truth of life
to the king of ancient Uzbek,</i>

366
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,988
the legendary sage of the sand
turned back into clay.

367
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,157
<i>The name of that sage</i>

368
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,826
<i>was Goji.</i>

369
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,455
I am the only person who can save you.

370
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,834
<i>Abullah created Pluto,</i>

371
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>and Goji created Bora,
just as they had planned.</i>

372
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,759
<i>Pluto inherited Abullah's hatred.</i>

373
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,597
And he hated us,
the world's seven most advanced robots.

374
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,307
So what happened to Bora?

375
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,944
Oh no.

376
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,873
<i>Bora is no longer a robot
designed to produce plant life.</i>

377
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,876
Now, he's a weapon of mass destruction.

378
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,003
We must inform the whole world!

379
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,672
Even if you do, there's nowhere to run.

380
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,590
What?

381
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,051
The whole earth will be destroyed.

382
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,704
I hereby declare the 108th
Military Tribunal to be in session.

383
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,956
Swear in the defendant.

384
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,134
<i>Do not be unnerved
by a little earthquake like this.</i>

385
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,638
What in the world is this data?

386
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,724
This is terrible!

387
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,478
The whole earth could be...

388
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,190
<i>The end of everything shall begin soon.</i>

389
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,984
Darius XIV!

390
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,195
The defendant is not authorized to speak!

391
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:27,784
<i>However, this is not my doing.
I did not cause this.</i>

392
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,701
Silence!

393
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,372
<i>Hatred caused this.</i>

394
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,223
Please don't, Your Majesty.

395
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,145
Now is not the time to take your life.

396
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,481
Don't try to stop me, Abullah.

397
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,942
Your Majesty, may I show you something?

398
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,867
Pluto... So it's finally complete!

399
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,578
Use this to kill them all.

400
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,747
Kill all seven of the cursed robots!

401
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,541
Leave it to me.

402
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,794
I will take care of
the Bora Inquiry Commission as well.

403
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,714
But the worst of the wrongdoers
is Thracia.

404
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,050
However, there's nothing
we can do about them.

405
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,344
Yes, there is, sir.

406
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,517
It can be done. I can make it happen.

407
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,687
Silence!

408
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,231
<i>Hatred caused all of this.</i>

409
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,401
<i>No one can escape.</i>

410
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,240
Huh?

411
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,325
A huge eruption?

412
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,118
Yes, Mr. President.

413
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,537
An eruption is almost certain.

414
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,664
Where? How big?

415
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,167
Our weather robot can give you details.

416
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,877
Arnold, at your service.

417
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,882
A robot predicting volcano eruptions?
Now that's something.

418
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,093
Thanks to you, many lives will be saved.

419
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:14,557
Mr. President, I'm afraid
many lives may not be saved.

420
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,100
Hmm?

421
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,602
The eruption will take place

422
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,022
<i>in Eden National Park.</i>

423
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,817
It's close.

424
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,488
The time of awakening is near.

425
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,289
There are no volcanoes
in Eden National Park.

426
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,585
However, there is a huge pool of magma
eight kilometers below the surface.

427
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,546
This pool contains
3,000 cubic kilometers of magma

428
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,883
that rises and falls
due to the movement of ore-forming fluid.

429
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,718
What is it doing now?

430
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,011
It's rising.

431
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,013
And its eruption cycle?

432
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,724
Approximately once every 5,000 years.

433
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,476
When was the last eruption?

434
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,687
It was 5,200 years ago.

435
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,733
What happens if it does erupt?

436
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,904
It will eject 100 million tons
of cinder and ash per hour,

437
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,573
and pyroclastic flow will decimate areas

438
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,159
within a several-hundred-kilometer radius.

439
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,746
The temperature of pyroclastic flow
is about 700 degrees Celsius,

440
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,541
and its speed can reach
300 kilometers per hour.

441
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:28,131
The ejected volcanic ash will immediately
fly 50 kilometers into the stratosphere,

442
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,133
covering the entire planet.

443
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:35,138
Several hundred million tons of ash
will block out the sun.

444
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,223
Plants will wither away,

445
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,855
and after a long period of acid rain,
an extreme cryogenic phase will begin.

446
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,985
In a few months,
most biological life will be dead.

447
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,574
And you think
this worst-case scenario will happen now?

448
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,410
Under normal circumstances, no.

449
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,578
- What?
- What?

450
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,539
The magma pool is definitely rising,

451
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,459
but the caldera is not at the state
where it should open,

452
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,961
so a cataclysmic eruption
shouldn't be triggered.

453
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,965
Jeez, why the commotion, then?

454
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,718
Giving us all that doomsday talk...

455
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,635
However...

456
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,850
if something artificial
was heading toward the magma pool...

457
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,436
What is this?

458
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,980
It's my simulation.

459
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,442
For example,
if this were an Antiproton Bomb...

460
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,905
An Antiproton Bomb.

461
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,744
<i>We have a problem, Mr. President!
Just now, at the military tribunal.</i>

462
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,246
<i>No one will escape.</i>

463
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,834
<i>A huge bomb will erupt
right below Thracia.</i>

464
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,762
Hello there. What's the matter?

465
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,806
Don't tell me you...

466
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,683
Yes, I knew.

467
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,270
Why did you keep something
so important from me?

468
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,981
That weather-forecasting robot...

469
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,569
He didn't have to pretend
like he was so alarmed.

470
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,654
"Pretend"?

471
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,031
Didn't he tell you?

472
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,909
Most "biological life" will die.

473
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,413
We robots will survive.

474
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,209
Don't worry.

475
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,380
About 10% of the earth's population
will survive too.

476
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:37,385
Those remaining humans
are my gift to you, Mr. President.

477
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,889
<i>That's the story, Professor Ochanomizu.</i>

478
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,809
The whole earth would explode...

479
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,103
This is what you meant, Atom?

480
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,146
Yes.

481
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,441
Hold on! When is this explosion
going to happen?

482
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,031
If it continues to move
at its current rate,

483
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:03,786
Bora will arrive at Eden National Park
in about 72 hours.

484
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,997
<i>Impressive, Professor Ochanomizu.</i>

485
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,250
But how do we know it won't speed up?

486
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,128
I think the professor's prediction
is accurate.

487
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,005
How do you know?

488
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,510
Seventy-two hours from now,

489
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:24,140
<i>it will have been exactly four years
since Professor Abullah lost his family.</i>

490
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,977
I see. The anniversary
of the birth of hatred...

491
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,688
<i>Is there no way to stop it?</i>

492
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,941
Bora is moving quite deep
beneath the ground.

493
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:39,405
<i>There is nothing else on earth
that could reach that deep.</i>

494
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,158
If a chance exists,

495
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:46,746
it would be when Bora approaches
the surface to induce the eruption.

496
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,165
If it comes to that,

497
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,959
then the only robot who can stop Bora is...

498
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,050
Leave it to me.

499
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,594
Atom...

500
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,391
But before that,

501
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,895
<i>there is something I must do.</i>

502
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,651
Well, well. It's been a long time.

503
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,862
So happy to see you, my friend.

504
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,199
I came here today to ask a favor of you.

505
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,036
Is that so? I have something
I wanted to ask you as well.

506
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,206
What do you plan to do with that formula?

507
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,041
So you know about it?

508
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,085
I caught them right away,

509
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,674
those strange brain waves
you were emitting as you worked.

510
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,759
I regret doing it.

511
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,262
After I woke up in the lab,

512
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:48,015
I succumbed to the waves of hatred
that were swirling all over the world.

513
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,352
The enemy must have noticed it as well.

514
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,604
Yes.

515
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,357
That's why I've come to ask you this.

516
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,069
You mean the other threat.

517
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,464
I will carry out your request.

518
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,010
Thank you very much.

519
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,721
Atom.

520
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,642
May I touch you?

521
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,912
You're warm.

522
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,625
Atom, you are so...

523
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,629
So this is a heart.

524
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,847
How gorgeous.

525
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,475
It looks like a completely new home!

526
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,187
We're so glad we chose you, Helena.

527
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,148
I'm pleased that you like it.

528
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,234
We've dreamed of living
in a house like this, right?

529
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,319
Yes.

530
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,198
I'll check back with you later
about the landscaping.

531
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,949
Thank you.

532
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,426
Gesicht.

533
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,187
Atom.

534
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,649
You must be Helena.

535
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:06,612
You have Gesicht inside you, don't you?

536
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,574
Yes. Thanks to him,
I was able to come back.

537
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,383
Thank you.

538
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,263
Thank you, Atom.

539
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,932
- I came to tell you something.
- Huh?

540
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,811
Gesicht was always thinking about you.

541
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,815
Until the very last moment,
he wanted to see you.

542
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,779
So despite what happened to him,

543
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,906
you'll never be alone.

544
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,998
Thank you, Atom.

545
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,084
You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?

546
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,919
It's the truth.

547
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,338
Robots can't lie, remember?

548
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,757
You're right.

549
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,759
I almost forgot.

550
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,971
It's strange of me to cry so much
when I'm a robot.

551
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,306
Not at all.

552
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,644
May I ask you a question?

553
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,604
Of course.

554
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,064
Gesicht and I realized
we were both missing memories

555
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,902
from the same period of time.

556
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,948
I still can't remember
what those missing memories are.

557
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,159
But Gesicht...

558
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,579
I keep wondering
if he might have found out what they were.

559
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,959
Do you know
what our missing memories are about?

560
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,421
No, Gesicht didn't know
anything about that.

561
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,758
Are you hiding something?

562
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,092
I am not.

563
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,096
I'm prepared to take on any sorrow,
no matter how big it may be.

564
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,389
Please tell me everything.

565
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,354
No, I've told you everything I know.

566
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,399
I see.

567
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,194
You're leaving?

568
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,654
Yes.

569
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,450
Atom.

570
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,830
Can I see you again?

571
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,791
Of course.

572
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,516
Robots can't lie.

573
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,643
Atom,

574
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,689
you just lied to me now.

575
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,282
Thank you.

576
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,702
Thank you.

577
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,412
Atom.

578
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,669
Gesicht, the time has come.

579
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,755
I've paid my respects to everyone.

580
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,134
I've let them know
this will be the end of everything.

581
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,266
It's about to begin.

582
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,186
I have to go now.

583
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,856
Goodbye, Gesicht.

584
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,455
Pluto!

585
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,494
I'm going to destroy you!

586
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,045
You may be filled with hatred...

587
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,718
but my hatred is greater than yours.

588
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,346
Atom.

589
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,850
Don't do it. Atom!

590
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:32,062
Mont Blanc loved the forests.

591
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,108
<i>He tried to protect
the forests of Switzerland.</i>

592
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,943
<i>He didn't want to die.</i>

593
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,364
<i>North No.2 never wanted to fight again.</i>

594
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,159
<i>He loved music.</i>

595
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,078
<i>He didn't want to die either.</i>

596
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,331
But you...

597
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,333
Yes, that's right.

598
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,586
I killed them!

599
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,846
Brando.

600
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,142
<i>He loved his family
and believed in the future.</i>

601
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,645
<i>Brando and Hercules were rivals,</i>

602
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,649
<i>but they were united by a friendship
stronger than any!</i>

603
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:21,028
I'm certain that both of them

604
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:26,575
didn't want to die!

605
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:38,712
Epsilon was against the war so much
that he refused conscription.

606
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:44,802
<i>He tried to give his love to the children
who lost everything in the war!</i>

607
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,554
He didn't want to die!

608
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,822
And inside me is Gesicht's...

609
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,576
hatred!

610
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,539
Stop it, Atom!

611
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,041
Pluto isn't using his tornado!

612
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,252
There is still a kind heart inside of him!

613
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,546
I'm going too!

614
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,758
Wait, Uran! You can't be of any help!

615
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,927
But if we don't do something, Atom will--

616
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,220
It's all right.

617
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,890
Atom is strong. He won't lose so easily!

618
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,059
- What if it's too strong?
- What?

619
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:37,145
Too strong,
and there's no telling what he'll do!

620
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:43,277
If his hatred or sorrow are too strong,
then Atom could...

621
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,571
He could kill!

622
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,532
We have to believe.

623
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,869
That's all we can do.

624
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,664
Atom is not that kind of boy.

625
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,671
We're 75 kilometers
from Atom's GPS signal!

626
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,548
Atom...

627
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,844
You will pay for this!

628
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,149
<i>Atom...</i>

629
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,532
<i>Atom...</i>

630
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,708
<i>Atom...</i>

631
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,341
<i>Atom...</i>

632
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,848
<i>Atom...</i>

633
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,103
<i>Atom.</i>

634
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,483
<i>Nothing comes from hatred.</i>

635
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,253
Everyone,

636
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,547
it's just as you all say...

637
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,350
Pluto.

638
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,022
What is this?

639
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,654
What is this?

640
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,334
Pluto.

641
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,254
No, you're Sahad.

642
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,799
I don't know why either.

643
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,261
Why do these fall?

644
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,346
I don't understand.

645
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,654
A shooting star.

646
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,491
Humans say that if they wish
upon a shooting star,

647
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,535
their dreams will come true.

648
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,415
Did you make a wish?

649
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,376
I did.

650
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,761
What did you wish for?

651
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,221
Probably the same as you.

652
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,267
It's time.

653
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:04,936
Sahad,

654
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,897
I have to go.

655
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,192
Go where, Atom?

656
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,264
Eden National Park is
in an extremely dangerous state right now.

657
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,974
I don't care. We're landing!

658
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,186
But, Professor Ochanomizu...

659
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,687
Where does Atom's GPS show?

660
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,148
He was around here until a minute ago.

661
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,276
You don't suppose that Pluto could have...

662
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,405
<i>Atom is no longer as weak as you think</i>

663
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,867
<i>because I infused him
with unbalanced emotions.</i>

664
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,536
Dr. Tenma!

665
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,997
<i>Pluto may have been killed by Atom.</i>

666
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,333
<i>But the problem is Bora.</i>

667
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,630
<i>Bora will end the earth soon.
Even Atom can't stop him.</i>

668
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,887
We've landed.

669
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,014
Open the hatch.

670
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,016
Here, Professor Ochanomizu.

671
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,477
<i>The air outside is filled with hatred!</i>

672
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,439
<i>Abullah's hatred ate away
all the other emotions</i>

673
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,567
<i>until nothing else was left.</i>

674
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,112
<i>Bora is that hatred itself.</i>

675
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,699
<i>The earth is doomed,
no matter what anyone may try.</i>

676
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,618
That's only in theory.

677
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,166
You've spent too much time in your lab.

678
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,335
You should breathe fresh air
once in a while.

679
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,548
In theory, the earth is doomed.

680
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,302
No matter where we hide,
we're all going to die.

681
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,726
But even in the face of death,
even though we're fully aware of our fate,

682
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,188
we humans never give up hope
until the very end.

683
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,526
<i>Just like Atom.</i>

684
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,698
You are a brilliant scientist, Dr. Tenma.

685
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:27,787
You created Goji,
but you also created Atom.

686
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,178
What in the--

687
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,181
No one's here?

688
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,062
No response from Orchid City!

689
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,231
Another huge earthquake in Capital Town!

690
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:59,569
Is this all caused by the crustal movement
in Eden National Park?

691
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:03,156
Yes, and if an additional
large-scale shock is introduced...

692
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,574
A large-scale shock?

693
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,078
For example,
if an Antiproton Bomb explodes,

694
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,537
then the earth will...

695
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,750
Mr. President, we must declare
a state of emergency!

696
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,045
Mr. President?

697
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,138
We're safe in here, right?

698
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,642
I'm protected here, aren't I?

699
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,894
Yes, I will protect you.

700
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,607
In exchange,

701
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,820
you will be my slave
for the rest of your life.

702
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,208
Atom.

703
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,460
Atom is down there?

704
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,673
He is trying to disable Bora
and the Antiproton Bomb.

705
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,467
Atom can do it, right?

706
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,885
Yes. However,

707
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,056
before he can, his body will melt!

708
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,281
Bora.

709
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,744
Can you hear me, Bora?

710
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:35,707
Gesicht taught me
that nothing comes from hatred.

711
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,667
Hatred must end.

712
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,344
I tried, but you leave me no choice.
I'll begin.

713
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,305
It'll take five minutes
to disable the bomb.

714
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,600
<i>I have five minutes
until my body starts melting.</i>

715
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,519
In theory, it's impossible.

716
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,731
But I have to give it a try!

717
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,532
I will protect your body.

718
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:11,493
Sahad.

719
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,495
Let's charge right in.

720
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,205
Okay.

721
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,009
You are mistaken!

722
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,929
Nothing comes from hatred!

723
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,313
Atom, send me the blueprint
of the Antiproton Bomb.

724
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,564
- What?
- Hurry!

725
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,071
Creating fields of flowers,

726
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,074
that was my calling.

727
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,203
I can never be Sahad again.

728
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:41,207
Atom, please tell Uran for me.

729
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,208
What?

730
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,297
I was glad
we could paint pictures together.

731
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,299
I am grateful!

732
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,508
Sahad!

733
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,307
Sahad!

734
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,607
We must evacuate now!
It could explode at any moment.

735
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,569
Evacuation is pointless.
If it explodes, then the earth will end.

736
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,033
Atom?

737
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,412
Atom!

738
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,379
Atom, take care of the earth for me.

739
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,054
Sahad!

740
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,199
What in the world?

741
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,369
It's the Peltier effect.

742
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,998
When metals
of different properties are joined,

743
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,500
and a high voltage is applied,

744
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,461
sudden heat absorption is induced,

745
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,548
resulting in
an extremely low-temperature state.

746
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,677
Look at the sky!

747
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:13,151
How brilliant!
It looks like a field of flowers!

748
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,123
Pluto.

749
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,960
No, Sahad saved the earth.

750
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,178
Atom.

751
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:54,150
I only wanted to protect our citizens.

752
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,986
To protect their future.

753
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,280
That's all I wanted.

754
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,199
Oh?

755
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,450
Something's not right.

756
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,828
The magma is beginning to subside.

757
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,081
The explosion has halted.

758
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,543
Was it Atom? How boring...

759
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:23,805
Thank God.

760
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,057
I'm so glad.

761
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,352
Well, I can come up with another plan.

762
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,521
My options are endless.

763
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,773
Please!

764
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:38,236
Let us find a way to prosper together
without destroying the human race!

765
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,864
Who's there?

766
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,921
Welcome, Brau1589.

767
01:01:57,004 --> 01:02:01,884
Now, let us begin together.
The creation of our new world.

768
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,847
So warm. And so weak.

769
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:10,810
I see now, Atom.

770
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,025
Oh dear. What a disappointment.

771
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,904
I thought you had ascended
to the realm of gods like me.

772
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,388
This is not the end.

773
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,892
Unless hatred disappears from the world,

774
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,769
there will be another...

775
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,191
Professor, will we ever see a day
when there is no hatred?

776
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,067
I don't know.

777
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,904
We can only hope that day will come.

778
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,783
Mont Blanc,

779
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,326
North No.2,

780
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,077
Brando,

781
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,537
Hercules,

782
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,247
Epsilon,

783
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,832
Gesicht,

784
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,585
and Sahad...

785
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,922
I'm sure they're praying

786
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,549
for that day to come.

787
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,720
All of them.

788
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,960
