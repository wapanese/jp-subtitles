1
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,446
My goodness.

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,533
Superintendent Tawashi,
we have the name of the victim.

3
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,162
Junichiro Tazaki, a legal scholar.

4
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,916
He's the one who proposed
the International Robot Laws.

5
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:29,130
Oh, the very man
who gave robots freedom and equality?

6
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,507
Yes.

7
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,800
Well then,

8
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,470
let's start by questioning everyone
in anti-robot law groups.

9
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,387
Yes, sir!

10
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,104
Horns, eh?

11
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,233
I remember hearing about cases
involving horns somewhere.

12
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,692
I'll have it looked into.

13
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,196
Hey, you there!

14
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,159
Still, what in the world happened here?

15
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,462
What caused this?

16
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,259
Did it collapse on its own,
or did someone use a power shovel on it?

17
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,970
We're analyzing it now.

18
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,933
I guess it wouldn't be impossible
for you lot.

19
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,726
Sir?

20
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,690
For a robot with some strength,
this would be a piece of cake.

21
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,567
Superintendent Tawashi!

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,653
The cases with the horns
happened in Switzerland and Germany.

23
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,240
That's right!

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,451
They were found in the head
of a destroyed robot called Mont Blanc.

25
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,205
There was another case
in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

26
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:49,419
The victim, Bernard Lanke, was also
a leader in the Robot Liberation Movement.

27
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,256
We'd better contact Europol

28
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,384
and talk to the investigators
assigned to each case.

29
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,012
Actually, according to this data,

30
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,098
the same detective
is in charge of both cases.

31
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,058
The same detective?

32
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes, and a robot detective at that.

33
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,189
A robot, eh?

34
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,982
What's his name?

35
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,234
Gesicht.

36
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,048
How curious.

37
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,008
What is?

38
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,052
When I look at you,

39
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,973
my identification system might malfunction
trying to tell if you're robot or human.

40
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,934
I get that a lot.

41
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,728
I've seen you many times in the news,

42
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,898
but seeing you
sitting right in front of me...

43
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,858
The news?

44
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,068
Yes.

45
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,196
When you arrived
with the peacekeeping forces

46
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,282
during the 39th Central Asian War,

47
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,493
the media raised a fuss, remember?

48
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:05,995
Right.

49
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:12,210
I only went there to help defend
the peace in that nation. Yet...

50
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,840
And yet, they treated you
like an idol or a pop star.

51
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,175
Yes.

52
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,885
Here you go.

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,765
Time to dig in!

54
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,695
Is something wrong?

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,116
No, it's just that you seem like
you're truly enjoying it.

56
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,411
I'm sure it's obvious
that I'm pretending to drink.

57
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,415
The more I pretend,
the more I feel like I understand it.

58
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,125
Understand what?

59
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,252
When something is delicious.

60
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,299
I don't know
if it's a truly human sensation,

61
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,925
but I feel it in my heart.

62
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,221
Incredible.

63
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,350
When you saw that kid
playing with a new toy earlier,

64
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,602
did you really want one too?

65
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,566
Yes. That toy is really popular
among kids right now.

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,234
Then, how about the snail?

67
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
Huh?

68
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,864
Earlier, you found a snail in the rain.

69
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,781
I did.

70
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,826
<i>You didn't just collect a sample</i>

71
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,412
<i>of a pulmonate gastropod mollusk
from the helicidae family.</i>

72
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,831
You felt something.

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,500
You were moved by life, weren't you?

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,004
Maybe? Beats me.

75
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
You really live up to your reputation.
You're amazing.

76
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,430
You may look like a child,

77
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,642
but I know your artificial intelligence
is far superior to mine.

78
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,939
That's why I was sold.

79
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,027
I look like a child,
and people found it amusing,

80
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,862
so they sold me to the circus.

81
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,364
Sold?

82
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,287
Gesicht?

83
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,212
It's nothing.
I'm sorry for bringing all that up.

84
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,129
It's all right.

85
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,674
Let me get down to business.

86
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,178
As I had mentioned in the email,

87
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,598
Mont Blanc of Switzerland
and North No.2 in Scotland

88
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,600
were killed in a series of murders.

89
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,144
And you think I'm in danger too?

90
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,899
Yes. I don't have any proof yet,
but the killer's goal may be...

91
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,822
to destroy the seven
most advanced robots in the world.

92
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,199
But why?

93
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,994
I think you know why.

94
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,463
Gesicht, could I please
read your memory chip?

95
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,381
What?

96
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:09,303
There may be clues to help solve the case
in everything you've seen and heard.

97
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
No, I can't do that.

98
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,894
It includes classified information
on other cases and my personal data.

99
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,404
Oh, right. Your artificial intelligence
is more advanced than mine.

100
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,489
I'll trust you.

101
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,492
It'll only take a minute.

102
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,177
Thank you.

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,762
For anything unrelated
to the investigation,

104
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,806
could you delete that?

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,141
I will.

106
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,811
I hope you can find information
that I've overlooked.

107
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,025
Something you've overlooked...

108
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,281
Pardon me, Gesicht.

109
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,201
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- The bathroom?

110
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,497
It's another habit I've developed
while mimicking human behavior.

111
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,166
I see.

112
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,336
Well, being as close to human as you are,
it makes sense.

113
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,773
Gesicht, you...

114
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,988
It sure rains a lot.

115
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:51,906
Yes.

116
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,534
Are you leaving Japan right away?

117
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,453
Yes, I have a lot of work waiting for me,

118
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,707
and I need to speak
to three more robots about this.

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,546
Gesicht, please come visit again. Promise?

120
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,172
Yeah, I promise.

121
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,384
Your wife is lovely.

122
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,390
This is why I didn't want
to let you read my chip.

123
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,520
Come on! No making fun of adults!
Delete that data now!

124
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,861
It'll be okay.

125
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,907
You and your wife will be okay.

126
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,368
Whatever happens, you two can handle it.

127
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,705
Thank you.

128
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,749
Goodbye, Atom.

129
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,174
Gesicht, I'll be waiting!

130
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,136
We'll meet again for sure!

131
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,196
FORENSICS DIVISION

132
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,159
Cause of death?

133
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,910
It was suffocation.

134
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,704
Suffocation?

135
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,664
What was the murder weapon? A rope?

136
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,167
We don't know yet.

137
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,961
We only know that his neck
was subjected to great pressure.

138
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,589
- No trace evidence?
- None.

139
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,136
Hey, bring up the 3D replica!

140
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,006
I've got a pretty good idea
who the perp might be.

141
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,800
What? You do?

142
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,261
Sure. For the suspect to not leave
any trace, that could only mean--

143
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,554
How strange...

144
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,935
You!

145
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,311
Atom!

146
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,482
Hello there, Superintendent Tawashi,
Inspector Nakamura!

147
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,235
Who gave you permission to be in here?

148
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,196
I have an admission pass here.

149
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,117
You requested cooperation
on the investigation from Europol, right?

150
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,704
I installed the memory
of Inspector Gesicht,

151
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,372
the one in charge of the cases.

152
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:51,168
So I have the data on the Mont Blanc case
in Switzerland and the DÃ¼sseldorf case.

153
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:58,968
Being a robot must be awfully convenient
to swap the contents of your brain.

154
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,889
But if you think you know everything
from that, you're very mistaken!

155
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,852
You robots don't even know
when something is beautiful or tasty.

156
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,775
Then again, when it comes to this case,
perhaps your kind might grasp it better.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,238
You guys have finally done it.
A robot committed murder.

158
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,699
What makes you say that?

159
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,619
No human could have done this
without leaving a trace!

160
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,416
A living human would have left
fingerprints, hair, something,

161
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,710
but there is nothing here.

162
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,421
Then what do you make of this?

163
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,342
There's green tea under the rubble here.

164
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,844
Green tea?

165
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,015
Yes, two broken teacups
and some <i>yokan</i> red bean jelly.

166
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,559
- Hey, pick up this spot!
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

167
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,733
It hadn't been that long
since this tea was brewed.

168
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:01,113
The autopsy did find some tea
and <i>yokan</i> in the victim's stomach.

169
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,534
Would you serve tea and <i>yokan</i>
if a robot came to visit?

170
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,663
You pretend to eat all the time!

171
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,082
The outside corridor...

172
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,671
Hydrangeas.

173
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,633
They sat outside
and admired the hydrangeas.

174
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,385
Hey, pick up that spot!

175
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,681
<i>We can confirm that there were
hydrangeas in the garden there.</i>

176
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,228
Robots don't understand beauty, right?

177
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,647
Do you still think a robot did this?

178
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,649
What are you saying?

179
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,735
That the human who committed the murders
also wrecked the house?

180
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:45,282
That after happily gazing at hydrangeas,
the suspect bulldozed the house?

181
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,077
- Pull up the witness statements!
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

182
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,040
<i>Yes, it was like a tornado.</i>

183
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:57,002
<i>I heard this crazy roar,
and suddenly the house next door was gone!</i>

184
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,882
<i>I can't believe our house still stands.
It was such a huge tornado.</i>

185
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,676
See? They said it was a tornado!

186
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,138
And an unnaturally localized one
that only destroyed one house!

187
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,432
What do you make of that?

188
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,060
After that,
Mr. Tazaki went out to the garden.

189
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,190
Excuse me. Could you bring up
the image of the body?

190
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,609
No, it's not something
a child should see--

191
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,652
It's fine!

192
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,655
He only looks like a child.
He's just a robot.

193
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,614
Oh, right.

194
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,658
<i>Hey, bring it up!</i>

195
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,576
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,330
Horns.

197
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,804
The god of death had horns.

198
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,017
<i>This is Gesicht's memory.</i>

199
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,729
The lord of the underworld
in Roman mythology...

200
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,609
<i>The lord of the underworld
in Roman mythology...</i>

201
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,237
Pluto.

202
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,168
Excuse me.

203
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,254
Did Mr. Junichiro Tazaki use pens?

204
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,255
Huh?

205
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,967
There's a callus on his middle finger,
so it looks like he did.

206
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,721
The rain washed most of it away,
but there's a bit of ink on his hand.

207
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,318
Wet footprints.

208
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,864
He rushed into the house from the garden.
To the study!

209
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,699
Look, right here!

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,369
There's an ink bottle
with the same ink on his hand.

211
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,828
Hey, pick this up!

212
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,583
He must have knocked it over
to find something.

213
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,293
Find what?

214
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,674
Can you pick up what's beneath here?

215
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,719
Business cards?

216
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
INQUIRY COMMISSION

217
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,933
"Inquiry commission"?

218
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,101
There it is.

219
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,604
A business card with ink and fingerprints.

220
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,439
Whose card?

221
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,868
Not that matter again.

222
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,997
No matter what you say,
I will not change my mind.

223
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,915
Thracia may say what they want,

224
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,085
but we are not making robots
for them to use in wars!

225
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,461
Good grief.

226
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,174
Professor Ochanomizu?

227
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,968
Oh, Atom.

228
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,845
Do you have a moment to spare?

229
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,806
Sure. What brings you here at this hour?

230
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,475
Professor Ochanomizu.

231
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,813
Have you heard of a scholar
named Junichiro Tazaki?

232
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
Yes, I heard he died.

233
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,277
He was caught up in some incident.

234
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,530
It was he who proposed
the International Robot Laws.

235
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,990
He was a great man.

236
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,577
How about Bernard Lanke?

237
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,870
Lanke?

238
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,205
He was a key advocate for the robot laws.

239
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,460
Yes, I know him,
though I haven't seen him in years.

240
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,420
What about him?

241
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,131
He passed away.

242
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,095
Professor, where did you meet Mr. Lanke?

243
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:40,559
During the 39th Central Asian War,
as part of a certain inquiry commission.

244
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,978
Right before he passed,

245
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,107
Junichiro Tazaki
was looking for a business card.

246
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,236
It was yours, Professor.

247
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,530
He was trying to contact me?

248
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,409
Yes. I believe you're in danger.

249
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,247
Someone is after you.

250
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,833
You and the former members
of the Bora Inquiry Commission.

251
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,670
Please tell me.

252
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,839
What exactly is Bora?

253
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,887
<i>It all started from the suspicion
that the Kingdom of Persia</i>

254
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,141
<i>was in possession
of robots of mass destruction.</i>

255
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,810
<i>As you know,</i>

256
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:28,774
<i>the Kingdom of Persia was ruled
by the dictatorship of Darius XIV then.</i>

257
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>Its citizens and robots
were treated poorly,</i>

258
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,739
<i>not in compliance
with United Nations treaties.</i>

259
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:40,202
<i>Darius XIV used
overwhelming robot military might</i>

260
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,663
<i>to bring neighboring countries
under his control</i>

261
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,624
<i>and attempted to conquer
all of Central Asia.</i>

262
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,417
<i>That's when they proposed</i>

263
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>the Prohibition of the Manufacture
of Robots of Mass Destruction treaty.</i>

264
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,924
<i>It was immediately passed
at the United Nations.</i>

265
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>Soon after, the Kingdom of Persia</i>

266
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,971
<i>was suspected of possessing
robots of mass destruction.</i>

267
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,099
<i>President Alexander
of the United States of Thracia,</i>

268
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:07,354
<i>the one who had called for the treaty,
leveled the accusations against Persia.</i>

269
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,356
<i>Based on his accusations,</i>

270
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,861
<i>the Bora Inquiry Commission
was dispatched to the Kingdom of Persia.</i>

271
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,321
No one knew what Bora was

272
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,868
or if it was just a code name
or to what it referred.

273
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,831
But I was a member
of the inquiry commission alongside Lanke

274
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,499
and Mr. Tazaki.

275
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,960
What happened with Bora?

276
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,548
Such robots of mass destruction,
as the United States of Thracia claimed,

277
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,924
were nowhere to be seen.

278
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,387
On what basis did the United States
of Thracia make such a claim?

279
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,848
There was this genius.

280
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,558
A genius?

281
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:49,396
It was believed that the Kingdom
of Persia's advanced robot army

282
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,649
came from the mind of a genius scientist.

283
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,235
What is the name of this scientist?

284
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,197
He was commonly known as "Dr. Goji."

285
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,826
No one knew his real name

286
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,578
or what he looked like.

287
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:10,167
We didn't even know
if such a person actually existed.

288
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,129
That's about all we found out.

289
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,426
But there was this one place
that we visited.

290
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>It was deep underground,
beneath an old mosque.</i>

291
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,309
<i>I still don't know what to make
of what we saw there,</i>

292
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,146
<i>those piles and piles of robot corpses.</i>

293
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,442
The Kingdom explained to us

294
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:40,364
that it was a dump for unusable robots.

295
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,743
And then,

296
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,120
the war started.

297
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,035
You all right, Mont Blanc?

298
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,934
You two hurt anywhere?

299
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,817
Brando destroyed 2,895.

300
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,739
I destroyed 2,962.

301
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,992
How many did you destroy, Mont Blanc?

302
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,453
A lot.

303
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,413
A lot, huh?

304
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,957
How impressive.

305
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,667
It was 3,022.

306
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,467
What are we doing here?

307
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,805
We came here for a just cause, didn't we?

308
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,434
To liberate robots from oppression.

309
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,019
That's why we came, right?

310
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,817
We...

311
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,405
Access the network.

312
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,120
<i>The palace of Darius XIV is about to fall.</i>

313
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,209
<i>The peacekeeping forces
have entered the center of town.</i>

314
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,922
<i>An "Emissary of Peace," huh?</i>

315
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,299
Atom's got it easy.

316
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,304
Why did we come here, you ask?

317
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,890
Who is it that we should have destroyed?

318
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,562
Who is it that we were supposed to hate?

319
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,773
"Hate"?

320
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,274
Yeah.

321
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,736
What the heck is this thing
they call "hatred"?

322
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,985
Brando!

323
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,695
<i>What a landslide!</i>

324
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,530
<i>Truly unbeatable!</i>

325
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:13,493
<i>The final round of the ESKKKR Tournament
ended with his instant victory!</i>

326
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,704
<i>Undefeated in 936 consecutive matches!</i>

327
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,249
<i>Will we ever see an end
to the legend of this invincible hero?</i>

328
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,668
<i>The strongest warrior in history!</i>

329
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,671
<i>Brando!</i>

330
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,139
That was an impressive match, Brando.

331
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,976
Nah, I'm definitely
getting rickety these days.

332
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:42,272
Sometimes, I can't even move
after a match, like right now.

333
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,110
It's strange though.

334
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,031
You all wear
the same pankration suits in the ring,

335
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,492
but when you wear it,
you're the strongest.

336
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:58,079
Experience is all you need
to win most matches.

337
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,915
The rest is luck.

338
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,875
Luck?

339
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:06,838
Yeah. I know humans laugh
when a robot talks about luck.

340
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,133
But I'm a lucky man.

341
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,729
It's an old town, right?

342
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,356
Yes.

343
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,030
My place is upstairs.

344
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,624
Your face says,

345
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,753
"Why does a combat-sports superstar live
in a dump like this?"

346
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,338
Not at all.

347
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:53,677
Sure, with my fight money,
I could afford to live in a fancy mansion.

348
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,638
However,

349
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,891
I've chosen to use my money
on something else.

350
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,230
I'm home!
King of the fighting world has returned!

351
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,565
Daddy!

352
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,858
Daddy!

353
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,569
- You're home!
- Welcome back!

354
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,531
All right, kiddos.

355
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,950
Have you been good?

356
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,827
Daddy, you're so strong!

357
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,037
- You were amazing!
- You betcha!

358
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,582
Welcome home, dear.

359
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,499
Oh?

360
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,419
I almost forgot. This is my wife, Mine.

361
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,423
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Gesicht, of Europol.

362
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,467
Time for dinner, everyone!

363
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,386
- I'm starving!
- I'm so hungry!

364
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,762
Let's go!

365
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,515
Please come in.

366
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,728
Catch me if you can!

367
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,771
Hey! Don't go spilling things.

368
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,231
Hey, you!

369
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,817
No running during meals!

370
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,070
Hey, mister, are you really a detective?

371
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:54,988
I am.

372
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,950
Then do you have a cool weapon
or something?

373
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,953
No, I'm afraid I don't have anything cool.

374
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,664
Stop with the silly questions!

375
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,167
Keep that up, and you'll get a spanking!

376
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,465
Please excuse them.

377
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,384
No, I haven't had
such a fun meal in a while.

378
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,891
What do you think?
A human-style meal isn't so bad, is it?

379
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,644
Yes, so merry and lively.

380
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,272
This is how it is in our house.

381
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,483
Every day is a zoo event!

382
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,028
Honey! Eat your salad!

383
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,821
Oh...

384
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,157
My mom is the strongest in this house!

385
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,577
She's the world champion, right?

386
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,581
Champion!

387
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,084
Stop being silly and finish your dinner!

388
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,379
Yikes! So scary!
She really is the champion!

389
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,431
Is everyone asleep?

390
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,349
Yeah.

391
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,606
Don't drink too much.

392
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,033
This is the life I've made for myself
with the fight money I've earned.

393
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,451
Right.

394
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,579
Because I fight for a living,

395
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,835
Mine never knows when I'm going
to come home in pieces.

396
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:37,424
For a while, she had to stay home alone,
worrying about me every day.

397
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,344
That's when that policy came into effect.

398
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,806
The Robot Adoption System.

399
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,183
Right. We took in one first.

400
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,353
And then a second
because the more, the merrier.

401
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,063
Now we have five.

402
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,736
It's a funny thing.

403
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,282
Before kids, I never gave a shit
if I'd be torn into pieces in a match.

404
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,284
But now,

405
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,912
I want to live as long as possible.

406
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,539
Weird, huh?

407
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,460
I got kids, so I could die at any time.

408
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,296
But now that I have them,
I don't want to die.

409
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,053
I'm sure Mont Blanc wanted to live too.

410
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:31,936
I met him
during the 39th Central Asian War.

411
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,773
But more than the memory
of fighting together,

412
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,817
I remember the fun times we had
doing silly things and talking all night.

413
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,906
He told me about trees,
birds, all kinds of things.

414
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,283
For a great guy like him

415
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,786
to die the way he did...

416
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,088
Do you know a robot named North No.2?

417
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah, only by name.

418
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,427
He's dead.

419
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,723
Last week.

420
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:14,646
He was living peacefully as the butler
of a composer in Scotland, and then...

421
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,357
Was he killed?

422
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,320
Yes. And now you're in danger too.

423
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,240
You don't need to worry about me.

424
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,075
I'm the king of the fighting world.

425
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,744
That's why you're being targeted.

426
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,788
I say bring it on.

427
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,124
After what they did to Mont Blanc,

428
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,670
I'll rip them apart, just you watch.

429
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,799
Please don't be stupid!
If anything happens, call me right away!

430
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,176
Would you like another?

431
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,640
Oh, actually, this Turkish energy drink
is pretty potent.

432
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,601
I'm ready for another.

433
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,061
None for you.

434
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,607
Fine.

435
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,069
You sure you don't want me
to drive you back?

436
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,239
Yes, I can grab a cab there.

437
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,617
Okay. Come visit again soon.

438
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,538
Thank you. I had a great time today.

439
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,083
Yeah, kids are great, you know?

440
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,544
You might want to give it a thought.

441
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,007
Five of them like us
might be a bit much though.

442
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,885
You're right.

443
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,014
You can have the whole body for 500 ZEUS.

444
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,933
What's the matter?

445
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,522
Oh, it's nothing.
Maybe I had too much to drink.

446
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,400
Are you sure you can get home by yourself?

447
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,862
Yes, I'll be fine.

448
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,823
All right, if you say so.

449
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,285
Do take care of yourself.

450
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,288
If anything happens, contact me.

451
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,000
- Say...
- Hmm?

452
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,962
I told you that winning
was up to one's luck, right?

453
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,593
Humans leave things up to chance,

454
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,929
but I say luck is something you take.

455
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,726
It's because I have a family
that I've got luck on my side now.

456
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,313
If anything happens, you just call me.

457
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,608
I'm a lucky man.

458
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,028
Yes.

459
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,529
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

460
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,040
<i>Please...</i>

461
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,669
<i>Don't you die on me.</i>

462
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,989
<i>Whoa! It's a double wrist lock!
Is this the end?</i>

463
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,241
Rip his arm out!

464
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,620
Break it!

465
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,122
Twist it off!

466
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,088
<i>There he is, the undefeated champion!</i>

467
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,633
<i>What a perfect match
to defend the title of world champion!</i>

468
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:38,224
<i>Everyone is intoxicated by the artistry
of Hercules, our god of battle!</i>

469
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,893
Hercules!

470
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,688
<i>Next month,
Hercules will finally have a showdown</i>

471
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:47,316
<i>with Brando from Turkey,
the European champion!</i>

472
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,988
<i>There it is, his signature pose!
The god of battle!</i>

473
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,952
It's an amazing monument, Hercules.

474
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,664
I told them not to.

475
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,878
I said it would only ruin the view
of the world heritage site.

476
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,132
But they ended up building a statue
of my pankration suit.

477
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,344
Humans like that kind of stuff.

478
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,681
I saw the match last night.

479
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,059
You were strong, as usual.

480
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,062
As usual, huh?

481
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,733
Would you like to sit down
for a cup of tea and talk?

482
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,985
I don't imitate humans.

483
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,821
I'm a robot.

484
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,533
A killing machine
that destroys his opponents.

485
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,287
But in your recent matches...

486
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,041
You think I've gone soft, right?

487
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,002
That I held back last night
when it really mattered.

488
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,131
Are you worried
about my next match with Brando?

489
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,053
I heard you went to see him.

490
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes.

491
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,306
He was in top shape.

492
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,557
I'll bet.

493
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,311
I've fought him many times,
and I know he's tough.

494
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,273
Just like he was back then.

495
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:15,029
During the 39th Central Asian War,
you mean?

496
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,122
Detective Gesicht,

497
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,417
do you know why humans
love building these monuments?

498
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
Because they forget.

499
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:40,847
Before their memory fades,
they build these things to remember.

500
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,307
But look at us.

501
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,896
Unless we erase them,
our memories will last forever.

502
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,816
We remember things vividly.

503
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,485
Our comrades in arms.

504
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,364
Mountains of robot corpses on both sides.
Ours and theirs.

505
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,411
That's how I learned

506
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,621
about murderous intent.

507
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,879
Ever since then, I haven't been able
to destroy my opponents.

508
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,841
What do humans call this feeling?

509
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,595
Compassion, perhaps?

510
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:24,932
Say...

511
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,392
Yes?

512
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,602
Don't you think

513
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,355
that we are evolving?

514
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,559
<i>But why, Daddy?</i>

515
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,065
You promised
that you'd come to the zoo with us!

516
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,775
Yeah.

517
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,443
Sorry, kiddos.

518
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,280
Some work came up
that I have to attend to.

519
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,740
What?

520
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,243
You're just going to cancel on us?

521
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,036
I'll come with you next time.

522
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,621
It's a promise!

523
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,332
You'll just break your promise again!

524
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,253
No, I promise this as a man.

525
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,966
And real men never break their promises.

526
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,970
All right. Stop complaining!

527
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,097
I'm coming with you.

528
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,724
You're a liar, Daddy!

529
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,060
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,522
A sudden work matter...
Did something happen?

531
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,484
Oh, it's an interview.

532
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,027
An interview?

533
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,908
It's a conversation with Miss Istanbul.

534
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:13,874
I owe this editor I know,
and I couldn't say no.

535
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,503
Well, have fun at this "interview."

536
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,048
Hey, your husband
is the European champ now.

537
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,759
I've got obligations...

538
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,610
What's the matter?

539
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,530
<i>Don't "what's the matter" me.</i>

540
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,491
<i>You took your pankration suit out
without permission.</i>

541
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,578
It won't be a problem.
I'll return it right away.

542
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,872
<i>That's not the point.</i>

543
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,333
<i>You even took the cargo truck
without asking.</i>

544
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,836
<i>If anything happens,
they won't let you fight in the match.</i>

545
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,922
<i>The match with Hercules
is coming up next--</i>

546
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,299
That's exactly why.

547
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,342
<i>Huh?</i>

548
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,763
I'm borrowing it
to get ready for the next match.

549
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,723
<i>That may be, but--</i>

550
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,190
Relax, pal.

551
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,794
Professor, do you think these incidents
were caused by a human, or...

552
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,629
A robot?

553
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,216
Or a combination of the two?

554
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:51,889
The only precedent of a robot killing
a human is the case of Brau1589.

555
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,809
Is that really true?

556
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,269
Why do you ask?

557
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:04,777
Never mind. So what kind of defects
did the AI of Brau1589 have?

558
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,655
There weren't any.

559
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,156
What?

560
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,660
His AI was perfect.

561
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,495
Perfect...

562
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,331
A perfect AI killed a human...

563
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,708
What does that mean?

564
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,169
Could it be

565
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,089
that it was human?

566
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,935
This should be a good spot.

567
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,890
What's the matter?

568
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,141
Detective Gesicht?

569
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,102
Patch yourself in, Hercules!

570
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,564
No way!

571
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,068
Atom, you patch in too!

572
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,283
Atom, what's wrong?

573
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,120
I'm getting a signal from Istanbul...

574
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,135
Gesicht, what's going on here?

575
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,305
It's communication from Brando.

576
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:45,062
<i>Keep the channel... open!</i>

577
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,274
Brando!

578
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,483
Brando!

579
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,363
<i>I'll show you the fight I have in me!</i>

580
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,949
Stop! Stop it, Brando!

581
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,201
Brando, run!

582
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,288
I've identified his location.
He's on the coast of the Black Sea.

583
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,706
Let's go, Gesicht!

584
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,336
<i>To avenge...</i>

585
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,715
<i>Mont Blanc!</i>

586
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,261
Brando, do not take it head-on!
We're on our way!

587
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,739
The signal is disturbed.

588
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,284
What's happening, Atom?

589
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,912
Professor, I have to go!

590
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,789
But go where?

591
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,876
Someone is attacking Brando.

592
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,628
I have to hurry!

593
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,341
<i>So strong...</i>

594
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,176
<i>What the heck is this thing?</i>

595
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,781
What was that?

596
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,743
Brando, come in!

597
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,453
Brando!

598
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,205
Brando!

599
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,132
The sea...

600
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,522
<i>I did it.</i>

601
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,192
Brando!

602
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,111
<i>I beat it.</i>

603
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,613
Brando!

604
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,950
<i>I won.</i>

605
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,705
<i>But it got me too.</i>

606
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,874
We're coming! Hold on, Brando!

607
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,043
<i>Hercules.</i>

608
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,422
<i>Our next match,</i>

609
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,550
<i>I was looking forward to it.</i>

610
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,927
Me too.

611
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,639
<i>I would have beat you.</i>

612
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,974
Don't be silly!

613
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,643
You never know!

614
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,273
We're coming to get you!

615
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,234
Just stay there and wait for us!

616
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:45,367
<i>I'm sending you the data I analyzed
on the guy I just fought.</i>

617
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,287
Brando, don't push yourself.

618
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,100
<i>Huh?</i>

619
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,519
<i>That's weird...</i>

620
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,522
That's Brando's family.

621
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:18,859
<i>Damn it...</i>

622
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:20,986
<i>My circuits are</i>

623
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,322
<i>all messed up.</i>

624
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,824
Brando, that's enough.

625
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,076
<i>Damn it.</i>

626
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,830
<i>I can't transmit</i>

627
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,208
<i>the correct data.</i>

628
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,335
You've done enough.

629
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,087
<i>That's odd.</i>

630
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,757
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

631
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,719
<i>I can't control it.</i>

632
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,822
<i>Detective Gesicht.</i>

633
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,158
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

634
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,203
<i>I'm a lucky man.</i>

635
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:12,871
Yeah.

636
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,540
<i>I promised my kids</i>

637
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,668
<i>that I'd take them to the zoo.</i>

638
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,381
<i>I made the promise as a man.</i>

639
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,886
<i>Tell them</i>

640
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,556
<i>not to worry.</i>

641
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,810
<i>I'm a lucky man.</i>

642
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,191
Brando!

643
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,784
This is where Brando
sent his last transmission from.

644
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,705
I've been sending him a signal,
but there's no response.

645
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,498
All I can see is

646
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,001
spilled oil on the water's surface

647
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,463
and a huge amount of wreckage
at the bottom of the ocean.

648
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,967
<i>Gesicht.</i>

649
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,093
<i>Hercules.</i>

650
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,140
For a brief moment,

651
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,059
did you notice something mixed in
with the signals Brando sent?

652
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,769
No, I didn't.

653
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,566
Was it a signal from someone
other than Brando?

654
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:28,530
Yes, a different AI
that had gone out of control.

655
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,365
Something like noise.

656
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,242
Noise?

657
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,078
What could it be?

658
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,207
- Atom, can you bring it up on the monitor?
- I can.

659
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,960
<i>Atom, send it to us as well.</i>

660
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,378
Understood.

661
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,423
Here, right after this.

662
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,928
What in the world is this?

663
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,316
What do humans call this?

664
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,402
Death incarnate.

665
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,237
Death incarnate?

666
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,240
Emotion.

667
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,791
Overwhelming... pain.

668
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,099
<i>This is the Blue Mosque Coliseum
in Istanbul.</i>

669
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:43,230
<i>Scores of people are here
to mourn the death of their hero, Brando.</i>

670
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,697
Daddy!

671
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,910
We'll go now to our reporter on the scene.

672
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
I'm here at the scene.

673
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,834
The ocean floor around here
is covered with wreckage,

674
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,129
and it is assumed
that most of it belongs to Brando.

675
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,800
The police and the military
are continuing their search,

676
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,137
but sources say it would be impossible

677
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,640
to recover all the wreckage
due to the muddy ocean floor.

678
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,905
How long are you going to let this go on?

679
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,200
The deadline for defending your title
is coming soon!

680
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,662
Are you listening to me, Hercules?

681
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:48,587
If you're not going to fight,
then I'll sue you for breach of contract!

682
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,674
I'm Al Haft, the biggest promoter
there is! You hear me?

683
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,932
They haven't found a damn thing.

684
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,895
They haven't found
a single piece of the killer.

685
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,858
All they've found so far
are pulverized pieces of Brando.

686
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,779
Brando fought the killer here and won.

687
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,824
So, why can't we
find pieces of the killer?

688
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,619
Hercules.

689
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,664
Even the military and the police have
given up on recovering everything.

690
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:29,294
So, why should you be the one to do it,
let alone out of your own pocket?

691
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,715
Is it your friendship with Brando?

692
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,802
Your fans are all waiting for you.

693
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,513
For Hercules, the god of battle,
to come back to the ring.

694
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,807
I am too.

695
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,519
So please, Hercules.

696
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,603
Come back--

697
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,278
Hercules! We found Brando's arms!

698
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:56,863
Good work!

699
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,241
Take great care with the recovery!

700
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,743
Actually, it's a little complicated!

701
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,163
They were found on a rock reef
about 100 km away from here,

702
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,916
not on the ocean floor!

703
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:08,959
We'll take you there!

704
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,253
Wait!

705
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,213
Hercules!

706
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:17,509
Come back!
Come back and fight one more time!

707
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,805
Hercules.

708
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,861
Right over there, on that rock!

709
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,039
What the...

710
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,143
Brando's memory chip.

711
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,103
Horns.

712
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,357
I don't believe this...

713
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,401
