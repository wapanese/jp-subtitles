1
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,173
<i>Me?</i>

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>No, me.</i>

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,971
<i>It's me, for sure.</i>

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>Maybe it's me.</i>

5
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,059
<i>Ought to be me.</i>

6
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,810
<i>Hey! It's me.</i>

7
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>Me.</i>

8
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>Me, me, me.</i>

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,356
<i>It's me.</i>

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,357
<i>Me, of course.</i>

11
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>- It's me.
- Me, obviously.</i>

12
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,944
<i>- Me!
- It's me.</i>

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>- Of course it's me.
- Me!</i>

14
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,089
So, how goes it?

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,051
If he were human, I'd say he's dreaming.

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,013
But there's absolutely
no sign of him waking up.

17
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,432
I see.

18
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,228
You're better off not seeing his face.

19
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,273
The 9.9 billion personalities
programmed in him

20
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:52,362
are being simulated on his artificial skin
at an incredible speed.

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,324
It's beyond imagination
how hideous his face would be.

22
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:03,081
Perhaps it is impossible
to create a perfect robot after all.

23
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,042
What should we do?

24
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,710
How can we wake him up?

25
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,797
There is a way.

26
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,132
What?

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,925
Are you prepared?

28
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,139
He may turn out to be a devil.

29
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,602
A devil, huh?

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,396
Dr. Tenma.

31
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,692
She went back to her country.

32
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,652
"She"?

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,864
Gesicht's wife. Helena.

34
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,990
I see.

35
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
I wish you could have met her.

36
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,539
She was concerned about Atom.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,792
Though it pains me to admit,

38
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:52,463
we scientists tend to focus
only on technological results,

39
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,759
but her sense of kindness
is worth studying too.

40
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,678
It's almost as if

41
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,931
she were Atom's equal.

42
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,687
Dr. Tenma.

43
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,066
The National Diet has set the date
for Atom's state funeral.

44
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:28,917
With that, Gesicht's death
won't be in vain, right?

45
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,881
We humans call things like this
"a soul" as well.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,801
I will take good care of
your husband's soul.

47
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,642
<i>You are entering
a Class-A restricted zone.</i>

48
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,852
<i>Retinal scan in progress.</i>

49
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,858
<i>Please proceed.</i>

50
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,783
<i>Devil or not, it doesn't matter!</i>

51
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,535
Nothing matters unless he wakes up.

52
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,246
What do we do?

53
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,708
Introduce unbalanced emotions.

54
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,587
"Unbalanced emotions"?

55
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,051
Yes. Anger, sorrow, hatred...

56
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:25,431
Tipping the scale is the simplest way
to solve the chaos of 9.9 billion.

57
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,822
To bring you back from the dead,

58
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,783
I'd gladly become a devil.

59
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,339
Gesicht's hatred...

60
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,387
As Gesicht... died...

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,809
toward whom was he directing his hatred?

62
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,442
It's been raining for three days.

63
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,612
At this rate, just like Gesicht, I might...

64
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,908
Epsilon, you have a visitor.
He looks really strong.

65
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,581
It sure rains a lot here.

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,294
I'm Hogan of the Ministry of Science
Defense Agency.

67
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,004
Nice to meet you.

68
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,424
I've been assigned as your bodyguard.

69
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:46,763
They say you're the next target
since Detective Gesicht has been killed.

70
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,726
My power isn't even
in the same league as yours.

71
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,479
But with all this rain

72
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,898
and with you being powered
by Photon Energy...

73
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,818
I'll take you to the safe house.

74
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,697
But what about the children?

75
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,825
We cannot drag them into this.

76
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,913
Today is my birthday, you see.

77
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,664
Huh?

78
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,335
The children are throwing me a party.

79
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,130
It's a surprise party.

80
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,926
Well, it's meant to be a surprise,
but I already know about it.

81
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,514
Can you make it short?

82
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,349
Thank you.

83
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,821
Oh, you all...

84
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,412
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

85
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,413
Thank you.

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,623
Thank you very much, everyone!

87
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,000
We have presents for you, Epsilon!

88
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,629
Wow, really? I'm so happy!

89
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,714
This is from us!

90
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,675
What a lovely necklace!

91
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,636
- You made this yourselves?
- Yes!

92
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,097
This hat is lovely too.

93
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,849
Look at that, Epsilon.

94
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,184
It's something you love!

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,438
It's the sun, huh?

96
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,067
With this, you can feel happy
even on a rainy day like today, right?

97
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,027
You're right. Amazing!

98
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,654
It does cheer me up.

99
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,825
See? I told you he would love it!

100
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,581
These children
lost their parents in the war.

101
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,292
To those kids,

102
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,712
Epsilon is like their sun.

103
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,759
Hey, Wassily, you drew something
for Epsilon, right?

104
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,553
Don't be shy. Show him!

105
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:51,888
Is that true?

106
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,639
Let me see.

107
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,567
Bora...

108
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,278
This is Bora?

109
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,322
Bora

110
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,116
ate it...

111
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,076
Earth...

112
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,663
Wassily is saying something
other than "Bora"!

113
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,789
...ate it...

114
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:26,464
<i>The giant made a south pole
In the desert</i>

115
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,548
A song?

116
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>The giant released a river of fire
And summoned the floating glaciers</i>

117
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:41,187
<i>The giant made the rains come down
Until there was a great flood</i>

118
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:47,777
<i>The giant swallowed the fire
The glaciers, and all the rain</i>

119
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,739
<i>And then he ate</i>

120
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,742
<i>The earth itself</i>

121
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,579
<i>He ate</i>

122
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,666
<i>The earth itself</i>

123
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,210
Amazing, Wassily!

124
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,419
But what a weird song!

125
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,801
We need to get going.

126
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,803
Five more minutes.

127
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,098
It's been a while, Arnold.

128
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,767
<i>Oh, why if it isn't Epsilon?</i>

129
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,144
I'd like to ask you something.

130
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,688
<i>Okay!</i>

131
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,108
<i>Let the United States of Thracia's
best weather-forecasting robot, Arnold,</i>

132
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,901
<i>predict it for you.</i>

133
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,946
<i>The rain you've been having
should stop tomorrow before dawn.</i>

134
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>Just be patient--</i>

135
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,031
Not that.

136
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,157
Three years ago.

137
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>What? Three years ago?</i>

138
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,537
Do you have any records

139
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,373
of abnormal meteorological events
in Persia three years ago?

140
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,585
For example, something like this picture.

141
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,588
<i>What is that?</i>

142
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,423
I'm not exactly sure.

143
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,884
<i>Three years ago in Persia, huh?</i>

144
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,973
<i>Nothing in particular.</i>

145
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,183
<i>The smoke you see in this data</i>

146
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,270
<i>is the kind caused
by battlefield artillery shells.</i>

147
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,275
<i>Some of the children you took in
are from this area, aren't they?</i>

148
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,360
- Yes.
- Huh?

149
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,991
<i>There's something gigantic
inside the smoke...</i>

150
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,242
What is it?

151
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,746
<i>It's impossible to analyze.</i>

152
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,080
It's time, sir.

153
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,711
I'll be back soon.

154
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,088
Epsilon, where are you going?

155
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,424
What about the rest
of your birthday party?

156
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,968
Some last-minute work came up.

157
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,680
Be good while I'm gone, okay?

158
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,986
Wassily...

159
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,155
Wassily?

160
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,259
Hey, over here.

161
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,311
It's dark, so watch your step.

162
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,900
I guess you do come in handy.

163
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,867
Sir, I have brought him.

164
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,788
Whoa, you're bright. Dim your light.

165
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,252
I'm Brigadier General Scott
of the UN Forces.

166
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,754
So you're the Epsilon
who refused to join the army.

167
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,759
You've got a dainty frame for a robot.

168
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,886
No wonder you're a coward.

169
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,806
At least you can help
with the post-war cleanup.

170
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,642
Have a look. This is your job.

171
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,730
What is this?

172
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,108
You are going to melt all of this down.

173
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,488
With your Photon Energy,
you'll finish in no time, right?

174
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,659
You want me to do that

175
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,453
to these?

176
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,665
They're advanced robots, but their
artificial intelligence has been removed.

177
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,460
It's just a pile of marionettes.

178
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,503
It can't be.

179
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:40,551
I'd heard that the robot rights
had been recognized in Persia.

180
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,430
What happened to the AI that was removed?

181
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,890
No idea.

182
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,851
Anyway, just get it done quickly.

183
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,229
I'll let you know
when we're at a safe distance.

184
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,332
<i>You ready, Epsilon?</i>

185
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,752
<i>- I'll start the countdown.</i>
- Wait!

186
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,423
<i>We're past the scheduled time.
Start the process immediately.</i>

187
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,549
No, listen to me!

188
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,260
- There's still someone nearby!
-<i>What?</i>

189
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,345
Someone's out there.

190
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,307
<i>That's impossible. We've checked.
There's no one left alive.</i>

191
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,142
I'm getting a life-form reading.

192
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,103
<i>Must be a dog or a cat. Just do your job.</i>

193
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,532
Come here.

194
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,033
It's okay.

195
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,452
Don't be scared.

196
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,787
Come on out.

197
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,209
Here.

198
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,866
Bora...

199
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,039
Bora...

200
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,838
Do you realize that you...

201
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,047
No.

202
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,550
I almost turned this boy to ashes!

203
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,886
We'll take care of the kid.

204
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,223
We don't have much time.
Just get on with it.

205
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,189
<i>Eight, seven, six,</i>

206
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,191
<i>five, four,</i>

207
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,192
<i>three,</i>

208
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,193
<i>two,</i>

209
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,153
<i>one.</i>

210
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,884
It's been a while, eh, Epsilon?

211
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,764
It's me, Scott, from the UN Forces,
though now I'm a full general.

212
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,600
Excellent work you did back then.

213
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,602
Quite a flashy explosion, as I recall.

214
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,439
Quite frankly, he's got so much power,

215
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,442
it's silly for us to think
we can act as his protection.

216
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,157
<i>Plus, this is more like a fortress
than a safe house.</i>

217
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,703
<i>But of course, you are the last
of the most advanced robots.</i>

218
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,873
<i>If anything happened to you,
it would be a loss for the whole planet.</i>

219
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,751
I'm sure you know this already,

220
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,504
but according to the data retrieved
from Detective Gesicht,

221
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,964
the enemy's name is--

222
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,923
Pluto.

223
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:06,840
Right.

224
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,176
<i>And as his brain,</i>

225
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,389
<i>the AI of another robot named Sahad
had been installed.</i>

226
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,558
You're prepared as expected.

227
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,228
What is Bora?

228
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,107
Those robot corpses I destroyed...

229
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,818
How are they connected to Bora?

230
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,653
"Connected"?

231
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,657
What was the Bora Inquiry Commission
in the first place?

232
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,244
The members of that mission
who found that robot graveyard

233
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,287
are being killed off one by one.

234
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,957
Now is not the time for secrets!

235
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,667
Your life is in danger too!

236
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,379
Pluto's power is terrifying.

237
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,259
But an even greater power
is waiting beyond its evolution.

238
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,720
One that could

239
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,682
"eat the earth itself."

240
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,226
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,271
It's from the song
that boy was singing, isn't it?

242
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,649
Listen, they're singing it even now.

243
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,737
Yes, I can hear it.

244
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>The giant made a south pole in the desert</i>

245
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:22,583
<i>The giant released a river of fire
And summoned the floating glaciers</i>

246
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:28,464
<i>The giant made the rains come down
Until there was a great flood</i>

247
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:34,303
<i>The giant swallowed the fire
The glaciers, and all the rain</i>

248
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:40,142
<i>And then he ate up the whole earth!</i>

249
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:45,689
<i>And he ate up the whole earth!</i>

250
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,609
<i>Bora</i>

251
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,403
<i>Bora</i>

252
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,448
<i>Bora</i>

253
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,409
<i>Bora</i>

254
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,746
<i>Bora</i>

255
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,875
Hey, Wassily. Everyone loves your song.

256
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,845
<i>The giant made the rains come down
Until there was a great flood</i>

257
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,975
<i>The giant ate up the fire
The glacier, and all the rain</i>

258
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,480
<i>And then he ate the earth itself!</i>

259
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,982
<i>Bora</i>

260
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,276
<i>Bora...</i>

261
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,070
What's the matter, Deacon?

262
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,451
- What's going on?
- What is it?

263
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,042
No! They have to flee!

264
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,335
Flee?

265
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,253
What's wrong?

266
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,673
I must return to Australia right away!

267
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,134
Oh, wow.

268
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,136
What is that?

269
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,560
Everyone, run!

270
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,813
There's something above us too?

271
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,983
General, take your men and run!

272
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:16,530
Run? The defense system here
can instantly respond to any attack.

273
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,200
We aren't like you,
who only thinks about running away.

274
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,035
You have to flee n--

275
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,417
Epsilon!

276
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,003
Do you read me, Epsilon?

277
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,049
I have to save them!

278
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,887
It's too late. Everyone's been vaporized.

279
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,473
Because of me, they all...

280
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,058
That's not true!

281
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,771
There were plenty of chances to target you
over the last three months.

282
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,774
It's highly possible
that the general was the target.

283
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,819
The Bora Inquiry Commission assassinations...

284
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,279
Take a look.

285
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,413
They look like two horns.

286
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,796
Whatever the case,
I must return to the children!

287
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,843
Such destructive power.

288
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,429
What weapon could do this?

289
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,723
No.

290
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,099
It was probably

291
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,227
Bora.

292
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,270
What is Bora?

293
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,564
I'm not sure.

294
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,526
It's like he has emotions
but doesn't at the same time.

295
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,531
Is he just a puppet?

296
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,661
Who is it?

297
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,747
Who? Just take a look.

298
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,959
It's me. Higeoyaji.

299
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,877
Oh, Principal Ban.

300
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,922
I wasn't asking about you.

301
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,675
Then what did you mean?

302
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:06,473
I just saw two great rushes of sadness
emerge somewhere in the world.

303
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,603
<i>Pinocchio,</i> eh?

304
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,275
<i>Pinocchio struggled to learn
about the human heart.</i>

305
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,859
<i>But Uran,</i>

306
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,197
you have more heart than most humans.

307
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,409
They're crying.

308
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,452
What's the matter?

309
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,787
You can tell me.

310
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,001
Why are you crying so much?

311
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,921
Wow!

312
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,298
It's coming this way.

313
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,633
Should we run?

314
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm sure we'll be fine
if we stay inside the house.

315
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,093
Everyone! Gather around me!

316
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,720
Now!

317
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,767
Huddle closer!

318
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,438
Get down and protect your heads!

319
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,319
Epsilon!

320
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,622
Get down!

321
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,758
It's okay.

322
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,927
Don't be scared.

323
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,679
Come on out.

324
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,932
Here.

325
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,241
What power...

326
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,586
The sun came out.

327
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
Hey, look!

328
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,801
There are two suns!

329
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,784
Epsilon!

330
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,585
Thank goodness.

331
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,795
You defeated it, then?

332
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,677
Wassily...

333
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,182
Epsilon...

334
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,604
You called my name for the first time.

335
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,567
Thank you.

336
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,988
Thank you,

337
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,616
Epsilon.

338
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,134
Uran.

339
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,761
Uran!

340
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,387
What's wrong?

341
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,140
He's Pinocchio.

342
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:18,975
What?

343
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,353
The child is like Pinocchio.

344
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,689
The one who was sad and crying?

345
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,234
He can't find it.

346
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,194
His heart.

347
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,740
<i>No matter where he goes,</i>

348
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,493
<i>it's darker than inside the whale's belly.</i>

349
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,246
He doesn't want to be a puppet.

350
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,581
He doesn't want to be controlled.

351
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,876
He thinks he's acting on his own,

352
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,380
but he's controlled by his hatred.

353
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,885
But you see,
he's not the only one being controlled.

354
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,055
<i>Geppetto is too.</i>

355
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,725
Geppetto is

356
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,186
just another puppet.

357
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,024
I wanted to talk to him some more.

358
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,529
But he's gone.

359
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,839
Can you tell them to hold off
on Atom's state funeral?

360
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,633
<i>If that's what you'd like, sure...</i>

361
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,010
Thank you.

362
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:54,446
Come on, Wassily!
Run faster, or you're gonna get tagged!

363
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:56,906
You're it!

364
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,541
Are you all right, Wassily?

365
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,001
Oh, someone is coming.

366
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,424
It's Mr. Simon.

367
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,220
Hello there. Nice weather today, eh?

368
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,681
It sure is.

369
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,602
Is Epsilon around?

370
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,646
Unfortunately, no.

371
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,357
Oh, he's not here?

372
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,359
He's not. He's at a hearing.

373
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,235
A hearing?

374
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,240
So, Epsilon,

375
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,786
did you defeat your adversary?

376
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,412
Yes, I did.

377
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,580
Are you sure?

378
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,333
I thought robots couldn't tell lies.

379
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,543
I defeated my enemy.

380
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,962
Completely?

381
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,549
I defeated my enemy.

382
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,219
Then can we discuss the other issue?

383
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,638
Why did you fail to protect the general?

384
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,559
Everyone stationed at the safe house
was gone in an instant.

385
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,187
That was different.

386
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,107
It was an attack with a different weapon.

387
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,025
A different weapon?

388
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,488
In any case, please take a look at these.

389
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,368
These are the parts scattered
around Epsilon's orphanage.

390
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,288
They seem to be from the left arm
of a robot made in Persia.

391
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,790
A robot that was created

392
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,085
for environmental development
but converted for the military.

393
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,586
Just the left arm?

394
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,004
Anything else?

395
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,173
Not that we have found.

396
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,845
Epsilon, we're all aware
of your pacifist views,

397
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:47,308
so we're concerned that you may have
gone easy on the enemy again.

398
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,402
No matter how many times we fight,
he will never be my adversary.

399
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:02,991
Something like this should be discussed
once Epsilon gets back.

400
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,909
That's why I came today.

401
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,369
What?

402
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,122
I'm sure you are aware, Ms. Griffith,

403
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,667
of what people say about this foster home,

404
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,838
about whether a robot
can be a parent to a human child.

405
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,924
We at the Child Services Agency

406
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,804
have no problem with outstanding humans
like you serving as childcare workers.

407
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,683
The problem is Epsilon.

408
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,772
Epsilon cares more for the children
than any human could!

409
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,065
Even so,

410
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,361
it would be better for these children
to be taken in by humans.

411
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,905
Don't you agree?

412
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:50,747
Especially since we have Mr. Johansen here
willing to get involved.

413
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,664
Yes.

414
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,044
Once he becomes my child,
I will make sure he has a happy life.

415
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,507
Mr. Johansen is one
of the most prominent people in Oslo.

416
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,552
My wife and I have visited several times,
and our hearts are set

417
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,179
on helping this child.

418
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,598
I hope for a favorable answer.

419
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,434
But

420
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,688
out of all the children, why that boy?

421
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,401
Yes?

422
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,320
I've brought him.

423
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,697
Oh!

424
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,624
Wassily, come here.

425
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,378
Wassily.

426
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,884
It's okay. Don't be scared.

427
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,971
Wassily, have you ever seen snow before?

428
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,309
Mr. Johansen, Wassily is--

429
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:57,981
Mr. Johansen is prepared to make
a substantial donation to the foster home.

430
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,818
Are you going to deny the boy the chance

431
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:06,155
to be adopted by ideal parents
just because he doesn't like it?

432
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,409
Why don't we go see snow?

433
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,960
Look! It's Epsilon!

434
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,675
- Welcome back, Epsilon!
- It's Epsilon!

435
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,968
Welcome, Epsilon!

436
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,927
You're back!

437
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,555
Hey now, I've only got one body, you know.

438
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,017
Stop that, children.
Epsilon must be tired.

439
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,853
The hearing must have been tough.

440
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,229
It was fine.

441
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,441
Well then, what shall we play today?

442
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,405
Where's Wassily?

443
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,782
He went with that man.

444
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,118
The man who's really rich.

445
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,620
What's going on?

446
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,791
Where's Wassily?

447
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,002
He went to Oslo.

448
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,631
Oslo? No one told me about this!

449
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,426
We had no choice.

450
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,194
Enough already.

451
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,156
How many times do you have to stop?

452
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,080
Mr. Johansen is prepared to make
a substantial donation to the foster home.

453
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,551
There's no point holding hands anymore!

454
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,262
There's the door.

455
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,515
Once you go through, my work is done.

456
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,476
Don't give me any more trouble.
Quickly now.

457
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,105
I told you to hurry up!

458
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,567
I have the tracking results!

459
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,614
Wassily was taken
to Vigeland Castle in Oslo.

460
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,199
However,

461
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,079
Johansen, the man who took Wassily,
doesn't exist.

462
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,872
- What--
- That can't be.

463
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,502
I've brought the boy.

464
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,390
I hope you've been gentle with him.

465
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:41,144
Why, I handled him
as if he were made of glass.

466
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,816
Well then, if you'd excuse me...

467
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,910
Bora...

468
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,373
Don't be scared.

469
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:07,712
Bora!

470
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,881
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

471
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,301
- There's nothing to be scared of.
- Bora!

472
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,929
You'd better not shout that so loud.

473
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,392
You're a bad boy.
That's why this is happening to you.

474
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,854
You're a very bad boy for seeing Bora.

475
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,277
But Epsilon will come to the rescue,
even for a bad boy like you.

476
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,280
Epsilon is quite kind, isn't he?

477
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,240
Isn't that right?

478
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,054
I've come this far for you.

479
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,932
Failure is not an option. Not this time.

480
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:07,647
Epsilon is the last one remaining.
Kill him, and all will be over.

481
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,775
You will be victorious.

482
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,904
Even with only one arm, you will win.

483
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,032
When it's all over,

484
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,787
the world will regret
the sins it has committed!

485
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,997
You hear me, Pluto?

486
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,430
Epsilon, isn't that...

487
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,518
The body armor that was issued to me
during the Central Asian War.

488
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,313
I had no need for it
since I refused to enlist.

489
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,356
Wait!

490
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,860
Wassily's life is in danger.

491
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,737
The military will be ready to deploy
any moment now.

492
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,865
It's me they're after.

493
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,369
Why didn't you finish him off?

494
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:11,169
You must have had the chance
to strike the final blow.

495
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,713
Why didn't you do it?

496
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,436
You don't need to come.
I don't want to create any more victims.

497
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,271
No, I'm coming with you.

498
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,273
You don't need to protect me.

499
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,026
I'll be protecting Wassily.

500
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,928
He'll be here any moment, Pluto.

501
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,766
You must settle it by sunrise.

502
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,898
Bora!

503
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,566
Be quiet!

504
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,284
What are you doing?

505
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,414
Defying your father, are you?

506
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:36,504
Since when do you take
that sort of attitude with your creator?

507
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:43,678
Once this battle is over,
you can go back to your original body.

508
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,600
You know that, right, Pluto?

509
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,697
I'm picking up Wassily's bio-readings.

510
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,407
I'm going in.

511
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,992
I want you to stay here.

512
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,536
<i>But you are a Photon Energy-powered robot.</i>

513
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,996
<i>You should wait until sunrise!</i>

514
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,957
I have to rescue Wassily
as soon as possible!

515
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,085
<i>Wait! I will use my stealth ability!</i>

516
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:32,893
Behind this door.

517
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,564
I'll break it down.

518
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,358
Breach!

519
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,281
Epsilon!

520
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,782
Rescue Wassily, quickly!

521
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,200
- But--
- Hurry!

522
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,660
Wassily!

523
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,169
He still had that much power left?

524
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,805
Wassily! Are you all right? Wassily!

525
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,232
I'm running out of energy.

526
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,193
Is it

527
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,028
dawn yet?

528
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,876
Finish him! Finish him off, Pluto!

529
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,096
The child...

530
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,972
The child?

531
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,808
You mean Wassily?

532
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,270
I've secured Wassily! He is safe, Epsilon!

533
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,731
He's safe!

534
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,321
Is it Sahad inside you?

535
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,117
What happened to you?

536
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,411
Who is Abullah?

537
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,329
What is Bora?

538
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,209
The sun is rising.

539
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,212
Finish him off now!

540
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,890
Help...

541
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,980
Help me...

542
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,709
TOBIO TENMA

543
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,672
So it was you.

544
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,302
You're the one who's been leaving flowers
at Tobio's grave.

545
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,512
You're...

546
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,684
This is my son's grave.

547
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,315
Are you, by any chance...

548
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,484
I'm Uran.

549
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,028
Atom's little sister.

550
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,112
Yes.

551
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,201
A robot visiting a grave...

552
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,328
Truly incredible.

553
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,247
You're Ochanomizu's masterpiece.

554
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,292
Can you tell me

555
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,754
how Tobio is doing up in heaven?

556
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,591
I don't know about heaven
or that sort of thing,

557
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,262
but I do know that you are grieving.

558
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,182
You do?

559
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,435
You understand grief?
Understand the heart?

560
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,523
I don't know if it can be called a heart,
but emotions...

561
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,400
Like right now.

562
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,446
Somewhere, far away,

563
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,990
I sense two emotions.

564
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,786
Terrible, terrible sadness...

565
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:21,914
<i>from two sources.</i>

566
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,335
It's sunrise!

567
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,878
You've won, Epsilon!

568
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,339
What are you doing? Finish him off, Pluto!

569
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:37,888
Why didn't you finish me off last time?

570
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,309
Why didn't you kill me?

571
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,272
Because the wavelengths you emit told me...

572
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,694
you were sad.

573
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:56,448
Then kill me now!

574
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,675
That's it.

575
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,847
Use your Photon Energy to melt me away!

576
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,185
Do it! Kill me, please!

577
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,107
Come on! Do it!

578
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,377
You are

579
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,130
Sahad.

580
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,969
Let's find your original body.

581
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,974
We'll put your artificial intelligence
back into your original body.

582
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,434
Let's stop this.

583
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,897
You can stop by your own will.

584
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,653
I can't.

585
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,823
He's coming.

586
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,534
Who's coming?

587
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,335
The sun. It should have risen already,

588
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,671
yet it's disappeared.

589
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,593
Bora!

590
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,223
What's happening?

591
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,100
Wassily!

592
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,853
It's no use! I can't hold on!

593
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,024
Use my energy!

594
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,372
Epsilon...

595
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,343
That's your brother.

596
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,812
Dr. Tenma? Doctor?

597
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,983
Wassily! Are you all right?

598
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,444
Your hands are protecting us!

599
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,462
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

600
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,549
<i>Everyone, I'm back.</i>

601
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,594
<i>What's going on?</i>

602
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,471
<i>Everyone?</i>

603
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,223
<i>I see.</i>

604
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,976
<i>This is just an image in my memory.</i>

605
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:17,024
<i>I thought you all were here in real life,
so I tried to hug you.</i>

606
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,527
<i>Hug you...</i>

607
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:23,989
<i>Huh?</i>

608
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,493
<i>Where are my arms?</i>

609
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,372
<i>Where is my body?</i>

610
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,169
<i>Am I...</i>

611
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,811
Atom?

612
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,439
Do you recognize me, Atom? It's me, Uran!

613
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,859
<i>So he's finally awakened.</i>

614
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,695
Dr. Tenma.

615
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,533
<i>I've installed certain data
in his artificial intelligence.</i>

616
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,910
<i>Unbalanced emotions.</i>

617
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,330
<i>A program to simplify the chaos.</i>

618
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,292
<i>It finished processing
all the information,</i>

619
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,504
and the only thing left to do
was to wait for him to wake up.

620
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,880
And now, it has finally--

621
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,760
What are these brain waves?

622
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,929
And these numbers?

623
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,517
What is going on here?

624
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,311
<i>Something came down just now.</i>

625
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,064
Right before Atom opened his eyes,

626
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,066
something flew down!

627
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,026
What is this "something"?

628
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,364
A humongous

629
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,616
sadness.

630
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,411
<i>I understand now.</i>

631
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,496
<i>I understand everything.</i>

632
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,540
<i>I know who Pluto is,</i>

633
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,959
<i>who Abullah is,</i>

634
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,462
<i>and what Bora is.</i>

635
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,439
Bora!

636
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,316
That huge shadow...

637
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,359
Is that Bora?

638
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,697
Epsilon is...

639
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,948
Don't look!

640
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:30,866
Epsilon...

641
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,492
Epsilon has...

642
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,079
become light.

643
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,049
The morning sun is back.

644
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,428
The giant shadow is gone, and so is Pluto.

645
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,347
Those hands...

646
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,183
Epsilon's hands!

647
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,684
Yes.

648
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,062
They protected us.

649
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,704
Thank you, Epsilon.

650
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:22,876
<i>Someone.</i>

651
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,505
<i>Anyone.</i>

652
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,632
<i>Please, in my stead...</i>

653
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,096
For the earth, in my stead...

654
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,849
<i>For the earth...</i>

655
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,282
Epsilon.

656
00:49:55,075 --> 00:50:00,288
You probably would be reluctant
to hear this,

657
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,961
but you are no coward
who dodged enlistment.

658
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,506
You were a truly brave warrior.

659
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,351
Sadness flew down, huh?

660
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,188
<i>Uran, you must love reading books.</i>

661
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,648
What?

662
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:31,236
You are simply good at
expressing things poetically.

663
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,905
You don't understand
other people's feelings.

664
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,616
But I do understand!

665
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:41,580
<i>I know how sad you were
in front of Tobio's grave!</i>

666
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,540
I sensed it!

667
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,919
<i>I can sense how sad and empty
you feel right now!</i>

668
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,924
Dr. Tenma, wait!

669
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,801
Dr. Tenma!

670
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:00,932
Atom.

671
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,727
Atom, it's me, Uran! Do you understand me?

672
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,437
I understand.

673
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,938
Thank goodness.

674
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,648
Atom,

675
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,817
you came back to life.

676
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,529
I understand, Epsilon.

677
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:15,989
What?

678
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,075
Atom?

679
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,910
I understand,

680
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,412
Gesicht.

681
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,962
Hmm?

682
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,256
A crack?

683
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,718
The earth is going to break.

684
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,872
