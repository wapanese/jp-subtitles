1
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,730
Stop!

2
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,067
I...

3
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,403
Can't you see I'm badly wounded?

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,643
Still playing innocent?

5
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,145
You murdered my brother!

6
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,025
"Super robot detective," my ass!

7
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,861
You're nothing but a murderous machine!

8
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,344
You call this a safe house?

9
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,388
It's just a log cabin!

10
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,558
How can I protect myself
in a place like this?

11
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,019
The inside is equipped
with a state-of-the-art security system.

12
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,730
Hey! Where are you going?

13
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,399
I'll be back in an hour.

14
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,401
Get inside and don't leave,
no matter what.

15
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,570
Your wife and son should be here soon.

16
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,114
Hey, wait! You're abandoning your post?

17
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,575
Your mission is to protect--

18
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,559
<i>If you want to save your family,</i>

19
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,728
kill Gesicht.

20
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:11,608
Under the larch tree 200 steps north
of the safe house,

21
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,526
there will be a weapon.

22
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,287
Dad!

23
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,747
Hans.

24
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,421
Where's Gesicht?

25
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,883
Don't mention his name.

26
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,218
Dear.

27
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,595
What's going on?

28
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,223
I'm sorry to have worried you, Ilsa.

29
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,309
Why must we go through all this?

30
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,189
What in the world did you do?

31
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,119
You're back, huh?

32
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,622
He said you might be coming...

33
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,505
Ah, there you are.

34
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,258
So you finally remembered.

35
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,261
How does it feel?

36
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,811
Wow!

37
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,189
The basement is like a fallout shelter!
And there's a gym too!

38
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,483
Is that the whole truth?

39
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,153
Yes.

40
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,905
Unbelievable.

41
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,866
To think you would go after Gesicht...

42
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,411
I was hoping you'd understand.

43
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,328
Well, I don't!

44
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:52,083
Gesicht may have killed a human,
but we're talking about your brother!

45
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:03,177
A goal! Hans is the champion!

46
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,222
I'm sorry for what I'm about to say,

47
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,268
but your brother deserved to die.

48
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,440
He committed countless crimes,
and it's not just about the number.

49
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,109
It sends chills down my spine.

50
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,486
Just thinking about it makes me nauseous.

51
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,824
Yes, he was a sick man.

52
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,536
But even so, he didn't deserve
to be killed by a robot.

53
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,456
You don't know that it was intentional.

54
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,000
Robots can malfunction.

55
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,502
No. It was his duty.

56
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,714
Gesicht was faithfully following orders.

57
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,216
He didn't do it
out of any particular emotion.

58
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,344
Gesicht

59
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,096
didn't kill your brother out of hatred.

60
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>You killed him out of hatred.</i>

61
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,189
I knew it from the first moment I saw you.

62
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,649
You and I are the same.

63
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,237
Try as they might,
that memory will never be scrubbed away.

64
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,992
The scar from that gaping wound
will always be there.

65
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,037
Stop!

66
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,081
I was wrong!

67
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,124
I...

68
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,670
Please spare me! Don't do it!

69
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,270
Try and scratch that itch.

70
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:42,902
Then you'll remember even more clearly
how true hatred feels.

71
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,452
I must return to my post.

72
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:07,385
<i>In the red corner, the WPKKR champion,</i>

73
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:12,557
<i>the god of battle, Hercules!</i>

74
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,017
Hercules!

75
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,773
His opponent this time will be formidable.

76
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,859
But that doesn't matter.

77
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,863
The strong prevail
until someone stronger defeats them.

78
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,657
That's all there is to it.

79
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,749
The sea is getting rough.

80
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,795
Listen, Gesicht
is investigating this case.

81
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,299
Don't do anything reckless.
Work together to find a solution.

82
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes. We will.

83
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,355
It's coming.

84
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,023
You sense it too?

85
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,817
Yes. Abnormal electromagnetic waves.

86
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,569
Shall I help you?

87
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,031
You are not equipped to help me here.

88
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,743
True. I am not wired that way.

89
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,663
And I am wired precisely for the task.

90
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,208
I'm a machine made for battle.

91
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,043
Leave quickly.

92
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,172
A robot with no combat functions
will only slow me down.

93
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,134
You're looking down on me again,

94
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,555
just as you did
when I refused to fight in the war.

95
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,441
Maybe you were right.

96
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,533
Maybe you were right in refusing to fight.

97
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,287
I am built to fight.

98
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,749
But that war was no fight.

99
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,168
<i>Back then,</i>

100
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,088
<i>there was a robot who fought alongside me.</i>

101
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,799
<i>As an airborne brigade elite,</i>

102
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,553
<i>he helped lead us to success
on many missions through his actions.</i>

103
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,230
<i>The last time I saw him,</i>

104
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,526
<i>he kept washing his hands.</i>

105
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,487
<i>Over and over again.</i>

106
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,489
<i>Despite being a robot,</i>

107
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,034
<i>he kept washing his hands.</i>

108
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,412
Hey, what are you doing?

109
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,581
It won't come off.

110
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
What won't?

111
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,668
It won't come off.

112
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,676
The enemy coming our way is a ghost.

113
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,594
A ghost?

114
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,639
What I'm about to fight

115
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,142
<i>are the ghosts of those who fell.</i>

116
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,271
Go.

117
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,398
You bear no guilt.

118
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,525
You have no reason to be killed.

119
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,320
But Atom was killed.

120
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,991
He bore no guilt either,
so why was he killed?

121
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,914
You know something.

122
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,876
No, you learned something in that war.

123
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,252
Just go.

124
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,217
I'll be standing by at 3,000 meters.

125
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,930
Suit yourself. You can collect the data
from my fight up there.

126
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,853
I fight better when there's an audience,
even an audience of one.

127
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,440
After all, I'm Hercules,
the god of battle.

128
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,712
Brando...

129
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,049
We fought many battles
that will go down in history.

130
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,052
<i>They all ended in no contest.</i>

131
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,472
<i>I wish we could have settled it, Brando.</i>

132
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,228
We may not have been able
to settle our score,

133
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,898
but I will settle it with this thing!

134
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,826
However, this isn't a game.

135
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,832
It's a fight to the death!

136
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,627
They say the world
is made up of winners and losers,

137
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,382
wise men and fools,
the living and the dead.

138
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:43,095
But everyone is a loser, a fool, and dead.

139
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,848
Everyone except for me.

140
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,906
You won't fool me
with childish tricks like that!

141
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,171
Die!

142
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,683
I hereby declare
the 99th military tribunal in session.

143
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,811
The defendant is to be sworn in.

144
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,485
I order you to take the oath immediately,
defendant Darius XIV.

145
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,987
Oath?

146
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,199
God has no faith in the oaths of men.

147
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,286
You have repeated the same response
99 times now.

148
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,163
Take the oath immediately.

149
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,835
Humans lie.

150
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,504
God does not believe them.

151
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,005
The defendant is out of order!

152
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,676
In the eyes of God,
humanity is a failed creation.

153
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,554
Humanity is in need of replacement.

154
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,472
A new species.

155
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,933
Robots are that species!

156
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,893
Enough nonsense!

157
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,688
Court is adjourned!
Remove the defendant from the courtroom!

158
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,897
He's responsible!

159
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,025
A new species?
You're the one who slaughtered them!

160
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,820
You're full of contradictions!

161
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,947
- Order in the court!
- That's right!

162
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,866
There are no contradictions.

163
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,493
That was no slaughter.

164
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,662
It was an evolutionary stage.

165
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,373
Hold Darius in contempt of court!

166
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,875
Darius must be sentenced!

167
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,751
Death to Darius!

168
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,797
I'm from a human rights organization.

169
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,799
If there's anything we can do to help you...

170
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,887
Bring me crayons.

171
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,102
Hercules...

172
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,484
These parts are his...

173
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,862
No, some belong to the enemy!

174
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,822
Did they destroy each other?

175
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,705
<i>That's the body Hercules uses
for daily life.</i>

176
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,338
What is going on?

177
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,965
The parts are scattered all over the sea--

178
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,218
The abnormal electromagnetic waves are--

179
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,020
That's...

180
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,982
If I can break off this horn,

181
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,651
then surely you will...

182
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,948
If I help him now,
we can defeat the enemy!

183
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,301
Hey, what are you doing?

184
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,553
It won't come off.

185
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,305
What won't?

186
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,726
It won't come off.

187
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,399
What are these images?

188
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,068
I can't move my body!

189
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,071
So that's

190
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,031
who you are!

191
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,886
It's way past lights out.

192
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,388
What are you doing?

193
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,435
When the flood returns,

194
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,770
the ones who board the ark,

195
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,398
the ones chosen by God...

196
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,357
Hey!

197
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,319
Humans or robots, which will it be?

198
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,571
Open up.

199
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,073
The only one who will survive...

200
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,617
What the...

201
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,746
...is Pluto.

202
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,332
Hercules!

203
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,853
<i>Where</i>

204
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,147
<i>am I?</i>

205
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,608
<i>I'm</i>

206
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,818
<i>running away.</i>

207
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,196
<i>From what?</i>

208
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,961
Hercules is dead.

209
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,090
I must let him know.

210
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,550
I must!

211
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,637
Only he has the authority
to arrest the enemy.

212
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,514
Gesicht.

213
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,267
Gesicht?

214
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,061
Gesicht?

215
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,271
The channel's been cut off!

216
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,898
<i>Gesicht!</i>

217
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
<i>Gesicht, please respond!</i>

218
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,485
<i>Gesicht!</i>

219
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,947
<i>Did you have the same look
in your eyes back then?</i>

220
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,075
You're the one who killed my brother!

221
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,829
Right this way, please.

222
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,292
Could you confirm that this is your child?

223
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,844
Gesicht, I can take it from here.

224
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,470
Check the other room.

225
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,652
There's no mistake. This is our child.

226
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,331
Humans cry like that
in these situations, don't they?

227
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,044
I understand somewhat.

228
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,463
Yes.

229
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,846
We applied as soon as
the Robot Adoption System was launched.

230
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,641
It took four years
until this child came to us.

231
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,105
There were many couples
on the waiting list, you know?

232
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,901
I was so happy
when I met this child for the first time.

233
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,402
Yes.

234
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,282
We're finally living in an age
when robots can have families.

235
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,536
We thought we could live as a family.

236
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,212
I'm Gesicht. I'll be joining
the investigation from today on.

237
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,171
Nice to meet you.

238
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,424
Is it a good idea
to have a robot on this case?

239
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,426
I'm just following orders.

240
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,931
Robot children were kidnapped
and torn to pieces.

241
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,726
The crimes may have been committed
by someone with anti-robot beliefs.

242
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,896
Your involvement could be considered
a conflict of interest.

243
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,608
Yes, and that's why I will
only investigate other possibilities.

244
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,323
What about the surveillance?

245
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,745
Like the others, the kidnapping took place
after the B-Com Eye 3 was destroyed.

246
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,207
In all, there have been
23 kidnapping cases like this one.

247
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,419
Every time, the perpetrator kidnapped
the kid after destroying the system.

248
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,465
There are 304 places
where B-Com Eye 3 systems were installed.

249
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,678
All known robot haters, radicals,
and ex-convicts in the area

250
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,180
were recorded elsewhere
at the time of the crime.

251
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,226
Which means all of our suspects
have an alibi.

252
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

253
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,235
Why did you tell the media
that I joined the investigation?

254
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,987
It's a diversionary tactic.

255
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:28,161
We'll show the public
how committed we are to solving the case.

256
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,830
More importantly,

257
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:34,001
your involvement might prevent
the next crime from happening.

258
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,256
We've narrowed the list of robot haters
to those not seen on surveillance

259
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,967
in the Euro Federation
at the time of the crime.

260
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,510
There are seven of them.

261
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,013
They're all under surveillance right now.

262
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,348
What is the failure rate
of B-Com Eye 3 systems?

263
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,266
Huh?

264
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,604
Can you compare the failure rates
before and after the incidents?

265
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,774
Oh, the manufacturer has that data.

266
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,154
The system itself is top-notch,
but it is prone to failures.

267
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,823
The failure rate over the last three years

268
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,492
is 3.26%.

269
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,495
And after the incidents...

270
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,205
Huh?

271
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,666
It's 3.25%.

272
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,045
Though the crimes were committed
after the suspect destroyed the system,

273
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,880
the failure rate isn't affected.

274
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,594
<i>We have a report
of a kidnapping in Ward W-25!</i>

275
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,346
<i>The victim is a robot child!</i>

276
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,098
Gesicht, head to the scene.

277
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,475
Yes, sir.

278
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,812
Helena? Sorry.
I'm responding to an emergency.

279
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,024
What?

280
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,486
What's wrong?

281
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,782
Hey, where are you going?

282
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,701
- Henry!
- I'm coming!

283
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,412
Find the causes
of the B-Com Eye 3 failures.

284
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,330
What?

285
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,665
I can't access the data in this case.

286
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,876
I need your help.

287
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,045
But if we don't hurry to the scene--

288
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,421
Just do it now!

289
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:02,839
Gesicht?

290
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,925
You don't sound like yourself.

291
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,349
These are the causes of all failures
occurring in the last three months.

292
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:17,104
Three outages due to lightning strikes
and 38 problems with control chips.

293
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,731
Can you compare that
to data from the last three years?

294
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,649
Okay.

295
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,819
The ratio is pretty much the same.

296
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,364
The perpetrator
didn't destroy the systems.

297
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,323
What?

298
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,911
But it's possible to emit electromagnetic
waves that are identical to lightning...

299
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,792
There is one case where the system
was clearly destroyed by human means.

300
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,252
It happened yesterday?

301
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,213
But there were no kidnappings yesterday.

302
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,590
Show the list of maintenance contractors.

303
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,095
Bring up the maintenance contractors
in the kidnappings' vicinity!

304
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,349
It didn't start with the system's failure.

305
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,017
It started with its repair!

306
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,230
There's only one person responsible
for repairing the system

307
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,857
at the kidnapping site!

308
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,702
Hey, Gesicht?

309
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,455
<i>Gesicht! Do you copy, Gesicht?</i>

310
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,498
<i>Gesicht isn't responding!</i>

311
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,417
<i>It's no use.
The comm channel has been shut off.</i>

312
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,629
<i>Respond, Gesicht!
This is insubordination! Gesicht!</i>

313
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,089
Stop!

314
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,300
Please don't!

315
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,974
Don't shoot me!

316
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,702
No, I can't.

317
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,333
I can't run away from this.

318
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,760
Damn it!

319
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,513
There will be a weapon.

320
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,017
Where the hell is this so-called weapon?

321
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,143
Mr. Haas!

322
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,730
Oh, I'm Meyer from Europol.

323
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,066
What are you doing there?

324
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,903
You want me to go back
to the safe house, right? I know.

325
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,905
No, that's not it.

326
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:37,494
You stopped at a rest area by the forest
before you got here, didn't you?

327
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,538
What about it?

328
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,208
There was a suspicious man
on the security camera footage from there.

329
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,709
We looked into him,

330
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,712
and it seems he's a member
of the organization that's after you.

331
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,715
They know your movements.

332
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,385
We must transfer you
to another location now.

333
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,844
Oh, I see.

334
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,388
Inspector Meyer!

335
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,307
Gesicht is back.

336
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,059
Hey, Gesicht!

337
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,062
You're not to leave your post
without permission!

338
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,106
I'm sorry, sir.

339
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,276
It's unthinkable for a robot
to do something like this.

340
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,278
I'll have to file a report later.

341
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,238
But for now, Mr. Haas's protection--

342
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,032
I heard the situation.
I will move him right away.

343
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,744
Let's go, Mr. Haas.

344
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,080
Abandoning your mission, huh?

345
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,749
Just like back then.

346
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,252
What you did to my brother
was not your mission.

347
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,008
My mission right now is to protect you.

348
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,982
Say, which direction
are the bad guys coming from?

349
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,859
Stop talking nonsense and sit down!

350
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,112
But we'll be okay
no matter where they come from, right?

351
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,655
Because Gesicht is here!

352
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,700
The other inspector's car behind us
is guarding the rear.

353
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,869
You don't need to worry, Hans.

354
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,455
What will you do if the bad guys show up?

355
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,750
- Does your arm transform into a gun?
- Hans!

356
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:11,963
But I learned in school
that robots can't shoot people.

357
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,215
How are you going to do them in?

358
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,760
He'll shoot them if it comes to that.

359
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,677
Right?

360
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,679
That's enough, dear.

361
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,098
What is it?

362
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,100
The car behind us...

363
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,813
Wait, I don't see the inspector's car!

364
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,941
I've lost communication.

365
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,276
They're coming!

366
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,697
Someone's after us?

367
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm going to speed up.
Fasten your seat belts!

368
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,292
They're speeding up--

369
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,175
The police car disappeared in an instant.

370
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,302
The weapon they're using could be...

371
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,804
A compact cluster cannon.

372
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,473
Most likely,

373
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,476
it's the same model I had acquired

374
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,812
since it's strong enough to kill you.

375
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,027
Help us, please!

376
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,280
At least my wife and my son.

377
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,032
Please.

378
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,870
The robot at the rest area told me

379
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,915
that if I wanted to save my family,

380
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:30,917
I'd have to

381
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,211
kill you.

382
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,171
But from the start,

383
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,425
they were planning
to dispose of all of us,

384
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,262
so I couldn't expose the truth
about the anti-robot cult.

385
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,432
I hate you.

386
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,559
You killed my brother.

387
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,394
That's why

388
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,771
I tried to kill you.

389
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,315
This hatred,

390
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,777
you know it too, even if you are a robot.

391
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,199
Without hatred,
you could never kill someone like that.

392
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,371
But that's between you,
me, and my brother!

393
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,166
My family has nothing to do with this!

394
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:12,876
Please...

395
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,462
Please save my wife and my son!

396
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,090
Mr. Haas, grab the lever to your right.

397
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,009
- What?
- Grab the lever to your right!

398
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,557
Hans! Mrs. Haas!

399
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,773
Hans! Ilsa!

400
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,696
Hans! Ilsa!

401
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,782
Hans!

402
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,824
Ilsa!

403
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,126
A regular gun is enough for you.

404
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,378
But the leader told me

405
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,007
to make this all look like
it was your doing,

406
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,220
and that you died in the explosion
from the cluster cannon.

407
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,140
No hard feelings.

408
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,351
Drop your weapon!

409
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,561
Ah, the robot detective.

410
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,064
Aren't you forbidden
from firing your right arm?

411
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,565
I'm a human, you see?

412
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,487
You're not allowed to kill humans, right?

413
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,991
Come any closer,
and I'll fire this bad boy.

414
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,829
Mr. Haas, walk toward me slowly.

415
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,792
Step slowly behind me.

416
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,422
Suits me just fine.

417
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:46,052
This cluster cannon can easily blast
the two of you into pieces,

418
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,055
even if you're made of Zeronium.

419
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,016
Two birds with one stone.

420
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,142
Get behind me!

421
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,798
My left arm shoots sleeping gas.

422
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,635
You can surrender quietly,
and I'll read you your rights,

423
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,346
or you can be knocked out by the gas.

424
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,640
Which will it be?

425
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,392
Say it.

426
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,023
Gesicht.

427
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,401
My brother was the worst of the worst.

428
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,571
And yet,

429
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,365
you used your own body to shield me,

430
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,076
the man who tried to kill you.

431
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,537
It was my duty.

432
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,955
Gesicht...

433
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,709
Mr. Haas, there's something
I want to ask you.

434
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,463
Does the hatred you humans feel
ever disappear?

435
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,423
Or does it never go away,

436
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,384
no matter how many times
you try to erase it?

437
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,349
What I was most afraid of...

438
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,562
is myself,

439
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,315
now that I've learned how to hate.

440
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,537
She's been keeping to herself
on the schoolyard these days.

441
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,251
She used to be so cheerful,
but she doesn't talk much anymore,

442
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,587
not since the incident.

443
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,008
I guess it proves
how advanced she is as a robot.

444
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,678
Who knew a robot could go through
a personality change...

445
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,054
Of course she could!

446
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,726
Robots feel sorrow and shed tears,
just like humans do.

447
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,436
Principal...

448
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,148
There are no high or low specs
when it comes to the heart.

449
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,025
You're right, sir.

450
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:11,823
Even an old robot model like me
feels sorrow.

451
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,992
Mr. Sakamoto...

452
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,787
But the question is,

453
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,665
what can we do as educators
in a situation like this?

454
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,210
How can we save her from her sorrow?

455
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,508
Uran, you aren't the only one

456
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,261
who grieves Atom's loss.

457
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,821
I feel something.

458
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,287
Something out there
is feeling sadder than I am.

459
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,683
Was it you who was feeling so sad?

460
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,393
Where's your mommy?

461
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,854
No.

462
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,273
It's coming from over there.

463
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,661
Is it you?

464
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,751
Are you the one who is feeling sad?

465
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,461
Leave me alone.

466
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,384
There's an electromagnetic net below,
so there's no use jumping.

467
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,302
Then...

468
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,722
then what am I supposed to do?

469
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,642
I get bullied day in and day out.

470
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,436
They threaten me for money!

471
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,438
They call me dirty and stinky!

472
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,361
What am I supposed to do?

473
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,492
I'd be better off dead.

474
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,747
I don't understand.

475
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,582
Huh?

476
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,253
I don't understand what it feels like
to want to die

477
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,255
because I'm a robot.

478
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,842
How could a robot possibly understand?

479
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,053
I'm not programmed that way.

480
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,098
Just leave me alone already.

481
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,767
And that's why my brother

482
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,104
had no feeling of wanting to die.

483
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,565
Yet, he was killed.

484
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,111
Right now, I'm really sad.

485
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,197
If I were human,

486
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,450
would I want to die like you?

487
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:10,084
This kitten was sad too,
but it didn't want to die.

488
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,839
All it thinks about is how it wants milk
and how hungry it is.

489
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,759
Was that cat abandoned?

490
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,108
It's pretty cute.

491
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,904
But we've got to feed it soon.
It's shaking.

492
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,907
Can you get some milk for the cat?

493
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,824
What?

494
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,202
There's someone even sadder over there!

495
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,954
Hey!

496
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,800
Is this what you're looking for?

497
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,928
Oh!

498
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,181
Yes, this is my wallet.

499
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:11,395
I put my pension card in here
so I could buy a gift for my grandchild.

500
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,023
Thank you.

501
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,566
I'm truly grate...

502
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,576
It's here.

503
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,288
I can sense
such immense sadness from here.

504
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,635
This is the spot.

505
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,555
The person I sensed was just here.

506
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,058
Incredible sadness...

507
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,063
As if they experienced
the same person dying twice.

508
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,070
"Tobio... Tenma."

509
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,162
Oh, Minister Ochanomizu.

510
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,248
The Chief Cabinet Secretary
called many times...

511
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,165
Let them wait.

512
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,417
But, sir...

513
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,629
Tell them I have no interest
in discussing a state funeral for Atom.

514
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,007
I'm not giving up yet.

515
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,760
More importantly,
have you heard back from him yet?

516
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,678
"Him"?

517
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,763
I told you! The former minis--

518
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,598
You can't enter without permission!

519
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,226
Please make an appointment.

520
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,729
Otherwise, the security system
cannot verify you.

521
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,814
There will be no problem with security.

522
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,190
But, like I said...

523
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,402
I am the former head
of the Ministry of Science.

524
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,903
- What?
- Dr. Tenma!

525
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,614
You came! I've been waiting for you!

526
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,661
I knew you'd come.

527
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,873
You're the only one
who can save Atom in his current state.

528
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,334
Only you, the one who brought Atom
into the world.

529
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,044
It's impossible. He can't be saved.

530
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,005
I've come to say goodbye.

531
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,215
Atom is dead.

532
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,281
Tobio is

533
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,116
dead.

534
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,132
Tobio, what did you do today?

535
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,384
Today?

536
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:51,055
Today, I studied in the morning
and cleaned up my room in the afternoon.

537
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,266
I found an insect encyclopedia
at the back of my bookcase.

538
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,937
It was so interesting
that I forgot all about cleaning.

539
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,856
There's a pretty butterfly
called a zephyrus.

540
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,192
I'd love to see one in real life.

541
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,196
Tobio.

542
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,535
Do you think this dish is tasty?

543
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,995
Yes, it's really tasty!

544
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,957
I see.

545
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,736
Minister! Minister Ochanomizu!

546
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,114
It's Dr. Tenma!

547
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,743
He's repairing Atom!
He's trying to revive him!

548
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,913
It's incredible.
I've never seen anything like it!

549
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,835
He's connected RS-889 while simultaneously
controlling the motherboard!

550
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,795
And he's randomly replacing motion data.

551
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:11,635
<i>Outputting data to H2K-4380.
Releasing shield on Troy 647K.</i>

552
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,263
<i>Updating TNT module.</i>

553
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,474
<i>BQ lines on auto control.</i>

554
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,405
Are we witnessing
the technique of a true genius?

555
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,742
You said you came to say goodbye.

556
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,787
I knew you would do this.

557
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,665
Dr. Tenma...

558
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:57,515
After working nonstop for 18 hours,
you should get some rest.

559
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,519
I'll leave your tea here.

560
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,776
So, what do you think about
Atom's prognosis?

561
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,196
The head of the Ministry of Science,
Professor Ochanomizu,

562
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,573
poured everything he had into him.

563
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,368
Your operations were brilliant.

564
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,578
Spare me the jokes.

565
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,582
No abnormalities
in his artificial hippocampus

566
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,876
nor his artificial right and left brains.

567
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,047
The receptor adjustment,
synaptic cleft, everything checks out.

568
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,009
Your repair work was perfect.

569
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,470
Then why won't Atom wake up?

570
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,646
Why did Atom have to meet such a fate?

571
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,611
This case involves the destruction
of all the world's most advanced robots.

572
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,071
You know this, yes?

573
00:42:55,781 --> 00:43:02,580
And the former members of the Bora Inquiry
Commission are being killed one by one.

574
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,876
Dr. Tenma,

575
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,964
do you know of a person named Goji?

576
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,175
I do not.

577
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,136
That can't be true!

578
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:21,140
I'm talking about Dr. Goji, who built
the robot army of the Kingdom of Persia!

579
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:26,270
The robot army that was only possible
because the AI you developed

580
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,189
was leaked to them. Am I wrong?

581
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,528
I have no idea.

582
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,989
My artificial intelligence

583
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,491
shouldn't be wasted
on the likes of a robot army.

584
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,580
A robot with my artificial intelligence

585
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,292
would be more noble and more complete.

586
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,545
Wanna know something?

587
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,507
I once created a perfect robot.

588
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,304
It was commissioned
by a certain individual.

589
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,516
I told them it would be extremely costly,
but they insisted.

590
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,356
The artificial intelligence of the world's
most advanced robots, including Atom.

591
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:15,486
Their programming is extremely complex,
but there are limitations.

592
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,115
So, what do you think I did?

593
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,996
I analyzed and programmed
9.9 billion personalities,

594
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,334
the same number as the world's population.

595
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,546
In other words,

596
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,593
I put every single option and possibility
into that artificial intelligence.

597
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,428
A brilliant idea, no?

598
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,264
Such a robot
could potentially become anything.

599
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,686
A grump, a coward,
a crybaby, a hard worker,

600
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,272
a scholar, a hero, or a genius?

601
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,066
Perhaps a murderer?

602
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:59,029
What do you think happened to that robot?

603
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,621
<i>It never woke up.</i>

604
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:11,792
<i>No, I should probably say
that it refused to wake up.</i>

605
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,212
It was too complicated.

606
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:20,551
It would take an eternity
to simulate 9.9 billion personalities.

607
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,596
But I knew how to wake it up.

608
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:29,184
All I had to do was to steer the chaos
of the 9.9 billion in one direction.

609
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,395
How?

610
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,814
By destroying the balance.

611
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,900
Anger, sorrow, hatred...

612
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,112
By infusing unbalanced emotions.

613
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,574
Unbalanced emotions?

614
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:49,538
Yes. Imbalance is the program
that simplifies chaos.

615
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,790
But if you did something like that...

616
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,047
Where is that robot now?

617
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,008
Who knows.

618
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,554
The owner must have it hidden away,
still asleep.

619
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:09,933
Don't tell me...

620
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:15,397
Are you saying that Atom is
in the same state right now, Dr. Tenma?

621
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,902
That he has sensed something inconceivable
and is simulating the response endlessly?

622
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:25,073
Atom won't wake up for the same reason
your perfect robot didn't wake up?

623
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,412
Are you suggesting

624
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,332
that we infuse Atom
with unbalanced emotions to wake him?

625
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,626
If we did that,

626
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,839
Atom could be reborn
as something horribly different!

627
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,051
Yes.

628
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,638
He might come back a monster.

629
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,393
I see.

630
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,270
You think it's tasty?

631
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,313
Yes!

632
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:58,857
Tobio.

633
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,734
Yes, Dad?

634
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,905
The real Tobio died in a traffic accident.

635
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,327
But I'm here now.

636
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,706
Tobio was terrible at cleaning,
and his room was always a mess.

637
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,251
Okay, from tomorrow,
I won't clean as much--

638
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,878
Tobio hated studying.

639
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,590
Then I won't study--

640
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,592
Tobio stuffed
the encyclopedia I bought him

641
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,345
in the back of the bookshelf
without looking at it.

642
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,348
Tobio

643
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,768
hated this dish.

644
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,568
Do you like me?

645
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,070
Yes, I love you, Dad.

646
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,074
I was so hard on Tobio,
scolding him all the time.

647
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,829
Because of that, I'm sure that Tobio...

648
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,546
hated me.

649
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,844
<i>Gesicht?</i>

650
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,305
<i>Do you read me?</i>

651
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:12,931
<i>Gesicht!</i>

652
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,810
<i>Hoffman here. Please respond, Gesicht!</i>

653
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,271
<i>You're still in the middle of an overhaul.</i>

654
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,440
<i>It's too dangerous
for you to return to work!</i>

655
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,777
<i>There is still shrapnel
from the cluster cannon in your body!</i>

656
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,404
<i>Gesicht?</i>

657
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,448
<i>Please respond, Gesicht!</i>

658
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,242
<i>Gesicht, this is Epsilon.</i>

659
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,952
<i>It's urgent. I need to--</i>

660
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,413
<i>...right away--</i>

661
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,360
I have an appointment.
I am Gesicht from Europol.

662
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,823
Verified. Please enter.

663
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,538
<i>Please wait in B-325.</i>

664
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,382
Welcome.

665
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,094
I'm Colonel Armstrong
of the United States of Thracia Army.

666
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,888
Gesicht of Europol.

667
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,849
Our nation did not join
the International Criminal Law Treaty.

668
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:42,813
Your request has been granted
by a special directive from the president.

669
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,693
Time is limited, so I ask that you
complete your business here quickly.

670
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,486
- Begin.
- Yes, sir.

671
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,823
Begin right here?

672
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,366
Yes. Is there a problem?

673
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:55,951
Well, no...

674
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,078
What are you doing? Hurry it up.

675
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:58,996
Yes, sir.

676
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,457
This is
a state-of-the-art prison facility,

677
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,710
but as you can see,
our robots are outdated.

678
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,130
Our country is
on the cutting edge of technology,

679
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,174
but as you may know,
we're far behind in the robot industry.

680
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,344
If we had excellent robots like you,

681
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,847
the restoration of Persia
could have gone faster.

682
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,558
But from a human rights perspective,

683
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,060
we do not produce
robots of mass destruction.

684
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,272
The link is up.

685
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,150
Make it short, please.

686
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,909
You really expect me
to interview him like this?

687
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,037
Yes. Is there a problem?

688
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,500
You're Darius XIV, correct?

689
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,712
<i>Correct.</i>

690
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,006
I'm Gesicht from Europol.

691
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,592
I'd like to ask you some questions.

692
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,720
How is life in this prison?

693
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,140
<i>Not bad.</i>

694
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,351
Let's stop with the farce.

695
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,271
- This isn't a real interview.
- Huh?

696
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,315
There are many layers of security,

697
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,318
so you can censor any comments
you find inconvenient.

698
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,903
What are you talking about?

699
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,030
Stop playing games!

700
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,574
He is an extremely important witness!

701
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,993
I will meet him in person.

702
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,161
Hey, you!

703
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,204
Wait!

704
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,956
The president granted you
a special interview,

705
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,210
but your actions
clearly violate international law--

706
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,127
- Halt!
- Halt!

707
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,965
I don't care about any relationship
between you and Europol.

708
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,842
None of that matters!

709
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,970
Right now, the whole world is in danger!

710
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,772
So you're a robot.

711
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,316
How extremely well-made.

712
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,610
You look just like a human.

713
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,697
I hope you're not as stupid
as humans though.

714
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,950
Are you the mastermind

715
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,078
behind the recent serial destruction
of advanced robots?

716
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,331
I spoke too soon. Stupid indeed.

717
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:11,753
Did you order the assassinations
of the Bora Inquiry Commission members?

718
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,132
They are all liars.

719
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,509
They reduced my country

720
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,763
to a barren desert.

721
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:27,269
They needed us to remain have-nots.

722
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:32,691
They took everything from us,
including our glorious robot civilization.

723
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,279
Because of their damn machines
and filthy artificial intelligence,

724
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,157
my country was turned to ashes.

725
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,870
Out of that resentment,
you created a robot of mass destruction.

726
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,372
You created a monster.

727
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,586
I created a monster?

728
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,590
We didn't create it. It was born.

729
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:03,096
He's the most capable and untarnished
of robots. One beloved by God.

730
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,725
"Untarnished"? "Beloved by God"?

731
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,312
A robot that repeatedly
kills and destroys?

732
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,773
You're wrong. He was reborn.

733
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,567
Reborn?

734
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,321
With a stronger, more powerful body.

735
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,365
A body that was more suited

736
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,202
to the robotic hatred
that had spawned inside his AI.

737
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,246
Robotic hatred.

738
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,958
This field of flowers.

739
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,256
This is Pluto.

740
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:40,842
Pluto.

741
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,552
Who is he?

742
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:47,557
Who is Pluto? Tell me what he is!

743
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,769
I'm sure you already know.

744
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,728
What?

745
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,986
He bit through his tongue!

746
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,321
I need help!

747
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,239
What the hell?

748
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,241
What have you done?

749
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,450
Call a medic!

750
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,868
Get him out of here!

751
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:17,379
"I'm sure you already know"?

752
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,887
<i>What? Darius XIV attempted suicide?</i>

753
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,306
Yes. But they managed to save his life.

754
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,726
<i>You're going to get us in hot water again.</i>

755
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,771
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm ready to take responsibility.

756
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,691
<i>In any case, return immediately!</i>

757
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,612
Epsilon.

758
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,827
I couldn't reach you, so I looked up
your location and flew here.

759
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,499
Hercules left this behind.

760
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,754
But that's not all he left.

761
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,132
I'd like to show you something.

762
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,466
Huh?

763
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,845
A great deal
of electromagnetic waves were emitted

764
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,847
while Hercules was fighting.

765
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:14,686
My analysis shows that most of them
fall into the genre of hatred.

766
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,566
But there was a flash
of something entirely different.

767
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:22,986
This is it.

768
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,904
I'll transfer it to you now.

769
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,493
What is this image?

770
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,420
This couldn't possibly be.

771
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,674
<i>Pluto?</i>

772
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:14,824
