1
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,717
Stand back!

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,802
It's dangerous! Please step back!

3
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,803
What's the damage?

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,597
Oh, Inspector Nakamura.

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,848
You won't believe it.

6
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,853
A localized tornado is one thing,
but for it to only damage a single truck?

7
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,274
And, of all things,
an animal transportation truck, right?

8
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,358
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,403
Lions, tigers, and cheetahs. Five in all.

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,654
What?

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,823
We've got a problem, Inspector Nakamura!

12
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:15,950
A child!

13
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,378
Can't we do something?

14
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,632
A rescue team in the area is on standby,

15
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,885
but all five cats must be taken out
all at once or else...

16
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,222
Damn it! Call for more sharpshooters!

17
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,807
What is it?

18
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,768
A little girl has crossed the police line!

19
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,478
What is she doing?

20
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,400
Don't be scared.

21
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,903
It's all right. Come here, everyone.

22
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,037
That's right. Nothing to be afraid of.

23
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,267
Now!

24
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,397
We've secured the boy.

25
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,649
Hey now!

26
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,610
You're scaring them with those guns!

27
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,532
It's Uran!

28
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,492
Give me a break.

29
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,039
You sensed that they were afraid?

30
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,457
Yes.

31
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,626
So let me get this straight, Uran.

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,921
You're saying
the lion and the tigers were afraid?

33
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,301
I don't know. I guess.

34
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:02,891
And that's why you walked two miles
out of your way to school to go there?

35
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,017
Yeah, so?

36
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,021
You can sense that animals are afraid
from that far away?

37
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,481
Yeah, I guess.

38
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,234
Wow.

39
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,694
What an amazing ability.

40
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,653
So...

41
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,698
Can I go now?

42
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,078
Oh!

43
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,917
I'm sorry for all the trouble
my sister has caused, Inspector Nakamura.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,378
Oh, not at all.
She's actually been a huge help.

45
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:38,259
Exactly. Thanks to me, the big cats
calmed down, and the boy was saved.

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,763
Worthy of
the Superintendent General Award.

47
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,766
I don't want something so boring.

48
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,852
Uran!

49
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,355
I'd rather be awarded that lion.

50
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,649
Please excuse her.
We'll be on our way now.

51
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,444
Inspector!

52
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,448
He's here, at the entrance.

53
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,784
What? Where's Superintendent Tawashi?

54
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,993
I've contacted him.

55
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,994
Good!

56
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,958
Uran, how many times must I tell you?
Don't take detours.

57
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,293
But I couldn't help it.

58
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,921
Hey, wait.

59
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,923
You two are this way.

60
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,013
No, we're supposed to go this way.

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,391
Huh? Really?

62
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,187
It's hard to tell these days...

63
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,690
Right this way, please.

64
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,670
Are you listening to me, Atom?

65
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,921
Huh? Yeah.

66
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:03,344
Like I said, I wasn't taking a detour,
and you wouldn't believe what I saw.

67
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,185
Thank you so much for coming.

68
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,480
I am Tawashi of
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

69
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,532
- Hey, get me a translation machine!
- Yes, right away!

70
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,994
No need. I can speak Japanese.

71
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:33,541
I see. Just what you'd expect from
Central Asia's greatest intellect, huh?

72
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,959
Yes, indeed!

73
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,755
Please have a seat.

74
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,925
I apologize for the drab surroundings,
Professor Abullah.

75
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,636
Not at all.
Everywhere in Japan is fantastic,

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,307
especially compared to the current state
of my home country, Persia.

77
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,354
Is this visit part
of the post-war reconstruction efforts?

78
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,980
That's right.

79
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,192
I'm here to attend
the World Science Conference in Tokyo.

80
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,029
By the way, Professor Abullah,

81
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,741
you also visited Japan
three months ago, correct?

82
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,201
I did.

83
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,705
And you met a legal scholar
named Junichiro Tazaki, didn't you?

84
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,419
I heard the shocking news.

85
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>Why did a great man like him
have to be killed?</i>

86
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,637
You were the last person
to see Mr. Tazaki alive.

87
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,059
Please rest assured.
You're not under suspicion.

88
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,772
The incident happened as your plane
was about to depart from the airport.

89
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,819
It's just that we wondered if you noticed
anything out of the ordinary.

90
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,699
He had so many wonderful things
to tell me.

91
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,662
Mr. Tazaki was the first to propose
the International Robot Laws.

92
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,124
It was his true and sincere wish

93
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,585
for robots and humans to coexist.

94
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:08,052
Robots actually feel a lot more
than humans assume, don't you think?

95
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,012
Yeah.

96
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,392
But we're just not good
at expressing ourselves.

97
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,688
They say they can't tell
humans from robots without a sensor gate,

98
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,939
but I can tell right away.

99
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,025
Humans have
complicated facial expressions.

100
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,403
Like this.

101
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,364
That man...

102
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,324
Which man?

103
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,119
The man we passed by at the gate.

104
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,704
I couldn't tell

105
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,582
<i>if he was human or robot.</i>

106
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,587
Thank you for your cooperation.

107
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,131
Not at all. I'm sorry I wasn't much help.

108
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,930
Hey! I told you to turn it off!

109
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,682
- I'm sorry!
- The professor--

110
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:59,145
I lost most of my organic body
in the last war.

111
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,607
I beg your pardon!

112
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,401
Oh, please don't worry.

113
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:13,034
By the way, I heard today
there was another tornado in Tokyo.

114
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,494
Yes.

115
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,455
Where did it happen?

116
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,876
Fear...

117
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,546
But the big cats are okay now, right?

118
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,429
The feeling I had today
came flying at superspeed.

119
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,140
Like, whoosh!

120
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,101
You mean apart from the big cats?

121
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,562
I'm not sure.

122
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,774
And you're still getting that feeling?

123
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,486
It's really faint.

124
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,196
From which way?

125
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,698
It's too faint to tell.

126
00:08:55,743 --> 00:09:00,081
You know, lions hide their fear
when they're really scared.

127
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,377
But right now,

128
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,255
the one who's most scared

129
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,215
is you, Atom!

130
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,265
You were looking at it again.

131
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,395
Don't blame yourself so much.

132
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,399
- Hey, Helena.
- Yes?

133
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,026
Let's take a trip.

134
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:11,986
A trip?

135
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,196
We discussed it the other day.

136
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,033
But can you take time off?

137
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,953
The higher-ups consider the robot attacks
to be concluded for now.

138
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,165
True. And a change of pace might be good.

139
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,708
It will be.

140
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,126
I'm sure of it.

141
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,337
How about Japan?

142
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,838
Japan?

143
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,884
I was just there for work,
and it was a lovely place.

144
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,677
I'll leave it to you.

145
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,975
<i>This is Marco Polo Tourist.</i>

146
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,519
Hello, I used your service before.

147
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,355
<i>Mr. Gesicht, yes?</i>

148
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,857
I'd like to make a reservation again.

149
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,983
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

150
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,736
My wife and I would like to go to Japan.

151
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,945
<i>Very well.</i>

152
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,659
I guess I'll have to register her
with you first.

153
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,953
<i>Actually, your wife is already registered.</i>

154
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,294
I don't believe she's left
the Euro Federation before.

155
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>Both of you have registered
with us before,</i>

156
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,758
<i>but you canceled your reservation.</i>

157
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,219
- We did?
<i>-</i> When?

158
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,182
<i>Two years ago. It was the same request
for a trip to Japan.</i>

159
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,519
Two years ago to Japan?

160
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,110
<i>Two years ago, we were in Spain</i>

161
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,071
for my training assignment with Europol.

162
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,322
That's right.

163
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,033
We lived in Madrid for the entire year.

164
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,244
See? We have tons of photos.

165
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,251
Ah, this is the Sagrada Família.

166
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,920
This is Andalusia.

167
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,676
You tripped and disappeared
into the field of sunflowers.

168
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,597
I remember!
You even used your GPS to find me.

169
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,062
We sure took a lot of pictures.

170
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,480
Yes.

171
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,907
Maybe too many?

172
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,912
Right. We do try to copy human behavior,
but we never take this many photos.

173
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,790
It was fun, wasn't it?

174
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,126
Yes. Very.

175
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,338
Apparently, we planned
a trip to Japan during that time.

176
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,398
<i>All done, Gesicht.</i>

177
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,984
<i>No abnormalities at all.</i>

178
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,903
Thank you, Professor Hoffman.

179
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,159
<i>Since you insisted on coming in,</i>

180
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>I don't doubt you're experiencing
some sort of malfunction.</i>

181
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,582
But according to the data,
everything looks just fine.

182
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,168
I still think it's due to fatigue.

183
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,299
And don't be too hard on yourself
about what happened to Brando.

184
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,806
Human memory is a convenient thing.

185
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,683
We have the function to forget.

186
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,814
Life can be tough if you hang on
to too many painful memories.

187
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,275
That's what forgetting is for.

188
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
But it doesn't work that way with robots.

189
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,616
Your memory will always remain fresh.

190
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,702
The only solution for robot memories

191
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,995
is to delete them.

192
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,665
Professor.

193
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,582
Yes?

194
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,169
Is there any record
of my memories being deleted?

195
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,175
No, I don't see any record of that.

196
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,054
How about traces
of nonfactual memories being inserted?

197
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,182
You mean like false memories?

198
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,517
Yes.

199
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,272
I heard things like that used to be done
at correctional facilities,

200
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,024
but now robots have rights too.

201
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,485
Why do you ask?

202
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,032
What if someone had deleted my memories
and replaced them with false memories?

203
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,328
What if that's the reason
for my nightmares?

204
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,501
That's an interesting theory.

205
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,596
I'm off to a meeting now.
Can we talk later?

206
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,557
I only need a minute, Director Schelling!

207
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,684
We'll talk later.

208
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,437
Did you do something
to Detective Gesicht's memory?

209
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,906
Director!

210
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,329
How many robots of Gesicht's caliber
are left in the world?

211
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,788
What?

212
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,417
How many robots have existed in the world

213
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,170
that could become
weapons of mass destruction?

214
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,131
There were seven altogether.

215
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,633
That's right.

216
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,218
And now, in this series of incidents,

217
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,097
three of them, Mont Blanc, North No.2,
and Brando, have been destroyed.

218
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,684
Now, there are only four left.

219
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,561
And one of them

220
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,022
is Gesicht.

221
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,567
But, Director,
that doesn’t answer my question!

222
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,570
Did you do something to him?
His artificial intelligence--

223
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,698
We made a huge investment
in Gesicht, you know!

224
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,621
All you need to do
is to maintain him properly.

225
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,624
That's all.

226
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,045
What did you do to Gesicht?

227
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,634
What exactly are you hiding?

228
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,934
These horns...

229
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,188
You think it's the same killer
from the other cases?

230
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,566
What do you make of this,
Detective Gesicht?

231
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,611
No, this is a copycat.

232
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,071
How do you know?

233
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,534
The perpetrator wore hybrid sneakers
to try and conceal their footprints,

234
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,870
but I see traces of movements everywhere.

235
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,416
Weight: 78 kilograms.

236
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
Height: 175 centimeters.

237
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,461
Most importantly, that drawer.

238
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,800
The culprit had difficulty with the knob,
so they removed their gloves for a moment.

239
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,428
You'll find fingerprints on it.

240
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,887
Forensics!

241
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,391
So this is a robbery
made to look like those incidents?

242
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,601
Yes, most likely.

243
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,980
Amazing as ever. You're perfect.

244
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,442
Perfect.

245
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,944
You're on vacation, right?

246
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,156
I'm sorry for summoning you.
You've been a great help.

247
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,119
- Detective Fersen.
- Yes?

248
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,081
This is the second time
we've met, correct?

249
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,045
Come on, I'm sure your robot memory
is more accurate than mine!

250
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,507
We met in Salzburg three years ago.
You did an excellent job on that case too.

251
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,468
Three years ago?

252
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:38,182
Yes, right after you came back
from The 39th Central Asian War.

253
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,435
I remember you telling me
all those stories from the war.

254
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:46,190
You had seven beers
at Karl's bar that night.

255
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,985
So you do remember!

256
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,653
And I'm still a beer drinker.

257
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,615
It was great to see you again, Detective.

258
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,575
Same here.

259
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,161
Let's go for drinks again another time.

260
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,793
<i>I remember perfectly
what happened three years ago.</i>

261
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:10,089
<i>It's been four years since the end
of The 39th Central Asian War.</i>

262
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,591
<i>Democracy is starting
to take root in Persia...</i>

263
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,011
<i>The 39th Central Asian War...</i>

264
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,645
<i>We're military police!</i>

265
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,649
<i>There are terrorists hiding in this area!</i>

266
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>All residents must evacuate immediately!</i>

267
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,863
<i>I repeat!</i>

268
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,615
<i>There are terrorists hiding...</i>

269
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,881
They're not here.

270
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,594
There aren't any terrorists here!

271
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,016
The only ones here were children!

272
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,437
You dropped a bomb on my sleeping child!

273
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,569
To hell with "saving the oppressed"!

274
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,572
Is killing children your idea of justice?

275
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,532
Have you no humanity?

276
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,493
You must know how I feel!

277
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,370
I am a robot.

278
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,792
Stop it!

279
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,891
He's...

280
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,559
He's in despair.

281
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,438
It may be an emotion beyond understanding
for a robot like you.

282
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,360
Despair...

283
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,034
<i>My memory from four years ago
is perfect too.</i>

284
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,425
I got killed!

285
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,554
- Aw, man!
- Oh no, I'm sorry.

286
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,641
- I just got this yesterday, Mom!
- Hans.

287
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,477
Why can't we get a maid robot?

288
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,145
My whole class has one, but--

289
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,480
Hans!

290
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,483
Your mother is doing the best she can.

291
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,443
Watch your words.

292
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,404
Besides, no gaming during meals.

293
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,156
Yes, sir.

294
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,872
What's your plan for today, dear?

295
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,918
Today's the anniversary
of your brother's death.

296
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,256
You're going to go claim his body,
aren't you?

297
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,511
Yes, today makes three years.

298
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:07,140
I still can't believe they wouldn't
let you have it for three whole years.

299
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,935
It's the law.

300
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,105
The authorities keep
the bodies of criminals for three years.

301
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,608
It can't be helped.
He was a rotten apple, after all.

302
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,030
But you know,

303
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,993
he was a good brother to me.

304
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,787
I want to give him a proper burial,

305
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,872
regardless of who he was.

306
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,213
<i>An explosion occurred
at a hotel in Berlin last night.</i>

307
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,217
<i>Judge Neuman from the German Ministry
of Justice has been confirmed dead.</i>

308
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,972
<i>Judge Neuman attracted attention
as the world's first robot judge</i>

309
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:52,227
<i>and was known for groundbreaking verdicts
on cases such as the Greifelt lawsuit.</i>

310
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:57,065
<i>The cause of the explosion is under
investigation, and according to forensi--</i>

311
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>Good morning, Adolf.</i>

312
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,990
I heard the news.

313
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>What news?</i>

314
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,414
A robot judge was killed... No, destroyed.

315
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,876
<i>Death to machines.</i>

316
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,838
Death to machines.

317
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,965
<i>Death to machines.</i>

318
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,301
Death to machines!

319
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,897
Corpse number 902886.

320
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,024
Right this way.

321
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,861
In accordance with the König Law,

322
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,821
we acknowledge the passage of three years

323
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,616
and hereby return the body
to the family of the deceased.

324
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,743
Will you accept it?

325
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,744
Yes.

326
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,330
Then please sign here.

327
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,294
I don't need to look
at my brother's body, do I?

328
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,756
Given the degree of his injuries,
I would not recommend it.

329
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,718
I was told he was shot to death
by a police officer.

330
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,679
And it was lawful and appropriate.

331
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,563
<i>Please state your destination.</i>

332
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,483
Hofgarten Cemetery.

333
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,651
<i>Confirmed.</i>

334
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,617
Scratch that. New destination.

335
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,536
To Dr. Schiller's.

336
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,621
<i>Confirmed.</i>

337
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,709
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, Doctor.

338
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,380
So, you want me
to view your brother's body?

339
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
Yes.

340
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,969
You have a problem
with the autopsy report?

341
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,595
No, not exactly.

342
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,223
Well, it's a chance to say goodbye.

343
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,891
Let's see.

344
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,769
This is...

345
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,854
Doctor?

346
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,494
What's the matter?

347
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,706
No, it's nothing.

348
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,680
We see more and more robots these days,
even in places like this.

349
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,189
They say robots can think like we do,

350
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,024
but who knows--

351
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,945
Don't say things like that too loud.

352
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,530
It'd be discrimination.

353
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,366
At least under
Universal Robot Rights Protection Laws.

354
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,788
I have one other thing
to take care of before I go home.

355
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,582
You go on ahead without me.

356
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,459
Okay. Be careful.

357
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,795
<i>Armed robbery in progress!
There are multiple suspects!</i>

358
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,923
<i>They're fleeing
in a military-armed vehicle!</i>

359
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,383
<i>The suspects broke through Ward N-6!</i>

360
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,594
This is Gesicht.
I'll try and head them off.

361
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,320
I have eyes on the suspects' vehicle.
Requesting permission to fire the SAAW!

362
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,530
<i>Permitted!</i>

363
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,660
Did you get them, Gesicht?

364
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,246
I only damaged the tires of the vehicle.

365
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,042
Hands in the air!

366
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,335
Freeze, or we'll shoot!

367
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,714
Splendid, Gesicht.

368
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,592
Is that a specialized anti-tank gun?

369
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,264
No, I had to use a special shell
to stop an armored vehicle like that.

370
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,975
What is it, then?

371
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,935
A special alloy.

372
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,895
Zeronium shells.

373
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,073
Brethren!

374
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:21,246
My wish is to eradicate every single robot
from the face of this planet.

375
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,750
Now is the time
to teach those abhorrent machines!

376
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,087
I will promise you all this.

377
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,673
Repeal the Universal Robot Rights
Protection Laws!

378
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,884
Repeal the Universal Robot Rights
Protection Laws!

379
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,095
Abolish police-bots!

380
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,306
Abolish police-bots!

381
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,766
Robots are servants!

382
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,227
Robots are servants!

383
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,271
Robots are slaves!

384
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,315
Robots are slaves!

385
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,233
Robots are inferior.

386
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,193
Robots are inferior!

387
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
Death to machines.

388
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:58,199
Death to machines!

389
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,786
Death to machines!

390
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,298
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

391
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:16,968
So...

392
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,348
What is this urgent matter you spoke of?

393
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,809
I claimed my brother's body today.

394
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,519
I see...

395
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,520
<i>That</i> brother.

396
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:32,442
He was the kind of person
who deserved to be killed.

397
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,319
- But...
- But?

398
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,987
He was pulverized.

399
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,198
"Pulverized"?

400
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,160
They used a weapon
that should never be used against humans.

401
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,997
I was told the only ones capable
of firing a weapon of that caliber

402
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,458
are robots and no others.

403
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,837
What? If that's true,
it would be a huge scandal.

404
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,216
Yes, Article 13
of the International Robot Laws says,

405
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,803
"A robot shall not be able
to hurt or kill humans."

406
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,475
There are only a few robots in the world
that can fire such an armament.

407
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
And that armament is?

408
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,980
It's a special Zeronium alloy shell.

409
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,024
I see.

410
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,443
I know the robot you speak of.

411
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,947
Detective Gesicht.

412
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,660
A robot in whose development Europol
made their largest-ever investment.

413
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,622
He has solved many difficult cases.

414
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,126
During The 39th Central Asian War,

415
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,837
he served as a member
of the peacekeeping forces.

416
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,259
If he murdered your brother,

417
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,428
it's repulsive to even imagine it.

418
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,514
My brother,

419
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,850
he was a lowlife.

420
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,519
But still,

421
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,398
he didn't deserve
to be pulverized by a robot!

422
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,944
I couldn't agree more, Adolf.

423
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,821
Lend me your strength!

424
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,116
The strength to destroy this robot!

425
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,833
It's been a while.

426
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,045
I haven't worn this battle suit
since the war.

427
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,674
You kept it maintained?

428
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,429
I did what I could.
I had to be discreet, you see?

429
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,681
But taking a battle suit
without permission...

430
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,642
I owe you. I know I've asked a lot of you.

431
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,687
Well, we go back a long way.

432
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,648
But what are you going to do?

433
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,901
If they find out,
they'll revoke your license!

434
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,153
I don't mind.

435
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,112
What?

436
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,948
I'm retiring.

437
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,705
Hercules.

438
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,291
There's nothing
like a military battle suit!

439
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,044
The horsepower is way different
than in my pankration suit.

440
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,253
Yeah.

441
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,883
The left arm output feels a bit weak.

442
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,803
Okay, I'll work on it.

443
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,308
Two suns?

444
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,769
Hercules!

445
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,527
A police robot used a Zeronium shell
just the other day.

446
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,405
Care to comment, Spokesperson Wagner
of the Europol Information Office?

447
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,575
Yes, it was against an armored vehicle.

448
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,703
But if it happens to hit a human,
they'll be pulverized.

449
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,332
Any use of it requires permission
from headquarters,

450
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,584
and we make sure
that human lives are protected.

451
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,753
But there can always be mistakes!

452
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,047
Well, we make sure
human lives are absolutely--

453
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,051
Exactly how many robots
are capable of firing Zeronium shells?

454
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,725
<i>It's like we humans walk the streets
under constant watch of an executioner.</i>

455
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,187
<i>The discussion is heating up,
but let's take a commercial break.</i>

456
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,397
What do you think?

457
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,400
It's a TV program we've set up.

458
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,361
Our media strategy
is steadily making progress.

459
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,572
But it will take time.

460
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,032
There's no need to rush

461
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,536
as long as
we can stigmatize Gesicht in the end.

462
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,289
I've looked into his schedule.

463
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,876
He's going on a long vacation
in a few days' time.

464
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,252
We have to act now!

465
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:24,716
Please. No matter where he runs,
we will never stop denouncing him.

466
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,967
But...

467
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,470
If we rush, your brother's background
will come out as well.

468
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,935
To be honest, even I feel nauseous
hearing about the things he did.

469
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,523
If those facts are publicly revealed,

470
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:44,110
then society will turn against us, and you
can forget the anti-robot campaign.

471
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,905
You understand, don't you?

472
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,285
Hold on. Where are you going?

473
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,798
Hercules!

474
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,261
Are you okay?

475
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,388
This energy reaction...

476
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,474
Is it Photon Energy?

477
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,479
Epsilon!

478
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,449
That was a rough way to say hello
for our first meeting.

479
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,785
I apologize.

480
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,163
But I felt I needed to stop you.

481
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,706
Stop me?

482
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,042
It's still alive, isn't it?

483
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:45,672
The enemy that destroyed
Mont Blanc, North No.2, and Brando.

484
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,674
Don't forget you're a target too.

485
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,634
I know.

486
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,511
Then why stop me?

487
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,554
We must not fight.

488
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,349
A pacifist, are you?

489
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,019
Is that why you refused
to be deployed to that war?

490
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,022
That war did not have a righteous cause.

491
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,732
"A righteous cause"?

492
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,236
Even though so many robots were destroyed?

493
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,990
You're just scared.

494
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,575
And you're justifying it with excuses.

495
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,203
Yes, I am scared.

496
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,208
I heard you were forced
to do post-war cleanup

497
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,460
under terrible conditions because of that.

498
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,922
I was abused and heckled
by the entire world,

499
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,466
unlike you heroes.

500
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,138
But thanks to that,
I gained something valuable.

501
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,389
Something valuable?

502
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,976
<i>I met many war orphans.</i>

503
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,688
<i>I took them in, and I'm raising them.</i>

504
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,026
Yeah, I heard.
A robot raising human children.

505
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,695
Yet another reason to criticize you.

506
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,658
This valuable thing you mentioned.
Could it be love?

507
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,331
I'm sure you gained something
from the war, didn't you?

508
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,545
The ability to hate, perhaps?

509
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,631
Here is what I think.

510
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,342
Humans and robots are growing closer.

511
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,887
And if we get too close,

512
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,222
something bad will happen.

513
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,018
Here is what I think.

514
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,437
This is the first sign.

515
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,898
A sign?

516
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,358
We must break...

517
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,863
this cycle of hate.

518
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,244
This isn't an item
you can just find anywhere, pal.

519
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:45,500
It was used in the Central Asian War,
but you can't make or sell them anymore.

520
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,962
It's a compact cluster cannon.
A guided rocket launcher.

521
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:54,717
It locks onto its target and never misses.

522
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,929
It'll explode inside the body.
Even a robot will be blown to bits.

523
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,015
Whoa there. Be careful with that thing.

524
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,268
Possession is enough for civilians
to be charged with attempted murder.

525
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,146
I won't kill.

526
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,065
Not humans, at least.

527
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,823
<i>When I was a child,</i>

528
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:21,869
<i>the use of robots
dramatically improved productivity.</i>

529
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,287
<i>At the same time,</i>

530
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,123
<i>because of the so-called
"robot restructure,"</i>

531
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,333
<i>many unemployed humans
ended up on the streets.</i>

532
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,128
<i>My father was one of the victims.</i>

533
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,297
Dad, I'm hungry!

534
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,677
Let's grab something to eat.

535
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,098
Man, just another sandwich.

536
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,809
I want to eat some steak.

537
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,270
Get real, you idiot!

538
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,565
You think Dad found a decent job?

539
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,860
He's looking because he hasn't found one.

540
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,028
It'll be all right.

541
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
Don't you worry.

542
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,283
Dad, when is Mom coming back?

543
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,245
It's all right.

544
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,496
Don't you worry.

545
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
I wish we had a ball.

546
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,134
Here you go. It's a ball.

547
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,180
Huh? Wow, it's brand-new!

548
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,514
Where did you get it?

549
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,475
Don't worry about it. Go play.

550
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,519
Thank you, Dad!

551
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,608
There!

552
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,693
There!

553
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,694
Hey!

554
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,366
He is the culprit.

555
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,578
He stole the ball from the store.

556
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,122
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

557
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,583
He is the culprit.

558
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,544
I'm sorry, okay? Please let me go!

559
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,005
Damn it!

560
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,049
Forgive me!

561
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,300
Ah, damn it!

562
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,511
<i>He came home a couple days later</i>

563
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,431
<i>and started to drink heavily.</i>

564
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,850
<i>Three months later,</i>

565
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,020
<i>he jumped from the roof of our building.</i>

566
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,943
What's wrong?

567
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,280
Adolf, you wanted this, right?

568
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,866
Here you go.

569
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,454
Hey, this is a portable prep school!

570
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,831
What happened to your arm?

571
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,669
I had to off them.

572
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,420
"Off them"?

573
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,130
A robot.

574
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,716
They can't kill us humans,

575
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,637
but we're allowed to kill them.

576
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,934
Study hard, Adolf.

577
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,896
Study hard
and create a world without robots.

578
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,040
Toward the suburbs?

579
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,543
Did he notice me tailing him?

580
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,893
Maybe this is my chance.

581
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,276
<i>What is he up to?</i>

582
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,572
This is it!

583
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,034
Damn it!

584
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,795
You're Epsilon, I presume?

585
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,215
I'm sorry to have asked you
to come on such short notice.

586
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:07,053
It's fine. It's not something to discuss
over a simple data transfer.

587
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,265
You are the only one
with the authority to arrest our enemy.

588
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,518
The enemy died fighting Brando.

589
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,813
That's the official line
from Europol as well.

590
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,399
Do you really believe that?

591
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,694
We must stop Hercules.

592
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,865
We must prevent a duel,
a worst-case scenario.

593
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,409
That goes for you too.

594
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,745
No need to tell me that.

595
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,121
I am a police officer.

596
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,749
We must act, or another war will start.

597
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,461
War must never occur again.

598
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,135
No one should experience what the children
in my care went through.

599
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,559
Have you heard of what they're calling
Persian War Syndrome?

600
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,144
Yes.

601
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,148
Deep psychological damage
from the experiences of the war.

602
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,152
Many of the children in my care
suffer from severe symptoms.

603
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,279
Especially one in particular.

604
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,575
His entire village
disappeared in an instant.

605
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,453
He was the sole survivor.

606
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,455
<i>Everything and everyone was simply gone.</i>

607
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,460
<i>An image is burned into his memory.</i>

608
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,549
<i>Something huge moving toward the desert.</i>

609
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,346
Even today, he only speaks one word.

610
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,270
It's the word uttered
by the thing he saw that day.

611
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,731
Bora.

612
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,415
Atom!

613
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,002
What's wrong?
We gotta hurry, or we'll be late.

614
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,422
Hey, Atom, did you feel anything?

615
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,465
Feel what?

616
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:13,512
Like a small animal quivering in fear
because it can't find its way home?

617
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,597
Again?

618
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,182
I'm going to go find it!

619
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,100
What about school?

620
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,643
Think of an excuse for me!

621
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,314
She's nothing but trouble.

622
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,235
REDEVELOPMENT ZONE
NO TRESPASSING

623
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,198
Is it this way?

624
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,701
What on earth is this?

625
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,078
Such a terrible painting.

626
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,508
Hey.

627
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,009
Are you dead?

628
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,430
Were you the one crying?

629
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,392
You're a robot, aren't you?

630
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,728
I gotta report this!

631
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,146
Wait.

632
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,442
You'll be okay!

633
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,152
I'm gonna go get help.

634
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,197
Professor Ochanomizu can fix anything!

635
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,241
There's no need.

636
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:19,036
Yes, there is!
If we don't do something, you'll die!

637
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,247
Just leave me alone.

638
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,623
I can't!

639
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,334
You mustn't call any humans.

640
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,087
Then tell me what you need.

641
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,297
What kind of energy do you use?

642
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,301
SOL 208355.

643
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,346
I've never heard of that one.

644
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,307
ER 1059.

645
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,184
Not genuine though.

646
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,563
But it'll work as a substitute, eh?
Got it! I'll go get some!

647
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,231
Stay where you are, okay?

648
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,495
Are you okay?
It didn't agree with your body?

649
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,917
Thank you.

650
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,502
I feel better now.

651
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,212
That's good.

652
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,214
Mister, what's your name?

653
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,758
I don't know.

654
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,677
Where did you come from?

655
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,762
I don't remember anything.

656
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,181
All I remember is

657
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,893
running here as hard as I could, naked...

658
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,437
Running from something.

659
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,939
"Running from something"?

660
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,361
I don't know what, but it was very scary.

661
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,450
And there was a shack over there.

662
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,036
Must be a work shed
for the redevelopment project.

663
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,204
I stole these clothes from there.

664
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,332
That's why they don't fit you.

665
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,292
You're right.

666
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,129
You finally smiled! I'm Uran!

667
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,922
Uran.

668
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,052
Mister, did you paint that?

669
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,971
Yes, there was paint in the shed.

670
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,557
Are you an artist?

671
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,476
I don't know.

672
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,811
But I had the urge to make this.

673
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,480
I know!

674
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,274
This is called abstract painting.

675
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,485
Abstract painting.

676
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:19,073
Robots are capable of drawing
exactly what they see, right?

677
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,035
So it's rare to see a robot
paint a picture like this!

678
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,665
Or maybe you're just bad
at rough sketches.

679
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,125
Maybe.

680
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,754
I don't even know
what I was trying to depict.

681
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,132
Or why I was doing it.

682
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,263
I just don't know.

683
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,479
Mister!

684
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,029
Mister!

685
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,990
Hello, Uran.

686
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,367
What are you doing?

687
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,828
Looking at these flowers.

688
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,788
Flowers?

689
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,501
Yesterday, there was only grass.

690
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,795
Oh, that reminds me. I got you more!

691
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,797
More energy catalyst!

692
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,215
And more paints!

693
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,299
Paints?

694
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,011
You need more colors, don't you?

695
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,277
Mister! I got you bigger clothes!

696
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,532
I've finished my painting.

697
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,118
Is this...

698
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,495
I finally figured out what it was.

699
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,789
A field of flowers?

700
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,171
Your rough sketch wasn't bad at all.

701
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,922
Actually,

702
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,675
it brings tears to my eyes.

703
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,849
Thank you.

704
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,649
Uran!

705
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,653
Good morning, Atom.

706
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,615
Don't you think it's too early
for a "good morning"?

707
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,910
- You think so?
- You're going again, aren't you?

708
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,997
I found a cat, and it's so cute.

709
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,082
An empty bottle of energy catalyst.

710
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,418
Is this what the cat is drinking?

711
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,546
I found it in your book bag.

712
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,802
You searched my book bag without asking?

713
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:49,097
Who went to bed right after asking me
for help with their homework?

714
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,642
It's a robot cat.

715
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,977
Then report it to the Ministry of Science.

716
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,062
No!

717
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,024
If it's broken, we should ask
Professor Ochanomizu to fix it.

718
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,776
What's the model number?

719
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,904
I don't know the model number.

720
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,991
It's not made in Japan?
Which country was it made in?

721
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,453
Anyhow, it's still scared!

722
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,624
It's finally starting to warm up to me.
I don't want it to run away again!

723
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,379
I'll introduce you to him
when I feel he's ready.

724
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,257
Please don't say anything
until then, okay?

725
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,178
Thank you! I'm off!

726
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,102
You'll never be popular with girls
if you keep peeking in ladies' bags!

727
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,524
Mister!

728
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
Where are you, Mister?

729
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,990
Oh no, did he really run away again?

730
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,327
Mister!

731
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,121
Mist-- Oh.

732
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:01,712
My goodness! The clothes I gave you
are so dirty already!

733
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,798
Hey, are you listening to me?

734
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,761
I've finally figured out
what I was born to do.

735
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,971
Huh?

736
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,140
Here, look.

737
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,105
Where did these flowers come from?

738
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,566
Watch this.

739
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,877
Wow, you made a dying flower bloom!

740
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,921
What is this power?

741
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:49,217
This is my... true power.

742
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,476
So that's why you painted this picture.

743
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,144
I'm not sure.

744
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:04,107
But there was a trace of this image
in my memory.

745
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:08,070
That's amazing!
You can breathe life into things!

746
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,282
Life. Do you think we will die eventually?

747
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:13,909
Die?

748
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,205
When you saved me, you said so.

749
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,832
That if we didn't do something,
I would die.

750
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,379
That would mean
your computerized brain being broken.

751
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,590
Professor Ochanomizu said
depending on how broken it is,

752
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,217
it may be impossible to restore.

753
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,303
Even if it's fixed,
you'd be a different robot.

754
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,430
Is that what dying is?

755
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,395
What does dying really mean?

756
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,523
This flower field represents life.

757
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,317
But there is another image.

758
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,569
A world of death.

759
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,030
"A world of death"?

760
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,700
Devoid of life.

761
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,416
What is this?

762
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,756
What is this giant monstrosity?

763
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,467
What is it?

764
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,678
I'm scared!

765
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,514
Mister! Mister, calm down!

766
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,063
You're okay.

767
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,107
I'm right here.

768
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,026
No need to be afraid.

769
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,943
It's okay.

770
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:31,987
Bora.

771
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,946
Huh?

772
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,907
Bora.

773
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,451
Bora?

774
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,754
I've just arrived at Central Park,
Professor Abullah.

775
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,715
That was quicker than I thought.

776
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,342
You passed through customs
with no problem?

777
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,719
<i>No problem.</i>

778
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,931
I'm at the site
where the most recent tornado happened.

779
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,143
I know it's a lot to ask
since the park is so big.

780
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:08,106
It's no problem, sir,
because you gave me this body.

781
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:26,833
When you retrieve it,
be careful not to damage it.

782
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:31,046
He is another body I created, after all.

783
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,258
<i>I'll repeat the model number
you are to retrieve.</i>

784
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:40,138
<i>SOL 2083553.</i>

785
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,642
His name is Pluto.

786
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,404
I've located him, Professor Abullah.

787
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,031
Good.

788
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,992
I'm on my way.

789
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,619
Pluto.

790
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,293
I know you can do it, Mister!

791
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,004
Make the whole world like this painting!

792
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,465
"Like this painting."

793
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,969
Yes! You can fill the world with flowers!

794
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,429
That's why you were born.

795
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,307
"That's why I was born."

796
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,102
Exactly! You've got to remember.

797
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,313
You have the power
to turn the entire world into a garden!

798
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,318
That's not true.

799
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,070
Not true?

800
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,365
Not a garden.

801
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,825
Huh?

802
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,078
That's not it.

803
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,708
It's something much...

804
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,085
Yes?

805
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,840
Much bigger. Real nature...

806
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,849
A tornado.

807
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,409
It's raining.

808
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,955
Hey, look!

809
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,792
Flowers are blooming one after the other!

810
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,755
This is amazing!
Plants are growing so fast!

811
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,799
It's so beautiful!

812
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,677
Beautiful.

813
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,564
Uran!

814
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,983
Get away from him right now, Uran!

815
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,113
There's a strange
electromagnetic field around him!

816
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,115
Atom...

817
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,868
Uran, you have to come over here now!

818
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,579
You too, Professor Ochanomizu?

819
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,958
I've asked the staff
from the Ministry of Science to come!

820
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,463
I can't believe you, Atom!
You promised you wouldn't tell!

821
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,258
Now is not the time for that!

822
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,385
There's something dangerous
about that robot!

823
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,721
Squad A, in position!

824
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,766
- Squad B, in position!
- What?

825
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,476
The police too?

826
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,688
- Professor?
- Who told you to call the police?

827
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,275
I reported it per regulations.

828
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,863
Inspector Nakamura of the police!
Are you all right?

829
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,282
How could you?

830
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,326
How could you do this, Atom?

831
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,787
Atom.

832
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,998
You've got to get over here now, Uran!

833
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,959
Atom.

834
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,304
Atom.

835
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,350
Hatred.

836
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,522
System... overload...

837
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,358
Stop! Stop, or we'll shoot!

838
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,609
Mister...

839
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,616
I'm going to explode!

840
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,039
The surge

841
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,207
of rage...

842
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,418
Fire!

843
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,461
Wait!

844
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,174
So many robots...

845
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,925
Death...

846
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,390
They deserve to die.

847
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,851
How many did I...

848
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,855
kill?

849
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,234
Flowers in the desert...

850
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,323
A world of death.

851
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,580
Horns!

852
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,670
Mister!

853
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,389
I don't believe this!

854
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,891
What's the matter, Professor?

855
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,352
This can't be.

856
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,814
His computerized brain is missing!

857
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,370
What was that?

858
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,330
Oh, there it is!

859
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,584
That's my body!

860
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,003
What?

861
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:10,510
I'm a construction robot
working at this redevelopment site.

862
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:11,970
Huh?

863
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,515
I finished my 100-hour shift,
and when I was ready to go home,

864
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,476
I saw that my off-duty body was missing.

865
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,355
So, this is your body?

866
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,651
I've been looking for it.
I'm so glad I found it!

867
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,572
What on earth is going on?

868
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,367
A robot
without its artificial intelligence...

869
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,746
somehow activated on its own?

870
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,804
It's right over here.

871
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,017
Calling it "wandering anima"
makes it sound dignified,

872
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,103
but it is only a robot
without a computerized brain,

873
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,772
remotely controlled
through electromagnetic waves.

874
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,735
Are you satisfied now?
The time for your little stroll is over.

875
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,363
Come back.

876
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,163
This is your only body, Pluto.

877
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,928
And don't forget your orders

878
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,846
<i>to kill Atom.</i>

879
