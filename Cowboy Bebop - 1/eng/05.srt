1
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,420
Confirmed.

2
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,270
To our new relationship,
and our new friendship.

3
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,070
And, to prosperity.

4
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,270
The view from here makes me
sad that I must leave so soon.

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,940
It's an amazing sight.

6
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,150
Next time, we should
have dinner together.

7
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,090
The Cantonese cuisine that
our head chef makes...

8
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,150
...is just about as superb
as this scenery.

9
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,990
That's a wonderful
invitation, however...

10
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,790
To think that the day that I'd dine
with an executive from the Red Dragon...

11
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,030
Rest assured,
the food will not be poisoned.

12
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,450
I can finally take a breather.

13
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,880
Thank God.

14
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,930
Doing things like this
won't do you any good!

15
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,010
Times have changed!

16
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,340
The syndicate cannot survive
just by fighting alone!

17
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,350
O-Only if...

18
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,710
...S-Spike returned...

19
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,920
...someone like you would...

20
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,570
BALLAD OF FALLEN ANGELS

21
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,890
I don't feel up for this.

22
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,560
Wha?

23
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,510
I said, I don't feel like doing this.

24
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,070
Then there's no choice.

25
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,870
Wait, Spike.

26
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,850
I can't burden you.

27
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,940
Don't say stuff like that.

28
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,080
You know who that is, don't you?

29
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,380
Superficial stuff, yeah.

30
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,440
Then...

31
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,520
Good money.
Easy to get info on him.

32
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,350
We also have a lead.

33
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,720
What makes you scared?

34
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,130
Spike, you're deliberately
avoiding the subject.

35
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,100
Are you hiding something from me?

36
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,200
So... what happened
to that arm of yours?

37
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,010
What does that have
to do with anything?

38
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,170
Nothing.

39
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,700
So, you have no intention of telling me?

40
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,340
I could ask you the same.

41
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,750
Why is this door so damn narrow?

42
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,350
Oh? Am I interrupting something?

43
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,760
None of your business.

44
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,120
We're supposed to be comrades!
That's awfully cold of you!

45
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,820
What do you mean, comrades?

46
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,800
Troublemakers should keep
themselves outta this.

47
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,160
Well, I don't care.

48
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,300
So, who is this? What's he up to?

49
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,770
Don't look without asking us.

50
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,010
What do you mean?
He's just there on the screen!

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,370
Spike!

52
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,280
Hey, wait, Spike!

53
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,580
I'm taking off.

54
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,650
<i>Spike!</i>

55
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,930
<i>Shit, I won't be responsible for you!</i>

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,550
Roger that.

57
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,200
Dammit! He's such a...

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,670
Mao Yenrai.

59
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,080
A bounty of 28 million
for the alleged murder...

60
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,380
...of an executive from
an opposing syndicate.

61
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,950
Amazing! And you guys are after him?

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,180
What, did you have a fight?

63
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,450
Shut up. You're being obnoxious.

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,160
- You're such a kid.
- I said, you're being obnoxious!

65
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,600
He can do whatever the hell he pleases.

66
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,900
Oh, God...
He's throwing such a huge fit.

67
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,370
<i>You there, Jet?</i>
<i>I got something big for ya!</i>

68
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,300
Something big?

69
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,550
Excuse me, madam,
but I need to see your ticket.

70
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,930
Oh, I don't have anything like that.

71
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,370
Well, then, I am afraid that
you cannot enter the hall...

72
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,930
But, they told me I didn't need one.

73
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,640
You know. The guy in the box seat...

74
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,010
HIM.

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,870
Mao Yenr...

76
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,120
Can you park my vehicle for me?

77
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,980
If it's not one, it's the other...

78
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,280
Why do they all do
everything as they please?!

79
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,750
There's a protective
encryption on this thing.

80
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,600
You worried?

81
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,930
Just watch.
These are decrypted like this...

82
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,900
See? And then, I input "Mao Yenrai"...

83
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,510
The bounty part sure
seems to be true, but...

84
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,950
Is this Sir Mao's seat?

85
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,520
I looked all over for it.
Actually, I...

86
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,490
We were waiting for you.

87
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,270
U-Um...

88
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,440
They are performing,
so please stay quiet.

89
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,880
Hold it right there!

90
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,530
I'm not letting you get away!

91
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,600
Whatcha doin'?!

92
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,240
Give it back!

93
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,800
Shit. Give it back, you dumbass!

94
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,980
Really, kids these days!

95
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,110
I'll hand you over to the cops!

96
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,780
Y-You!

97
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,120
Yo.

98
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,990
Hey, isn't it bad for you to
drink it in one shot, Annie?

99
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,730
You coming back to life
is worse on me than this glass.

100
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,300
What terrible treatment!

101
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,570
The words of the dead are meaningless.

102
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,370
But I'm alive.

103
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,810
No, you died three years ago!
That's how things work here.

104
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,520
I know.

105
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,290
The fact that you came here... means you
have something you want to know, right?

106
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,390
If it's not much, I can be of help.

107
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,360
Anastasia...

108
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,640
Stop it! There are only two people
that can call me by that name...

109
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,900
So, what do you want to know?

110
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,610
Mao Yenrai.

111
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,580
What happened to him?

112
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,430
Mao-taijin?
There's a reason for this...

113
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,030
No need to talk, Miss Valentine.

114
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,870
We have done a background
check already.

115
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,930
Rest assured, it will be
held in a safe location.

116
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,540
Please, to your seat.

117
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,760
You're trembling...

118
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,730
Who... are you?

119
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,600
Vicious.

120
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,030
You know...

121
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,930
I won't say anything bad to ya.

122
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,740
Don't get yourself involved
with Vicious anymore.

123
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,170
But I know saying that is useless.

124
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,180
Sorry.

125
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,650
You've never listened
to what others say.

126
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,150
On top of it,
you're a stubborn showoff!

127
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,320
It can't hurt you to listen to
your elders once in a while...

128
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,120
About Mao...

129
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,930
He had a lot of people looking
for you after you were gone.

130
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,490
He said that you still
had to be alive...

131
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,840
You're finally back, but Mao is...

132
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,100
Stop it already.

133
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,340
This is for Mao!

134
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,220
I'll take that one for Mao.

135
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,910
What are you up to now...
to need something like THAT?

136
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,200
Where's the broad?

137
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,650
She lost sanity looking at
the bounty figure and took off.

138
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,980
Right now she's probably
somewhere, screwing up.

139
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,950
I see.

140
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,050
I'll tell you something.
You won't get the bounty for Mao.

141
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,010
He's already dead.
He was killed.

142
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,390
Internal discord.
Do you understand?

143
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,490
This is a trap! I'm sure of it!

144
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,600
Yeah. I know all that.

145
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,860
You know?!

146
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,440
Then what, you're Mao's?

147
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,510
I owe him one from before...

148
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,370
I'll tell you something, Spike.

149
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,850
This arm. It's the price I paid
for being over-spirited...

150
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,850
...and running ahead of the game.
You understand?

151
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,720
I don't wanna go, either.

152
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,690
Then...

153
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,860
Let's just say,
duties of the life I live.

154
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,160
<i>Tee hee. I've been caught.</i>

155
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
You...

156
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,040
<i>Come to the place we specify,</i>

157
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,970
<i>Otherwise, my life is over.</i>
<i>So they say,</i>

158
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,710
<i>Lesse... the time to meet is...</i>

159
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,580
It's because you did as you please.

160
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,450
<i>You're being cold.</i>
<i>We're comrades, remember?</i>

161
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,280
You reap what you sow.
Take care of it all yourself.

162
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,220
<i>Hey, wait!</i>

163
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,620
Where is it?

164
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,050
<i>You're really gonna come?</i>

165
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,130
Don't worry.
I'm not going there to save you.

166
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,220
Spike!

167
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,310
Angels that are forced from
heaven have to become demons.

168
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,640
Isn't that right, Spike?

169
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm only watching a dream
that I never awakened from.

170
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,820
I'll wake you up right now.

171
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,800
Don't be so anxious, Vicious.

172
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,960
It's our first meeting
in a while, right?

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,520
A plea for your life?

174
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,370
Hardly.

175
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,310
Something like that doesn't
work on you, remember?

176
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,300
After all, you even kill
those who've saved your life.

177
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,810
He was a beast who lost his fangs.
That's why he's dead.

178
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,310
The same goes for you.

179
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,360
Now, we want you to drop your gun.

180
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,330
What's wrong? If you don't hurry...

181
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,050
Are ya tryin' to kill me?

182
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,990
Oh man, what the hell've I done...

183
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,620
Yeah?

184
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,630
<i>Thank God! Jet? Spike is...</i>

185
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,460
Not my problem!

186
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,730
God dammit!

187
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,300
Spike.

188
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,460
Do you know what your face
looks like right now?

189
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,430
What?

190
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,510
The same blood runs in you and me.

191
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,610
The blood of a beast who wanders,
desiring the blood of others.

192
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,450
I've bled all of that blood away.

193
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,950
Then why are you still alive?!

194
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,430
Just like that...

195
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,430
...sing for me.

196
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,350
Oh, you're finally up.

197
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,290
You've slept too much.
It's been three days.

198
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,830
What? I was worried about you.
You have to be thankful to me!

199
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,580
Tone-deaf.

200
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,890
Oh, well...

201
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,730
COMING EPISODE

202
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,870
But you know what? What a tough
world we live in nowadays...

203
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,000
What are you talking about?

204
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,770
This guy, that guy... They're all trying
to put a lid on something that stinks.

205
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,400
Yeah.

206
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,470
Can we let things go on like that?

207
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm asking you,
what ARE you talking about?

208
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,110
World affairs, man! World affairs!

209
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,340
With all these lids about,
the world'll be buried in lids!

210
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,580
I don't really get it...

211
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,780
With stuff like that,
you can't see the truth!

212
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,350
Truth, huh?

213
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,450
So lids like that...
I'll crush them all away!

214
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,960
Next Episode: "Sympathy for the Devil".

215
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,720
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

216
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,750
That sounds... smelly.
