1
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,350
This was the most
special of the special.

2
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,420
It was an emergency ration
for true emergencies...

3
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,050
...that was saved for the
last of the last resorts.

4
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,010
All I'm asking is who ate this.

5
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,120
Grudges over food sure are scary.

6
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,930
Spike, by perchance, was it you?

7
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,560
If I was the culprit, I wouldn't leave
the empty box lying around like that.

8
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,500
Ed is hungry.

9
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,600
Maybe you ate it yourself,
but are pretending...

10
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,800
...to be upset because
we found the empty box?

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,210
What?!

12
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,180
We haven't had anything to
eat for two whole days!!

13
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,380
Don't you call a situation
like this an emergency?!

14
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,550
I wanna eat stuff like
fried beefun noodles...

15
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,720
We're outta gas!
We can't do anything about it!

16
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,620
If you could hold out
like this a bit longer...

17
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,060
...we'll reach Europa soon
thanks to inertia.

18
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,790
Tummy's caving in!

19
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,790
If only we could use that
energy to propel ourselves...

20
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,600
You keep mouthing off like that and
I'll toss you out into absolute zero.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,570
And a stir-fry of liver and
chives would be good, too...

22
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,940
Sounds good.

23
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,430
At least it's better than aimlessly
floating around this place.

24
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,070
That was some collision...

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
Hey! Can you hear me? Answer me! Hey!!

26
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,340
Isn't this...

27
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,780
...a hit-and-run?!

28
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,020
This is bad! The shock from that
collision changed our trajectory!

29
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,290
What did what to who?

30
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,560
What's going on?!

31
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,110
MUSHROOM SAMBA

32
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,860
Huh?

33
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,240
Wow... Where is this place?

34
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,640
This is so uncivilized!

35
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,830
I don't think that's our problem...

36
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,310
We have to start by checking the ship.

37
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,180
Can you go get some food?

38
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,810
What?

39
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,780
I suddenly feel... a stabbing pain...

40
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,510
What are you trying to pull?

41
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,690
This expired a year ago...

42
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,930
I'm glad I didn't eat it.

43
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,530
Serves you right.
This is divine retribution!

44
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,640
Let's get to it...

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,180
Whatcha gonna do?

46
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,090
Ed will help, too!

47
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,090
We're fine here, so go outside
and find us some food.

48
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,890
Okay!

49
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,930
Gotta wear my socks...

50
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,770
...to go out, to go out...

51
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,630
Nothing here...

52
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,510
It's that hit-and-run ship!

53
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,250
Wait, wait!

54
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,250
Wait, wait!!

55
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,210
Wait, wait!!!

56
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,320
Smell...

57
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,660
Smell... food...

58
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,810
FOOD!

59
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,640
Gimme!

60
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,780
1,000 woolongs each, including tax.

61
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,950
Cash only. No money cards
or cash cards allowed.

62
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,680
I don't have money.

63
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Then hurry home, kid.

64
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,800
Can I have one?

65
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,710
1,000 woolongs each.
Cash only. Cards are...

66
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,970
Kid, no use staring.

67
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,380
If you want food,
go someplace like the town.

68
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,610
I don't need change.

69
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,910
In exchange...

70
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,050
If you see this man, gimme a call.

71
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,060
Thanks!

72
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,830
Excuse us.

73
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,210
We would like to check your baggage.

74
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,540
Something wrong?

75
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,600
Apparently, a broker on
the wanted list for...

76
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,940
...illegal mushroom sales
made a getaway to this town.

77
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,240
What a coincidence.

78
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm after that bounty as well.

79
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,040
A cowboy?

80
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,610
We're gonna check out your trunk.

81
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,350
Go ahead, feel free.

82
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,460
Hey!

83
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,650
All right! FREEZE!

84
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,790
- Now, wait a minute...
- All right, stay still...

85
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,090
- I don't know anything about this!
- Turn around! Hands on the ground!

86
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,120
- What are you doing?!
- Now put your hands on the ground!

87
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,690
- Let go of me!!
- HURRY UP!

88
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,760
Food, food, do you have any?

89
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,800
Oh, you don't? Oh, you do?

90
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,670
Boy, am I hungry...

91
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,920
Meanie!

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,190
What?

93
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,220
Gimme!

94
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,290
Gimme something!

95
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,530
Dammit, stop hanging all over me!

96
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,930
HEY!

97
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,440
I won't let you tell me you
forgot who I am, Domino!

98
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,700
Let's see...

99
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,370
Come on! Remember, dammit!

100
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,610
I'm the younger of the Shaft brothers
that bought mushrooms from you!

101
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,170
I really can't recall...

102
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,880
You do want to know why I drag an
empty coffin around like this, don't you?

103
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,820
It's because...

104
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,620
...I'm going to go home after
putting your corpse inside...

105
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,230
Pieces... All in pieces!

106
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,600
What was what to who?

107
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,230
My big bro ate a mushroom
he bought from you...

108
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,400
...and laughed and laughed,
and twisted his intestines to death!

109
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,910
A happy way to die.

110
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,270
Shut up!

111
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,440
Speaking of which,
it's all your fault!

112
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,500
That's what I call
an unjust resentment!

113
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,380
Ed is hungry, too!

114
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,270
Take THIS!

115
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,120
Wait, you bastard! Dammit!

116
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,390
Food!

117
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,190
Aah! Don't, Ein! We have to share!

118
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,170
Ein?

119
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,970
Bad mushroom?

120
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,470
This for real?

121
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,710
Delicious!

122
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,080
This really can't be happening.

123
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,420
Really...

124
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,830
This really has no way of happening.

125
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,060
Hey... You know, the world
really is a great place...

126
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,700
Did I just say something?

127
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,850
Hey, mister.

128
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,810
This is a stairway to heaven.
You know that, right?

129
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,050
An obnoxious little frog...

130
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,720
I don't care anymore.
I warned you!

131
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,780
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

132
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,760
I now know the secrets of the universe.

133
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,730
By the way...

134
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,570
...who was I?

135
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,010
So these mushrooms are
inedible after all...

136
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,110
<i>So, as you can tell, it's time</i>
<i>for another episode of BIG SHOT!</i>

137
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,980
<i>We'll introduce you to more</i>
<i>and more bounties this week!</i>

138
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,680
<i>So, batting first for us today...</i>

139
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,520
<i>... is this man, Domino Walker.</i>

140
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,360
<i>He's currently wanted for</i>
<i>selling illegal mushrooms.</i>

141
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,760
- That's the guy we just saw!
- <i>The bounty is a conservative 1.2 mil.</i>

142
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,890
That's cowgirl, Ein.

143
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,490
We earn money, and buy food!

144
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,510
Ein, you're a cow-woofwoof!

145
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,670
Here we go!

146
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,440
One!

147
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,180
Two!

148
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,910
Five!

149
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,780
Four!

150
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,080
Hello!

151
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,820
Hey, don't underestimate the police!

152
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,860
I really don't know anything!

153
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,430
Then why did you have a strange kid
and a dog in the trunk of your car?!

154
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,630
Hello... Yes?

155
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,040
Oh, it's you, Sally.
Really... You're so hopeless...

156
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,770
I told you so many times
not to call me at work...

157
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,680
And? Yeah yeah, and that's it?

158
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,380
I mean, I didn't mean it THAT
way when I said "that's it?"...

159
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,720
Yeah, yeah, like that.
I love you, Sally.

160
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,020
Got it. Tonight at 7 it is. Bye-bye!

161
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,960
HEY!

162
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,540
What's wrong, young'un?
Lookin' like that...

163
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,010
Did your woman run off without you?

164
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,100
What to say...

165
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,770
None of your business, old geezers.

166
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,320
Oh, man... that's for
eating all at once.

167
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,950
They say when you're in
a hurry, go around.

168
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,190
Is that right?

169
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,690
He's not here...

170
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,140
Aah! That hit-and-run ship!

171
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,390
I'm sure they never even dreamed
that I was raising these in here.

172
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,690
This one's bad.

173
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,960
Well, making an emergency landing here
was the only miscalculation I had.

174
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,260
Were you surprised?

175
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,820
I was.

176
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,130
What the hell are you guys?

177
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,360
Why are you here?

178
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,340
That's my line!

179
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,770
How did you get in here
in the first place?

180
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,100
- The door was open.
- Is that so?!

181
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,070
Culprit of the hit-and-run,
prepare to get arrested!

182
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,340
Stink bug gas!

183
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,510
Wait, wait, wait!

184
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,330
Don't think that you
can get away from me!

185
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,980
Don't get in my way!

186
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,000
Ein! Growl!

187
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,790
C-Come on! Let go of me!

188
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,040
BOO!

189
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,030
Gotcha!

190
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,320
W-Wait...

191
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,020
T-These mushrooms are
worth 100,000 each.

192
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,660
Let me go, and I'll give them to you.

193
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,500
Why?

194
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,760
Think about which one is worth more.

195
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,900
I dunno.

196
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,500
A-Are you an idiot?!

197
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,900
Take the mushrooms!

198
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,140
Okay!

199
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,870
<i>"Thanks"</i>

200
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,690
<i>"Oh, it's no problem"</i>

201
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,800
Yahoo! Dinner! Mushroom!

202
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,780
100,000 each? Really?

203
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,370
That sure would make some money.

204
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,880
These are real?

205
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,900
Excuse me.

206
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,750
I'm with the police.

207
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,380
I want to ask a few questions about
Domino, an illegal mushroom dealer.

208
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,090
Unfortunately, we have no clue.

209
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm so sorry we can't be of any help.

210
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,300
Ed knows who that... MMF!

211
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,860
Don't mind her...

212
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,060
In exchange, I got... MMGH!

213
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,510
- Really...
- She's a troublesome kid...

214
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,970
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,290
They're okay.

216
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,890
He must really like shiitake mushrooms.

217
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,000
Well, sorry to bother you.

218
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,770
Here's dinner.

219
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,280
What's the menu?

220
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,050
Shiitake stir-fry, shiitake stew,
shiitake salad, and a shiitake dessert.

221
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,050
Yaaaaaay!

222
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,210
Again? How many days has it been?

223
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,220
No... I can't eat anymore.

224
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,750
Quit complaining, and be
thankful that we can even eat!

225
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,990
Thankful!

226
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,460
COMING EPISODE

227
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,230
A videotape that was delivered to
the Bebop with no return address.

228
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,570
Because we wanted to view the tape,
things took a turn for the unexpected.

229
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,740
No, actually it doesn't go anywhere.

230
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,750
At first glance,
the story is pointless...

231
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,250
...the actions are on a small scale...

232
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,410
...and the ending is forced...

233
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,150
...but what will you get out of it all?

234
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,880
Next episode: Speak like a Child.

235
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,290
At first glance, it's interesting.

236
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,580
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD
