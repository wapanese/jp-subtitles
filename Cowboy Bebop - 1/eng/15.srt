1
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,090
Frozen, frozen, hard.

2
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,000
No good after all...

3
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,990
It's full of dioxins.

4
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,440
I had saved this as
evidence a while back...

5
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,180
Don't eat it,
you malnutritioned kid!!

6
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,250
Then you want to catch a fraud?
A matrimonial fraud?

7
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,780
Guess I have no choice.

8
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,880
What kinda fraud? Is it big?

9
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,550
Smallest of the small fry.

10
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,530
I don't think Spike
will be up for this...

11
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,720
Ed wants chicken kabobs!

12
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,690
Guess I'll do it alone.

13
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,700
You have GOT to be kidding!

14
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,910
Give me a break...

15
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,820
This stinks!

16
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,420
Really...

17
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,690
Weren't you taught that you
should wipe your own butt?

18
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,100
I've been thinking of who
you remind me of...

19
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,570
I know now.
That guy with the thin eyebrows...

20
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,270
Whitney Hagas Matsumoto.

21
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,380
I wonder why I suddenly
was reminded of him...

22
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,050
Do you want to know something about
my past that nobody else knows?

23
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,630
MY FUNNY VALENTINE

24
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
Miss Manley, does she look
resuscitated to you?

25
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,670
Yes, she does, Doctor.

26
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,180
Miss Manley, does she look
like an old woman to you?

27
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,950
No, she doesn't, Doctor.

28
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,960
Do you think she has been
successfully defrosted?

29
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,790
I believe so, Doctor.

30
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,220
Can you hear me?

31
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,990
I am Doctor Baccus.

32
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,560
Baccus, as in the Baccus that
drowned more humans than Neptune.

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Do you know about him?

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,740
But I used to be an alcoholic.
Baccus was drowning thanks to Baccus.

35
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,010
Hey, that was great!

36
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,510
All right, open wide...

37
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,920
No problems. You have no wounds left,
and the cells are dividing nicely.

38
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,160
Now... you only have
one problem to solve.

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,890
Oh, it's just a simple process.

40
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,800
The 30 million for the basic operation,
and 54 years' worth of interest.

41
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,390
Hey, how much is that?

42
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,370
273 million... add to that the hospital
fees for a total of 300,028,000 woolongs.

43
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,370
Yes, if you pay up that much,
you will be free. Do you understand?

44
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't understand...

45
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,080
Yes, that's it...

46
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,240
WHAT?!

47
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,580
Where is this?

48
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,560
Who am I?

49
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,560
Miss Manley?

50
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,790
She is not acting, Doctor.

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,200
I am Whitney Hagas Matsumoto,
your lawyer.

52
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,270
Lawyer?

53
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,150
At the request of the Totus Insurance
Company, I did some research on your past.

54
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,120
Miss Faye Valentine.

55
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,520
Is that really my name?

56
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,920
It's a lovely name.

57
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,190
It suits you very well.

58
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,120
...and?

59
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,360
How much of your memory
do you still have?

60
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,650
This is a TV...

61
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,860
...this is a hot water pot...

62
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,900
...and this is a cellular phone.

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,390
I know everything...

64
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
...except about myself.

65
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,190
I see.

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,260
And?

67
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,600
According to the materials that
remain, when you were 20...

68
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,630
...well, you are still 20...

69
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,110
...you seem to have been
involved in a serious accident.

70
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,080
Accident?

71
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,550
Such that medical technology back
then could not completely cure you...

72
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,810
I'm totally fine, as you can see...

73
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,680
Not a scratch on my body...

74
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,050
Wait, what do you mean,
"back then"?

75
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,750
That was 54 years ago.

76
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,730
You have been in cold-sleep, or rather
cryogenically preserved, to this day.

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,970
And you were able to reawaken now that
you could get the treatment you needed.

78
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,730
Just like Sleeping Beauty.

79
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,230
You're kidding, right?

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,510
I am being serious.

81
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,680
Then this is a dream...

82
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,710
No, it is definitely 2068 now.

83
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,620
And this isn't a TV...

84
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,560
...but a washing machine.

85
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,080
And this isn't a hot water pot...

86
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,990
...but an automatic
face-washing machine.

87
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,160
And this is not a telephone,
but a thermometer.

88
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,660
You put this round segment
in your mouth...

89
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,760
Don't mock me!

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,700
You just start saying stuff like that,
and you expect me to believe...

91
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,870
<i>Body temperature: 34.5 degrees Celsius.</i>
<i>Pulse: 54. Blood pressure: 40/75.</i>

92
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,570
- Still low.
- Wait a minute!

93
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,980
Your memories end back when cellular
telephones still looked like this.

94
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,240
Then tell me!

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,440
What kind of accident?!
What was I like before then?!

96
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,920
Who am I?!

97
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,220
Calm down.
If you get excited, you...

98
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,050
What?! What is going to happen...

99
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,790
You'll get sleepy.

100
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,400
<i>Would you like one?</i>

101
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,550
Hey!

102
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,750
Hey!!

103
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,020
HEY!!

104
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,760
W-Wait!

105
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,050
Miss Valentine!

106
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,430
Wait!

107
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,900
Don't get near me!

108
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,460
What can you do by running away?!

109
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,940
Miss Valentine...

110
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,910
I can't pay 300 million...

111
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,410
It's unreasonable for them to
choose to resuscitate me...

112
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,390
...and then expect me
to pay the debt.

113
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,620
I don't even know
anything about myself...

114
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,720
What should I do?

115
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,200
We can take it slow about the debt.

116
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,800
I will help you.

117
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,640
Your memory might come
back to you someday.

118
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,480
If you keep living,
you might meet someone wonderful.

119
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,320
What... is this?

120
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,160
An ID.

121
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,830
This way, if you die,
or if you forget yourself...

122
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,960
...they will know who you
are and where you're from.

123
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,170
And I don't have that...

124
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,600
What?!

125
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,700
The collection agency!

126
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,510
The insurance company got impatient!

127
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,700
What are we going to do?!

128
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,020
At this rate, we're both doomed.

129
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,120
You should get out of the car and run.

130
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,350
What about you?

131
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,220
We'll meet up at the
Doctor's place. All right?

132
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,060
Why are you helping me?

133
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,560
The prince must protect
his sleeping beauty.

134
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,280
We just went through the paperwork.

135
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,380
He told us to hand you all of his
assets if something happened to him...

136
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,790
If you give us a thumbprint here,
everything he owns will be yours.

137
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,590
Whitney...

138
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,360
You really cared for me...

139
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,690
Now, put your thumb here.

140
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,070
Why are the numbers all red?

141
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,980
Well, they say that debt is an asset...

142
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,350
Debt...

143
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,190
You have GOT to be kidding!

144
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,480
I was stupid back then,
now that I think about it.

145
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,860
I mean, he risked
his life to save me...

146
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,800
His debt was nothing compared to mine.

147
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,640
It really wasn't that much...

148
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,540
You were there the whole time?

149
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,080
Your story was way too long.

150
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,590
You are a horrible woman.

151
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,990
I'm sure that guy is
weeping in the afterlife...

152
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,970
...now that you ran away
without paying the debt.

153
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,970
I can't help it.
It's not a sum that I can pay off.

154
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,900
Now you're being defiant about it.

155
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,530
I've got some nerve, alright...
I'm much older than you are.

156
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,450
Your past is all lies.
What was that about Romani?

157
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,540
Did you make this story up, too?

158
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,150
It's neither a lie, nor a fake.

159
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,920
I just don't know the truth.

160
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,480
Like I can help it.

161
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,390
Welcome back!

162
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,290
This guy is known as
the "Madam Killer."

163
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,600
Well, he's just a cheap
matrimonial fraud...

164
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,830
Sure doesn't look like one.

165
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,530
Well, I can do a good job
even by myself.

166
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,700
Got that?

167
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,440
Whitney Hagas Matsumoto...

168
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,920
H-Hey... long time no see...

169
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,860
What kinda relationship do they have
that she wants to talk to him alone?

170
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,950
Apparently it's a pretty
deep relationship.

171
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,760
An old guy of hers?

172
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
They were made for each other.

173
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,460
You seem very, VERY well,
Mister Lawyer.

174
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,140
Is it because I'm fat?
Isn't that a biased opinion?

175
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,940
I demand an explanation.

176
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,280
I got a fat implant
after that accident.

177
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,340
Got a little incision around
the armpit, and had it squeezed in...

178
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,820
NOT THAT!

179
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,040
It's been three years?

180
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,710
You look healthy, I'm glad.

181
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,020
Yea, I'm sure you are.

182
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,180
Did you think that you completely
reinvented yourself by doing that?

183
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,320
I wanted to start over...

184
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,420
...start everything over...

185
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,520
And so you went with matrimonial fraud.

186
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,470
To think you're a bounty hunter...
This must have been destined.

187
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,630
So everyone was in on it?

188
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,640
Back then, I couldn't do anything else.
Because he sheltered me, the doctor...

189
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,200
Maybe it was better
to have been caught.

190
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,340
I couldn't wish for anything more than
having you hand me over to the police.

191
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,350
You think it's all right
to leave them alone?

192
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,880
You worried about her?

193
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,480
I just thought that she
might let him go.

194
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Does she have that much
sympathy in her heart?

195
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,150
Women as insistent as her
tend to be the ones...

196
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,390
...who get emotionally
swayed by their exes.

197
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,870
Is that so?

198
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,230
Women don't work on reason.

199
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,730
Welcome, visitors!

200
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,540
<i>So are you the ones</i>
<i>that reported to us?</i>

201
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,170
<i>Yeah, I want to claim a bounty,</i>

202
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,200
<i>I see.</i>

203
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,180
Miss Manley, prepare to rendezvous.

204
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,210
Yes, Inspector.

205
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,690
I'm glad I was able to
meet you one last time.

206
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,120
Take care...

207
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,500
I won't hand you over to them!

208
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,190
It's all right.

209
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,500
You really don't have to mind me!

210
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,670
Are they ready to depart already?

211
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,940
Is she gonna let him go?

212
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,100
She might be letting him go.

213
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,310
- You wanna bet?
- We're splitting it 60-40.

214
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,780
Dammit, hurry up, Spike!

215
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,810
I'm trying!

216
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,180
I-It's impossible...

217
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,710
...to get both of us in this!

218
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,620
I don't care.

219
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,320
Breathe out some more! EXHALE!

220
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,820
Hey, wait!

221
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,590
I'm not letting you have him!

222
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,320
She took the guy and not the money!

223
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,100
Jet captured him!

224
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,670
I have to repay my debt to him.

225
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,730
So I have the right to do what I want
with him, and the bounty on him!

226
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,310
Amazing. She clearly
states a pointless argument...

227
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,840
That's what I told you.
Women don't work on reason.

228
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,600
Get me off of this thing!

229
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,880
Are you gonna let him go?

230
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,610
We'll see!

231
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,530
Visitor, thanks for coming!

232
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,990
Where are you going?

233
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,170
What are you going to do with me?

234
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,540
I want you to tell me the truth.

235
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,440
Why was I there?

236
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,640
Where does the truth end,
and where do the lies start?

237
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,520
What are you doing?!

238
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,990
If you're not careful,
I'll hit the pod.

239
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm not going to be easy on you!

240
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,900
That's MY line!

241
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,740
You're causing me a lot of trouble...

242
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,710
Who am I?

243
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,220
Do you really want to
know your own past?

244
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,390
Are you prepared for the consequences?

245
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,160
I am!

246
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
I see...

247
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,230
Wait a minute.

248
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,930
Well, I don't really know myself.

249
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,200
You're so...

250
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,540
<i>Who you really are, where you are</i>
<i>from, and where you will go.</i>

251
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,010
<i>That is a question that every human</i>
<i>asks himself at least once in his life.</i>

252
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,880
And who are you?

253
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,210
<i>However, puberty is the only time you</i>
<i>need to worry about things like that.</i>

254
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,410
<i>Only bored individuals think such</i>
<i>thoughts after a certain age.</i>

255
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,250
I've heard that voice before...

256
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,380
<i>Can you see me?</i>

257
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,590
Is that... the doctor and the nurse?

258
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,030
Seems... that way.

259
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,190
Didn't you say something like
that doctor passed away?

260
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,030
No, no... I didn't mean it THAT way...

261
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,940
YOU! How many lies do you have
to tell before you're satisfied?!

262
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,600
Um... Er...

263
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,610
<i>You were cryogenically,</i>
<i>preserved there.</i>

264
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,410
<i>That we are certain of.</i>
<i>I guarantee it.</i>

265
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,480
What about my past?

266
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,980
Who in the world am I?

267
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,350
<i>I gave you the name Valentine.</i>

268
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,910
I named you after my favorite song.

269
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,260
As for everything else, all data was
lost back in that Gate accident.

270
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,660
<i>So I don't know who you are, or</i>
<i>why you were put in cold-sleep...</i>

271
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,530
He wasn't a cop?

272
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,760
<i>The patrol ship over there.</i>
<i>State your department.</i>

273
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,360
<i>I repeat. The patrol ship over there.</i>

274
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>State your department</i>
<i>and registration number.</i>

275
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,340
Doctor... at this rate,
we will be apprehended.

276
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,650
It's truly unfortunate, but it's best
that we not meddle in this any longer.

277
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,620
Let's give up.

278
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,550
<i>So, farewell, Whitney,</i>
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

279
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,520
<i>We're sorry.</i>

280
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,690
H-Hey, wait! Uncle! UNCLE!

281
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,190
Uncle?

282
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,230
I'll take my bounty here and now!

283
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,710
There ya go!

284
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,270
Good riddance.

285
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,010
I guess you're getting paid back
for all the lies that you told.

286
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,480
There is one truth that I have spoken.

287
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,200
That I fell in love with
you while you were asleep...

288
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,220
...in love with a sleeping beauty.

289
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,570
No, just kidding!

290
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,160
I'm lying! It's a lie!

291
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,370
Did you want me to
come back that badly?

292
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,850
You sure got a big mouth.

293
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,540
You were jealous.

294
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,280
You really are a heartless woman.

295
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,550
I guess I don't know anything
about my past anymore...

296
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,560
Isn't that something that
really doesn't matter?

297
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,060
You think that way
because you have a past.

298
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,720
No matter the past,
you still have a future.

299
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,930
What's this?

300
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,030
Your share... of the 19,800 on his head.

301
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,270
19,800?

302
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,280
The smallest of the small fry.

303
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,570
It wasn't 198,000?

304
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,410
I put an extra digit in there...

305
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,190
COMING EPISODE

306
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,920
So, the next episode
of Cowboy Bebop...

307
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,290
...I admit, is really
heavy and depressing.

308
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,630
The only people that show up
are well-aged, musty men.

309
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,660
I hate to say this,
but it is rather lackluster.

310
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
Children shouldn't watch it.

311
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,170
Ladies should avoid it, too.

312
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,140
And to top it off, it's better
for young guys to not watch either.

313
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,940
Next episode: Black Dog Serenade.

314
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,820
Just to all the old guys...
make sure you watch it.

315
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,180
BLACK DOG SERENADE
