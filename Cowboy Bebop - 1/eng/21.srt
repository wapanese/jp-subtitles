00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,380
<i>This strange story began</i>
<i>on a blistering hot day,</i>

2
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,850
<i>I had received an unexpected mail</i>
<i>from an old acquaintance of mine...</i>

3
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,520
<i>...but the message was just this:</i>

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,260
<i>"Seek the sacred beast from Anzan."</i>

5
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,560
<i>"I am at the meeting place</i>
<i>of the four gods. "</i>

6
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,670
BOOGIE WOOGIE FENG SHUI

7
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,310
<i>Pao, the sender of the message,</i>
<i>was an acquaintance of mine...</i>

8
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,050
<i>...but it didn't mean that we</i>
<i>kept in touch all that well.</i>

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,580
<i>I grew suspicious, and started</i>
<i>to research Pao's current whereabouts.</i>

10
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,360
<i>They say that Pao is one of the three</i>
<i>greatest Feng Shui masters here on Mars.</i>

11
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,130
<i>But when I found his whereabouts,</i>
<i>he had already left this world...</i>

12
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,740
Are you sure you weren't the
one that sent me this mail?

13
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,010
The one who visits from
the inauspicious back door...

14
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,080
Receive the word from the heavens,
and lead me to the sun stone...

15
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,490
Just like what the pa-kua told me!

16
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,490
Look out!

17
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,230
Where are you shooting?!

18
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,770
They sure are disrespectful fellows.

19
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,270
The escape route!

20
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,940
Hey?

21
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,840
Hey, hey!

22
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,240
Idiot!

23
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,810
Shit!

24
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,580
Hey, hey, hey!

25
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,830
Escape route!

26
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Chi of Earth!

27
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,830
That was really close!

28
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,060
I'm glad you're safe.

29
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,710
What are you doing?

30
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,410
Hey, over there... Who is that?

31
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,390
I wonder if she's a new girlfriend.

32
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,960
For that, she's rather young.

33
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,320
Weird one, hot dog bun, loved one!

34
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,130
Maybe she's his secret love-child?

35
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,630
For that, she's rather old.

36
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,000
Child, mild, wild!

37
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,100
But I'm surprised.

38
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,070
I wasn't expecting Pao's daughter
to be this old already...

39
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,810
You probably don't remember...

40
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,780
...but I met you once when
you were this little.

41
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,450
How do you know my father?

42
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,510
How?

43
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,320
Just an acquaintance.
It's been 10 years already.

44
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,530
But your father sure was unlucky
to be in a traffic accident...

45
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,900
On the way to Jupiter, there was a sudden
spatial fluctuation in hyperspace...

46
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,930
Here you go.

47
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,010
Thank you.

48
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,840
Are you the "girlfriend?"

49
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,250
Are you the "secret love-child?"

50
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,050
Rejected!

51
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,030
Mr. Jet, why were you at the graveyard?

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,900
Nobody outside the family knows
he got into an accident...

53
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,970
"Seek the sacred beast from Anzan."

54
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,940
"I am at the meeting place
of the four gods."

55
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,980
This is?

56
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,220
Pao sent me this.

57
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
When?

58
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,650
Three days ago.

59
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,380
Right before the accident...

60
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,390
Please! Can you help me?!

61
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm sure this is the whereabouts
of the sun stone!

62
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,400
Sun stone?

63
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,570
The direction, day, and time you arrived
was the best combination for Feng Shui!

64
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,060
Especially when you're
searching for something!

65
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,970
I-It was?

66
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,210
It was!

67
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,480
Please, Mr. Jet!

68
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,480
Yes. About that, we will have it soon.

69
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,520
Yes, I understand.

70
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,110
How was the boss feeling?

71
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,590
Well...

72
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,920
There's no way it could be good.

73
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,650
Of course not...

74
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,920
Let's go!

75
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,730
<i>I didn't have any particular favors</i>
<i>to repay to Pao or this girl...</i>

76
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,560
<i>...but I decided to help them for now.</i>

77
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,370
<i>There were too many things that made</i>
<i>me suspicious to leave it alone.</i>

78
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,930
<i>Why did Pao send me mail</i>
<i>right before his death?</i>

79
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,840
<i>What do those words mean?</i>

80
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,640
<i>Who were those guys that attacked us?</i>

81
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,910
<i>And there was something about</i>
<i>this girl named Meifa as well...</i>

82
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
This universe is made
of three different Chis.

83
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,840
One is the Chi of Heaven,
the energy that comes from the Sun.

84
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,680
One is the Chi of Earth, the energy
that comes from a planet's surface.

85
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,880
And lastly Chi of Magnetism, the Chi
that organisms like ourselves produce.

86
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,910
Chi from organisms?

87
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,920
The human body always
produces a magnetic field.

88
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,520
That magnetic field and
the magnetic field of the Earth...

89
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,500
...react to one another
to create energy.

90
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,470
Universal Feng Shui is the
technology that reads the energies...

91
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,630
...of nature such as this to
use them in everyday life.

92
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,100
Ice cream.

93
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,710
Universal Feng Shui...

94
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,770
It's not the same thing
as fortunetelling?

95
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,250
Other fortunetelling methods
only predict or prognosticate.

96
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,760
However, Universal Feng Shui has the
power to make the bad into the good.

97
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,700
For example, if you were a Feng Shui
master as powerful as my father...

98
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,190
What's wrong?

99
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,600
I just realized that I never spent
time like this with my father...

100
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,300
Hey, now.

101
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,540
Let me point out that
I'm not that old.

102
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,040
If anything, I would be a boyfriend...

103
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,110
No, wait, that would be bad.

104
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,240
W-What am I saying?

105
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,810
At least I can be an
elder brother or something...

106
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,680
Ice cream...

107
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,780
ICE cream.

108
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,130
Let's go, Mr. Jet!

109
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,210
I believe that "Anzan" refers to here.

110
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,730
The Mountain Hotel Building...

111
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,380
There!

112
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,680
Seiryu!
(Blue Dragon)

113
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,530
Byakko!
(White Tiger)

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,940
Genbu!
(Black Turtle)

115
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,410
Suzaku!
(Scarlet Phoenix)

116
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,170
Hey...

117
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,340
I know, the cross-zenith method!

118
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,950
The sun stone is here!

119
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,580
Are you sure?

120
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,470
There they are.
They're right over there.

121
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,330
All right.

122
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,790
I finally found it...

123
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,760
This must be the sun stone.

124
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,270
This thing?

125
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,310
Mr. Jet?

126
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,180
Outta the way.

127
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,090
What are you doing?

128
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,090
One bottle of lao-chu.
I don't need a glass.

129
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,630
Take that!

130
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,280
Hey, who are you guys?

131
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,550
Heh, you think we would
tell you that easily...

132
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,550
W-We're from the Blue Snake...

133
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,320
So you ARE from a syndicate...

134
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,690
Why are you following us around?

135
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,870
I-I couldn't tell you that
even if you killed me...

136
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,860
I-It was because we couldn't get Pao...

137
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,970
So they told us to get
the recipient of his mail...

138
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,700
I-I'm telling the truth!

139
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,980
We're on the low end so we
don't know any more than that!

140
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,950
I'm sure.

141
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,930
Mr. Jet...

142
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,650
My father... is alive?

143
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,170
<i>Pao's words showed where</i>
<i>this stone was.</i>

144
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,870
<i>Does that mean Pao is</i>
<i>still alive somewhere?</i>

145
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,670
<i>Did he want me to find this</i>
<i>stone and do something with it?</i>

146
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,480
<i>It feels like I created more</i>
<i>mysteries instead of solving them.</i>

147
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,250
<i>For now, I decided to check out</i>
<i>this stone, which was our only clue.</i>

148
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,060
So this is a piece of the moon from
that Gate accident 50 years ago...

149
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,160
We Feng Shui masters
call it the sun stone.

150
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,130
It's absorbed the fluctuations
in time and space...

151
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,700
...and conceals a tremendous
amount of energy.

152
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,480
I can only think of it
as a plain old rock...

153
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,210
So, how much would it be if we sold it?

154
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,240
Hey, guys, if you're gonna
smoke, go smoke outside.

155
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,450
What?

156
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,580
You always smoke in here, too!

157
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,960
I'm turning this into a
nonsmoking area starting today.

158
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,620
Hey, now, you're kidding, right?

159
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,830
This ship is MY ship, remember?

160
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,140
So, what are you gonna
do with this stone?

161
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,080
I... have no idea.

162
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,250
I don't know what my
father is thinking...

163
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,890
Oh, hey, wait!

164
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,050
Ein! Wait!

165
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,730
The luo-pan...

166
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,860
What?

167
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,930
That can't be...
I took the magnet off...

168
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,930
I see... I get it now...

169
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,640
So that's it!

170
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,510
THAT'S IT!!

171
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,660
If I remember correctly, my father
owned a sun stone as well.

172
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,990
I'm sure that the two
stones are resonating...

173
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,400
...to show me the
whereabouts of my father.

174
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,770
And that's why Pao made you
look for this stone...

175
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,500
But...

176
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,970
I don't know why my father
sent the mail to you, Mr. Jet...

177
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,140
...and not to me...

178
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,460
What do you think?

179
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,190
They make a good couple.

180
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,570
It's a dangerous combination.

181
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,800
What is?

182
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,600
The more righteous a guy
was in his youth...

183
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,300
...the more likely he's gonna fall
for a young girl later in life.

184
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,500
Is that so?

185
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,070
Really... Guys are so clueless.

186
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,010
My father...

187
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,650
...was one that believed in Universal
Feng Shui, but not other people...

188
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,820
So my mother left the house,
and took me along.

189
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,550
That was seven years ago...

190
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:56,130
I'm sure my father was able
to find our whereabouts easily.

191
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,760
But he never even tried
to look for us...

192
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,540
I'm sure there was a reason behind it.

193
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,700
Why was my father
targeted by those men?

194
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,680
Was it because he was
friends with bad people?

195
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,820
Please, tell me the truth!

196
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,150
Who my father really was...

197
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,160
Pao... was the consultant
for a syndicate.

198
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,700
That's the truth.

199
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,630
Pao had leaked
information to me about...

200
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,140
...the syndicate, back
when I was a detective.

201
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Pao already wanted out of
the syndicate back then.

202
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,530
However, it's impossible
for someone who knows...

203
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,140
...important syndicate secrets
to ever leave the group.

204
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,820
I'm sure Pao was afraid that more bad
things would happen to his family.

205
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,760
Well, I'm sure you can confirm
it all when you see him.

206
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,170
Here!

207
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,210
Around here...

208
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,910
There isn't anything here.

209
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,050
How about the radar?

210
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,090
No response.

211
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,030
That can't be...
I'm sure this is the place...

212
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,990
Hmm? Wait...

213
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,360
Hold on...

214
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,200
Do we have guests?

215
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,760
They sure are persistent.

216
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,470
Spike, Faye, please take care of them!

217
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,910
Aren't they YOUR guests?

218
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,370
Help me out if you don't
wanna die with this ship!

219
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,040
What rotten luck of the draw.

220
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,890
<i>Sometimes it's good to act without</i>
<i>asking "What's in it for me?".</i>

221
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,620
We're fairies who are going to
grant the princess' wish.

222
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,680
<i>We are?</i>

223
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,400
Unmanned fighters?

224
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,430
So these would be the seven dwarves...

225
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Shit! They're trying to scare us!

226
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,610
I got it!

227
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,300
<i>Spike! Come back here!</i>

228
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,500
What?!

229
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,300
<i>Apparently, if we apply lots</i>
<i>of energy to that stone...</i>

230
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,290
<i>...we can draw out all the</i>
<i>forces trapped inside it.</i>

231
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,100
And, what are we going to do?

232
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
This is an all-or-nothing plan, but...

233
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,780
I don't care what it is, just hurry!

234
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,650
I put it in!

235
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,850
All right!

236
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>Blast this rock with</i>
<i>your plasma cannon.</i>

237
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,960
What a great plan this is...

238
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,890
<i>Looks like you made it in time, Jet...</i>

239
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,090
Pao! You're...

240
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,060
<i>Meifa... It's been a while.</i>

241
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,600
Pao, you're in unstable territory.
I can't approach any closer than this.

242
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,100
<i>I know... There isn't any,</i>
<i>oxygen left in here anyway,</i>

243
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,340
<i>I sent you that mail because I wanted</i>
<i>you to bring my daughter here...</i>

244
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,290
Then... you willed us to be here
like this using Feng Shui?!

245
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,020
<i>Yeah...</i>

246
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,700
That's not true, Pao.

247
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,400
This wasn't your doing.

248
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,100
Meifa is here now...

249
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,940
...because she WANTED to come here.

250
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,320
<i>You might be right.</i>

251
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,410
<i>Perhaps I was being too hotheaded...</i>

252
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,320
<i>Meifa... it's wonderful to</i>
<i>see you one last time...</i>

253
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,790
I hated you all this time...

254
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,200
I despised you all this time...

255
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,340
But...

256
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,780
Papa...

257
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,240
<i>Now, I don't know if it was a good thing</i>
<i>or a bad thing that we took her along.</i>

258
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,440
<i>In any case, this was how</i>
<i>this strange case ended.</i>

259
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,780
<i>She went back to Mars.</i>

260
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,440
<i>And the smoking ban was lifted</i>
<i>from the living quarters.</i>

261
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,050
<i>Once again, unchanging daily life</i>
<i>has returned, just as it was before.</i>

262
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,960
<i>One thing that has changed, though...</i>

263
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:31,120
<i>I no longer read the</i>
<i>fortunetelling pages in magazines.</i>

264
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,800
He... came with a whistle.

265
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,190
COMING EPISODE

266
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,080
A man, Andy, made a sudden
appearance on horseback.

267
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,740
Who in the world is he?

268
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,980
Is he an ally or a foe?
Or is he a true cowboy?

269
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,650
The next episode is a shocking sci-fi
macaroni-western epic saga: Cowboy Funk.

270
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,780
Wait a minute, isn't this
world view a bit different?

271
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,230
COWBOY FUNK
