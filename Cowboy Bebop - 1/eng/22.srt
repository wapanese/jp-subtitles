1
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,980
You forgot something.

2
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,360
A-As you can see,
I'm just some old man.

3
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,220
Unfortunately, I don't have
any children, either...

4
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,260
I never said it was yours.

5
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,320
Oh, was it a customer's?
I will hold it, then...

6
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,070
How about it?

7
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,670
Wanna go somewhere?

8
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,970
It's a little to early to go to bed...

9
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,270
I'm an early riser... I sleep early.

10
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,140
If you want a prim and proper life,
I have just the place for you.

11
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,480
A hotel where you get three meals
and a bodyguard, all for free.

12
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,550
I'm sure that's impossible
without a reservation.

13
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,590
I'm talking about
Hotel PRISON, Teddy Bomber.

14
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,390
I'd rather not, Spike Spiegel.

15
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,360
Oh, you know me?

16
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,370
It's a popular story among criminals...

17
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,500
...that we never want to be
caught by you, or by Andy.

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,160
Andy?

19
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,870
I will fulfill my objective!

20
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,320
It won't blow up.

21
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,690
I took out the ignition pin.

22
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,770
3 million woolongs,
graciously accepted.

23
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,770
That's not the only bear.

24
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,180
You'll die, too.

25
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,080
I love them to death.

26
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,010
Why do you want to
blow stuff up so much?

27
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,980
Ya wanna know?
I am giving a warning.

28
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,950
I am ringing a bell of warning!

29
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,690
All right, be mindful of what I say!

30
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,270
Andy!

31
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,710
Andy?

32
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,540
Call me Wyatt Earp.

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,520
YOU! Teddy Bomber, serial bomber!

34
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,890
ME?!

35
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,290
The fact that you'd plant
a bomb here today was easy...

36
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,860
...for ME to figure out after
calculating YOUR criminal cycles.

37
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,560
You don't think that's him?

38
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,930
He's a security guard!

39
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,130
Just look at his face!

40
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,770
In this day and age,
a face means nothing.

41
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,970
Then what is the basis of your theory?!

42
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,210
That is...

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,940
...my gut instinct. Yes, INSPIRATION!

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,780
Hey, wait!

45
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,690
WAIT!

46
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,070
OH SHIT!

47
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,570
That's why I said Teddy Bomber
was THAT guy, you idiot!

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,630
DANGEROUS!

49
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,690
That was a close one.

50
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,220
Giddyup!

51
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,340
COWBOY FUNK

52
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,670
A horse?

53
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,610
Yeah, a horse.

54
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,610
A horse, huh?

55
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,950
I thought something was
fishy when you said you...

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
...would nab that guy as
part of your foraging trip.

57
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,210
What do you mean by that?

58
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,450
You used up the food money for
all four of us, didn't you?

59
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,180
Oh, come on...

60
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,280
What did you use it on?

61
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,420
If you think I'm lying,
explain THIS on my back!

62
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,960
All right, I hear ya.

63
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,890
- The horse I can believe.
- You can?

64
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,520
But, you have to be more creative
than a cowboy in a cowboy outfit.

65
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Is that the problem?

66
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,270
Now if he was dressed like a samurai...

67
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,200
...that would be more plausible.

68
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,740
Here he is... little Andy!

69
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,910
Little Andy is a guy in the YMCA...

70
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,970
A Christian?

71
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,110
Nope. Young Men's Cowboy Association!

72
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,350
Oh? Such a thing exists?

73
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,750
But, he got kicked out
soon after joining.

74
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,760
The reason?

75
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,660
Because he caused others trouble!

76
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,890
Of course!

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,800
Andy von de Oniyate...
the noble son of Oniyate Ranch.

78
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,630
Hey, he's pretty cute.

79
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,870
123 cases of property damage. 89 cases
of destruction of public property.

80
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,410
Many, many people injured.

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,100
A good match for SOMEONE we know.

82
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,170
I told you he existed!

83
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,580
All right, I hear ya.

84
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,880
Any reactions?

85
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,510
<i>None yet.</i>

86
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,960
However...

87
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,260
We can't let it explode
with all these people around.

88
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,860
<i>His only target is the building.</i>

89
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,800
<i>He's not one for murder.</i>

90
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,330
You think we can trust him?

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,500
<i>Guys like him are often concerned</i>
<i>with their sense of style.</i>

92
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,210
Well, this is the perfect
party to hide yourself...

93
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,180
Did you know that a serial
bomber is gonna come here?

94
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,010
To tell the truth, I didn't know.

95
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,480
Well, he's coming.

96
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,090
Hey!

97
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,550
The world is about LOVE AND PEACE!

98
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,020
Yo.

99
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,460
H-How did you know it was me?

100
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,330
This lead the way to its papa.

101
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,740
I think I woulda known in either case.

102
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,900
You guys just don't quit, do you?

103
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,100
Speak for yourself.

104
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,870
Why do you want to blow
things up so much?

105
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,740
Ya wanna know?

106
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,300
I am giving out a warning.

107
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,150
Listen, in this world,
the root of all evil...

108
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,820
A horse...

109
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,230
A cowboy...

110
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,400
HEY, YOU! Teddy Bomber!

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,700
M-Me?!

112
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,940
See, I told you.

113
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,500
Or is it you over there?

114
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,440
Do you have NO memory?

115
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,110
We met just yesterday!

116
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,510
I have no recollection.

117
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,950
YOU!

118
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,120
Um, sir, your horse
is an inconvenience...

119
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,320
It does prove rather troublesome
for our other customers...

120
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,290
OH! MY beloved steed Onyx
is no ordinary horse!

121
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,730
At times, she sets my troubled mind at
ease; at others she is my chess partner.

122
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,220
Like horses play chess!

123
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,060
It doesn't matter either way...

124
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,730
I detest being IGNORED!!

125
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,750
What happened to his sense of style?!

126
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,810
Calm down!
I'm telling you to calm down!

127
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,250
Love and peace, man!

128
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,160
Such a lovely horse.

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,360
Do you like her?

130
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,630
Would you like to be my escort?

131
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,330
Now, get behind me...

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,080
You little!

133
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,900
In my life, I've never seen such a...

134
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,730
...tasteless room.

135
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,770
Now, I present you with my
special Son of a Gun Stew.

136
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,310
I'm sure you'll find
it extremely delicious.

137
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,520
Um... So, why are you a bounty hunter?

138
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,730
If you're so rich, uh, I mean if you
have so much comfort in your life...

139
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,500
Why... Let's see...

140
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,470
Because... it suits me.

141
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,130
That feeling a cowboy gets
when he corners a bull.

142
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,310
Oh... but you don't have to go after
such a dangerous bounty, do you?

143
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,390
I know why nobody wants
to go after Teddy Bomber.

144
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,450
Nobody wants to get a
piece of the explosion!

145
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,120
You think we can worry about that?

146
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,360
Yes! I don't worry about
things like that!

147
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,890
Once I set my mind on something,
I can see NOTHING else!

148
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,330
I think I've seen this
personality somewhere before...

149
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,770
Oh, nothing...

150
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,830
Now!

151
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,770
Here's lookin' at...

152
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,750
...my reflection, kid.

153
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,440
Cheers...

154
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,590
Hi, I got a souvenir.

155
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,270
Yippie! A souvenir! A souvenir!

156
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,000
I ain't gonna eat THAT!

157
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,540
Guess this is for dinner...

158
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,540
I will NOT eat that!

159
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,440
Your stomach will suffer.

160
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,910
But, what about him
makes you so hotheaded?

161
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,820
They're too similar.

162
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,120
You know how similar
people hate each other.

163
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,720
What part of me is similar
to that shit-headed idiot?!

164
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,190
The part that makes
you damn troublesome.

165
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,630
Oh, Big Shot has already started.

166
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,200
<i>Well, the last thing we have to tell</i>
<i>you is info about TB, Teddy Bomber.</i>

167
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,610
<i>Can you believe it? We got a message</i>
<i>from him, just for this show!</i>

168
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,010
<i>What? Is that for real?</i>

169
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,770
<i>Um, let's see...</i>

170
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,340
<i>WARNING. "This is for those</i>
<i>that have made fun of me. "</i>

171
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,890

172
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,450
<i>"This time, I'll blow YOU up</i>
<i>as well, like fireworks. "</i>

173
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520

174
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,790
<i>"That is, if you know</i>
<i>where I will set up next. "</i>

175
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,920
<i>"Heh, heh, heh."</i>

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,230
<i>"And lastly, I will tell</i>
<i>you my true intent..."</i>

177
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,800
<i>Whoops! Looks like time is up for us.</i>
<i>That's all for today,</i>

178
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,070

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,040
<i>Well, until next time...</i>

180
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,870
<i>Good luck!</i>

181
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,050
The next one's in City Hall...

182
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
You figured it out already?

183
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,020
TB is blowing up tall buildings
starting with the tallest one...

184
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,020
The reason was THAT simple?

185
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,860
What are you gonna do?
I'm getting outta this one!

186
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm gonna pass, too.

187
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,330
Spike, what are you going to do?

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,990
Like you have to ask?

189
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,500
LATE!

190
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,880
Dammit! If they think they can get away
with this, they are sorely mistaken...

191
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,280
You alone?

192
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,480
How dare you take so
much time to get here!

193
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,750
Wait!

194
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,960
Wrong guy...

195
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,520
I have never intended
humans as targets!

196
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,890
But, you guys are different!

197
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,230
Guys like you deserve...

198
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,440
He's here...

199
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,250
YOU! It was you!

200
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,050
So you finally remember me.

201
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,220
- You always...
- You ALWAYS butt in and get in my way!

202
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,190
YOU'RE the one that's in the way!

203
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,320
Now that I have both of
you here, I will tell you.

204
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,860
The reason why I continue to
blow buildings up. That is because...

205
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,900
Today, we are going to settle
the score once and for all.

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,970
WHAT?! That's MY line!

207
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,770
Listen to what I have to say!!

208
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,900
Shut up!

209
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,870
And you are? WHO ARE YOU?!

210
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,480
C-Can't you guys put some
effort into your work?!

211
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,490
We have to catch HIM first!

212
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,150
Wait!

213
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,330
<i>You guys take me too lightly,</i>

214
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,200
<i>That elevator's doors</i>
<i>will never open again.</i>

215
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,370
<i>And once it starts moving,</i>
<i>that's the end. It will never stop.</i>

216
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,470
At the top floor, my cute
little bears will greet you.

217
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,650
So, the moment that the elevator
reaches the top floor...

218
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,480
BOOM!

219
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,420
<i>Well, live what little you have</i>
<i>of your life left without regret!</i>

220
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,620
<i>Farewell, and good luck.</i>

221
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,270
Rest assured.

222
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,860
I understand...
I KNOW how he does things.

223
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,610
Don't worry. I know how he does...

224
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,240
This afternoon, I reverted
the secret emergency...

225
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,180
...code that had been changed. YEAH!

226
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,780
<i>I reverted it this afternoon!</i>

227
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,990
Change after change...

228
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,290
...means it's back to
where it started!!

229
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,960
Stop, you idiot!

230
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,970
What do we do, what do we do?!
OH, NO!!

231
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,450
Wah, stop, shit, it's too tight!

232
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,850
YOU are in the way!

233
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,380
What?! Get outta the way, dammit!!

234
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,680
Farewell...

235
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,650
Come to think of it,
they were brave young men...

236
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,770
They're climbing...
those two monkeys...

237
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,480
They like high places.

238
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,750
So they ARE similar...

239
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,320
Let's just go back...

240
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,350
Then I'll go turn him in.

241
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,760
YOU don't even deserve
to be called a cowboy.

242
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,970
I will never forgive you.

243
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,210
WOW!

244
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,950
I lose...

245
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,730
That was some punch!

246
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,390
You are a true cowboy.

247
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,430
As of today, I will
no longer be a cowboy.

248
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,270
This really is a hats-off!

249
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,270
So... what are ya gonna do now?

250
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,870
I will no doubt find
a new way of life...

251
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,550
See you, Space Cowboy!

252
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,730
Well, it was only a rich boy's hobby.

253
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
His level... no... rank...
was really no match for me.

254
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,610
Hey, are ya listening?

255
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,040
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,640
So, he just wasn't any enemy of mine.

257
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,340
Of course, I never had
him in my line of sight.

258
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,310
- Hey, are ya listening?
- Yeah, yeah.

259
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,260
But anyway...

260
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,390
Why did you want to blow
stuff up so much?

261
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,990
I wanted to give a warning...

262
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,330
...against all the unnecessary waste
created by capitalism lacking philosophy.

263
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,770
Planets that needlessly get colonized.

264
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,740
Media that needlessly get circulated.

265
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,470
And buildings that are needlessly
tall to symbolize all of this!

266
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,040
And by destroying them,
I wanted to raise...

267
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,020
...the question of how
a true pioneer should be.

268
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,450
Wait, wait, WAIT!

269
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,150
Andy!

270
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,620
Call me... MUSASHI!

271
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,620
Go, JIROUMARU!

272
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,560
But...

273
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,860
It was all a waste, wasn't it?

274
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,270
COMING EPISODE

275
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,540
So, did you pay close attention
to me and my wonderful role?

276
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,580
Hey, wait a minute...

277
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,520
Now, the next episode,
the next story...

278
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,050
Why are YOU doing the preview?

279
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,020
Once again, it's time for me, Andy,
to have an active role in the story!

280
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,790
Your turn on the stage is already over!

281
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,790
Now that I'm a space samurai, watch me
completely crush cowboys left and right!

282
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,260
You're not appearing
in the show anymore!

283
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,920
Next episode of Cowboy Bebop:
Andy Strikes Back!

284
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,230
The title is nothing like that!

285
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,930
Please look forward to it!

286
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,300
BRAIN SCRATCH
