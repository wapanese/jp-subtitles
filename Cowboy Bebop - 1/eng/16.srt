1
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,160
Hey, did you do that by yourself?

2
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,730
Pretty good!

3
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,970
Hey, let's be amiable.

4
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,030
We shouldn't waste what our
whimsical god has given us.

5
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,310
God?

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,610
Or rather, for these guys,
it would be the devil.

7
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,380
Want some? It's Dom Perignon.

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,090
Cheers.

9
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,600
To this ship that has
charmed the devil.

10
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,170
BLACK DOG SERENADE

11
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,520
What in the world is going on
with the showers in this place?!

12
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,820
This is the fourth time!
The FOURTH time!

13
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,350
Even Buddha gets upset
after the third time!

14
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,950
Hey, are you listening?

15
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,190
The shower broke, and only
cold water comes out.

16
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,170
And the faucet fell off.

17
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,670
If you know about it, fix it!

18
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,970
I'm busy right now.

19
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,630
You can do THAT any time you want...

20
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,470
We're busy!

21
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,510
Don't just hang up!
What if it's an emergency?

22
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,020
Oh, all right.
You'll be happy if I fix it, right?

23
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,360
Hi, he'll call you back.
What's your name?

24
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,300
OK, Fad. I'll tell him.

25
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,630
Fad?

26
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,530
Did you say Fad?

27
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,040
It's not hot?

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,680
Why don't you fix that?

29
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,350
I told you I'll fix it.

30
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,850
No, your arm.

31
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,720
I mean, reconstructive surgery
doesn't cost that much nowadays, right?

32
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,020
This ship is my ship.

33
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,650
And this arm is my arm.

34
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,350
Don't tell me what I need to do.

35
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,960
Now, you death row inmates.

36
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,340
I'm sorry to say, but the cruise to
the prison on Pluto has been canceled.

37
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,000
This ship will now
enter a mystery tour...

38
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,540
What are you going to do?

39
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,640
Do you think this ship
is enough for you to escape?

40
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,680
I wasn't talking to you...

41
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,790
S-Stop wasting your time like this.

42
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,420
If you surrender peacefully...

43
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,090
I told you to shut up.

44
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,890
Don't get so hotheaded, Dig.

45
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, man... there goes
our precious hostage.

46
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,510
I'm not letting anyone
tell me what to do.

47
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,770
If you got a problem with
that, step forward!

48
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,080
YOU!

49
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,890
I remember...

50
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,900
You're... yeah...

51
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,130
That assassin for the syndicate...

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,100
Udai.

53
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,580
Caught you red-handed
tossing a cigarette butt.

54
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,090
That would be a fine of
20000 woolongs, Jet.

55
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,830
Then I'll need to collect
that loan I gave you...

56
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,830
...with 7 years' worth of interest,
to cover it... and then some...

57
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,300
When did you buy me that coffee?

58
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,460
That's long past the
statute of limitations!

59
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,900
So you still think you're
a gunman with a gun like that?

60
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,470
Sure is a waste of ISSP tax money.

61
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,970
This is?

62
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,970
No, your salary.

63
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,210
Yeah, really...

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,980
No, I quit.

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,650
Huh, I see...

66
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,460
Tenth day. It's a hard world
to live in for smokers, anyway.

67
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,360
Hmm... I never thought you would...

68
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,030
And, what was it that
you wanted to tell me?

69
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,060
There was trouble on the prison
transport ship headed for Pluto.

70
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,330
That was six hours ago.

71
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,600
Apparently there was
an electrical malfunction...

72
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,310
...the prisoners took advantage
of it, and rioted.

73
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,470
I don't know the details.

74
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,740
And?

75
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
Udai is on that ship.

76
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,190
We don't know where the ship went
after it left the Ganymede Gate.

77
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,190
The ISSP is frantically searching...

78
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,560
Hey, you... don't get any stupid ideas.

79
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,690
It's out of your jurisdiction.

80
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,690
You think it's a stupid idea?

81
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,640
The reason you quit being a cop was...

82
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,140
...because of when...

83
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,390
Now THAT is past the
statute of limitations.

84
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,650
If after all this, he lives on...

85
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,400
...wouldn't that left arm
of yours cry, Jet?

86
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,130
That story doesn't
interest me anymore...

87
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,740
Jet! I'll go around from this side!

88
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,670
Got it!

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,740
Udai Taxim!

90
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,920
You are under arrest!

91
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,000
A trap?!

92
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,950
What are ya gonna do?

93
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,960
The guys from the ISSP are
gonna come any minute!

94
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,450
And the pilot's dead.

95
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,860
We're gonna break through, of course.

96
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,660
Easy for you to say.

97
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,560
We only got enough weapons
for self-defense.

98
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,970
What are ya gonna do?

99
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,340
I'm sure they've set up a barricade.

100
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,280
It would be better for us to attack...

101
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,510
...and break through
where they're thin.

102
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,880
Can you... steer this thing?

103
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,820
I was a cop on Venus once.

104
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,280
And now you're imprisoned for life?

105
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,290
Cops are human, too...

106
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,190
You got back?

107
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,140
I'm heading out.

108
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,000
It's dangerous, so stand back.

109
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,010
You're going out. Get souvenirs!

110
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,300
Ed...

111
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,280
If I don't come back,
water the bonsai for me.

112
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,550
Yup!

113
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,380
Bonsai, wise guy, chicken pot pie.

114
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,650
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

115
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,960
<i>HQ, do you read?</i>

116
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,550
<i>This is Group D-7.</i>

117
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,730
<i>We have spotted the</i>
<i>prison transport ship.</i>

118
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
<i>The ship is sending an SOS.</i>

119
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,870
<i>Apparently they ran into</i>
<i>some mechanical trouble.</i>

120
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,870
We are releasing a lifeboat.

121
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,180
On the boat are 4 officers
and 12 inmates.

122
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,520
We're requesting a pickup.

123
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,890
<i>Number 12, Number 13, no response.</i>
<i>We request emergency backup.</i>

124
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,360
<i>Repeat, we request emergency backup.</i>

125
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,230
<i>We have lost sight of the transport.</i>
<i>Current location is seven-four-five.</i>

126
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,070
<i>Group D-7, initiate code ten-eight.</i>

127
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,040
<i>Repeat, we request emergency backup.</i>

128
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,470
No good.

129
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,070
Apparently the police don't
know where they went, either.

130
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,340
What do you think their
next move will be?

131
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,910
If they are to hijack another ship...

132
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,110
They'll be somewhere close
to their original route...

133
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,180
At a place where they can hide...

134
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,210
I don't think so.

135
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,120
What?

136
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,420
Europa.

137
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,050
Europa?

138
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,150
What makes you think that?

139
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,390
If I was Udai,
I would go back to Europa.

140
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,930
But, Udai is already...

141
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,870
He hasn't contacted the
syndicate in quite a while.

142
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,800
He is old-fashioned.

143
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,800
So much that he's not the right kind
of guy to live in this day and age...

144
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,810
He'll go back. I know it...

145
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,780
The Black Dog that won't
let go once he bites, huh?

146
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,810
OK, Europa it is.

147
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,290
If you're wrong,
you're paying for fuel.

148
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,290
Wait! What the... OW!

149
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,800
What part of this is fixed!

150
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,900
What's this? Jet's gonna have a fit!

151
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,940
He asked me.

152
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,010
He's not comin' back!

153
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,750
It's okay, just bring
something to wipe this up.

154
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,120
Okay!

155
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,580
What's up with him,
leaving his precious bonsai here?

156
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,120
Hey, Jet! What the hell is going on?!

157
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,320
It's me.

158
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,300
<i>You seem to have done</i>
<i>something outrageous.</i>

159
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,860
We need a new ship.

160
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,810
<i>There is no further relationship</i>
<i>between us and Udai Taxim.</i>

161
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,070
Are you betraying me?

162
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,740
<i>If you want to feel that way, go ahead.</i>

163
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,840
I have information.

164
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,650
<i>That threat won't work anymore.</i>

165
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,150
<i>Times have changed...</i>
<i>while you were in prison.</i>

166
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,730
You win. He's there.

167
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,860
We should split up.
I'll come around from the other end.

168
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,270
You're crazy!

169
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,830
That ship doesn't have
any decent weapons!

170
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,040
You know how I work better
than anyone else, right?

171
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,710
Hey, Jet...

172
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,080
Why don't you quit being a bounty
hunter and pair up with me again?

173
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,050
I'll think about it if we get back.

174
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,190
Heat source detected.

175
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,630
Someone after us?

176
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,130
If it's the ISSP,
I doubt they would come alone.

177
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,570
I found something good
in the cargo bay.

178
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,540
And we have the perfect target.

179
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,980
All right, Jet...

180
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,510
We'll approach them using this ice
for cover. Stay there until I signal...

181
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,260
JET!

182
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,460
I don't know who ya are,
but we'll give ya a warm welcome!

183
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,790
Here ya go!

184
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,610
Bingo!

185
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,910
That guy's got guts...

186
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,100
...to come here alone.

187
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,190
What the hell is he?

188
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,320
Hey, where are you...

189
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,800
He's my visitor.

190
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,840
You've got to be kidding.

191
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,810
I'm not gonna put up with all of this!

192
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,410
You came all the way here to see me?

193
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,910
I didn't come here because I wanted to!

194
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,420
Don't say that, I came
out here just to greet you.

195
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,990
I didn't want to come...

196
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,830
...but something else
wanted to see you...

197
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,800
What?

198
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,600
The left arm that I lost!

199
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,720
What a happy camper you are.

200
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,020
You never knew anything, did you?

201
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,290
What?

202
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,290
I wasn't the one who
shot you back then.

203
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,760
It was your partner.

204
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,200
Jet! I'll go around from this side!

205
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,710
Got it!

206
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,170
<i>It was all planned out</i>
<i>from the beginning...</i>

207
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>To get rid of you, who was</i>
<i>a threat to the syndicate...</i>

208
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,290
Udai Taxim!

209
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,190
You are under arrest!

210
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,830
<i>You were long since betrayed...</i>
<i>You were used...</i>

211
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,340
A trap?!

212
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,490
Why did you shoot?

213
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,460
Was it because he was
telling the truth?

214
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,730
You came here to shut him up for good?

215
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,770
Why aren't you answering me?!

216
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,640
It was your fault, Jet.

217
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,080
It ended up this way because
you went in on your own...

218
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,740
You know what happens to people who
go against the syndicate, right?

219
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,860
Either they all quit like you...
or they die.

220
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,060
We can't live on with
our pretty little ideals.

221
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,830
That's why you betrayed me...

222
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,430
...and kept fooling me?!

223
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,230
I wanted to team up with
you like back then.

224
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,790
Time for farewells, Jet.

225
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,230
Fad!

226
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,850
Jet...

227
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,190
You didn't...

228
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,460
Did you let me shoot on purpose?

229
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,420
Can I have... a smoke?

230
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,250
I guess... I couldn't quit smoking...

231
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,190
COMING EPISODE

232
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,930
This time, the three of us
will try to do the previews!

233
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
Do you think we can do it?

234
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,060
We only have 30 seconds!
If you're too slow, it'll all be over!

235
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,500
You sure are restless...

236
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,300
Anyway, what kinda story
is it next time?

237
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,310
I can't remember...

238
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,180
What are you doing?!
We're already running out of time!

239
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,580
Come on, at least tell them the title!

240
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,710
Next episode... Wait, what was it?

241
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,880
We couldn't do it after all!

242
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,310
