1
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,170
<i>Soon, this flight 210</i>
<i>will arrive on Venus.</i>

2
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,540
<i>Some people may have an</i>
<i>allergic reaction to...</i>

3
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,480
<i>...the floating plants used</i>
<i>in the terraforming of Venus.</i>

4
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,520
<i>It has a chance of degenerating</i>
<i>into Venus-sickness...</i>

5
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,360
<i>...so if symptoms appear, please</i>
<i>consult a doctor immediately.</i>

6
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,180
Quiet down, everyone!

7
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,150
Both hands behind your heads!
All of you!

8
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,780
I-I'll give you money!

9
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,050
I don't care about the others,
let me off...

10
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,190
Anyone who makes a ruckus
ends up like him!

11
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,600
Dammit... why did this
have to be the day...

12
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,230
You over there!

13
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,930
HEY!

14
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,810
You listening to me?!

15
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,970
You! Get up!

16
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,350
All right.

17
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,450
Quietly put both hands
behind your head...

18
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,850
Hey! Don't fall asleep!

19
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,550
Who the hell do you think we are?!

20
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,380
YOU!

21
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,870
Whoops, sorry.

22
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,960
That's enough!

23
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,210
Enough of YOU, Ms. bounty.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,460
WALTZ FOR VENUS

25
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,070
Don't be silly!

26
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,800
This is 5000?!

27
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,670
Special price.

28
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,070
That's not written anywhere up there!

29
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,100
But it's not to
normal residential quarters.

30
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,170
I'm asking ya for a favor here...

31
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,680
All the way out there to
the middle of the desert...

32
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,140
Hey! Don't rip me off here!

33
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,550
W-Wait a minute...

34
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,420
Make sure it gets there! Got that?!

35
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,690
Hey, wait!

36
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,260
Thanks for the business.

37
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,270
Hi.

38
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,060
What?

39
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,300
My share.

40
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,300
Here?

41
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,270
I need it now.

42
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,380
That's all you get.

43
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,850
I know that!

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,820
Depositing it at the casino again?

45
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,880
It's better than a bank!

46
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,880
She never gives up...

47
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,560
I don't need any more pickpockets.

48
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,130
Amazing... You're really amazing!

49
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,310
You're the one that rounded up the
hijackers with some amazing moves, right?

50
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,380
I have a favor to ask.

51
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,720
Can you teach me how to move like that?

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,190
Is it judo? Or kung-fu?

53
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,850
Hey, wait a minute.

54
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,850
I want to be strong, like you.

55
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,420
You're an annoying guy...

56
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,660
A no is a no.

57
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,600
Oh, come on. Just a little.
Please, master!

58
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,400
Please!

59
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,100
Hey, wait a sec!

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,140
What was that guy?

61
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,580
C-Come on, just a little bit.
Think of it as helping me.

62
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,520
You got a little bit
of mercy in ya, right?

63
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,790
I'm out of that right now.

64
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,270
Come on, please, it's not
like you're losing anything.

65
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,760
Quit it already?!

66
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,340
Venus has a lot of helium
in the atmosphere.

67
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,400
You can fix it quickly
with some medicine.

68
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,950
Come on, that's not fair! Man!

69
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,080
You're the one that...

70
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,450
That was just a throat drop.

71
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,620
You!

72
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,490
Oh! Hands-on training?

73
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,700
You're...

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm Roco Bonnaro.
Nice meeting you, master!

75
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,440
Our first income in a while.

76
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,970
I'll feed you something good.

77
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,140
This is all thanks to the mastermind.

78
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,170
And next up...

79
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm telling you to not tense up!

80
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,430
But you can't defeat enemies that way.

81
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,960
The flow is more important...
not power.

82
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,800
You have to be like the water.

83
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,640
You get it?

84
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,970
Not one bit.

85
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,480
That's what I thought.

86
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,480
All right, come after me with a knife.

87
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,480
You'll get hurt.

88
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,450
Just do it.

89
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,540
All right, here I come!

90
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,060
What's going on?

91
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm not tensing up anywhere.

92
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm just using your excessive force.

93
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,470
I control the flow of power...

94
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
...and to do that,
I have to relax the whole body...

95
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,370
...to be able to
react to any movement.

96
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,740
Yeah...

97
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,040
I become like water.

98
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,740
Water?

99
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,080
Yeah.

100
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,410
Water can take any form.

101
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,360
It can flow along slowly or
beat down aggressively, right?

102
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,030
I dunno if I get it or not...

103
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,790
You should take care of your elders!

104
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,530
Here, hold this!

105
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,200
Tonight... No, tomorrow night.

106
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,760
At the cathedral on the
outskirts of this town!

107
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, wait!!

108
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,270
There he is! Don't let him get away!

109
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
Casino?

110
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,820
The ones around here are
famous for being stingy...

111
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,410
Don't worry about it.
It's not our money.

112
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,260
On top of it, she takes off like a bullet
and we don't know when she gets back.

113
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,260
Hey, no use wasting time.
How about making some pocket cash?

114
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,270
Piccaro Calvino.

115
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,040
Usually a stingy little thief,
but went in big this time.

116
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,940
Price is doubled if
we get the whole crew.

117
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,870
And this is the stolen goods.

118
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,350
It makes the remedy for Venus-sickness,
but apparently it's...

119
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,120
...hard to grow them and
they're worth tens of millions.

120
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,550
Sorry!

121
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,960
Shit, where did he go?

122
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,630
Shit, he's sure good at running.

123
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,650
I say we take it. I mean, it's worth
much more than nabbing that group.

124
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,590
No, we can't!

125
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,350
Hey, you thought for a moment!

126
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,190
Idiot! It's better to not be involved
with dangerous stuff like this!

127
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,560
It's okay if they
don't find out, right?

128
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
So, how much did you lose at the casino?

129
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,260
What?

130
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,840
I'll leave Piccaro up to you.
I'm going after Roco.

131
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,770
Why don't you wait?
You're gonna see him anyway.

132
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,740
They say that Lady Bounty
only has bangs.

133
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,810
You mean Lady Luck.

134
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,410
<i>Remains of a shuttle?</i>
<i>Why in such a place?</i>

135
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,650
Dunno...

136
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,130
<i>There might be some weirdos that do</i>
<i>live out in the desert, but still...</i>

137
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,920
Don't move!

138
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,230
Don't move!
Both hands up!

139
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm nobody suspicious...

140
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,900
That makes me sound even
more suspicious, doesn't it?

141
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,240
Who are you? Why are you here?

142
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,240
Answer me!

143
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,140
Let go.

144
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,710
I just came here to see Roco...

145
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,550
You're... Roco's friend?

146
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,950
Huh? Um, no...

147
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm glad...

148
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, make sure you wash your hands.

149
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,370
We can't find him, Boss.

150
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,810
H-Hi...

151
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,050
You know, it's all because
of those floating plants.

152
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Sometimes they send spores
that look like snow.

153
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,620
Most people are fine, but my
body isn't... and my eyes...

154
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,330
Isn't it inconvenient?

155
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,490
No. It's not a big deal once
you get used to it.

156
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,100
Besides...

157
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,090
Sometimes you understand
more when you can't see.

158
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,410
You'll get better, right?

159
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,310
If I put money into it...

160
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,040
I don't mind staying as is...
but Roco...

161
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,380
He cares about his little sister.

162
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,820
Roco sent me this yesterday.

163
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,490
Everyone says bad things about him...

164
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,800
And he seems to hang out
with some bad people...

165
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,600
But Roco is a good person.

166
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,540
I might be one of those bad
people he hangs out with.

167
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,840
Maybe. Maybe you are.

168
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,850
But you're different.

169
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,710
I can tell.

170
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,280
Both you and Roco have
something beautiful deep in you.

171
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,380
It's hard to tell, but it's there.

172
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,480
I can see it. That's why
I'm offering you tea like this.

173
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,600
Something beautiful, huh?

174
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,510
I probably lost that long, long ago...

175
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,760
I want to see Piccaro.
Tell me where he is.

176
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,500
What? I don't know who that is.

177
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,010
Can you remember?

178
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,340
I-I remember now!

179
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,240
What did you just say?

180
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,950
The price of a gray ash seed?

181
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,390
I'm just asking.

182
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,480
Don't be a fool.
Those things are like gems.

183
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,150
You're lucky if you ever see one...

184
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,300
Well, it might be difficult to
sell them once you get them...

185
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,500
...but I would say 8 million each.

186
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,800
You got some?!

187
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,670
No...

188
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,400
Thought not...

189
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,060
How about Piccaro?

190
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh, just a little more.

191
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,570
Don't screw up on your end.

192
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,690
So, little Roco.

193
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,780
You can be nice and tell
us where the pot is.

194
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,290
If you don't want to tell us...

195
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,390
Sorry. I dropped it.

196
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,990
That ain't gonna work, is it?

197
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,910
My little Roco.

198
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,580
I've heard that you
have a little sister.

199
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,350
She has nothing to do with this!

200
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,250
Oh, really? Then where is it?

201
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,850
I-It's...

202
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,160
I want to see Piccaro.
Tell me where he is.

203
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,170
H-Hyu don'f haff to be so suhhen...

204
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,070
Huh? Where did you say?

205
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,970
I can'f breef...

206
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,100
Yo.

207
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,660
O-Oh, you're here.

208
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,370
And I brought it, like you told me to.

209
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,900
Sorry, but I snuck a peek inside.

210
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,410
You know what it is?

211
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,140
Grey ash. Something
spectacular unlike its name.

212
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,850
I mean, it's 10 times the
bounty placed on all of you.

213
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,420
You're a bounty hunter, aren't you?

214
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,390
Are you here to nab me?

215
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,100
Stella needs this, right?

216
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,600
Run, or you'll be killed!

217
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,910
What is this?! I was just
sent on some wild goose chase!

218
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,470
Jet! Are you listening?!

219
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,150
S-Stop, please...

220
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,050
The grey ash is back.

221
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,030
Come on, let him go. I'm asking ya.

222
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,230
Sorry to make you deliver
it all the way here.

223
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,000
I give my thanks.

224
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,540
You!

225
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,840
Get rid of him. Quickly!

226
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,650
<i>Piccaro Calvino!</i>

227
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,020
Stay still!

228
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,630
Can't she be a little more elegant?!

229
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,640
Don't kill them!
Ya trying to kill our bounty?!

230
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,870
Bounty hunters?
Get that thing back, now!

231
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,910
Roco!

232
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,100
Roco!

233
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,380
Shit! Idiots!

234
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,910
<i>Really, you've caused</i>
<i>me enough trouble.</i>

235
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,790
Come on, hang on! You alive?!

236
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,850
HEY!

237
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,090
Master... did you...
see that right... now?

238
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,330
Yeah. Don't speak anymore.
I'll call a doctor right now.

239
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,930
Hey!

240
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,460
I have... a favor...

241
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,840
In... the music... box...

242
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,370
I know. Leave Stella to me.

243
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,640
I trust you...

244
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,210
All right, hold on.
Now, don't die. Don't die!

245
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,660
Hey... if I knew you... earlier...

246
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,650
Would we... have been... friends?

247
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,050
Come in.

248
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,550
Roco?

249
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,560
It's you, Roco?

250
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,020
I'm taking his place.

251
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,020
You'll do. You know what?

252
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,550
Roco got me some grey ash!

253
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,890
And the operation fees!

254
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,900
They told me my eyes will be better!

255
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,900
Isn't it wonderful? What should I do?

256
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,200
I want to see Roco first.

257
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,300
So, tell him to come here right now!
To hurry over here!

258
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
Did he... get caught?

259
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,580
No...

260
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,950
Then why isn't Roco coming?

261
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,360
He's dead, isn't he?

262
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,970
I see...

263
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Stella.

264
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,730
It's all right... Leave me.

265
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,110
I know.

266
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,980
Roco died because he
did something bad, right?

267
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,380
Please, leave me for today...

268
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,350
I...

269
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,760
I never got to see
Roco once with my own eyes...

270
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,060
Hey, what was Roco really like?

271
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,300
You know without looking, right?

272
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,270
He was a great guy.

273
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,700
Just like the one you knew...

274
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,390
COMING EPISODE

275
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,380

276
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,950
Wait, who are you?

277
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,790
Um... Let me introduce myself.

278
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,490
Edward Wong Hau Pepelu
Tivrusky the fourth!

279
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,160
That's a long name...

280
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,170
Who the hell is this?

281
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,660
I made that name up myself!
Isn't it cool?

282
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,240
First of all, what do
you mean "the fourth"?

283
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,730
Next Episode: Jamming with Edward!

284
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,870

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,380
JAMMING WITH EDWARD
