1
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,110
Welcome back.
And how was it?

2
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,250
- Oh, they were just thugs!
- Nothing to do with the syndicate...

3
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,280
- Dammit, was just a salaried employee...
- ...they just wanted money to play with.

4
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,350
- ...that gave into his temptations.
- They went to the cops penniless!

5
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,860
Then, what?

6
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,330
All of you caught the criminals, but no
clue about the bounty we're really after?

7
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,090
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY

8
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,780
They still use paper just
for all the complaints.

9
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,790
Dammit, they're just harassing us.

10
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,310
AND, it's a waste
of valuable resources!

11
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,260
The e-mail server is going down
from the sheer number of complaints.

12
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,270
There is a movement out there
to sue our company for damages...

13
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,270
What the hell are
the bounty-hunters doing?!

14
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,290
We already have a huge bounty on him!

15
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,530
Yes, however...

16
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,000
<i>Amigo!</i>

17
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,840
<i>All you bounty-hunters in the</i>
<i>Sol system, how are y'all doing?</i>

18
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,110
<i>Once again, it's time for BIG SHOT!</i>

19
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,350
<i>We'll start with today's hot news!</i>

20
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,620
<i>They apprehended the culprit in</i>
<i>the series of recent Gate assaults!</i>

21
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,850
<i>Really? The bounty on him was</i>
<i>12 million Woolongs, right?</i>

22
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,890
<i>But the weird thing is that</i>
<i>20 culprits were apprehended!</i>

23
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,300
<i>What do you mean?</i>

24
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,960
<i>Apparently, they were all caught in</i>
<i>the act, but none were the mastermind.</i>

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,560
<i>Then you don't get the reward</i>
<i>unless you find that mastermind?</i>

26
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,870
<i>But of course!</i>

27
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,900
<i>Oh my...</i>

28
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,380
<i>I feel sorry for all the guys</i>
<i>who caught the culprits!</i>

29
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,940
Why the hell do these
thugs that normally just...

30
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,320
...rob convenience stores
attack at the Gates?

31
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,080
Maybe there are fads in crimes?

32
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,650
Like "Hyperspace Gates are the IN thing
among today's fashion-conscious kids!"

33
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,820
Like "Hyperspace Gates are the IN thing
among today's fashion-conscious kids!"

34
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,030
"...you assault at least
one Gate!" or something?

35
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,770
Hey, guys.

36
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,710
Why don't we trade the
information that we each have?

37
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,610
And split the bounty three ways...

38
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
What do you mean?

39
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,710
You're the one that
started all this, saying...

40
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,240
...that we should research
this case on our own.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,020
You also said that the occasional rivalry
between comrades would be good for us.

42
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,720
Come on, did the reward amount
make you lose your memory?

43
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,220
What? You guys were really
keen on the idea, too!

44
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,900
After all, we all wanted the
bounty to ourselves, right?

45
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,750
<i>In this case, all 20 cases</i>
<i>were done the same way,</i>

46
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,300
<i>All of them infiltrated</i>
<i>the tollbooth...</i>

47
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,470
<i>...deftly attached the hacking unit...</i>

48
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,030
<i>...and in the exact</i>
<i>moment that passing ships...</i>

49
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,100
<i>...access the tollbooth</i>
<i>to pay the toll...</i>

50
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,980
<i>...they steal the entire</i>
<i>balance from the credit card.</i>

51
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,110
<i>Furthermore, the unit automatically,</i>
<i>sent the money data that it just stole.</i>

52
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
<i>It immediately launders all</i>
<i>the funds in a bank on Europa...</i>

53
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,090
<i>...making it impossible</i>
<i>to track where it went.</i>

54
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,790
<i>All the culprits that were caught</i>
<i>in the act have nothing in common.</i>

55
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,530
<i>Age, gender, nationality,</i>
<i>religion, criminal record...</i>

56
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,700
And on top of it, nobody has any of
the money that they supposedly stole.

57
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,640
Well, that's about all I know.

58
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,770
How about you?

59
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,410
The guy that I nabbed said that
he was just following the...

60
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,890
...instructions from a manual
that he got through mail-order.

61
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,820
Perhaps the other culprits are
reading the same manual that he was?

62
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,190
Manual?

63
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,650
This.

64
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,830
"A new criminal support software."

65
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,270
"Right now, it's a real bargain.
For the low introductory..."

66
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,970
"...price of 30000 Woolongs,
you too can be rich!"

67
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,200
What the hell?

68
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,970
It's not easy to be a thief nowadays.

69
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,880
I'm sure there are people
who want manuals to help them.

70
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,780
And where is this mail-order company?

71
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,080
It's a store that's only on the
'net, so I don't know where it was.

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,020
Besides, the store has already closed.

73
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,150
Spike, how about you?

74
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,920
The hacking unit that was placed
on the Gates was something that...

75
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,520
...couldn't be made unless you knew
about the Gate system really well.

76
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,030
The mastermind's likely someone who has
some connection to the Gate Corporation.

77
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,800
That was my hunch, and
I investigated that front...

78
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,110
The programmers would be fishy.

79
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,310
...but the guys from the Gate Corporation
suddenly became uncooperative.

80
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,310
It was as if they knew something, but
didn't want us to find out about it.

81
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,860
Are you dead?

82
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,340
Where were we?

83
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,190
Well, I guess those are the
only clues we have for now...

84
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,950
Gimme that.

85
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,390
Gimme.

86
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,860
Yeah.

87
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,560
This is a memory cartridge for
playing chess over the 'net.

88
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,900
This piece has one match in its memory.

89
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,200
And, when you push it,
it connects to the 'net.

90
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,370
See?

91
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,870
And this has something to
do with this incident?

92
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,510
Nothing at all.

93
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,220
Maybe all of this is a game...

94
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,150
For now, continue playing
that game with the opponent.

95
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,880
Yup.

96
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,290
I'll go talk to the Gate
Corporation guys once more.

97
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,820
Lesse...

98
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,790
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe...

99
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Play ball!

100
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,450
Another bounty hunter?
I don't care, send him back.

101
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,480
But he's asking about
a chess-loving programmer...

102
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,500
What?!

103
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,490
Jet!

104
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,960
What, Jonathan, were
you another one that...

105
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,910
...went through all the
trouble to get nothing?

106
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,910
This thing isn't that easy.

107
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,320
I believe we have given
out all the information.

108
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,120
What more are you saying
you would like to know?

109
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,990
Sorry, but there is no smoking
allowed in this building.

110
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,090
Oops. I'm so sorry...

111
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,090
Actually I had something
that I wanted you to see...

112
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,600
What is it?

113
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,110
This is a planned game.

114
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,510
You guys at the Gate Corporation
should know what this means.

115
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,080
I mean, to put a bounty on a mastermind
that we aren't even sure exists...

116
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,820
...suggests that it's someone you don't
want the police to know about, no?

117
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,700
Bounty-hunters should just
look for their bounties.

118
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,030
I don't know who you are, and
whether or not you used to work for...

119
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,370
...the ISSP, but it's better for
you to not make any extra inquiries.

120
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,300
He's going home.

121
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,810
Make sure he is kindly
escorted out of here.

122
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,510
Damn this old piece of shit!

123
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,950
<i>I believe our risk is too great.</i>

124
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,520
<i>If that gets out to</i>
<i>the general public...</i>

125
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,890
<i>I am fully aware of our risk.</i>

126
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,020
<i>If we don't catch him,</i>
<i>the situation will just get worse.</i>

127
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,730
<i>But why is a ghost from</i>
<i>50 years ago coming back now...?</i>

128
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,790
<i>To think that he gave</i>
<i>everyone a chess piece...</i>

129
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,670
<i>Chessmaster Hex...</i>

130
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,870
<i>So it IS a game that he set up...</i>

131
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,570
Chessmaster Hex...

132
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,450
No good. This doesn't have anything
other than chess data in it.

133
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,940
I wonder what they were going
to do with such a thing...

134
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
If there is no meaning to the content,
maybe the pieces are the message...

135
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,990
Great, great!

136
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,470
<i>Spike, I have a name...</i>
<i>Can you investigate the guy?</i>

137
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,770
<i>He might be the mastermind</i>
<i>behind this whole thing.</i>

138
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,570
Hey, Ed.

139
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,010
Ed's really busy right now.

140
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,090
Here, here!

141
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,780
Checkmate!

142
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,060
...or so you thought!

143
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,500
I'll fork the king and the rook!

144
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,700
Indeed! This is either
an idiot or a genius!

145
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,730
I like this chap!

146
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,980
Chessmaster Hex. Estimated
to be 98 years old.

147
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,720
A programmer that had been
dubbed a genius from his teens.

148
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,160
In the Cosmo-net chess tournaments, he
dominated the champion's seat for decades.

149
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,360
He began work on the Hyperspace Gate
control program when he was 30...

150
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,840
...and created the central control
system that all Gates use to this day.

151
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,170
However, that was his fatal error.

152
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,700
He started to doubt the safety
of the Gates he helped create...

153
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,910
...and was against putting
them to practical use.

154
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,310
As a result, he was banned
from the Gate Corporation.

155
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,940
Ever since, his whereabouts
have been unknown for 50 years...

156
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,780
So he's the mastermind behind
our current string of crimes...

157
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,080
What do you mean?

158
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,450
I mean, why is he seeking revenge
50 years after the fact?

159
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,260
If we figure out where he is,
we'll know for sure.

160
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,090
Hey, Ed.

161
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,960
Ed's really busy right now.

162
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,190
Hey, you, quit playing games
so much and help out a little...

163
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,670
Ed, we want to figure out
where a guy named Hex is...

164
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,140
Hex... Hex... The Chessmaster?!

165
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,650
That's who I'm playing
chess against right now!

166
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,050
We're almost at the location we got from
the trace we did on Ed's chess opponent.

167
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,220
You guys standing by?

168
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,230
I really don't like this.

169
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,070
I mean, he's basically giving
us his exact location...

170
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,800
Can we even trust that
trace in the first place?

171
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,070
- Ya think he'd be in a dump like this?
- No, I think it was... that.

172
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,140
<i>I had heard once that there was a place</i>
<i>where all the scrapped remains of...</i>

173
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,620
<i>...obsolete Gates were gathered along with</i>
<i>scrap metal and abandoned spaceships...</i>

174
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,090
<i>...and that there were people</i>
<i>that started living there.</i>

175
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,290
<i>Why the hell do they want</i>
<i>to live here of all places?</i>

176
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,230
<i>That area has no nationality,</i>
<i>nor a government.</i>

177
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,000
<i>You don't have to pay taxes,</i>
<i>and there are no cops.</i>

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,030
<i>I see... It's the perfect</i>
<i>place to hide yourself.</i>

179
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,950
<i>It might be a trap...</i>

180
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,150
<i>This might be the</i>
<i>continuation of the game.</i>

181
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,150
Whatever happens, happens.

182
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,340
Looks like we have air.

183
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,940
<i>Then there is someone here...</i>

184
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,880
<i>Yo, Jet.</i>

185
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,040
Jonathan!

186
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,680
How the hell did you get here?

187
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,920
<i>Thanks for leading the way</i>

188
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,390
You... were following
us the whole time?

189
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,860
<i>Tough luck for you, but I have</i>
<i>important business with that guy,</i>

190
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,900
<i>So I'll be going ahead.</i>

191
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,000
What the?

192
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,510
What?

193
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,160
How the hell?

194
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,830
What is this?

195
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,600
What is this?

196
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,820
Hi!

197
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,790
Peace to the world...

198
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,890
...and love to my bank account!

199
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,790
You want one?

200
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,070
Wow! Amazing!

201
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,270
Chessmaster Hex?

202
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,290
All right, give up!

203
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,590
You guys...

204
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,020
Can you be a little quieter?

205
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,030
Old man!

206
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,990
Don't joke with me!

207
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,260
Hey, wait a minute.

208
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,670
You won't get away with
pretending to be senile!

209
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,470
Who are YOU?

210
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,470
If you don't hand over
the money you stole...

211
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,140
...you'll get a nice
hole in your brain!

212
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,940
That's a big tube you got there...

213
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,280
Hey, whatcha doin', Hex?

214
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,010
You gotta hear this. It's my first
formidable opponent in quite a while!

215
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,390
Must be some player if
you have trouble winning!

216
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,650
But before that, where's lunch?

217
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,220
What are ya saying?
You just ate lunch a while back!

218
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,630
Oh, is that so?

219
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,460
- Really, you've lost so much of yer mind...
- Who are these guys?

220
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,630
- ...that all you can do is play chess!
- Dunno. But you know, this old fogey...

221
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,400
- Have ya lost it?
- Like you can speak... You...

222
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,040
To... To think my life savings
are never coming back...

223
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,300
Damn... Goddammit...

224
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,370
Anyone and everyone, you and
that guy over there...

225
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,040
The world is all a mistake!

226
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,700
What are we gonna do?
This old man doesn't seem to...

227
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,400
...remember anything about
yesterday, let alone 50 years ago!

228
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,930
That's right.

229
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,700
Hex is no longer here.

230
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,670
Here we merely have an
old man that loves games...

231
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,040
Back then, Hex was riled up for
revenge, and planned this all out.

232
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,020
He made it so that this incident
would happen 50 years later...

233
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,690
...during the one moment that the Gate
program gets automatically updated.

234
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,290
Even making those that
physically commit the crime...

235
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,630
...hold chess pieces to hint
that it was his doing.

236
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,670
However, to that old-timer,
50 years was too long.

237
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,800
He went senile,
and had completely forgotten...

238
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,010
...about the traps that
he himself had set.

239
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,510
Well, it works out better
for you this way.

240
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,450
Because now you don't
have to worry about...

241
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,110
...the fundamental defect
in the Gates leaking out.

242
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Although, the price you paid was
that WE learned about that defect.

243
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,250
What do you want? Money?

244
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,230
Or... are you planning to leak
this information to the press?

245
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,270
Just leave that old guy alone.

246
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,830
That's all I want.

247
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,580
It's a good deal, isn't it?

248
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,750
Ed would get lonely if she
lost her chess partner...

249
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,120
You're playing that thing again?

250
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,790
Not again. Still.

251
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,730
Still?

252
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,700
You've been playing that
thing this whole WEEK?!

253
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,170
Yeah.

254
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,690
I see.

255
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,470
Well, good luck.

256
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,600
Yo, newcomer. You seem happy today.

257
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,740
Hi!

258
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,110
He's a really easygoing
fellow, isn't he?

259
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,710
That he is...

260
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,210
Checkmate.

261
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,390
I lost...

262
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,290
COMING EPISODE

263
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,690
Love... It is to believe everything.

264
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,960
Hey now, are you serious?

265
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,120
Love... It is the heart
that provides for all.

266
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,890
Come on... was that what
the story was about?

267
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,160
Love... It is the heart
that accepts everything.

268
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,570
You know, this is getting fishy.

269
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,370
Whitney... You loved me that much...

270
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,840
You really can't trust
the previews on this show.

271
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,670
A romantic love story
for all you lovers.

272
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,240
Next episode: My Funny Valentine.

273
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,010
I'm sure it's a lie.

274
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,850
Yeah, a lie. A lie.

275
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,280
MY FUNNY VALENTINE
