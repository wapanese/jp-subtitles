1
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,490
<i>The elders are going to be on the move.</i>

2
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,190
<i>It is dangerous over there as well.</i>

3
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,700
<i>Please hurry.</i>

4
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,430
THE REAL FOLK BLUES(PART I)

5
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,050
What a foolish act you have done.

6
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,960
The fortuneteller told us thus.

7
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,000
"The night of the red moon,
the snake will slither..."

8
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,300
"...horribly quickly to make
use of its venomous fangs."

9
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,170
You look so pitiful, Vicious.

10
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,010
We have informed you of our decision
that you cannot be our successor.

11
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,240
The syndicate does not need
corpses who cannot even fight.

12
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,750
That arrogance of yours will
ruin everything in the end.

13
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,860
Take him to the punishment chamber.

14
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,290
Kill me.

15
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,560
Right now.

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,460
You cannot choose how you will die.

17
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,440
After we let you have a good
taste of humiliation...

18
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,480
...we will send you
into the underworld.

19
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,710
Don't forget...

20
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,890
...a snake's venom poisons
slowly after the bite.

21
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,400
Sheesh, that was the first
time we screwed up so badly.

22
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,710
We never had anything
like that before...

23
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,140
...when we were all alone.

24
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,380
All told, they screwed up
our plans right to the end.

25
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,420
They really were like
troublesome babies.

26
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,890
I completely understand why
you hate women and kids now.

27
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,480
Too much vermouth.

28
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,050
Who are they?

29
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,230
Lin?!

30
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,970
I'm Shin, his younger brother.

31
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,670
Shin...

32
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,940
That's right, you two were...

33
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,210
If you change sides, you won't be
able to return to the syndicate.

34
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,720
What happened?

35
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,650
Vicious is to be executed.

36
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,320
He failed to pull off the coup, and has
been put under restraints by the elders.

37
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,990
You are in danger as well.

38
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,900
And Miss Julia...

39
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,390
Julia is?

40
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,740
They're in the city of Tharsis.

41
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,270
I'll hold them off here.

42
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,070
Please go!

43
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,670
I'll owe you one, Shin!

44
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,130
I don't know what
happened to Red Dragon...

45
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,000
...but it's not really
your problem now, right?

46
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,300
Vicious, Julia...

47
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,670
To me, both those names
sound nothing but ominous.

48
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,980
Just like a magic spell that opens
a door that shouldn't be opened.

49
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,420
You're...

50
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,160
Hold still.

51
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,360
You are no longer a member
of the syndicate...

52
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,660
I know.

53
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,330
You, too...

54
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,900
Forget everything, including
the fact that we came here.

55
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,500
What are you talking about?

56
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm just treating stray cats
that wandered into the office.

57
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,680
Stray cats that I can't
ever get rid of...

58
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,610
When this is over,
I'm leaving the syndicate.

59
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,070
You'll be killed.

60
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,910
I'll let them say I'm dead.

61
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll be waiting at the graveyard.
Of course, I will be alive.

62
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,160
I... can't come with you.

63
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,630
Come with me.

64
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,070
We'll leave here...
We'll escape from this world.

65
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,270
And then what are we going to do?

66
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,300
We'll just live a life
of freedom somewhere.

67
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,970
Just like watching a dream...

68
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,420
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

69
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,760
Are you going to leave this world?

70
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,630
Vicious.

71
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,400
Even if it's a dream,
that's an impossibility.

72
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,670
Are you going to kill him?

73
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,640
Yeah...

74
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,970
...with your hands.

75
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,250
You stay alive...

76
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,550
...or you both die.

77
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,750
You can choose.

78
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,490
So there is no place for me after all.

79
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,690
I won't go no matter who
comes to pick me up. Never.

80
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,360
I don't want to live a life
where I'm always in someone's way.

81
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,170
Mom! I've been looking for you!

82
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,680
A-Alfred...

83
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,110
I told you to wait in front
of the curry restaurant!

84
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,510
Sorry.

85
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,020
It's all right. I'm glad you came.

86
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,220
It sounds too good to be true that
you can take care of me now.

87
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,690
Mom, I want to live with you.

88
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,160
You found a job?

89
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,530
Don't worry about that.

90
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,360
What about your female co-host?

91
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,870
I heard she's getting married.

92
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,340
Something about this...

93
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,330
<i>Where are you now?</i>

94
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
What is it?

95
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,330
<i>I'm heading out to the city of Tharsis.</i>

96
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,700
<i>You should head that way, too.</i>

97
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,070
Why?

98
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>It's hard for Jet to</i>
<i>get around on his own.</i>

99
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,060
<i>Especially after getting</i>
<i>shot in the leg.</i>

100
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,270
<i>I'm telling ya to stop wandering</i>
<i>around so much, and just come back.</i>

101
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,480
Don't just assume that I'm coming back!

102
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,040
You've got to be kidding!

103
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,010
I have a place to go back to!

104
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,720
What's with that attitude?
Like he's all high-and-mighty.

105
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,280
What does he mean, Jet's by himself?
HE's there... Ed and Ein, too...

106
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,190
You saved me.

107
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,520
Same here.

108
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,390
You're a good shot.

109
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,360
I was getting bounties with it.

110
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,860
A bounty hunter?

111
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,530
Although now...

112
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,370
...I'm kind of on a break 'cause
there's something going on.

113
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,340
You look like you have
something going on, too.

114
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,370
It might be good to pair up
with another woman.

115
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,810
How about it?
Wanna be my partner?

116
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,820
I have... something to do.

117
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,010
Oh.

118
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,490
Too bad.

119
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,450
Do you know any bounty hunter hangouts?

120
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,690
I can help if you want
to put a bounty on someone.

121
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,490
I'm looking for a bounty hunter.

122
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,100
I'll drive you back.

123
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,210
What's your name?

124
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,580
Faye...

125
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,480
Faye?!

126
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,280
Faye Valentine.

127
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,410
A common name.

128
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,750
What's yours?

129
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,210
Julia.

130
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,480
Julia?!

131
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,190
It's a common name.

132
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,670
I'm glad I met you.

133
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,000
Me, too.

134
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,600
Um, have I seen you somewhere?

135
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,380
If... you see Spike again...

136
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,950
Tell him that I will be waiting there.

137
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,210
He'll know what I mean.

138
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,290
Tell him that I'll keep waiting...

139
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,090
Why?

140
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,990
Good-bye, Faye Valentine.

141
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,600
Why?

142
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,200
Why do you know?!

143
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,730
Does it still hurt?

144
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,200
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

145
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,610
A man injured his leg during a hunt.

146
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,740
In the middle of the savanna...

147
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,650
...with no means to treat the wound,
the leg rots, and death approaches.

148
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,180
The man got onto the airplane
that finally arrived...

149
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,620
...and there he sees a land
of pure white below him.

150
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,530
The place glistening in the light was
the summit of a snow-covered mountain.

151
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,660
The name of the mountain
was Kilimanjaro.

152
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,360
The man thinks...

153
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,630
...that was where he was headed...

154
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,040
...and?

155
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,080
I hate this story.

156
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,810
Men only think about the past...

157
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,720
...right before their death,
as if they were...

158
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,650
...searching frantically for
proof that they were alive.

159
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,280
Turn back.

160
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,460
You told me when we first met...

161
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,300
...that you were a man who
had already died once.

162
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,270
Just forget the past, okay?

163
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,470
There was a woman.

164
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,070
For the first time in my life...

165
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,480
...I saw a woman that was truly alive.

166
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,740
That's what I believed.

167
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,220
She was a piece of me I had lost.

168
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,550
She is my other half
that I had longed for.

169
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,090
- She's back.
- Hm? Who?

170
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh, man...

171
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,000
We're not a repair shop.

172
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,940
Don't come back just when
you broke something...

173
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,480
Where is he?

174
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,680
He?

175
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,770
The one with the fluffy hair.

176
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,880
What, can't you just say
you're looking for Spike?

177
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,050
Where is he?

178
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,950
He's in the workshop.

179
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,860
What are you trying to hide?

180
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,920
You came back here just to see Spike?

181
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,990
I was asked to relay a message...

182
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,790
...from Julia.

183
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,030
Hey, wait!!

184
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,970
<i>Jet, it's me.</i>

185
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,140
What, I don't have any information now.
We're not really able to...

186
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,770
<i>I'm glad you're all right.</i>

187
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,980
<i>I was worried. It's getting</i>
<i>to be pretty bad, you know...</i>

188
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,350
About Red Dragon?

189
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,440
<i>Yeah...</i>

190
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,820
<i>There was apparently,</i>
<i>a coup two days ago...</i>

191
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,250
<i>...concerning who was going to be</i>
<i>the syndicate's successor.</i>

192
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,190
<i>In the end the elders won,</i>
<i>and they're now out...</i>

193
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,660
<i>...to annihilate anyone who</i>
<i>was involved in the coup.</i>

194
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,530
<i>Your partner will also...</i>

195
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,330
Been there.

196
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,060
But why are they trying to get rid of
those that already left the syndicate?

197
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,930
<i>Anything against them will be</i>
<i>annihilated, down to the very last seed.</i>

198
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,270
<i>That's how they do it.</i>

199
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,370
That's the worst logic I've ever heard.

200
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,310
<i>Just run.</i>

201
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,140
<i>The police can't handle all of it.</i>

202
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,550
<i>Leave Mars.</i>

203
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,450
Too late for that.

204
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,500
You have something?

205
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,470
You look like you
have some information.

206
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,810
How much will you pay for it?

207
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,150
I don't have any money.

208
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,160
You sure came back at the worst time...

209
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,130
Weren't you the one who called me here?

210
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,670
Or... maybe they followed you here?

211
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Oh, well. It was gonna
happen sooner or later.

212
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,170
Wait!

213
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,640
Wait a minute!

214
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,280
I don't have any money.

215
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,880
She said she'll be waiting there.

216
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,250
She said you'd understand.

217
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,780
I don't get it.

218
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,060
It was from a woman named Julia.

219
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,970
Someone was after her...

220
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,730
They were chasing her...

221
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,710
Jet, I can go at any time.

222
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,510
You who caused a disturbance
in our clan's affairs.

223
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,750
By the will of the clan,
you shall be executed.

224
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,830
Let me out, too!

225
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,130
Wait!

226
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,960
Your right thruster isn't working yet!

227
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,640
The end is the same if
we go down ship and all!

228
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,640
Will you leave words?

229
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,130
Or leave something material?

230
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,640
Nothing.

231
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,700
You shall shed red tears.

232
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,120
<i>Spike, can you still fly?</i>

233
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,630
Don't worry about us. Just go!

234
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,190
Go grasp that thing you had lost.

235
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,660
<i>GO!</i>

236
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,540
As of now, the leadership
has changed hands.

237
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,750
From now on, I will dictate all authority
and symbolism of this syndicate.

238
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,460
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

239
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,970
COMING EPISODE

240
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,680
It sure was long...

241
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,690
- The past is the past...
- No use doing this...

242
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,190
- ...and the future is the future.
- So how was it, Jet?

243
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,100
- A man is a man, and a woman is a woman.
- Because of you, I ended up raising Ein.

244
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,570
- I am who I am, and you are who you are.
- Dogs are really cute after all...

245
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,770
- Like it really matters any...
- Hey, Jet. Come on, you aren't...

246
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,760
- I wonder why we gave him away...
- ...listening to what I'm saying at all!

247
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,040
- Oh... What was it?
- Never mind.

248
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,050
Anyway... Next episode:
The Real Folk Blues Part 2.

249
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,740
We'll see you again, somewhere.

250
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,980
THE REAL FOLK BLUES(PART II)

251
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,250
What? This is the end?
