00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,300
Hello, gentlemen.

2
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,410
I have come to take your lives.

3
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,690
PIERROT LE FOU

4
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,580
Hello, boy.

5
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,560
Your partner sure is unlucky, Jet.

6
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,020
Well, he wasn't all that
lucky to begin with...

7
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,790
This case is especially bad.

8
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,730
It would be better to not get
yourselves involved in this one.

9
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,130
I don't care, just answer me. Now.

10
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,130
I'm telling you this
for your own sake, and...

11
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,610
...if you get too involved in this,
I'm gonna get in trouble, too.

12
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,250
You know, Bob...

13
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,010
You're the only person
I can rely on right now.

14
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,750
I'll make sure it won't
be bad for you. So...

15
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,950
Don't you say that every time?

16
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,890
Really... you always have been a guy
that likes to get into trouble...

17
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,860
All right, this is only a rumor, but...

18
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,300
Have you heard of
the name "Mad Pierrot"?

19
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,810
There he is... the rumored mummy.

20
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,020
So, I heard you got beaten
up by some weird guy?

21
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,320
I recall you were sleeping
like this once before.

22
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,190
You really haven't shown
any improvement...

23
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,250
Oh well, it doesn't have
anything to do with me.

24
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,140
Don't you end up in situations
like that because you never behave?

25
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,370
Well, I have nothing to do with it.

26
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,940
So, since I have nothing to
do with it, if you'll excuse me...

27
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,140
Take care.

28
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,110
The victim was a high-ranking
guy from the ISSP.

29
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,950
He was the seventh victim.

30
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,050
What did you say?

31
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,990
Can't blame ya. This is top-secret.

32
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,690
Apparently those higher-ups don't
want the world to find out about this.

33
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,760
Why?

34
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,900
Your partner is in deep trouble.

35
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,670
The guy is a perfect killing machine.

36
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,140
They say that nobody who has seen
his face has made it out alive...

37
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,840
Even those lucky enough to escape'll be
tracked down to the ends of the world...

38
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,480
...and they always wind up dead.

39
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,620
They say he appears with a smile,
and he leaves with a smile...

40
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,140
Yeah, he is the mysterious
assassin known as Mad Pierrot...

41
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,620
Tongpu.

42
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,650
Faye-Faye!

43
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,790
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye!

44
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,960
Puff, puff! Faye-Faye...

45
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,340
Hey you, can you stop saying
my name twice like that?

46
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,030
Faye-Faye, a weird mail came, came.

47
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

48
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,180
...and I woulda been done if
I had a little more time...

49
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,310
I can't read it!

50
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,340
"Hello, boy. I'll invite
you to a wonderful party..."

51
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,080
Wait, this is...

52
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,020
Listen, keep the fact that this
mail came a secret from Spike.

53
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,430
Secret?

54
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,360
Why?

55
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,690
Why secret?

56
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,590
If we don't, that idiot...

57
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,000
...will run out to meet him?

58
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,370
It's a secret, secret mail!

59
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,680
Space Land?

60
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,980
Pretty considerate of him
to hold the party there.

61
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,740
You're gonna go like that?

62
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,610
Well, it would be perfect
if it was a masquerade.

63
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,020
Maybe this one really
will be the end of me...

64
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,750
Just kidding!

65
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,490
Would you come rescue
me if I said that?

66
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,700
Idiot.

67
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,630
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

68
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,780
<i>Hey...</i>

69
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>Oh, it's you, Ed. Where's Spike?</i>

70
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,020
<i>He went somewhere.</i>

71
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,210
What?

72
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,810
Not that this is anything new...
That idiot...

73
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,560
Idiot, idiot?

74
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,180
<i>Ed, I have a favor to ask.</i>

75
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,690
What, what?

76
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,000
Hello!

77
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,050
Welcome!

78
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,780
Yo...

79
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,180
Let's party!

80
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,980
<i>You can't enter here!</i>

81
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,990
<i>It's dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let's play outside!</i>

82
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,290
<i>It's dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let's play outside!</i>

83
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,160
Shut up!

84
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,680
<i>It's dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let's play outside!</i>

85
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,020
<i>It's dangerous in here!</i>

86
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,600
<i>It's dangerous in here!</i>
<i>Let's play outside!</i>

87
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,300
Hi!

88
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
<i>All right, Ed...</i>

89
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,750
<i>First, enter the ISSP's main</i>
<i>computer, and look for section 13.</i>

90
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,450
Aye, aye!

91
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,860
That's the section that doesn't
exist to the general public.

92
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,630
<i>It's a pretty tall order...</i>
<i>Can you do it?</i>

93
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,730
Yup!

94
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,860
Hello!

95
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,250
Found it!

96
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,350
<i>After you open it, find the</i>
<i>file with the code name "Tongpu."</i>

97
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,590
Yup!

98
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,540
Peek-a...

99
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,840
...BOO!

100
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,660
<i>ISSP Assassination Ability,</i>
<i>Improvement Experiment.</i>

101
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,790
<i>Experiment sample chart number 46.</i>

102
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,930
<i>Code name: Tongpu.</i>

103
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,200
<i>Confirmed a strong regression</i>
<i>of the mind during...</i>

104
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,400
<i>...the experiment.</i>
<i>Experiment was canceled.</i>

105
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,810
<i>Sample to be permanently kept</i>
<i>in a quarantine facility,</i>

106
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,080
In the beginning, he escaped
from the facilities to seek revenge...

107
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,050
...but now he seems to be enjoying
the actual act of killing.

108
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,050
His mind must be
continuing to regress.

109
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,780
So, he's like a child with
superhuman fighting abilities.

110
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,890
Really...

111
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,020
There is nothing as pure
and cruel as children.

112
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,860
It's show time!

113
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,170
That was unnecessary!

114
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,570
<i>Hello, hello...</i>

115
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,240
<i>Hello! Hello!</i>

116
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,570
Hello...

117
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,550
T-That hurts!

118
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,320
It hurts!

119
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,900
It hurts!!

120
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,440
It HURTS!!

121
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,670
Hurts...

122
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,610
Mommy, it hurts!

123
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,370
MOMMY!!

124
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,350
It hurts... Mommy!

125
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,590
<i>Spike! All right,</i>
<i>we figured out what he is! He's...</i>

126
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,420
No. I don't need it anymore...

127
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,320
It all ended just now...

128
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,320
COMING EPISODE

129
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,650
I knew there was something
fishy going on lately.

130
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,680
So, that's what it was!

131
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,020
What are you guys talking about?

132
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,210
You really can't judge
people by their looks...

133
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,020
Honestly disgusting.

134
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,720
Hey, hey, what are you
guys talking about?

135
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,060
I never thought it would
be a teenage girl...

136
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,860
It makes me despise him.

137
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,800
Who are you talking about?

138
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,830
Next episode: Boogie Woogie Feng Shui.

139
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,990
I didn't do anything!
