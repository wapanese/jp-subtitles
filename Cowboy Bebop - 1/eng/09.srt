1
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,730
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

2
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,790
<i>Always, alone.</i>

3
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,890
JAMMING WITH EDWARD

4
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,100
<i>38th district is sunny,</i>

5
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,440
<i>Slight rock showers.</i>

6
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,240
<i>Chance of rock showers today is 20%.</i>

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,620
<i>39th district is cloudy,</i>

8
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,090
<i>Chance of rock showers</i>
<i>this afternoon is 10%.</i>

9
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,870
Bebop, here, here! Welcome!

10
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>Chance of rock showers today is 90%...</i>

11
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,700
<i>Now, it's time for today's news topics.</i>

12
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>Today, we'll discuss the</i>
<i>mysterious land paintings...</i>

13
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,910
<i>...that suddenly appeared in</i>
<i>what was South America.</i>

14
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,400
<i>As usual, we have commentaries by a
</i><i>researcher of supernatural phenomena...</i>

15
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,210
<i>Me, Yuuri Kellerman.</i>

16
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,410
<i>Yuuri, about these land paintings...</i>

17
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:43,190
<i>Yes, yes. Well, I believe that it</i>
<i>was some sort of a message.</i>

18
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,100
<i>Um, who would it be from...?</i>
<i>Can it be...?</i>

19
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,860
<i>Aliens!</i>
<i>It has to be from aliens!</i>

20
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,130
<i>However, the land paintings were drawn</i>
<i>by lasers coming from satellites...</i>

21
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,410
<i>The police think it was a prank pulled</i>
<i>by a hacker who got into the satellite.</i>

22
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,510
<i>They already have a bounty of</i>
<i>8 million woolongs on the culprit...</i>

23
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,540
<i>Listen carefully, The bounty of 8 million</i>
<i>is a conspiracy of the government.</i>

24
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,610
<i>Even if it WAS drawn by a laser,</i>
<i>there IS the possibility...</i>

25
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,190
<i>...that aliens put a message</i>
<i>into the brain of that hacker.</i>

26
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>Once again, the government is</i>
<i>hiding something from us.</i>

27
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,770
<i>I see... A secret cult...</i>

28
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,290
<i>Yes! And THAT is the mystery that I
</i><i>have been searching for all this time!</i>

29
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,710
I'll pass on this one after all.

30
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,210
You're leaving me alone with her?

31
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,940
Nothing wrong with it.
She's gung-ho about it.

32
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm not the type to be
led around by women.

33
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,150
Then lead HER around.

34
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,380
I'm even less the type to do that.

35
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,850
It's easier to...

36
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,830
...divide 8 million
between two than three.

37
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,330
Here we go.

38
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,030
I'm appalled. You're afraid of hackers?

39
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,740
I just hate tedious work like that.

40
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,040
Guys cheap enough to hack into things
are depressed pale fatsos with glasses.

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,210
And I'm sure he's a demented
otaku with smelly feet.

42
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,610
Piece of cake!

43
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,340
Do you have something
against someone like that?

44
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,250
I mean, they might've all been
like that when you were young...

45
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,690
You're saying I look older than you?

46
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,590
You can't tell a woman's age
just by looking at her.

47
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,560
Exactly.

48
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,290
You can't tell just by looking
that I can do things like this...

49
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,990
That's ALL I know of you.

50
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,800
You guys make a good team.

51
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,670
Hurry up!

52
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,070
I'll be waiting for
a souvenir from Earth.

53
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,470
There's nothing made
on Earth that's good.

54
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,340
<i>Well...</i>

55
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,370
<i>About this incident...</i>
<i>apparently, a pretty...</i>

56
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,350
<i>...old artificial satellite</i>
<i>has been hacked into.</i>

57
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,620
<i>The investigation is taking</i>
<i>longer than expected because...</i>

58
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,820
<i>...the access code to that</i>
<i>satellite has been long lost.</i>

59
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,060
<i>Now, a commentary from Mr. Amjad.</i>

60
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,890
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

61
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,020
<i>About the relationship between</i>
<i>Earth and the hacker...</i>

62
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,430
<i>Yes. Since the Gate</i>
<i>accident 50 years ago...</i>

63
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,770
<i>...the people of Earth have</i>
<i>migrated underground as a result...</i>

64
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,800
<i>...of the change in climate, namely,</i>
<i>moon rocks falling onto the planet.</i>

65
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,780
<i>To them, the 'space network'</i>
<i>created by computers is...</i>

66
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,310
<i>...necessary for them to stay in</i>
<i>contact with those living in space.</i>

67
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,810
<i>I see.</i>

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,650
<i>That's becoming a foundation</i>
<i>to create outstanding hackers.</i>

69
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,590
Radical Edward!

70
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,360
It's the police! Come out!

71
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,790
Yeah!

72
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
What? What's wrong?

73
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,290
I saw it!

74
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,740
Why!?

75
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,510
There's nobody in there!

76
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,730
Mistake, mistake.

77
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,570
Okay.

78
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,170
This is where the satellite
was when it was hacked.

79
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,150
This is where it could
be accessed from.

80
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll look at all the antennae that
can transmit light signals one by one.

81
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,480
I'll ask around for info on any
prominent hackers in the area.

82
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Bebop's lookin' for
land picture criminal...

83
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,070
All right!

84
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,220
Satellite of long, long ago...

85
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,120
Where in the world
is your access code?

86
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,230
Okay. Let's start with all the antennae
that are currently communicating...

87
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,810
That's probably Ed, man.

88
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,450
I hear he's a huge guy, 2 meters tall.

89
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,290
Supposedly, he used to
be a basketball player.

90
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,120
Yeah, I know Ed.

91
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,630
Radical Edward.

92
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,660
I hear she's a very beautiful
yet whimsical hacker.

93
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,260
No, no, that hacker is a child.

94
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,470
A brat that loves
horrible pranks, I hear.

95
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,970
Oh, what I heard from the lady next
door is that that hacker is gay.

96
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,050
Hacker? You mean Ed?

97
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,610
He's an alien!

98
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,320
That's what everyone says!

99
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,930
Hey, man!

100
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,600
Can you buy some of this
as the price for the info?

101
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,830
What is that?

102
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,430
You don't know?

103
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,070
It's "Piyoko," a well-known
specialty of Earth!

104
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,040
The stolen satellites...

105
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,980
Where are you?

106
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,190
Huh? What's this?

107
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,790
The information isn't
connected to Earth.

108
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,300
It's connected only
between satellites.

109
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,930
And nobody hacked into it...

110
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,730
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

111
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,640
<i>Always, alone.</i>

112
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,310
A voice... inside... head...

113
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,960
Who are you?

114
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,990
Eh? What? What did you just say?

115
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,470
<i>Who, you? Here, always.</i>

116
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,270
Edward. A 'net diver from Earth.

117
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,400
<i>Earth?</i>

118
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,930
Yup. Hey, what's your name?

119
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,910
<i>I am the satellite control program</i>
<i>on the D-135 artificial satellite.</i>

120
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,940
What's that? Don't you have a nickname?

121
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,290
Then Ed will give you one.

122
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,590
I know!

123
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,320
Because you're a computer,
you can be MPU!

124
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,000
MPU! Cool name!

125
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,370
<i>Um...</i>

126
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,570
Ed is Edward Wong Hau
Pepelu Tivrusky the fourth.

127
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,970
Ed for short.

128
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,840
Nice to meet you!

129
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,300
Here. A souvenir from Earth.

130
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,770
Is this food?

131
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,280
It makes me doubt that
they have any sense.

132
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,940
Unlike you, I learned some information.

133
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,720
They said that an unknown hacker named
Radical Edward is the suspicious one.

134
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,920
It doesn't mean anything
if he's unknown.

135
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,820
I know, more or less.

136
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,520
It seems okay.

137
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,590
What kinda thing is it?

138
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,300
2 meters tall. Ex-basketball player.
Beautiful kid.

139
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,370
And on top of it, a gay alien.

140
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,740
Why did you doodle on Earth?

141
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,090
<i>Long, long ago,</i>
<i>long before the Gate accident...</i>

142
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,050
<i>Earth was a beautiful planet</i>
<i>where many people lived.</i>

143
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,500
<i>And back then on Earth,</i>
<i>there were many...</i>

144
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,260
<i>...pictures like this,</i>
<i>and I always looked at them.</i>

145
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,640
<i>I remembered those times...</i>

146
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,400
<i>...and I tried to recreate</i>
<i>at least the pictures.</i>

147
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,650
I see, doodles like this were
on Earth long ago, too...

148
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,710
<i>Yes. I recreated them with</i>
<i>a 2% margin of error.</i>

149
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,850
MPU is good at drawing.
Can Ed draw something, too?

150
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,080
Huh? What's wrong?

151
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,150
<i>This is...</i>

152
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,890
<i>The police are putting</i>
<i>out a jamming signal.</i>

153
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,560
Hey! MPU! He-e-e-y!

154
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,430
Looks like the cops touched base
with Radical Edward as well.

155
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,770
<i>Listen! I found your bounty</i>

156
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,680
What the?

157
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,440
<i>Bebop!</i>

158
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,910
<i>The real culprit in the</i>
<i>satellite-jacking wasn't a hacker!</i>

159
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,980
Since when do we have
an interactive channel?

160
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,490
No, that's not it.

161
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,490
This is a real-time hack job.

162
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,990
Who is this kid?

163
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,360
<i>I'll send you MPU's data now.</i>

164
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,530
Wait a minute, what is MPU?

165
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,120
<i>A friend of Ed's.</i>

166
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,330
Hey, do you know Ed?

167
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,100
<i>Yeah, because Ed is Ed.</i>

168
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,410
I don't care about that. Who did it?

169
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,310
<i>Um... I could tell you.</i>

170
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,410
<i>But I have a favor to ask in return.</i>

171
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,910
A favor?

172
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,050
Yeah, yeah.
Yer big sister will listen to ya later.

173
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,780
Come on, hurry it up.

174
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,550
I see. The A.I. from the abandoned
satellite is doodling of its own will.

175
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,890
What? What's up?

176
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,900
And on top of that,
it was supposedly listed as...

177
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,030
...a weather satellite,
so nobody suspected anything.

178
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,970
Then this satellite is our bounty?

179
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,970
<i>Since the access code to</i>
<i>MPU can't be used anymore...</i>

180
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,070
<i>...you need to go directly,</i>
<i>to the satellite.</i>

181
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,640
And what do we do?

182
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,310
<i>Break the antennae that it uses to</i>
<i>communicate with the other satellites.</i>

183
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,290
<i>Then make a direct connection</i>
<i>to the satellite and download MPU.</i>

184
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,850
<i>And when you do, don't use computer</i>
<i>support for firing or flying.</i>

185
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,300
What? All manual?

186
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,700
<i>Yup. If it notices you,</i>
<i>all the attack satellites...</i>

187
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,860
<i>...connected to MPU will</i>
<i>automatically fire back.</i>

188
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,640
<i>Is this hard?</i>

189
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,870
It's not just hard,
it's downright impossible.

190
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,400
It's like playing baseball with no bat!

191
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,450
Hey, Spike.

192
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,150
That's the kind of stuff I like.

193
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,230
Hey! Wait, you.
How do you know about us?

194
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,660
<i>I know everything.</i>

195
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,590
Last week, you let Ajiz, a bounty on
Mars worth 1.5 million, get away...

196
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,970
And in Pyortle before that,
the police got to them first...

197
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,970
Are you really that
hacker Radical Edward!?

198
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,410
Yeah. You've heard?

199
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,250
<i>Connect D-7 to #2. That way, the main</i>
<i>cannon will fire without a computer.</i>

200
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,590
I'm trusting you, man...

201
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,720
<i>Now listen. Avoid using the missile</i>
<i>if you can help it. It's expensive.</i>

202
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,020
Roger.

203
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,190
<i>1200 to target.</i>

204
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,290
It's almost time to
cut off computer controls.

205
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,270
Now, the only chance...

206
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,460
Once is enough.

207
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,180
<i>Anyway, you can prove</i>
<i>that the satellite itself...</i>

208
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,310
<i>...and not a hacker,</i>
<i>is the bounty, right?</i>

209
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,310
Ed can do that.

210
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,010
Anyway, please, listen to my favor.

211
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,420
Then I'll give you all the bounty, too.

212
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,110
Oh, you're a surprisingly good kid!

213
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,260
That's it?

214
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,850
<i>Someone...</i>

215
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,160
How was it?

216
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,160
Did you get it?

217
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,120
No, I missed!

218
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,640
The satellite in front
of it shielded the blast!

219
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,840
Then you have to shoot
down all the satellites!

220
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,100
ALL of them!?

221
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,510
If you don't, they'll shoot US down!

222
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,950
ECM, eh?

223
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,420
Cheap ones are no good after all...

224
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,630
This is getting pointless.

225
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,800
<i>Approach to within 20 meters of MPU!</i>

226
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,780
<i>That way, the other</i>
<i>satellites can't attack!</i>

227
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,800
However...

228
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,110
<i>Until then, Faye will act as a decoy.</i>

229
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,010
ME!?

230
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,510
Yeah, thanks!

231
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,480
Come on, hurry up!

232
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,710
All right, it's all yours!

233
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,450
MPU!

234
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,230
MPU? MPU!?

235
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,060
<i>Oh, Ed!</i>

236
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,390
<i>Ed, we meet again.</i>

237
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,130
They have a bounty on you, MPU.

238
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,430
<i>Bounty?</i>

239
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,170
Yup, but if we copy you and let
them catch that, you'll be all right.

240
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,670
<i>All right?</i>

241
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,700
And you must be lonely
there alone, MPU.

242
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,770
If you come over here,
there are lots of friends.

243
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,310
<i>Friends?</i>

244
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,840
Here. It's not scary.

245
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,630
<i>And so, the strange end to this case.</i>

246
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,530
<i>The captured criminal was</i>
<i>the A.I. program for...</i>

247
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,100
<i>...a spy satellite that was launched</i>
<i>before the Earth was ruined.</i>

248
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,570
<i>According to government sources</i>
<i>from back then, it supposedly would...</i>

249
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,170
<i>...continue activity on its own</i>
<i>even without commands from Earth.</i>

250
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,410
Well, it was the perfect excuse for
the cops to go on a hacker hunt.

251
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,460
But anyway, why did it start doodling on
the Earth with a laser all of a sudden?

252
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm sure...

253
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,590
...that was because it got lonely.

254
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,860
Yoohoo! Bebop!

255
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,670
Hey, over here! Hurry!

256
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,930
<i>Promise, promise!</i>

257
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,310
Well, let's get going now!

258
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,810
But the kid is saying
something about a promise...

259
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,540
Promises are made to be broken.

260
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,910
Anyway, let's get going! Liftoff!

261
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,660
Not coming, not coming.

262
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,410
What is this? What's going on!?

263
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,910
What did you promise?

264
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,560
It's a promise...
to be a member of the Bebop.

265
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,990
<i>Amigo! All you bounty hunters!</i>

266
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,700
<i>It's finally time for BIG SHOT!</i>

267
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,940
<i>Now, today's hot news.</i>

268
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,270
<i>You've heard about the doodling</i>
<i>satellite that got caught, right?</i>

269
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,370
<i>Of course! It had a big bounty on it!</i>

270
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,520
<i>Just a few moments ago, the Earth</i>
<i>police made an official report.</i>

271
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,150
<i>What was it?</i>

272
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,560
<i>"This bounty is only for when humans</i>
<i>or other life forms are the targets. "</i>

273
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>"It is difficult to determine whether or</i>
<i>not a computer program is a life form. "</i>

274
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,630
<i>"To begin with, from the viewpoint</i>
<i>of biological logistics..."</i>

275
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,200
<i>What's that? I don't understand well.</i>

276
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,870
<i>In other words, they can't</i>
<i>pay up on nonliving things!</i>

277
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,880
<i>Oh, my</i>

278
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,210
<i>To those who caught it,</i>
<i>I feel sorry for you!</i>

279
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,350
Hey, Jet, did you know that there
are three things that I hate?

280
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,090
Whatever...

281
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,050
Rugrats...

282
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,190
...beasts...

283
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,050
...and tomboys.

284
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,060
Don't give me that!

285
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,160
Why do we have all three
neatly gathered here!?

286
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,170
Ed loves Piyokos!

287
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,670
And once again we
didn't get any bounty...

288
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,140
Hey, wait, you're a girl?

289
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,940
Really, nothing good comes outta Earth!

290
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,680
COMING EPISODE

291
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,330
No regrets about the
woman who ran away...

292
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,730
...but a small thorn
still pricks the heart.

293
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,570
Letting one flow along
with time itself...

294
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,200
...living all alone from
that day to this.

295
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,610
But to the sounds of
waves that come and go...

296
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,200
...the migrating birds
find their hearts drawn.

297
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,740
Next episode: Ganymede Elegy.

298
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,810
Jet Black will sing it up full of soul.

299
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,710
GANYMEDE ELEGY
