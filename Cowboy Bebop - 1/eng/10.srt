1
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,610
Shut up!

2
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,920
Ow...

3
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,980
W-Wha?

4
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,360
Hey, Jet.

5
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,180
I'm asking ya, how much
longer before we land?

6
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,690
How long ya been standing there?

7
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,560
I've been here for a while.

8
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,530
I see...

9
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,700
What're ya spacing out about?

10
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,730
Where's my bounty?

11
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,540
Can't you land quickly so I can
hand over that musty-looking fugitive?

12
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,550
What, you haven't even
gotten permission to land yet?

13
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,310
I know. You guys are so obnoxious.

14
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,250
Don't rush so much!

15
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,220
And take care of the
airport end for me.

16
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,760
I thought Ganymede was your homeland.

17
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,700
Were you perhaps thinking about some
woman in the past that cried over you?

18
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,900
...or perhaps a woman
that made YOU cry.

19
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,270
Didn't ya hear me when I said
you're being obnoxious?!

20
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,440
<i>Yes...</i>

21
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,070
<i>This is Ganymede police.</i>

22
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,610
Donelly?

23
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,550
<i>Oh, Jet! Jet, it's you!</i>

24
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,490
<i>There is no mistake...</i>

25
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,360
<i>The top of your head's gotten rather</i>
<i>lonely, but it's still Jet all right!</i>

26
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,950
Long time no see, Donelly.

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,330
<i>I'm surprised that you're working</i>
<i>around here. Has it been...</i>

28
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,430
<i>Seven years? Eight?</i>

29
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,990
<i>What the hell's up with you</i>
<i>to come back so suddenly?</i>

30
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,630
I wanna hand over a bounty.

31
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,840
Wanted ad number EX41285.
Baker Panchorero.

32
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,280
<i>To think you're a bounty hunter...</i>

33
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,840
<i>You, who was called the Black Dog...</i>

34
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,480
<i>...a mad dog that never let</i>
<i>go of things bitten into?</i>

35
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,890
I thought YOU had already retired.

36
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,160
<i>Hey, I'm still an active officer!</i>

37
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,160
<i>Don't judge things on YOUR time</i>
<i>scale, you Rip Van Winkle you.</i>

38
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,190
- He used to be a cop? That explains...
- That example is completely reversed!

39
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,870
- What?
- <i>I'm just glad to see yer still kickin'.</i>

40
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,640
...why I don't get along with him.
- Yeah, you, too.

41
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,170
<i>Oh yeah... what was her name...</i>

42
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,140
<i>You know...</i>

43
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,170
<i>I know! Alisa!</i>

44
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,860
GANYMEDE ELEGY

45
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,750
She's got a little joint
in the port of Marvis.

46
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,360
A small bar called "La Fin"...

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,800
But in this recession, I hear
she's got a lot of debts to pay...

48
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,170
I'm sure there are a lot of problems
for a woman trying to live alone...

49
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,560
Sense of justice and duty, huh?

50
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,690
First time in a while he's home,
of course he's gonna go visit.

51
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,220
You're totally wrong if you think
your old woman still thinks about you.

52
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,130
You're totally wrong yourself if you
think every other woman thinks like you.

53
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,700
Justice and duty, duty,
THREE O'CLOCK TEA!

54
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,670
Really, men...

55
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,620
...are hopeless romantics.

56
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,050
Hey, why are you
rubbing that stuff on?

57
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,030
Beautiful skin is maintained by
continued effort that seems futile.

58
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,500
Do you understand?

59
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,730
I know! Futile! Useless!

60
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,720
This is...

61
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,060
...La Fin, right?

62
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,550
Yeah... and you are?

63
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,930
An old friend.

64
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,960
I was in the area for
the first time in a while...

65
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,200
Alisa... isn't here.

66
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,200
Jet?

67
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
That can't be...

68
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,650
Are you really Jet?

69
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,640
Rhint...

70
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,780
...he is my guest.

71
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,150
It's all right.

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,060
You don't mind?

73
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,830
I don't...

74
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,560
Anyway...

75
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,160
How about it? You want a glass, right?

76
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,540
You're my last customer.

77
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,710
I'm closing shop.

78
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,970
The number of ships decreased,
and this area has gotten desolate...

79
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,650
I'm thinking of moving to a new town.

80
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,680
Are you all right?

81
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,720
On the new island cities,
mortgage is expensive.

82
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,490
Are you able to manage all that?

83
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,130
That's so like you to
worry about such things.

84
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,170
I'm planning to change
myself in the new town.

85
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,470
Don't worry...

86
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,480
Rhint is here with me...

87
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,940
That guy that was just here?

88
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,510
Something on your mind?

89
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,640
Yeah.

90
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,150
To tell the truth,
I already have 3 kids...

91
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,190
I'm just kidding. It was a joke!

92
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,020
Rhint is just my boyfriend.

93
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,190
How are you doing?

94
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,490
Have you gotten married yet?

95
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,360
I live and wander with
a group of weirdos.

96
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,770
And on top of it,
I'm a bounty hunter now.

97
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,280
Do you remember?

98
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,660
<i>Where's Jet?</i>

99
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,660
Doing personal stuff.

100
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,790
<i>You're his partner, right?</i>

101
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,890
Yeah.

102
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,920
<i>I've got news on a bounty,</i>

103
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,660
<i>This hasn't been</i>
<i>publicly broadcast yet...</i>

104
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,270
<i>Rhint Celonius.</i>

105
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,110
<i>A thug in the port of Marvis.</i>

106
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,340
<i>Last night, he contacted</i>
<i>financial broker Law Rentzuo.</i>

107
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,480
<i>This guy was another tough guy...</i>

108
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,210
<i>...but he was killed!</i>

109
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,850
And so?

110
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,260
<i>Rhint... is Alisa's gigolo.</i>

111
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,690
<i>I thought I'd warn you guys.</i>

112
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,090
And how much is the bounty?

113
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,700
Back then...
when I got home from work...

114
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,110
You always waited for me.

115
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,670
That was all I needed.

116
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,950
But that day...

117
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,390
When I came home,
only that watch was left...

118
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,260
...and a small note with
one word: "farewell".

119
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,630
For some reason, I didn't feel sad.

120
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,970
It just lacked reality.

121
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,740
And I gradually felt something
inside me go numb...

122
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,980
After 6 months,
I made a bet with myself.

123
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,180
That I would leave this
planet if you didn't return...

124
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,490
...by the time this clock stopped.

125
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,670
I didn't come here to blame you.

126
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,830
I just wanted to know...

127
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,160
...why you disappeared back then.

128
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,280
You seem to think that
time on Ganymede had stopped.

129
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,450
That's a story from long ago...

130
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,960
I've... forgotten it.

131
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,630
I don't need time that stands still.

132
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,730
Farewell, Jet...

133
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,930
A bounty hunter? Then can he be?

134
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,770
Rhint...

135
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,830
He's after me...

136
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,310
I have a bounty on my head...

137
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,770
It's all over!

138
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,450
It's not your fault.

139
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,690
It's because I borrowed
money from a guy like him...

140
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,860
...and you protected me...

141
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,420
I can't be saved if I get caught.

142
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,020
I...

143
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,260
...killed a guy...

144
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,270
Let's get outta here...

145
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,240
Let's get outta here,
just the two of us!

146
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,870
This must be because
I have good karma...

147
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,810
Sorry, but it's business.

148
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,330
Steer for me, please!

149
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,860
<i>Hey? What's wrong?!</i>

150
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,070
I'm after a bounty worth 1.8 million.

151
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,540
- <i>What?!</i>
<i>- Here, I'll send it to you.</i>

152
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,870
He's a bounty?

153
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,940
<i>Yeah, a secret bit of info from Donelly,</i>
<i>He apparently killed a loan shark.</i>

154
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,450
Dammit!

155
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,960
<i>I'll do this. You can go back.</i>

156
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,960
You're not gonna let him go, are ya?

157
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
<i>This is the land where I was a cop...</i>

158
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,870
I'm the Black Dog...
Once I bite, I never let go.

159
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,570
I have no regrets about her, but I'll
settle this score on my home turf.

160
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,610
Sense of justice and duty, huh...

161
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,220
<i>Can you hear me...?</i>

162
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,150
<i>Stop the boat, now!</i>

163
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,150
Jet?

164
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,710
Stay away!

165
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,920
Please, let us go!

166
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,120
There are other bounties to find!

167
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,900
Even if I let you go,
someone will come for you someday...

168
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,940
If you run, you will
become an accomplice.

169
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,000
Stay away!

170
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,480
You still have time.

171
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,450
Don't worry about me anymore!

172
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,930
You were like this back then, too...

173
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,960
You decided everything.

174
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,970
And you were always right...

175
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,600
When I was with you,
I never had to do anything.

176
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,670
All I had to do was hang on to your arm
like a child, with no cares in the world.

177
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,910
I wanted to decide how to
live my life by myself...

178
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,660
Even if that was a mistake...

179
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,280
Let go! I don't wanna
go to prison! Let go!!

180
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,280
Help! Help me, please!

181
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,390
Be strong...

182
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,420
...and protect her...

183
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,470
Self-defense seems to
be how they see it.

184
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,080
What are you going to do now?

185
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,020
I won't be going anywhere anymore.

186
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,690
I will wait in my store... for Rhint.

187
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,590
It won't take long...

188
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,230
...because time is flowing along.

189
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,710
An unseen terror
assaults the Bebop crew.

190
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,520

unseen enemy, another victim falls.

192
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:25,380
What is the identity of the fearsome
enemy that refuses to show itself?

193
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,050
A symphony of shivers that will send
you into the deepest trenches of terror!

194
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,690
