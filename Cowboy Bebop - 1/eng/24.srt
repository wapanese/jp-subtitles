1
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,090
S-Since when were you...

2
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,760
Water sploosh...

3
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,600
You know this?

4
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,970
I think I know, I don't think I know.

5
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,530
I don't think I know that I know.

6
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,880
I think I know even though
I don't think I know...

7
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,650
Which is it?!

8
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,750
Hey!

9
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,680
HARD LUCK WOMAN

10
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,420
Hey Spike, where the hell are we?!

11
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,610
Isn't it Earth?

12
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,090
Earth?!

13
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,590
Hey, this ship was headed for Mars!

14
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,890
Why the hell are we on
Earth all of a sudden?!

15
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,190
Dunno.

16
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,960
Shit, this isn't funny.

17
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,730
While we're wasting time,
our fugitive!

18
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,730
It was the first big one in a while.

19
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,540
In any case why the hell are we on?

20
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,100
Jet.

21
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,300
The women are gone.

22
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,410
<i>Listen, if you lead me to</i>
<i>that "water sploosh" place...</i>

23
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,510
<i>...I'll give you something good.</i>

24
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,150
<i>Good thing? What?</i>

25
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,220
Something very, tremendously,
wonderfully good.

26
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,950
Something very, tremendously,
wonderfully good!

27
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,160
HOT!

28
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,060
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

29
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,620
This!

30
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,620
Water sploosh!

31
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,860
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you...

32
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,360
Hey, I found Ed!

33
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,370
Ed has been found?

34
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,570
What, you know them?

35
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,910
35 point 38 point 0, 35 point
48 point 1, 35 point 48 point 2...

36
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,040
This!

37
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,770
This, this, this!

38
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,370
Hey, can I have your nails?

39
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,220
Nails?

40
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm collecting them!

41
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,550
Can I, please?

42
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,020
- Just the pinky one will do!
- 35 point 52 point 3, 35 point...

43
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,610
This, this!

44
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,750
- Come on... can I have it? Please?
- What are you guys?!

45
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,920
HEY!

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,900
ED?!

47
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,070
Is that really you... Ed?

48
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,290
I'm sorry about that.

49
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,490
That's the best way
to make the kids listen.

50
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,360
It's all right.

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,290
Is Ed from this place?

52
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,500
She wandered in about five years ago.

53
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,900
Before I knew it, she was eating with
us as if it had always been that way.

54
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,600
And about three years ago,
she wandered away.

55
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,580
As if she was a cat or something.

56
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,640
I was wondering how she
was doing nowadays...

57
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,910
...but I didn't think she
would suddenly appear.

58
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,480
All right, it's time to eat!

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,790
Dear Lord up in the heavens...

60
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,230
Never mind the rest.
Let's eat!

61
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's eat!

62
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,670
I have to get going now...

63
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,940
What, you can stay longer, right?

64
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,570
I'm actually looking for something...

65
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,310
Ed knows where it is.

66
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,820
We just came here for food.

67
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,320
You...

68
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,090
You have to gimme something good!

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,630
Oh yeah, Ed.

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,060
There's something good in
the desk drawer over there.

71
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,430
Something good?

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,870
Go get it.

73
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,700
Something good!

74
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,670
Inside that drawer.

75
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Not that.

76
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,910
Yeah, that. Open it!

77
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,090
Her father.

78
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,520
WHOSE?

79
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,390
He came looking for Ed
about 2 months ago.

80
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,890
He said he forgot that he
had put her in an orphanage...

81
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,770
...and that he had been looking for
7 years, hopping around the world.

82
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,930
I hope she will be able to meet him...

83
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,210
People have to cherish
what ties they have...

84
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah!

85
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,510
Are you... Faye?

86
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,510
Impossible...

87
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,070
Really?

88
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,020
It's me, Sally Yung!

89
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,740
I was in your high school
graduating class!

90
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,150
Are you all right?

91
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,700
I was really surprised.

92
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,360
I thought you were a ghost.
You look just like back then...

93
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,110
You know, they say ghosts appear in
places where they have regrets...

94
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,970
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

95
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,410
You were put in cold sleep
after that accident.

96
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,280
And that's why you
look like back then...

97
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,210
Accident?

98
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,340
You don't remember, Faye?

99
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,310
I-I...

100
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,820
Grandma!

101
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,160
Grandma, we gotta go back now.

102
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,630
Is it that time already?

103
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,710
Do you know who this is?

104
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,840
I bet you don't know.
Actually, she's...

105
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,880
...a ghost.

106
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,750
Good-bye. Take care.

107
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,550
Hey, you guys!

108
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,390
What's with this course
change without asking?!

109
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,120
Our plans have all been
screwed because of it!

110
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,060
I don't appreciate you
doing things on your own!

111
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,410
You want to smell
something really good?

112
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,560
What's with them?

113
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
What are they being
so secretive about?

114
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
Leave them alone.

115
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,030
Maybe they're too hungry
for their own good...

116
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,510
Humans go insane if
they don't eat food.

117
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,450
50 million?

118
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,020
I see... pretty big.

119
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,210
Appledelhi Siniz Hesap Lutfen.

120
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,800
Would you like one, Mackenroe?

121
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,420
That's McIntire.

122
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,760
No thank you, Mr. Appledelhi.

123
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,270
You sure? Eggs are good.

124
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,110
As they say, power and charge.
That's what's important, Macintosh.

125
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,870
That's McIntire.

126
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,470
Why is it that you can't ever
remember your assistant's name?

127
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,280
Hm, don't worry about
the small things in life.

128
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,990
Hurry, Macky-Mike!

129
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,190
That's McIntire!!

130
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,280
Watch where you're going!

131
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,950
Hey?

132
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,460
Sorry...

133
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,510
Sorry?

134
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,390
I-I...

135
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,400
I have to go...

136
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,440
Going out?
Where are you going?

137
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,920
I finally remembered where I belong.

138
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,880
Where you belong?

139
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,660
You have someone waiting for you, too.
You have somewhere you belong.

140
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,930
You should go look for it, too.

141
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,260
That's the best thing, you know...

142
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,580
This one is a piece of cake.

143
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,640
50 million is right there!

144
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,820
If they can eat sukiyaki
filled with meat, then they...

145
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,530
Faye went out.

146
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,650
Again?

147
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,090
Where the hell did she go this time?

148
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,030
A woman's heart and
the skies of Ganymede, was it?

149
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,400
You're Appledelhi?

150
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,840
Can you come along with us?

151
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,080
Cooperate with us if you
don't wanna get hurt.

152
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,910
Who are you guys?
Don't interrupt our work!

153
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,150
Work?

154
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,090
What does this Earth need
to regain a peaceful peace?

155
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,360
This Earth of wild chaos!
Is it the cosmos?

156
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,870
That is a map! A map!

157
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,060
Yes, happiness comes in
the form of a map!

158
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,340
We are creating maps to save the Earth!

159
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,840
A map?

160
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,540
But, meteors fall often
and change the landscape.

161
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,320
That's why we're globetrotting.
We're chasing after every meteor!

162
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,980
Until every single meteor
falls onto Earth!

163
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,620
Enough with the excuses!

164
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,030
You!

165
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,290
I wasn't expecting someone this adept.

166
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,880
Is that you, Ed?!

167
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,330
That's enough! Stop!

168
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,910
FranÃ§oise!

169
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,720
How's that?

170
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,380
And that, and that?

171
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,420
This is father-person.

172
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,290
Father?

173
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,800
Your father?

174
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,400
She had such a thing?

175
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,670
This is Spike-person and Jet-person.

176
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,930
I see.

177
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,240
No, father. Good people.

178
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,370
Oh? I see.

179
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,120
Thank you for taking care of my son.

180
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,190
Or was it daughter?

181
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,090
Oh well, it's all right either way.

182
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,090
That's a token of my appreciation.

183
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,060
Then Ed, were you the one
who put the bounty on?

184
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,030
Fifty point zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, zero?

185
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,500
Only 50 Woolongs?

186
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,100
So, you wanna come with me?

187
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,050
Hurry, Michael-duck!

188
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,550
That's McIntire!!

189
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,610
Hey, wait!

190
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,620
Father!

191
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,260
He's gone.

192
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,890
Hey, it's dinner time...

193
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,340
Spike, dinner.

194
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,320
You can't come with me, Ein.

195
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,460
Ed is going someplace far, far away.

196
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,230
I might not be coming back.

197
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,630
So Ein, you should go back home.

198
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,130
Do you want to come with Ed?

199
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,090
Let's go, Ein!

200
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,760
COMING EPISODE

201
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,030
Everything has a beginning...
and an end.

202
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,070
Life is just a cycle of them.

203
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:21,940
With unwanted endings, becoming an adult
is to experience the inevitable finale.

204
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,020
It's been a fast trip for Bebop,
with only two episodes left.

205
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,250
But make sure you pay
close attention to how it ends.

206
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,550
Next episode:
The Real Folk Blues Part 1.

207
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,810
THE REAL FOLK BLUES(PART I)
