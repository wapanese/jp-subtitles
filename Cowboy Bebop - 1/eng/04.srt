1
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,510
Someone's here!

2
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,010
Hello there! You approaching
this area, can you see me?

3
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,210
I'm a little troubled
because I'm out of gas...

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,880
Can you take me to Ganymede?

5
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,550
Oh, dammit, why does everyone?!
Why won't they stop?!

6
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,320
GATEWAY SHUFFLE

7
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,300
This sea rat...

8
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,470
...used to be raised in
the oceans of Ganymede.

9
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,310
After the gates stabilized,
food was no longer scarce.

10
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,220
And so, now the ones in the wild get
eaten by those who have a fancy for them.

11
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,850
So, is it good?

12
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,410
It's totally disgusting.

13
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,720
It's just expensive because
it's a Ganymede specialty.

14
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,820
Then it's no good.
I'll have the lobster miso stew.

15
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,560
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,830
That doesn't look good, either.

17
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,500
Well, I thought I'd go for
something expensive while I'm at it.

18
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,840
You mean, because we'll
soon have some money?

19
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,490
To think that Gould was a spy...

20
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,650
But, Mom, don't worry.
We sunk his ship.

21
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,590
It's all right. One vial nowadays
doesn't mean much...

22
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,530
Let's continue the deal
as we initially planned.

23
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,730
But... who was in charge of
watching the house then?

24
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,600
M-Mom...

25
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,840
It was you, Harrison?

26
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Um, ur, Mom...

27
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,350
Hey! Where's my sea rat sautÃ©?!

28
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,490
Come on, there, come ON!

29
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,170
No doubt. It's Morgan.

30
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,690
Then shall we go before
we get breakfast?

31
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey, kid, did you know
that the Ganymede sea rat...

32
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,810
...is a very
intelligent and kind animal?

33
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,940
- What's that?
- That woman... I think she was...

34
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,110
I don't remember ordering a circus!

35
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,030
I know I've seen her somewhere...

36
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,560
<i>We, the Space Warriors, work night</i>
<i>and day to preserve the environment...</i>

37
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,690
<i>...and protect endangered species</i>
<i>all over the universe.</i>

38
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,030
I remember now!
That lady's worth 25 million!

39
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,010
Mom, hurry!

40
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,240
This is the end, Mademoiselle.

41
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,350
Mom?!

42
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,780
Don't move!

43
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,750
Do you want to see your mom in pain?

44
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,410
Who are you?

45
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
How's Morgan?

46
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,520
He's full of holes.

47
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,050
That's a problem. He was
gonna put food on our table.

48
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,490
But he's worth nothing compared to
the 25 million that you're worth...

49
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,430
- YOU!
- Let go of Mom!

50
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,630
Stop it. These guys are bounty hunters.

51
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,570
We can't do anything.

52
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,230
Mom!

53
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,630
Take care of the home.
I'll be back soon.

54
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,110
Come on. If you don't go now,
the cops are gonna arrive!

55
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,940
Mom, sit tight!

56
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,910
Harrison, you'll get plenty
of punishment later.

57
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,610
M-Mom?!

58
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,310
- Let's go!
- Mom!!

59
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,650
Lucky you, Harrison.
Your mom won't be back for a while.

60
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,670
Hey, are you alive?!

61
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,270
Please... Take this to the ISSP...

62
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,480
But... don't open it...

63
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,450
H-Hey, wait a minute!!

64
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,580
What does he want me to do?!

65
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,560
Universal Environmental
Protection Society?

66
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,460
More like environmental terrorists.

67
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
They're called the Space Warriors.

68
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,770
They used to be a good group
working on environmental...

69
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
...preservation and the
protection of endangered species.

70
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,400
But since their leader changed two years
ago, their focus drastically changed.

71
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,570
There are only a few members,
but now they're...

72
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,850
...even worse than a lot
of syndicates out there.

73
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,110
They're especially keen on
protecting the Ganymede sea rats.

74
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,160
And she's the leader of this terrorist
group: Twinkle Maria Murdock.

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,590
Please, don't associate
us with terrorists!

76
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,630
We are warriors of peace,
fighting for the law of nature.

77
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,730
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,200
And where can we get
the 25 million in reward?

79
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,310
The Ganymede government.
But we can't cash in.

80
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,210
I'm checking on it...

81
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,220
The government canceled
the reward yesterday.

82
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,510
Why?

83
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,930
When you're told not to open it,
the more you want to...

84
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,260
I didn't open it!

85
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,460
This thing opened by itself!

86
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,520
<i>So, as you requested,</i>
<i>we have canceled the bounty,</i>

87
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,530
<i>And we are debating</i>
<i>about prohibiting...</i>

88
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,360
<i>...the fishing of sea rats</i>
<i>on Ganymede as well...</i>

89
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,300
So, where's Mom?

90
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,400
<i>As I said, we haven't gotten</i>
<i>word of Twinkle's capture!</i>

91
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,030
<i>If we can find out</i>
<i>who captured them...</i>

92
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,740
If Mom doesn't come back...

93
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,540
...we'll set that plan
into action immediately.

94
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,020
<i>W- Wait! We're not going</i>
<i>against your wishes...</i>

95
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,920
Doesn't look like it
would ease my hunger...

96
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,940
Wait a minute, that terrorist act
we saw isn't on the records, either!

97
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,570
What's going on?

98
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,300
See? I told you that you
couldn't do anything.

99
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,040
So, you can just let me go.

100
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,340
I don't get it...
There's something behind all this.

101
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,520
<i>Hello there! You approaching</i>
<i>this area, can you see me?</i>

102
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,290
<i>I'm a little troubled</i>
<i>because I'm out of gas...</i>

103
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,490
Hey, she's!

104
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,560
Can you take me to Ganymede?

105
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,640
<i>Please?</i>

106
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,270
<i>Even getting a little propellant</i>
<i>would be wonderful!</i>

107
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,510
Hey! Can you hear me or WHAT?!

108
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,710
D'oh...

109
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,690
Then what?

110
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,230
You spent all the money you
took from us at the casino?!

111
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,970
As they say, " money makes
the world go round."

112
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,340
They also say,
"thieves have no compassion."

113
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,610
How is it over there?

114
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,450
Yeah, I'm contacting an old friend.

115
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,320
Man, there isn't even
anything worth keeping...

116
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,720
Huh? What's this?

117
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,090
Yes... I still don't know
where that virus is...

118
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes, Mr. President...

119
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,030
We will continue to do our best!

120
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,900
<i>Chief!</i>

121
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

122
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,800
<i>The one who nabbed Twinkle...</i>

123
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,570
You found them?!

124
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,210
And, that guy told you to
take this to the ISSP?

125
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,880
Yup. Doesn't that look
like it's worth something?

126
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,250
So, how about we call it even?

127
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,050
I never trust anything thieves say.

128
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,980
WHAT?!

129
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,330
What's all this about?! Hey, Bob!!

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,520
<i>Nothing is really up.</i>

131
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,330
<i>The bounty has been canceled.</i>

132
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,930
<i>They're saying you should</i>
<i>let her go immediately,</i>

133
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,440
Hey, Bob...

134
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,100
<i>When we worked in</i>
<i>the same department...</i>

135
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,700
<i>...a lot of the confiscated</i>
<i>eye drops disappeared, you know?</i>

136
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,080
W-What do ya wanna say?

137
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,340
<i>If you wanna work</i>
<i>until retirement age...</i>

138
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,950
<i>...isn't it a better idea for</i>
<i>you to go along with me?</i>

139
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,280
Oh, all right.

140
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,790
I get what you're saying.

141
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,770
Hey, don't break it!

142
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,230
<i>The guys are threatening</i>
<i>under the mask of "negotiation."</i>

143
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,070
<i>They're holding the 8 million</i>
<i>residents of Ganymede hostage.</i>

144
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,340
What do you mean by that?

145
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,350
They basically kidnapped
the leader in...

146
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,540
...virus technology and created
a virus to their liking.

147
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,850
<i>The virus is called Monkey Business.</i>

148
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,920
<i>They say that humans and monkeys only,</i>
<i>have a 2% difference in DNA structure...</i>

149
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,860
<i>...and apparently this virus</i>
<i>acts on those two percent...</i>

150
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,030
<i>So, that virus selectively,</i>
<i>acts only on humans.</i>

151
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,070
Why don't you give up?

152
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,580
We lost contact with the ISSP spy
that infiltrated their group.

153
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,520
So, we had no other option.

154
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,750
So you're going to
agree to their terms?!

155
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,990
Man, this was a big one
that we caught, too!

156
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,630
It's orders from up above!
WE couldn't do anything about it!

157
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,070
We're releasing her.

158
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,630
Us... or them...

159
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,330
Which one of us deserves
punishment from heaven?

160
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,440
Soon, the time of
judgment will arrive...

161
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,410
Yes... Soon...

162
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,950
The release procedure
has been completed.

163
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,690
We will continue to monitor
her using our special agents.

164
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,020
How's the satellite?

165
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,720
It will be ready in about an hour.

166
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,200
Get the chemical tech group as well.

167
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,690
Don't do anything until we
know where the virus is.

168
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,400
Sir, a communication from Twinkle.

169
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,840
<i>Long time no see, Minister.</i>

170
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,270
<i>About that promise we made...</i>

171
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,380
So... about the sea rats,
we will keep a stable...

172
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,710
...population using
limitations on hunting them.

173
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,250
<i>Didn't I say PROHIBITION of hunting?</i>

174
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,850
W-Well, we will look at the
demands in a positive light...

175
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,500
<i>Looks like you need some</i>
<i>punishment to understand.</i>

176
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,690
AH! Hey! WAIT!

177
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,700
Mom! I don't want to
become a monkey! MOM!!

178
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,620
<i>Alpha 1-0-5 to headquarters.</i>

179
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,220
<i>The target has entered</i>
<i>the wasteland area.</i>

180
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,790
Roger. Continue pursuit.

181
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,440
Man, they're too easygoing.

182
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,870
Dammit...

183
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,000
All that and no reward...

184
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,010
<i>Jet, can you hear me?</i>

185
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,980
<i>Turn on channel 72 and watch it!</i>

186
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,950
<i>They're broadcasting...</i>

187
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,950
<i>...from their own satellite!</i>

188
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,890
<i>This isn't just about the sea rats.</i>

189
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,190
<i>Humans, with their culture...</i>

190
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,360
<i>...have escaped from the</i>
<i>great system of nature...</i>

191
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,890
<i>...and are committing crimes</i>
<i>that cannot be amended.</i>

192
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,460
<i>Those that don't realize this...</i>

193
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,270
<i>...are what you could call</i>
<i>"bugs" in the nature system.</i>

194
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,980
<i>That ship was a decoy</i>

195
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,780
Where are they broadcasting from?

196
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,950
It's near here. They're...

197
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,850
...in hyperspace!

198
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,790
<i>Monkey Business, our virus...</i>

199
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,230
<i>...takes such humans and</i>
<i>returns them to nature.</i>

200
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,320
<i>Understand?</i>

201
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,900
<i>Au revoir.</i>

202
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,240
<i>Good news, Jet!</i>

203
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,770
<i>The Ganymede government has reestablished</i>
<i>the ransom on Twinkle and company.</i>

204
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,050
What?!

205
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,210
This is our chance!
WE'RE the only ones around here!

206
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,120
<i>But just catching them won't do.</i>

207
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,760
<i>If the missile falls, there'll be</i>
<i>nobody here that can pay the bounty</i>

208
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,040
So there's nothing to bitch about
if we get rid of the missile, right?

209
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,940
But they're at the exit to a gate.

210
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,340
I know.

211
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,730
What about the defense system?!

212
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,700
4 minutes and 30 seconds to impact!

213
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,130
The system won't make it in time!

214
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,490
T-This is an emergency!
Get the President!

215
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,240
They're here.

216
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,150
It split?! SHIT!

217
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,430
Jet! Get the last one!

218
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,570
What?! There aren't any
weapons over here!

219
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,750
If I wait for the next shot to fully
charge, that thing'll hit Ganymede!

220
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,250
<i>Oh? Are you in trouble?</i>

221
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,880
<i>How about for 80% of the earnings?</i>

222
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,940
You've got to be kidding!

223
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,850
<i>Okay, bye! Have a nice day</i>

224
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,720
All right. 40%. No more.

225
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,050
OK! I get the 60!

226
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,560
Fine... We got no choice.

227
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,230
Shit, will she make it in time?

228
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,100
Welcome!

229
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,770
What is this?!

230
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,810
Multiple warheads?!
This ain't the military!!

231
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,980
Now all of you, become apes!

232
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,190
<i>Jet!</i>

233
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,420
<i>The guys from the government</i>
<i>are closing down the gate!</i>

234
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,290
What?!

235
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,190
<i>They're going to enclose all of it</i>
<i>in hyperspace, missile and all!</i>

236
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Wait a minute, this isn't a joke!

237
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,150
<i>Spike!</i>

238
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,360
I hear ya!

239
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,820
Spike!

240
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,580
Why?

241
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,850
<i>Didn't you learn in high school?</i>

242
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,550
<i>Matter that gets enclosed</i>
<i>in hyperspace can be seen...</i>

243
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,020
...but will never interact with
matter in this realm again.

244
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,000
Mom! The gate's closed!

245
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,870
Hey, Mom, what can we do?!

246
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,340
Stop! Stop!

247
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,890
So... this and that and no reward.
All that work for nothing.

248
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,430
Oh, don't look so down,
we can make money next time.

249
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,330
Well, I'll go take a shower.

250
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,340
Next time? Make money?

251
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,440
Hey, Jet, what did she just say?

252
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,970
Don't ask me! Just don't!

253
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,640
And she's off to shower
without asking us...

254
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,150
Hey, are we gonna take all of this?

255
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,920
Don't tell me! Just don't!

256
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,060
Fine, I'll go tell her.

257
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,100
Hey, Spike...

258
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,260
Should've seen that coming.

259
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,590
The supposedly broken music
box starts to move...

260
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,190
COMING EPISODE

261
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,990
...and a nostalgic tune fills the air.

262
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,090
I then happen to wake up
from the dream.

263
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,130
There is no such thing
as a music box...

264
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,360
...yet, there is a small
music box nestled in my hand.

265
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,200
And I awake from the dream again.

266
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,470
As if I was peeling an onion,
it's a dream no matter how far I go.

267
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,040
I can never return to reality.

268
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,570
Such a nightmare, this is.

269
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,740
Next episode: Ballad of Fallen Angels.

270
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,520
