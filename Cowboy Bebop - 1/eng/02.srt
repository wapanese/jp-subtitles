1
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,480
Come out!
You can't run anymore!

2
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,420
We'll shoot!

3
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,280
Give up already, Abdul Hakim!

4
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,760
So ya wanna fight, huh?

5
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,310
You're such a...

6
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,540
STRAY DOG STRUT

7
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,340
<i>AMIGO!</i>

8
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,850
<i>How're all you 300,000 bounty hunters</i>
<i>in the solar system doing?</i>

9
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,580
<i>It's time for BIG SHOT, the show that</i>
<i>brings you information about fugitives!</i>

10
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,260
<i>Well, well, first up for today,</i>
<i>is this guy: Abdul Hakim.</i>

11
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,560
<i>He's known as a serial pet thief.</i>

12
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,460
<i>This time, he snagged</i>
<i>a test animal...</i>

13
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,600
<i>...from a research facility,</i>
<i>and is on the loose.</i>

14
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,270
<i>The good news is that he's</i>
<i>worth a whopping 8 million!</i>

15
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,070
<i>The conditions are as always.</i>

16
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,670
<i>Bring him in alive to</i>
<i>collect your reward.</i>

17
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,740
<i>If you kill him,</i>
<i>kiss your reward good-bye.</i>

18
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,110
<i>He's the biggest we've had in a while.</i>
<i>Do your best to get this guy</i>

19
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,310
How's it look?

20
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,210
It's done for.

21
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,050
Man, why does everything?

22
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,350
<i>Hey.</i>

23
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,420
Doctor? You got information?

24
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,720
<i>About Abdul Hakim.</i>

25
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,190
<i>- I'll take it!</i>
- I'll give a discount. 300.

26
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,130
I got his post-plastic surgery picture.

27
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,030
<i>Too much. 20 down.</i>

28
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,430
All right, 280.
On one condition.

29
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,900
What's that?

30
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,800
<i>Sock him one.</i>

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,300
<i>He trampled over me.</i>
<i>If you want, punch him a dozen times.</i>

32
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,100
I've got the goods.

33
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,900
This one should be something big...

34
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,710
Yeah, see you in six hours.

35
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,150
<i>He had a very conspicuous suitcase.</i>

36
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,480
That info's included
in the deal, right?

37
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,320
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

38
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,090
<i>It was something that could</i>
<i>carry a small woman inside.</i>

39
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,190
Treasure?

40
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,020
<i>Can't really say,</i>

41
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,620
<i>The way he handled it</i>
<i>sure didn't seem that way,</i>

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
Ni-lai-la!

43
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,710
If you feel lethargic,
have some ginseng hei-sui.

44
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,640
You'll last a week with it!

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,480
If you're tired,
have sugarcane hei-sui.

46
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,380
You ate too much?
Then have pineapple hei-sui.

47
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,920
Gimme some lao-chu.

48
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,280
Thank you.

49
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,770
Here you go.

50
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,690
Sorry. My apologies, bro.

51
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,060
Hey, I said I'm sorry!

52
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,650
What, can't say anything?

53
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,630
Wh- What? Ya pickin' a fight?

54
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,100
My treat.

55
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,410
Drink.

56
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,000
And now, the loot.

57
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,230
Even if I overhaul this whole craft,
I'll have some change!

58
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,300
Guess I'll go eat Peking Duck with it.

59
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,440
As they say, "Don't count
chickens before they hatch."

60
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,670
I got this one nailed shut!

61
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,410
<i>Well, give it what you got.</i>

62
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,420
So all three went down?

63
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,580
Seems that way.

64
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,320
And Hakim is around here?

65
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,860
Seems that way.

66
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,800
Dammit, he doesn't even know how
much that thing is REALLY worth.

67
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,470
A pet shop?

68
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,370
A shady one at that.

69
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,140
Hey, bro, you can buy
anything here on Mars.

70
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,480
From guns to human lives.

71
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,980
If ya wanna know,
show me what ya got.

72
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,580
The chain on this one is long.
Must be the "Way of the Dragon" model.

73
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,050
Oh, you can tell?
That's a rare one from the '30s!

74
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,480
It sure is an antique.

75
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,400
Try the store called Animal
Treasure off of Caiphon Road.

76
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm sure you'll find something there.

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay, I'll look... but I'll decide if I
want to buy it from you after I see it.

78
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, all right.

79
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,650
Run out of funds changing your
face around too much, Hakim?

80
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,360
W-Wait a sec...

81
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,830
Hey, don't move.

82
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,670
You sure are restless, changing
your face around this much.

83
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,500
What the?

84
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,070
Hold it. I don't want any
of this business here.

85
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,210
All of my babies are very sensitive!

86
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,010
You open it.

87
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,640
Why do I?!

88
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,110
There seems to be some
sort of misunderstanding...

89
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,480
Hurry it up!

90
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,480
Oh, fine.

91
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,470
A dog?

92
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,900
A Welsh Corgi.
It's cute, but it's everywhere.

93
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,240
Not a particularly rare species.

94
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
And how much is it worth?

95
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,150
With the suitcase, about this much.

96
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,110
200K?

97
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,250
No, no, 200, 200!

98
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,780
No way!

99
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,150
You don't like it, you take care
of it yourself. Like eating it.

100
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,850
It IS a puppy...

101
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,650
Sorry to bother you. Please continue.

102
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,030
I guess the Peking Duck
has been overcooked.

103
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,100
At least give me 300...

104
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,240
No can do.

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,100
280?

106
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,640
A no is a no.

107
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,540
250!

108
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,340
ZERO. I'll take it back.

109
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,640
This again?
What is it this time?

110
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,580
Someone! Catch my babies! Hurry!

111
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,990
- There it is!
- All right!

112
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,030
Hakim?!
God dammit, what's going on?!

113
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,680
- Gangway!
- What the hell?

114
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,340
WAIT, dammit!

115
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,240
Hey, what the hell do you want?!

116
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,300
Bounty hunter?

117
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,390
Animal rights syndicate?

118
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,300
Your story brings a tear to my eye.

119
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,130
Risking your life on a dog
that's only worth 200 woolongs.

120
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,340
What?

121
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,970
What I want are the 8 million woolongs
hanging from YOUR neck.

122
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,150
Not bad.

123
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,020
What?!

124
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,820
Dammit!

125
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,780
Shuddup!
I'm in a rotten mood right now!

126
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,960
There, there.
Here, lemme put on a collar.

127
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,670
A dog instead of a duck, huh?

128
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,770
Forget about that!
You know anything about it?

129
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,780
Yeah. This is a Welsh Corgi.
A total mongrel.

130
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Totally?

131
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,050
Totally. Completely worthless.

132
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,880
Shit, this gives me a headache.

133
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,210
And all this is
because of this mongrel...

134
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,060
The dog is worthless,
but the OWNER is worth something.

135
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Well, at least you should get
to know this critter well.

136
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,200
Man, I hate kids and critters!

137
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,320
They're nothing but trouble!

138
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,900
I got something!

139
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,600
All right!

140
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,430
It's big!

141
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,110
Here it comes!

142
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,970
Pull on the line!

143
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,070
What time is it now?

144
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,620
I-I-It's 4 o'clock now.

145
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,920
Two hours...

146
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,260
Who was that with Hakim? His ally?

147
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,390
Seems that way.

148
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,630
We got no clues?
We have to do something.

149
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,400
If THAT falls into police hands,
we're in deep shit.

150
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
Seems that way.

151
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,310
All our work will be worthless if our
experiments get revealed to the public.

152
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,440
Seems that way.

153
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,530
How much does he think we
put into that "data dog"?

154
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,480
Why don't YOU do this?

155
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,280
Didn't your grandma teach you
to finish what you start?

156
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,850
She was dead before I was born.

157
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,850
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>Anyway, we have the joker in our hand.</i>

158
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,590
Just do what we planned.

159
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,160
Give me code name "snoop."

160
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,760
Yeah. It's me.
I had some trouble.

161
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,840
No big deal...

162
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,330
Hey, wait, Michael!

163
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,180
I want to postpone the meeting a bit.

164
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,380
As I said, it wasn't that big a deal...

165
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,610
Impossible? Why? Hey, wait!

166
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,720
And THIS is our plan?

167
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,560
Hey, you!

168
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
You have something you
want to know, right?

169
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,470
Wait!

170
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,270
My little Peeko can
answer your questions!

171
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,840
You have something you
want to know, right?

172
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,510
See, little Peeko is telling me...

173
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,920
...that you're looking
for someone or something.

174
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,390
Well, where there's
this dog, there's Hakim.

175
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,360
Seeing loud and clear.

176
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,830
We're counting on you, pooch.

177
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,030
We must resort to the dog whistle.

178
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,400
But that'll cause a big mess.

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,430
I don't care.

180
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,740
We'll draw attention to ourselves!

181
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,540
We have no choice!

182
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,530
Shall I?

183
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,570
Do it.

184
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,690
I can't hear anything.

185
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,020
I said before that
humans can't hear it.

186
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,380
Oh, that's right.

187
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,730
This is so farfetched...

188
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,000
Will this really attract?

189
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,640
Oh, it's moving.
Something is now on the move.

190
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,110
Wait! Babies, what's
wrong with you guys?!

191
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,010
Hey, wait!

192
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,360
It got away, Jet!

193
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,230
Huh? Hakim?

194
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,060
<i>No, the DOG!</i>

195
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,770
It's close, it's close!
What you are looking for is nearby.

196
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,700
In fact, right in
front of your eyes...

197
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,710
Hey, wait, you need to pay!

198
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,780
I'll pay when I am rich!

199
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,740
You can't be serious...

200
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,420
Goddammit, what the hell is going on?!

201
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,760
Happy?

202
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,560
Yes, very.

203
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,060
- Excuse me...
- Outta my way!

204
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,700
You, what are you doing?

205
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,570
Hakim!

206
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,450
Dammit!

207
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,410
It's just a dog, after all.

208
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,990
Hakim!

209
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,560
<i>Spike, he's headed for Interstate 6.</i>

210
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,840
<i>Great!</i>

211
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,870
<i>If he thinks he can outrun me,</i>
<i>he's welcome to try.</i>

212
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,840
Don't get too hotheaded!

213
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,740
What part of me is hotheaded?!

214
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,040
There he is!

215
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,460
This is payback from earlier!

216
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,050
...the HELL are you doin'?!
This guy is MINE!

217
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
What the?

218
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,250
Now!

219
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,780
Stop that!

220
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,920
Shit!

221
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,570
SHIT!

222
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,730
THIS is why I hate critters!

223
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,860
<i>AMIGO!</i>

224
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,230
<i>How're all you 300,000 bounty hunters</i>
<i>in the solar system doing?</i>

225
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,130
<i>It's time for BIG SHOT, the show that</i>
<i>brings you information about fugitives!</i>

226
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,830
<i>So, you remember Abdul Hakim</i>
<i>who chose a rather...</i>

227
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,740
<i>...flashy way of turning</i>
<i>himself in last week?</i>

228
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,470
<i>Yeah! Of course!</i>

229
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,840
<i>Apparently, he stole what's</i>
<i>called a "data dog"...</i>

230
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,720
<i>...created in an illegal</i>
<i>experiment of some research firm.</i>

231
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,480
<i>Wow! What's that?</i>

232
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,560
<i>I'm not sure myself, but apparently,</i>
<i>it's a very intelligent pooch.</i>

233
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,430
<i>I hear that it's</i>
<i>priceless among collectors.</i>

234
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,100
<i>That's a surprise!</i>
<i>I wanna have a dog like that!</i>

235
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,770
<i>But they say it's still missing.</i>

236
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,870
<i>I wonder where it went?</i>

237
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,600
<i>Really</i>
<i>But now, a commercial!</i>

238
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,600
Can't be...

239
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,050
Hey there! When you're done cleaning,
feed the komodo dragons!

240
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,750
I want you to work your ass off!

241
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,580
Yeah...

242
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,390
Hey, hey!

243
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,920
Hey, don't jump on there!

244
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,660
That's cold!

245
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,570
That's why I said we should
throw out mongrels like this one!

246
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,330
But you're the one
that brought it here!

247
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,510
In any case, we have to do
something about the ticks.

248
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,440
Shit...

249
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm gonna salt you
and eat you, dammit!

250
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,150
<i>Well, it's time for us to go.</i>
<i>See you next time!</i>

251
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,080
<i>Good luck!!</i>

252
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,550
COMING EPISODE

253
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,310
"Nothing is permanent."
It's a fact of life.

254
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,990
The bell tolls for the great
ones who will someday fall.

255
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,890
Money makes the world go round...

256
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,260
...but debt piles up
before you know it.

257
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,700
I wandered through
all the reaches of space...

258
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,500
...and there I met a cowboy.

259
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,800
A session to the tune
of an off-key melody:

260
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,330
Honky Tonk Women.

261
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,620
HONKY TONK WOMEN
