1
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,240
It was raining that day as well...

2
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,220
You didn't come because of the rain?

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,920
I was supposed to kill you...

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,350
That day...

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,950
...if I had killed you...

6
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,930
...I would have been free.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
So why didn't you?

8
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,130
Why did you choose to be pursued?

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,840
Why...

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,840
...did you...

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,640
...love me?

12
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,590
Let's just run away somewhere.

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,620
Truly escape from this world...

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,030
...and go where no one else is...

15
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,000
Just the two of us...

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,700
THE REAL FOLK BLUES(PART II)

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,760
What about him?

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,590
He got away.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,170
All our men were defeated,
we ran out of weapons...

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,100
...and lost all means to...

21
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,370
Why did you come back?

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,410
Where is Julia?

23
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,880
I don't know...

24
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,210
Shin.

25
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,050
Don't follow in Lin's footsteps.

26
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,060
Keep going, and pass the place.

27
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,170
What?

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,940
Someone might have gotten here already.

29
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,400
Wait here.

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,820
Annie?

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,630
I told them that you weren't here.

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,400
That you were already dead.

33
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,760
I told them...

34
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't talk.

35
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,340
Vicious...

36
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,810
...killed off the elders, they said.

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,210
Everyone has lost sense
of where they want to be...

38
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,810
Just like kites with no strings.

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,990
I see... you were able to meet Julia...

40
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,290
I'm glad...

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,560
Annie!

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:34,800
It's... rather chilly... today...

43
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,860
You don't need weapons like
that just to run away.

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,070
You're going to go.

45
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,010
I'll go with you.

46
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,710
Until the very end, I'll be with you.

47
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,450
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,520
I'm gonna make a bit of a scene.

49
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,480
You sure are a lucky woman.

50
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,780
Really.

51
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,880
I came back just at the right time,
and got involved in just the right way.

52
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,510
I really am lucky.

53
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,890
The Red-Tail won't be
mobile for a while.

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,930
You're doing pretty well yourself...

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Getting the short end
of the stick and all.

56
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,790
He's probably not coming back,
you know that?

57
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,000
He might have been
offed somewhere already.

58
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,630
Maybe so.

59
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,570
But, so what?

60
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,170
Do you want me to go looking for him?

61
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,400
You've got to be kidding!

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,810
He went off to do away with his past!

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,080
You made him go.

64
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,780
My leg was shot, my ship is busted!

65
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,010
Hell, yeah! He was nothing but trouble!

66
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,450
Like I care!

67
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,290
So what kind of a woman was Julia?

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,260
A normal woman...

69
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,800
A beautiful, dangerous but normal
woman that you can't leave alone...

70
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,340
I see.

71
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,710
Like a devilish angel...

72
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,210
...or maybe an angelic devil.

73
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,540
This way!

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,910
Get down!

75
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,770
Julia!

76
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,700
Hey!

77
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,940
Where is Spike now?

78
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,950
All organisms...

79
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,280
All beings with life...

80
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,320
...all have their own stars.

81
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,160
The moment a new life is born...

82
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,530
...a new star is born,
and becomes the guardian star.

83
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,270
This star we stand on is
someone's guardian star as well.

84
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,170
That red star, that blue star...

85
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,450
When a life ends,
the star falls and disappears.

86
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,580
Please don't say that.

87
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,010
"Running Rock."

88
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,350
Don't call me by such a name!

89
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,380
His star is about to fall.

90
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,620
This is stupid. I can't believe it.

91
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,920
Do not fear death.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
Death is always at your side.

93
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,200
When you show fear,
it will spring at you faster than light.

94
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,610
If you do not show fear,
it will only gently look over you...

95
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,790
Sir Vicious, I found this.

96
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,190
The woman's passport is
inside it as well.

97
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,090
Surely she cannot escape
from this planet easily.

98
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,860
A beast that has lost a place to go...

99
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,560
He has nowhere to return to now.

100
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,240
He will come.

101
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,630
Spike, you...

102
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,520
Do you have anything to eat?

103
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,500
I'm starving.

104
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,540
The food you cook
tastes horrible, as usual.

105
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,440
For that, you sure are eating a lot.

106
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,910
Hunger is the best spice, they say.

107
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,620
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

108
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,620
There once was a tiger-striped cat.

109
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,150
This cat died a million deaths
and was reborn a million times...

110
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,130
...and was owned by various
people who he didn't care for.

111
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,570
The cat wasn't afraid to die...

112
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,740
One day, the cat was
a free cat, a stray cat.

113
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,550
He met a white female cat, and the two
cats spent their days happily together.

114
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,790
Years passed, and the
white cat died of old age.

115
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,560
The tiger-striped cat cried
a million times, and then died.

116
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,500
It never came back to life...

117
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,010
That's a good story...

118
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,510
I hate that story.

119
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,740
I hate cats.

120
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,570
That's what I thought.

121
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,620
Spike.

122
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,520
Can I ask you one thing?

123
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,590
What?

124
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,060
Is it for the woman?

125
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,770
There is nothing I can
do for a dead woman.

126
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,810
Where are you going?

127
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,520
Why are you going?

128
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,990
You told me once...
that the past didn't matter...

129
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,630
You're the one who's
tied to their past!

130
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,100
Look at these eyes.

131
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,280
One of them is a fake,
because I lost it in an accident.

132
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,990
Since then, I have been seeing the past
in one eye and the present in the other.

133
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,220
I had believed that what I saw
was not all of reality.

134
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,090
Don't tell me things like that...

135
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,960
You never told me
anything about yourself!

136
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,830
Don't tell me stuff like that now!

137
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,360
I thought I was watching a dream
that I would never awaken from.

138
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,280
Before I knew it,
the dream was all over.

139
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,120
My... memory came back.

140
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,190
But... nothing good came out of it.

141
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,420
There was no place
for me to return to...

142
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,530
This was the only place
I could go back to!

143
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,990
But now...

144
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,600
Where are you going?!

145
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,700
Why do you have to go?!

146
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,740
Are you telling me you're going
to just throw your life away?!

147
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,670
I'm not going there to die.

148
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,550
I'm going there to see
if I really am alive.

149
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,850
Shin!

150
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,580
Where's Vicious?

151
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,150
On the top floor. This way.

152
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,170
Shin!

153
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,770
Shin!

154
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,250
Please defeat... Vicious...

155
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,150
Actually...

156
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,280
...I wanted you to come back...

157
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,520
So, you are finally awake.

158
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,490
I told you before, Spike...

159
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,890
...that I am the only one
who can kill you.

160
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll return those words
back to you, Vicious.

161
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,970
Either way, we were destined
to end up like this.

162
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,400
Julia passed away.

163
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,170
Let's end it all.

164
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,610
If that's your wish.

165
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,060
This is...

166
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,440
...a dream...

167
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,940
Yeah...

168
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,640
Just a bad dream...

169
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,920
Bang...
