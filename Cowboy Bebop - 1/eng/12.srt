1
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,610
The star fell, Bull.

2
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,350
That is no ordinary star.

3
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,580
That is the tear of a warrior.

4
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,850
What is a warrior?

5
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,620
One who has finished his battle
somewhere on this planet...

6
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,490
A pitiful soul that could not
believe in the Great Spirit...

7
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,630
The report from Callisto went
directly to Sir Vicious.

8
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,130
He is requesting a deal for Red-Eye.

9
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,870
30,000 Woolongs per gram.
A total of 7500 grams.

10
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,980
Why did he specify you as the dealer?

11
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,580
He is a Titan veteran.
We were in the same unit.

12
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,420
Why does he rely on you now?

13
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,250
Callisto is undergoing
a depression right now.

14
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,630
If he can't see the future,
he is sure to worry.

15
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,560
All the more reason to keep
our hands out of that moon.

16
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,130
Vicious, are you not
the one that is worrying?

17
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,010
You have no permission to
make your own decisions.

18
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,310
Regardless of who it is, those who go
against the Van's will are punished.

19
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,940
You believe that I would
betray my own mentor?

20
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,580
Mao's case was merely bad luck.

21
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,420
Lin... You shall go with Vicious.

22
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,790
Yes.

23
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,880
Wang Long!

24
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,730
Callisto is a frigid planet.

25
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,460
Take plenty of winter clothes.

26
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,800
To me, no cold climate is
worth taking precautions for.

27
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
It is true that the planet
is warmer than your heart.

28
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,280
Your heart is colder
than a snake's skin.

29
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,110
Vicious.

30
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,760
A snake cannot eat a dragon.

31
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,440
I will be fine by myself.

32
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,910
I'll go with you.

33
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,170
Remember this.

34
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,510
If you want to survive,
you must betray me at times.

35
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,070
No, never.

36
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
That would go against the Van's will.

37
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,080
Such old-fashioned thinking
makes me nauseous.

38
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,290
Those damn corpses!

39
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,280
I will protect you,
for the honor of the Red Dragon.

40
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,720
Honor, huh?

41
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,530
Then, it's up to me
to slaughter them all!

42
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,350
JUPITER JAZZ(Part I)

43
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,450
It's hot...

44
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,990
Where are the others?

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,530
What a depressing bunch...

46
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,240
What's with this humidity?

47
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,240
It's so muggy that I can't sleep!

48
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,580
Oh, it's just a breakdown.

49
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,670
It'd be hard for me to do
if I saw your faces...

50
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,280
...so I'm leaving without seeing you one
last time. PLEASE don't look for me.

51
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,790
That wench...

52
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,690
She sucked out all the
antifreeze from the radiator.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,160
It'll be out for at least half a day.

54
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,390
Even if she didn't pull this stunt
we wouldn't look for her. Right?

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,470
She emptied out the safe as well.

56
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,000
7, 8, 9... hello!

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,380
Are you really looking for Faye?

58
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,180
1, 0, 1, 1, goodbye!

59
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,650
Are you just wasting time?

60
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,620
Is there anything else to do right now?

61
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,420
- Ooh! Boom!
- You found her?!

62
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,490
I wonder who this is...

63
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,430
Lesse... code name...

64
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,890
Julia!

65
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,190
Where is that coming from?!

66
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,530
Lesse...

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,070
Pretty close...

68
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,630
Looks like Blue Crow on Callisto...

69
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,930
Where's it going to?

70
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,140
It got disconnected...

71
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,080
Hey!

72
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,580
But...

73
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,810
Actually, there are no
girls in Blue Crow.

74
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,650
Honestly...

75
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,120
Hey, Spike...

76
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,620
Is that it?

77
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,800
Hey!

78
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,100
Hey, wait, Spike!

79
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,360
That's a common woman's name!

80
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,930
What about Faye?

81
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,310
Leave her.

82
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,040
This is a lawless area.

83
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,840
A woman surely can't survive
wandering about all alone!

84
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,070
Feeling sympathetic?

85
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,740
Plenty of sympathy...
for the money she ran away with!

86
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,920
Spike!

87
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm gonna go look.

88
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,350
What?

89
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm gonna look for my woman.

90
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,070
You can look for that other woman.

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,560
You're gonna have nothing
to do with this?

92
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,330
That's right. We only go so far.

93
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,670
Even if you come back, there
won't be a place for you here.

94
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,880
Can't do anything about it.

95
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,080
I'm sure you're not as lonely now
that you have more strange roommates.

96
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,550
Me?

97
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,720
You stayed here just for that reason?

98
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,350
You're being stupid!

99
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,450
It's been three years
since I teamed up with you.

100
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,360
But I never knew you
looked at me that way!

101
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,730
I was under the impression
that YOU were the lonely one!

102
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,600
Well we got rid of
that misunderstanding.

103
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,800
Good riddance!!
Now we'll have more money for food!

104
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,210
I never did understand you,
even to the very end!

105
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,300
I don't understand, either.

106
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,880
So long!

107
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,160
I don't know any woman.

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Like I would know!

109
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,300
Not even a rumor?

110
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,810
I have no luck with 'em!

111
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,440
I'd rather be with an armadillo!

112
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,600
Have you heard of the name Julia?

113
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,710
You shoulda said so earlier!

114
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,950
There's one in front of
Tony's place every night!

115
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,890
Excuse me! I'm not Julia.

116
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,590
Ju-li-US! I'm Julius!

117
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,590
Oh, I see...

118
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,030
Hey, you're my type.

119
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,760
Wanna hang out with me tonight?

120
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,790
I'm sorry, I already have plans.

121
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,800
Oh, yeah. Gren might know something...

122
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,710
I've seen him with a woman before.

123
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,870
Gren?

124
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,040
It's cold.

125
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,740
Looks like this is it for tonight.

126
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,080
Oh, a customer?

127
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,180
Not even. Can't you tell he's straight?

128
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,050
Come on, let's switch locations.

129
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,110
Hey, who and where is Gren?

130
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,560
So you wanna hang out with me tonight?

131
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,530
He's a sax player in Blue Crow.

132
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,810
Take care.

133
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,880
That was close.

134
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,790
When someone sneezes
and doesn't get told...

135
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,350
...to take care, that
person becomes a fairy...

136
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,050
That's what they say around here.

137
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,720
Then it's okay.

138
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm already a fairy.

139
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,230
I'm not as easy as I appear to be.

140
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,080
Unfortunately, I am not
interested in women...

141
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,740
Oh, that's a shame...

142
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,840
But the others seem to
be highly interested.

143
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,780
You didn't know that there
were no women in this town?

144
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,250
So I'll be very popular...

145
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,630
You should watch out...

146
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,470
Thanks for the warning.

147
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,380
I'm searching for something...

148
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,110
There's nothing here.

149
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,090
The only things are stale bread,
a broken-down car, and rancid booze.

150
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm looking for a guy named Gren.

151
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,960
No idea.

152
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,690
I see.

153
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,350
Hey, you need something?

154
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,990
You're Vicious, right?

155
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,860
ME?!

156
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,290
Where's the money?

157
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,100
If ya don't put out,
it won't do ya any good!

158
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,710
This is annoying...

159
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,710
So annoying it's repulsive!

160
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,670
What the hell do you mean?!

161
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,410
Why the hell am I Vicious?

162
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,650
There was info that there was
gonna be some deal for Red-Eye.

163
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,840
From Gren to Vicious.

164
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,580
I thought of taking that cash...

165
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,660
You think I look like I got money?

166
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,630
Foreigners are all rich.

167
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,330
And the code name was Julia?

168
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,700
Heh... Sure sounds like
some easy wench's name!

169
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,070
Yeah... really.

170
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,680
Gimme a Cowboy.

171
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,270
There are no bounties around here.

172
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,820
Bourbon with milk.

173
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,620
Oh, THAT Cowboy. I knew that.
You can't possibly be a bounty-hunter.

174
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,360
<i>So, who's our customer today?</i>

175
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,730
<i>Grencia Mars Elijah Guo Eckener.</i>

176
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,030
<i>That's a long name!</i>

177
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,120
<i>Yeah. He escaped from military,</i>
<i>prison three years ago...</i>

178
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,230
<i>...and the statute of limitations</i>
<i>is about to expire.</i>

179
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,130
<i>...and that means?</i>

180
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,300
<i>The bounty is double!</i>

181
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,410
<i>This is a chance you can't miss!</i>

182
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,070
<i>But I kinda feel like</i>
<i>we can let him go...</i>

183
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,310
<i>Judy, what are you saying?</i>

184
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,340
<i>He's an escaped convict!</i>

185
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,920
<i>But Punch...</i>

186
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,720
<i>He's very handsome!</i>

187
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,790
<i>Just look at his picture!</i>

188
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,720
<i>Lesse... Oh, come on...</i>

189
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,690
<i>I'm much more handsome than he is...</i>

190
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>Punch, I just can't</i>
<i>laugh at that joke...</i>

191
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,790
Hey, can you turn that thing off?!

192
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,890
Well, calm down.

193
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm sorry, man.

194
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,300
Don't worry. That guy passed
out over there is a cop.

195
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,930
What do ya wanna say?

196
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,780
Actually, there's a
bounty on my head, too.

197
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,150
This place is a hideout
for people like that.

198
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,110
I see...

199
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,450
So you can rest assured.

200
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,680
Me?

201
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,790
What's with this?

202
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,460
I wanted to get rid of all this
frustration, and nobody's coming?

203
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,100
Oh... you're all here.

204
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,310
Miss, your appearance is
rather harmful to the eyes.

205
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,400
Or are you enticing us?

206
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah, I am...

207
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,870
Hold on a minute.

208
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,810
If I don't do this, I'll chip a nail...

209
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,290
Okay, any time now!

210
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,050
You wench!

211
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,260
Hurry!

212
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,790
Why did you bring me here?

213
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,890
Because you said you're a fairy.

214
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,490
Why did you come with me?

215
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,900
'Cuz I got no place to stay.

216
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,870
You can trust me that easily?

217
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,430
You said you weren't
interested in women.

218
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,000
I might take your money and kill you...

219
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,850
That's fine.

220
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,350
I've lived longer than I seem.

221
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,820
It's broken.

222
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,270
You came to such a slummy
neighborhood all by yourself?

223
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,570
I'm alone.

224
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,540
I don't want comrades...

225
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,870
...and it's not worth having any...

226
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,500
I end up worrying about
things I don't have to...

227
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,810
You know, 'cuz I'm
such a good woman...

228
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,150
All the guys end up fighting for me.

229
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,680
They often say that humans
can't live alone...

230
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,990
But you can live pretty
long by yourself.

231
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,200
Instead of feeling alone in a group...

232
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,670
...it's better to be alone
in your solitude.

233
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,310
When I'm dealing with them,
it's nothing but trouble...

234
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,540
And I don't get squat out of it...

235
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,450
So it doesn't matter if
I'm there or not...

236
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,410
You just got scared of losing them.

237
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,390
So you distanced yourself from them.

238
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,790
You're weird.

239
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,200
Think so?

240
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,230
I don't know why I'm
talking to you about this...

241
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,470
I feel like I'm in a confessional...

242
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,710
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

243
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,700
No...

244
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,950
Take care.

245
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,630
You want to take a shower?

246
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,930
No thanks.

247
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,660
I don't know where
peeping toms might be...

248
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,370
You shouldn't peek, either.

249
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,700
Hm, I can't guarantee that.

250
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,390
<i>Gren... You're not there?</i>

251
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,120
Vicious?!

252
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,130
<i>I'm out with 'honroutou'.</i>

253
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,760
<i>Along with the 'mangan' and the</i>
<i>'ura-dora', it's 32000. I'll be waiting.</i>

254
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,010
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

255
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,980
Sir Spike!

256
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,680
Hey, Lin. You've gotten pretty big.

257
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,180
He used to work under you,
but things are different now.

258
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,750
I feel sorry for her. Having her name
used for some crooked deal like this.

259
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,990
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

260
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,370
We still haven't settled
the score from earlier.

261
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,700
Any time.

262
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,170
Lin!

263
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,950
Get out of the way, Lin!

264
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,690
Julia was here, in this town.

265
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,020
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

266
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,090
Lin...

267
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,010
A woman?

268
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,380
W-Which are you?

269
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,690
I am both, but I am neither.

270
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,100
COMING EPISODE

271
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,780
Hey... How are men and women different?

272
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,260
Hmm... I think women are hiding
more vital things than men are.

273
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,630
Yeah... but there are women
that aren't feminine.

274
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,290
And there are men
that aren't masculine.

275
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,760
What about those that
aren't normally feminine...

276
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,230
...but show that side on
some chance circumstance?

277
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,290
I like that.

278
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,960
Oh?

279
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,300
I'm not talking about you.

280
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,400
Then who?

281
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,300
Maybe it's Ed!

282
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,370
Next episode: Jupiter Jazz, part 2.

283
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,180
JUPITER JAZZ(Part II)

284
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,110
Maybe it's me.
