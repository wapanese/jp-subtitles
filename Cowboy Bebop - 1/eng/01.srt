1
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,760
ASTEROID BLUES

2
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,190
Hey, Spike!

3
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,070
It's ready!

4
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,730
I'm just about done myself.
What's cooking?

5
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,710
Special "beef with bell peppers."
Qing-jiao-rou-si.

6
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,210
Asimov Solensan.
This is our next target.

7
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,990
Hey, Jet...

8
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,630
He's a high-end of the syndicate
that deals all around the asteroids.

9
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,890
About this Qing-jiao-rou-si...

10
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,400
The guy's name is Asimov Solensan.
Weren't you listening to me?!

11
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,030
You DON'T call a meatless
"beef with bell peppers"...

12
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,900
..."beef with bell peppers"...do you?

13
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,070
Yes, you do.

14
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,370
No, you don't!

15
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,840
You do when you're broke!

16
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,850
What happened to the 1 million woolongs
we got as bounty from that last guy?!

17
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,140
The repair bill for
the plane you wrecked...

18
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,740
...and the repair bill
for the shop you trashed...

19
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,380
...and the medical bill
of the cop you injured...

20
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,950
KILLED ALL THE DOUGH!

21
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,490
Three days ago, there was a shootout
between his group and an enemy syndicate.

22
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,090
He killed his own men and took off.

23
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,330
They say he's hiding
with his woman in Tijuana.

24
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,870
That's a place for nobodies to go.

25
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,070
Despite being a nobody,
he's worth 2.5 million.

26
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,700
Don't feel like it.

27
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,380
Tijuana... The beef there...

28
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,180
...is REALLY tasty...

29
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,420
<i>"Attention, please.</i>
<i>We will soon arrive at the gate. "</i>

30
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,890
<i>"We look forward to serving you again."</i>

31
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,540
<i>Please line up single file at</i>
<i>the tollbooth after clearing the gate.</i>

32
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,340
<i>Please pass by after switching</i>
<i>the credit sensors to debit mode.</i>

33
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,820
I'll head over after
hitting the cops for clues.

34
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,730
<i>Then I'll try seeing old man Bull.</i>

35
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,100
<i>Can you trust that old guy?</i>

36
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,930
Such an easygoing song.

37
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,360
THIEF!

38
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,000
This again? Goddamn sonofabitch!

39
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,970
Man, you're totally ripping me off,
but do ya realize...

40
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,370
...the reason you can
live here is because...

41
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,280
...I dug that gate with
all my might, ya hear?

42
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,540
This again.
You always say that when you lose.

43
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,880
We all dug the gate together, remember?

44
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,580
That we did.
We dug like there was no tomorrow...

45
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,090
Goddamn idiot sonofabitch!

46
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,870
Gimme a beer.

47
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,500
And I'll have a Bloody Mary.

48
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,810
I got vodka, but unfortunately
I'm out of tomato juice.

49
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm sure there's ONE CAN
in the back room...

50
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,220
I'll take a look.

51
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,000
Top-notch "RED-EYE."

52
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,630
You'd know, as a buyer, right?

53
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,500
Can it be..."BLOODY-EYE"?

54
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,710
Prove to me that it's the real thing.

55
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,210
Keep those eyes open!

56
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,170
This is dandy,
but you got anything to eat?

57
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,990
I see...

58
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,660
The red-eyed coyote will appear
at the north end of town.

59
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,720
That is what I see.

60
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,790
A red-eyed coyote, huh...

61
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,430
You, "Swimming Bird."

62
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,830
You shall meet a woman.

63
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,810
You shall be targeted
by that woman...

64
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,100
And then... death.

65
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,800
Again. I see.

66
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,210
"Again"?

67
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,450
I've already died once.
Got killed by a woman.

68
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,650
You take women too lightly.

69
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,680
Catch ya later.

70
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
May he be blessed by Wakantanka.

71
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,170
Presidente?
I'll have a glass on the house.

72
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,940
Damn. Asimov sure lost his head.

73
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,290
No shit. We gotta do something
before the cops start moving.

74
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,260
Ya wanna leave it up to the cops?

75
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,780
He IS using those eye drops.
There's no way we can win.

76
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,460
I'm tellin' ya, we got nothin' if
we don't get that "BLOODY-EYE" back.

77
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,730
But, man!

78
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,160
Hey.

79
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,430
Can you give me the specifics?

80
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,410
Man, I'm hungry...

81
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,850
You, too?

82
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,960
It's better to leave the water running.

83
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,100
Or it'll clog.

84
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,520
Oh, I'm sorry!

85
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,160
Thank you...

86
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,000
Um...

87
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,430
...l'f soffy.

88
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,570
Ew! I don't want that anymore!
You can have it!

89
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,910
Lukfy!

90
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,590
I'm really sorry, honest.

91
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,560
Felt like my stomach was
going to be glued to my back.

92
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,690
Nice fighter.

93
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,200
It's an old model.

94
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,930
She's been with me for over ten years.

95
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,460
Looks like you've gotten
a lot of use out of it.

96
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,270
I travel around a lot.

97
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,830
I'm actually a wandering performer.

98
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,510
I can't tell if you're
for real or just joking.

99
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,140
A lot of people say that about me.

100
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,410
Been to Mars yet?

101
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,350
I was born on Mars.

102
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,820
They have everything there.

103
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,560
Unlike here, Mars has lots
of people, lots of things...

104
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,400
They must live happily there.

105
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,370
Only the rich.

106
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,990
Then I'm sure we'll be happy there.

107
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,310
You planning on escaping to Mars?

108
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,610
Running away...
but how far can you go?

109
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,170
Who are you?

110
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,340
An old-fashioned cowboy.

111
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,550
A bounty hunter?

112
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,180
Good call.

113
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,080
You're not going to catch us?

114
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,820
Your buddy seems to be pretty ill.

115
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,260
I don't deal with weakened nobodies.

116
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,730
Wise decision.

117
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,730
YOU are the nobody!

118
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,170
Asimov! That's enough!

119
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
Adios, cowboy.

120
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,400
Why did you stop me?

121
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,540
I coulda killed him in one second.

122
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,210
You're tired.
If you do this anymore...

123
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,710
He was young and attractive.

124
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,210
I was waiting so long for
you to come pick me up.

125
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,680
I can finally escape the
low life I've had here.

126
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,330
I can finally live happily on Mars...

127
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,380
A nap. How peaceful.

128
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,040
I had a good dream.

129
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,980
That's great.

130
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,820
Then you can see the rest of
that dream on the Bebop.

131
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,790
I'm giving up on this one.

132
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,260
It's impossible to catch him.

133
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,550
There's no way we can win.

134
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,460
When Asimov left his syndicate,
he snuck something out with him.

135
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,930
The top-end stuff of all the illegal
eye drops that the syndicate makes.

136
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,410
He took off with all of the drops,
so the group is in a mess.

137
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,640
They wanna catch him,
but all they get back are corpses.

138
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,870
Because Asimov is using it...

139
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,310
The eye drops known as "BLOODY-EYE."

140
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,680
They're planning on going to Mars.

141
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,710
Mars?

142
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,780
But before that, they'll sell THIS off.

143
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,850
Hmm? That's...

144
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,120
I grabbed it from his breast pocket.

145
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,420
You... met him?

146
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,090
A nightmare.

147
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,760
He got you?

148
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,930
The red-eyed coyote will supposedly
appear at the north end of town.

149
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,990
This again? Goddamn sonofabitch!

150
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,400
Man, you're totally rippin' me off, but do
ya realize the reason you can eat well...

151
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,100
...around here is because I cultivated
the land with my buddies, ya hear?

152
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,370
Yeah, and that's us.

153
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,100
That we did...

154
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,840
We planted seeds like
there was no tomorrow...

155
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,140
You were always planting "seeds"
of a different kind, though!

156
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,820
You have any Bloody Marys?

157
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,990
I only got beer.

158
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,930
I've got tomato juice.

159
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,020
How much?

160
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,160
300,000 woolongs.
I got 50 packs.

161
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,300
15 million woolongs, eh?

162
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,240
I'm in a hurry. I'll find others
if you don't want it.

163
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,730
Show me.

164
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,640
Lookin' for this?

165
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,580
Hey, do you know what YOU are worth?

166
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,680
What?

167
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,660
Only 2.5 million woolongs.

168
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,020
You're such a cheap guy.

169
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,550
Long time no see.

170
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Since when are you a buyer?
Did you give up on bounty hunting?

171
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,030
No thrill in cheap bounties.

172
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,330
Looks like you do better as a thief.

173
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,100
Give it back.

174
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,410
Sure I will.

175
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,500
I owe you one!

176
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,720
You trust your eyes too much!
You're not a chameleon!

177
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,890
You can't see everywhere all at once!

178
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,390
Let's go!

179
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,350
That way!

180
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,690
That way! That way!

181
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,130
What the hell are you?!

182
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,430
Don't move!

183
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,660
All right, stay still!

184
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,570
IDIOT!

185
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,940
We're doomed if these break!
Be more careful!

186
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

187
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,570
You're late, Jet!

188
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,470
Oh...

189
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,500
...shit!

190
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,370
Asimov.

191
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,780
Stop! Doing any more is insane!
Don't do it!

192
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,830
We can't run anymore...

193
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,200
There's no way we can get away...

194
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,390
Adios...

195
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,210
Hey, Spike, it's ready!

196
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,110
It's ready.

197
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,580
What's cooking?

198
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,010
Special "beef with bell peppers."

199
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,300
Well, and so this program
is finally under way.

200
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,160
COMING EPISODE

201
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,630
What's the meaning of all this?

202
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,970
Next week, we're completely changing
gears to show an anime for all ages.

203
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,500
Was it that kind of a story?

204
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,700
- Cheerful animals wreak havoc all over!
- WHAT?!

205
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,670
But Dr. Doolittle WON'T
be making an appearance.

206
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,670
From little kids to the elderly,
if you love animals...

207
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,310
Hey, hold on now, Spike!

208
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,080
Everyone gather around
and watch the show!

209
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,110
Is it all right to
say stuff like that?!

210
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,380
I'm not responsible for anything!

211
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,980
But there is one favor
to ask right now.

212
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,180
Good little kids should sit far
from the TV when watching the show.

213
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,990
Come on...

214
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,020
Stand back about a kilometer.

215
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,350
That's TOO far.

216
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,140
STRAY DOG STRUT

217
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,480
800 meters then?
