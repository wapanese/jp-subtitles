1
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,620
Such pretty eyes.

2
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,950
You've pretty eyes
and a smile to match.

3
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,490
Lookin' to score riches?

4
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,390
I welcome all.

5
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,370
Ya know the first rule in combat?

6
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,680
...to get the first attack.

7
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,180
What an extended greeting this is.

8
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,820
HONKY TONK WOMEN

9
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,150
I didn't know that the
sure-shot and master of poker...

10
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,190
...the legendary female gambler
Poker Alice was still alive.

11
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,460
If she was still alive,
she'd be 219 years old now.

12
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,940
Of course.
You sure don't look over 200.

13
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,070
Besides, Alice never
lost during her lifetime.

14
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,810
She kept winning, without cheating.

15
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,910
You have a way to prove that?

16
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,020
I hear you are carrying a large debt.

17
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,100
Which do you prefer...
the police, or my establishment?

18
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,020
A prophecy?

19
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,290
Charlie said,
"Only hands can wash hands."

20
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,160
"If you want to receive,
you must first give."

21
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,230
Hey, doesn't that mean that Charlie
is telling us to just do it?

22
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,270
Right?

23
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,470
Do you think Charlie Parker
would quote Goethe?

24
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,310
Oh come on, it's all part
of the dream I had.

25
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,470
The way things go,
I say that even the hard-earned...

26
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,780
...5000 woolongs will
disappear with your dream.

27
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,780
Let me tell you something, Spike...

28
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,810
This is a no smoking area.

29
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,580
You shouldn't play.
Your eyes are too good for this.

30
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,450
They'll kick us out
if you win too much.

31
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,450
Then don't bring me here.

32
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,340
Pray, man.

33
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,220
I'll take one.

34
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,740
Small jack.

35
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,740
I'll play a few.

36
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,720
<i>Must be him.</i>

37
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,770
Nice, Jackie.

38
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,590
The target will sit at a blackjack
table, and lose at a certain point.

39
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,560
Of course, you will help him with that.

40
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,830
And, he will hand you the last
chip he has as a dealer's chip.

41
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,900
And what about it?

42
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,110
It's something that'll
make your debt...

43
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,510
...as small as one tiny
second in this universe.

44
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,360
Last game.

45
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,330
I'm not lucky, nor am I nimble.

46
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,400
Then what are you?

47
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,740
Generous.

48
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,410
Blackjack.

49
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,150
Ya got me. I give up.

50
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,590
- I'll take this as a memento.
- Huh?

51
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,490
Wait a minute!

52
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,860
Hold up!

53
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,690
Hey, you!

54
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,300
What part of you is generous?

55
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,470
This wasn't the plan I heard!

56
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,270
I thought you were supposed
to give me the last chip!

57
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,800
Why should I?

58
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,040
I played along with you
and your cheats!

59
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,320
Did ya hear that!?

60
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,150
Cheating!

61
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,450
That for real?

62
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,480
The dealer has been cheating!

63
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,870
Can you come with me to the office?

64
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,470
Why?

65
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,710
What do you want?

66
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,310
You piece of!

67
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,160
Come on...

68
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,660
Does this casino also
run a fitness club?

69
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,500
It's showtime!

70
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,990
Heh heh. Pardon me here.

71
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,400
Spike...

72
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,740
All right.

73
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,580
Jet.

74
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,280
That's why I told you not to...

75
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,910
That's not it!
But we gotta split!

76
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,720
I haven't cashed these in yet!

77
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,620
HEY!!

78
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,220
He doesn't have it. The chip is a fake.

79
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:51,060
Neither you nor your boss realize
why we cooked up this whole thing...

80
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,230
If that chip falls into police hands...

81
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,700
It's all over!

82
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,370
Boss, we still can't find that broad.

83
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,000
Find her!

84
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,410
Put a reward on her if you have to!

85
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,730
Wait a sec!

86
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,730
Why is my reward
for bringing ya back...

87
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,600
...being trapped in here?!

88
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,240
I see. She smells like
money to you too, huh?

89
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,750
You have GOT to be kidding!

90
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,110
Jet, how much did you have?

91
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,310
Oh, 200K. Easy.

92
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,290
And who put it all to naught?

93
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,750
What, only 200K?

94
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,850
That's nothing compared to my debt...

95
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,060
Besides, don't you think this is
a bit much for a false accusation?

96
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,400
Well, that mono-carrier
should sell for about 400K.

97
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,340
If you had just given me that chip,
we wouldn't have had a problem.

98
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,200
Chip?

99
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,540
Yeah!

100
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,640
Disgusting.

101
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,840
If you give that to Gordon,
he'll give you as much as you want.

102
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,980
Yeah, let's do that!

103
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,650
I don't know any guy named Gordon...

104
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,520
...nor do I want to
believe your stories.

105
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,820
Wait a minute!

106
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,330
Let's go, Ein.

107
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,190
Are you listening to me? Come on!

108
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,770
It's a chip.

109
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,970
Of course it's a chip.

110
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't mean that kind of chip.
There's a microchip in this thing.

111
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,890
<i>AMIGO! Leave it to us</i>
<i>for bounty information!</i>

112
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,190
<i>Thanks for waiting!</i>
<i>It's time for BIG SHOT!</i>

113
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,040
This is...

114
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,470
<i></i><i>So, first up this week is...?</i>

115
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,080
<i></i><i>It's a shame we have to hand her to</i>
<i>the police. She doesn't look it, but...</i>

116
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,810
Hey, Spike!

117
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,070
<i></i><i>...she's a real mean one. Faye Valentine.</i>

118
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,650
<i></i><i>The bounty is a whopping</i>
<i>6 million! A real deal!</i>

119
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,480
Hey, Jet!

120
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,480
<i></i><i>First come, first served.</i>

121
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,510
<i></i><i>Good luck, cowboys!</i>

122
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,050
I've been waiting for you.

123
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,530
<i>First off, let me tell you</i>
<i>that I didn't intend to run.</i>

124
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,830
I trust you. Where are you?

125
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,360
<i>An old fishing ship in the gate.</i>

126
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,460
<i>They have the chip.</i>

127
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,660
<i>So hurry up and...</i>

128
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,240
What?

129
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,310
Well, we thought we
were being immature.

130
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,750
To leave a young woman
in a place like this.

131
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,920
You aren't thinking
weird thoughts, are you?

132
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,860
No, we thought we'd escort you to a
place more considerate of your situation.

133
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,690
Oh, and where would that be?

134
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,530
The police.

135
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,260
We're sorry that we were so cheap
earlier with the 200K bit...

136
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,200
...Faye Valentine.

137
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,360
What, there's a bounty on me?

138
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,740
A whopping 6 million.

139
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,270
What... only 6 million?

140
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,240
How much ARE you in debt?

141
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,820
Come on, please!
Anywhere but the police!

142
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,080
Only the police would give us money.

143
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,450
My mother's last will was for me to
not be in any place for too long!

144
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,290
Yeah, yeah...

145
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,260
My family have always been "Romanies,"
wandering about in search of love.

146
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,390
You don't know anything, do you?
That's another term for Gypsies!

147
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,800
Everyone else, like you guys, with no
pride in their lives are called "Gorgio."

148
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,830
I'm fine with being a "Gorgio."

149
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,340
It's calling me...
The great outdoors is calling out to me...

150
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,150
You can do all of this with the cops.

151
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,510
Let's go, Jet.

152
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,950
Oh, fine. I won't run.
At least untie one hand!

153
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,750
I can't even go to
the bathroom like this!

154
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,710
Man, we got one yappy woman here...

155
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,490
Like taking candy from a baby.

156
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,770
More like a small sacrifice
for a large reward.

157
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,830
As Charlie said, " If you want
to receive, you must first give."

158
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,870
I guess what I see in dreams is
worth something once in a while...

159
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,570
Ow...

160
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,080
What do you think you're doing?

161
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,720
<i>I don't know who you are...</i>

162
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,850
<i>...but I would like the chip back.</i>

163
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,450
<i>I don't know who you are...</i>

164
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,050
<i>...but I refuse.</i>

165
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,190
It's just a chip that
means nothing to you.

166
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,070
<i>Although we can sell what's</i>
<i>IN the chip for a pretty penny,</i>

167
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,400
There was a decryption program
called Crypt-Breaker...

168
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,380
...that was developed by
SIT three years ago.

169
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,420
Rumors say that right after its
completion, the programmer was killed,

170
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,040
and the program
went into the black market.

171
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,360
<i>It's a "magic key" that can decode and</i>
<i>unlock almost every protection code.</i>

172
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,990
<i>But that program itself was encoded.</i>

173
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,990
So, there was a need to find
the key to open the program.

174
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,340
I heard rumors that both the cops and the
ISSP were parting hairs to find the key...

175
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,310
I never thought I would see
it in a place like this.

176
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,550
You're pretty good.

177
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,210
I used to work in a shady
place called the ISSP.

178
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,710
<i>I'm sure the casino was to</i>
<i>take attention away from...</i>

179
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,810
<i>...the large sum of money,</i>
<i>and to fool the cops...</i>

180
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,620
<i>You just chose the wrong day,</i>

181
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,220
<i>Of course, this thing is</i>
<i>useless for us as well.</i>

182
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,660
<i>It would only be proper</i>
<i>to give it to the cops.</i>

183
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,790
I'll pay.

184
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,070
<i>300 million... Nah, too much.</i>
<i>How about 30 million?</i>

185
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,600
<i>Not bad for the price</i>
<i>of a magic key, eh?</i>

186
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,970
All right...

187
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,990
<i>Okay, 6 million turns into 30 million.</i>

188
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,730
The money just keeps growing...

189
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,400
<i>Don't get caught off-guard.</i>

190
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,570
Okey dokey.

191
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,850
Someone who specifies cash
up front is rare nowadays.

192
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm an old-fashioned guy.

193
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,960
<i>All right.</i>

194
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,770
We'll both count to three.

195
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,700
At which point, we will release the
magnetic field of the suitcase...

196
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,870
<i>...and send it that way,</i>

197
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,430
<i>You toss the chip our way,</i>

198
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,310
Okay.

199
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm trusting you...

200
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,490
When you confirm that we got
the chip, sink that ship.

201
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:56,990
Roger.

202
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,950
Let's go!

203
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,690
One.

204
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,960
Two.

205
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,890
Three.

206
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,910
Shutters are meant to be OPENED!

207
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,150
What!?

208
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,640
Hi, "Gorgio."

209
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,340
Hey, "Romani."

210
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,470
Bye!

211
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,070
Don't let her get away! Fire!!

212
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,050
Shit!

213
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,090
Jet, let's get outta here!

214
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,820
All right!

215
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,830
Get them! Get them!
What the hell are you doing!?

216
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,480
She dropped chaff!

217
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,220
What?

218
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,620
Missiles are approaching!

219
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,380
That wench...

220
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,490
It's only proper to use it.

221
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,460
Guess we have to build up
again from square one.

222
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,230
That's cheating!

223
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,070
COMING EPISODE

224
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,070
It sucks... this world is
such an unruly place.

225
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,720
Economic recession everywhere,
making kids lose their minds...

226
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Come on, this isn't the time
to be reading the paper!

227
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,080
Things aboard the Bebop are
becoming even more unruly!

228
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,950
Bah, this is nothing!

229
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,290
Look at this... terrorists!

230
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,380
Apparently they want
to blow Ganymede up.

231
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,920
Oh? Environmental Protection Society?

232
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,060
Perfect! We can have them
take care of this fleabag.

233
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,260
Next episode: Gateway Shuffle.

234
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,050
GATEWAY SHUFFLE

235
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,600
Man, I'M about to lose it.
