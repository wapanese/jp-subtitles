1
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,610
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

2
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,860
Those who don't work, don't eat.

3
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,590
Go find your own food.

4
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,900
Me? I'm okay.

5
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,100
Women are grand by birth.

6
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,040
3 million...

7
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,710
Well, I'll have the
guys earn it for me.

8
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,580
Damn, blues harp music is good.
It's just as good as I thought.

9
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,050
I thought you were a fan of jazz music?

10
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
Don't be stupid.

11
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,460
I even warbled when I was
sucking on my mother's milk!

12
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,530
You were a pretty thoughtful kid...

13
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,330
No mistake, that's Giraffe.

14
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,970
All right, I'm going from the right.

15
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,880
You go from the left.

16
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,210
There's a fatso in the way...

17
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,180
That's... Fatty.

18
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,590
The ball's in your court.

19
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920
Hey, Fatty!

20
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,930
Fatty River! Long time no see!

21
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,590
Oh! Who'd have thought, it's Jet Black!

22
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,930
When the hell did you get here?

23
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,660
How about you? You look so easygoing!

24
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,870
Did ya catch a big one?

25
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,440
I didn't know you were
a fan of blues music.

26
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,240
You're kidding me.

27
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,770
I've lived only for the blues
since I was in my dad's sack!

28
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,350
Give him back!

29
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,190
Zebra!

30
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,870
Hey you! Don't die!

31
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,060
HEY!

32
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,540
Shit, are you going to
wipe out my bounty?

33
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,910
D-Don't be fooled by his appearance...

34
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,880
You idiot! Don't speak!

35
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,210
...him... Help...

36
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,580
...him...

37
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,560
This stone...

38
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,320
HEY!

39
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,590
I can't say for sure
until I analyze it...

40
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,360
...but it might be worth a hefty sum...

41
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,260
So, what are ya gonna do?

42
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,030
Like I know?

43
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,160
HE's the one who gave it to me and
HE's the one who went off and died.

44
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,830
I see no harm in keeping it.

45
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,840
There is no harm.

46
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,000
After all, it's not your
duty to help the kid.

47
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,480
This is gonna pay for OUR food.
There's none for YOU.

48
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,540
You have such a poor heart...

49
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,050
I'm not like that.

50
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,450
Here, have a gift.

51
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,250
Oh, what's this?

52
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,630
An invoice? What for?

53
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,030
All the expenses that you've
racked up on our ship.

54
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,860
Thanks for your business!

55
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,960
You're welcome.

56
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,970
So why are you asking
about the dead bounty?

57
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,670
Well... uh...

58
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,940
So you were after Giraffe, too.

59
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,540
Ya got a good deal?

60
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,280
Go ahead, eat.

61
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,860
Ah well.
There's no bounty in it anyway.

62
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,760
Yeah. No gain at all.

63
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,890
No, no. There really is nothing.

64
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,090
Ah well. You'll owe me one for today.

65
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,560
You know that kid on the
blues harp the other day?

66
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,510
Giraffe was after
that kid Wen's father.

67
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,170
His old acquaintance, Zebra.

68
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,610
Acquaintance?

69
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,580
You didn't even know that?

70
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,280
That they were the top of the Volunteer
Self Defense Squad until ten years ago?

71
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,250
<i>But why is he after an old comrade?</i>

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,230
<i>Ten years ago, Zebra and Giraffe</i>
<i>attempted to reclaim a certain facility,</i>

73
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,900
<i>But, a few days later,</i>
<i>Zebra ends up missing...</i>

74
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,930
<i>...and Giraffe finds himself blindfolded</i>
<i>in a weird place he'd never seen before.</i>

75
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,680
<i>Giraffe was going after the top spot</i>
<i>in the group, but he was betrayed.</i>

76
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,910
<i>But Zebra was still alive...</i>

77
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,500
So, in the end, Giraffe was
killed by some form of betrayal?

78
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,300
Women easily betray others,
but men live for duty.

79
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,300
Duty, huh?

80
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,270
That's what I'd like to believe.

81
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,160
Who are you?

82
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,140
Someone suspicious.

83
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,870
What do you want?

84
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,250
Giraffe asked me...

85
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,910
...to help you.

86
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,490
But Zebra shot Giraffe...

87
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,850
Yeah...

88
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,130
Then why did Giraffe tell
him to help the kid?

89
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,860
This kid's showing up here, too.

90
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
He must be pretty famous.

91
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,430
Yeah. The kid's a genius.

92
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,600
This guy isn't Zebra!

93
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,970
What?!

94
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,670
Look... the date!

95
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,940
What the?!

96
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,950
Why the hell is this kid in an article
from 30 years ago with the same face?!

97
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,680
Come on. There's nothing to fear.

98
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
Come over here.

99
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,780
Little twerps should stay outta this.

100
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,770
If you stick your neck
in too far, you'll get burnt.

101
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,760
Don't give me that
conceited crap, kid.

102
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,710
I ain't a kid.

103
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,680
All kids say that.

104
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,140
I may look like this, but...

105
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,170
...I've been alive since
the days when humans...

106
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,950
...crawled only on
the face of the Earth.

107
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,860
It started on the day of the accidental
explosion of the hyperspace gate.

108
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,220
My body has ceased to age.

109
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,970
I can't die.

110
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,070
The guys that took interest in me, and
experimented on me, all died before me.

111
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,350
The end for this guy started
when he snuck into the lab.

112
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,110
I needed a "parent" to use as a cover.

113
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,050
<i>D- Don't be fooled</i>
<i>by his appearance...</i>

114
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,060
<i>...him...</i>

115
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,520
<i>Help...</i>

116
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,990
<i>...him...</i>

117
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,660
I think this was the third guy.

118
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,430
Now, gimme the ring.

119
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,940
Ring? What ring?

120
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,810
That's fine...

121
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,010
Even if you had it,
it's a pearl before swine.

122
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,450
Give me a break, you big klutz!

123
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,820
You're lucky you got
away with this little...

124
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,460
...since we don't have
the money for a funeral!

125
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,460
Sorry.

126
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,200
Knock it off, Ein!

127
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,710
Shut up.

128
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,940
Oh?

129
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,690
Jet, the alpha-catch.

130
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,030
Shit... this piece of junk...

131
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,630
All right!

132
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,330
Now... what are ya seein'?

133
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,340
The hotel.

134
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,050
He's remembering the time
that Giraffe died.

135
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,010
<i>Give him back! Zebra!</i>

136
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,540
<i>Come over here!</i>

137
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,810
Shit!

138
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,410
And then what?

139
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,220
What did Giraffe say?!

140
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,590
<i>I have it now.</i>
<i>I can do you in with this.</i>

141
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,220
<i>This is a stone that</i>
<i>will return time to you!</i>

142
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,690
<i>Now, hand Zebra over to me!</i>

143
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,200
<i>Zebra!</i>

144
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,430
When the Gate exploded,
a vast amount of energy and...

145
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,130
...an imaginary coordinate system
were created from the...

146
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,410
...resulting twists in hyperspace and
got enclosed into the gem of this ring.

147
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,150
And that same energy broke
Wen's circadian rhythm.

148
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,350
His pineal gland continually
produces a substance...

149
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,730
...similar to melatonin
that inhibits aging.

150
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,160
That's how the theory
goes in a nutshell...

151
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,360
You understand?

152
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,660
Like I do...

153
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,660
I don't either.

154
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,800
So, in other words,
there's no way to make sure...

155
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,070
...other than to stick
that gem into Wen.

156
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,100
I don't know what will happen.

157
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,640
It might explode the
moment you shoot it in...

158
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,150
This makes me excited.

159
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,530
What?

160
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,920
I thought this might be
the last time I'd see you...

161
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,560
...so I thought I'd see you off.

162
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,660
Oh, so you're finally
going to leave us?

163
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,730
No, you aren't coming back.

164
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,510
I don't like it.

165
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,510
I don't like it one bit.

166
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,230
Men are such idiots...

167
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,710
I see...

168
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,170
I can finally die now...

169
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,140
I feel so heavy...

170
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,950
But... I feel so at ease now...

171
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,120
Do you know?

172
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,590
Do you understand? Do YOU...

173
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,840
Like I do...

174
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,190
COMING EPISODE

175
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,700
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HEAVY METAL IS?!

176
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,360
WHAT?! I DIDN'T CATCH THAT!

177
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,300
HEAVY METAL, I SAID, HEAVY METAL!

178
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,640
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

179
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,080
HEY, CAN YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS RACKET?!

180
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,280
