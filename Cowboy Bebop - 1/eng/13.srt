1
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,010
I'm gonna go look.

2
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,250
What?

3
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,520
I'm gonna look for my woman.

4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,680
You can look for that other woman.

5
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,530
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

6
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,500
I feel like I'm in a confessional...

7
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,000
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

8
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,040
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

9
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,840
We still haven't settled
the score from earlier.

10
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,080
Any time.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,710
Lin!

12
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,920
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,120
Lin...

14
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,980
JUPITER JAZZ(Part II)

15
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,750
I was in the same unit
as Vicious on Titan.

16
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,250
You said that you
didn't need comrades...

17
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,730
...but I'm attracted to that word.

18
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,230
To the point of tears...

19
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,140
On Titan, we were all comrades...

20
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,460
What song is that?

21
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,030
Julia...

22
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,600
That's a good tune.

23
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,700
Would you mind if I played that tune on
my sax when I go home after all this?

24
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,390
After I came home from
the war, I was imprisoned.

25
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,120
They suspected that I was a spy.

26
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,820
I heard that Vicious
testified against me.

27
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,090
In prison, I went insane from insomnia.

28
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,190
As a result, I became a drug addict.

29
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,900
There were side effects...

30
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,740
My hormonal balance went out of whack,
and this is what happened.

31
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,240
You're the second person to know
Vicious since I arrived here.

32
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,580
And the second that I've
talked about this to...

33
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,080
Why are you going to see Vicious?

34
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,750
Didn't you just say that he framed you?

35
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,690
I want to see if he really did.

36
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
You're going to die.

37
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm not afraid to die.

38
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,750
You're lying.

39
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,760
Either way, I won't last much longer.

40
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,070
Why did you bring me here?

41
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,440
Perhaps I wanted to be with someone...

42
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,940
You selfishly help people,
and bring them along...

43
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,540
...and then you go off to die?

44
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,920
Are you sure it was this woman?

45
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,160
Yeah... It's been 6 months since
I last saw a woman in the flesh...

46
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,500
...and 2 years since I saw
someone that good-looking.

47
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,970
Of course I wouldn't make a mistake!

48
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,700
I never wanna live in this town...

49
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,440
She sat there, and was talking to Gren.

50
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,450
Julia always sat in that seat, too.

51
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,280
Julia?

52
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,190
She suddenly wandered in 2 years ago,
and disappeared before a month passed.

53
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,450
What kinda woman was she?

54
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,250
She was a real babe.

55
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,460
<i>I'm the only one that</i>
<i>can keep you alive...</i>

56
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,940
<i>And I'm the only one</i>
<i>that can kill you...</i>

57
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,210
<i>I'm only watching a dream</i>
<i>that I never awakened from.</i>

58
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,980
<i>It's like I am watching a dream...</i>

59
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,340
<i>Be careful when you're with that woman.</i>

60
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,110
<i>Women are all liars...</i>

61
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,320
<i>When this is over,</i>
<i>I'm getting out of all this.</i>

62
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,520
<i>And then... will you come with me?</i>

63
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,520
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

64
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,930
<i>They're going to kill you...</i>

65
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,290
<i>Oh, you're finally up.</i>

66
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,400
<i>You've slept too much.</i>
<i>It's been three days.</i>

67
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,230
<i>Your left eye and right eye</i>
<i>are different colors...</i>

68
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,840
<i>My left eye sees the past...</i>

69
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,580
<i>Then what about your right eye...?</i>

70
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,370
I'm not dead...

71
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,850
Which way is west?

72
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,790
Thanks.

73
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,460
Tranquilizer, huh?
They're mocking me...

74
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,860
Sorry, but can I ask ya something?

75
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,160
Where is a blue apartment
building called Orlando?

76
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,220
Don't ask me! I don't know anything!

77
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,290
Um, come on...

78
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,640
I want nothing to do with
foreigners from now on...

79
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,270
I'm just asking!

80
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,770
I'm gonna go find an honest job...

81
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,850
What the hell?

82
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,020
It's HERE...

83
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,150
Hey!

84
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,220
Hey, get it together!

85
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,390
Jet?

86
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,630
What the hell are you doing?

87
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,340
What's all this about?

88
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,570
He was one of THOSE kinds of guys?

89
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,760
What are you saying?

90
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,800
Gren... isn't like that.

91
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,810
Gren?

92
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,980
"Mangan", with "ura-dora"...

93
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,650
He's using an ancient code...

94
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,090
Julia was here... in this town.

95
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,060
<i>Yo.</i>

96
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,260
Yeah?

97
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
<i>Got anything?</i>

98
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,560
None.

99
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>I got something good.</i>

100
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,530
Catch 'em yourself.

101
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,500
I know about the guy from
that code name "Julia".

102
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,710
<i>It's a guy named Gren.</i>

103
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,880
<i>He's an escaped convict,</i>
<i>and has a hefty bounty on his head.</i>

104
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,880
<i>If you catch him, I'll let you back on.</i>

105
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,620
Hello?

106
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,140
<i>I'm overhead.</i>

107
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,200
<i>Come to the roof of the</i>
<i>building closest to the sky.</i>

108
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,180
I'll send a woman over.

109
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,730
<i>I don't care...</i>

110
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,180
<i>Although I would have</i>
<i>liked to see you as well...</i>

111
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,850
You broke the Bebop, but kept
the Swordfish and Hammerhead mobile.

112
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,520
Did you leave that message
so that we'd come find you?

113
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,220
You've got to be kidding.

114
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,690
Were you just testing us?

115
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,700
Why did you come here?

116
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,400
I want my money back.

117
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,700
The safe...

118
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,930
...only had 20,000 in it.

119
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,670
Is that so?

120
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,770
Dummy.

121
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,110
Hey... Who is Julia?

122
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,280
Dunno... but she has
something to do with Spike.

123
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,280
That's all I know.

124
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,610
Souvenir, souvenir, is it here yet?

125
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,590
It has an EX+ ranking. It's real.

126
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,560
Hand it over.

127
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,300
This is the Titan Opal
that you requested.

128
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,800
Give Gren my regards.

129
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,210
You saved me from that
scorpion back then...

130
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,540
Yet you sold me out...

131
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,760
Gren?

132
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,230
Long time no see.

133
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,600
What are you up to?

134
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,900
You gave me that
music box because you...

135
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,710
...never thought I'd take
it apart and examine it?

136
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,510
You found the transmitter...

137
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,170
Julia was the one who found it.

138
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,880
She realized as soon as she
heard it was a gift from you.

139
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,750
And what about it?

140
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,050
Are you trying to kill me again?

141
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,060
We fought in the war together...
We were comrades...

142
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,540
We fought together...
on that desert battlefield...

143
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,240
I looked up to you...

144
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,980
I believed in you...

145
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,710
There is nothing there to believe.

146
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,910
Nor is there a need to believe...

147
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,590
Sir Vicious!

148
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,170
In this world...
there is nothing to believe in...

149
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,690
Vicious!

150
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,460
Lin's soul won't be saved since he lost
his life protecting someone like you!

151
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,260
I'm not what he was protecting!

152
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,430
He protected the rules!

153
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,690
You're in the way!

154
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,820
Hey! Come on, get a grip!

155
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,690
Hey!

156
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,220
Where is Julia?
Where did she go?!

157
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,160
Do you know her?

158
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,470
Where is she now?

159
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,710
He hit some vital organs.

160
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,040
Shit, would an ambulance
come to a place like this?

161
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,490
Can you lift me up into the pod again?

162
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,320
I want to go to Titan...

163
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,490
You can't possibly last
in your condition!

164
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,020
It would take too long!

165
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,930
I won't last long anyway...

166
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,530
Dying during the voyage
would be a good way to go...

167
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,630
I want to return there...
one more time.

168
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,840
I want to be as close
as I can... Please...

169
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,850
I see.

170
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,390
You are Spike.

171
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,590
Julia was always talking about you...

172
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,400
That your two eyes were
of different colors...

173
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,840
That's what she said...

174
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,340
That you get a strange feeling
when you look into his eyes...

175
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,410
What was she doing?

176
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,080
In the corner seat of the bar...

177
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,550
She always sat there while
I wasn't paying attention...

178
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,430
She always requested the same song...

179
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,920
...and smiled.

180
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Sadly... smiled.

181
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,800
What do you have?

182
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,810
<i>Nothing.</i>

183
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,280
<i>Hurry up and get in. We're taking off.</i>

184
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,020
Julia...

185
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,220
What?

186
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,290
Mm... nothing. Just an
adult's idle muttering.

187
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,730
Where did all of you guys go?

188
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,160
Someplace good.

189
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,500
Ed's the only one left out!

190
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll tell you someday.

191
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,810
Nah, it's okay, really.

192
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,670
You're not being cute.

193
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,660
The star fell, Bull.

194
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,430
That is no ordinary star.

195
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,730
That is the tear of a warrior.

196
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,740
What is a warrior?

197
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,760
One who has finished his
battle somewhere on this planet...

198
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,380
A pitiful soul that could
not believe in the Great Spirit...

199
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,690

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,050
"In life, darkness looms
one inch away from you."

202
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,310
"This world is truly full of mistakes."

203
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,910
"In that case, we'll step
away from the mainstream..."

204
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,150
"...and lead the life of a dropout."

205
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,150
A psychedelic rhapsody for
someone just like you.
