1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,500
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD

2
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,460
And so, the turtle took him to a
place called Ryuuguujou as a reward.

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,760
Ryuuguujou?

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,030
Yeah. At that palace,
they held a welcome party for him.

5
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,200
Beautiful women,
and scrumptious feasts.

6
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
Breams and halibut swam about...

7
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,600
...and so he spent his
time as if in a dream.

8
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,130
I see...

9
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,340
I haven't eaten breams or
halibut in quite a while...

10
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,410
Days passed before he knew it,
and when he was about to go back...

11
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,480
...he was given the Tamatebako
as a souvenir.

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,850
Tamatebako? Is that yummy?

13
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,590
It's not food.
It's a chest with treasure inside.

14
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,600
I haven't seen any treasure
in quite a while either...

15
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,860
You guys are so tasteless.
This is an old fantasy tale!

16
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,270
The turtle's Tamatebako...

17
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,740
What were you listening to?

18
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,380
I should quit the horses now.

19
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,010
Pay up 6300 woolongs.

20
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,980
What, where did that come from?

21
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,500
This was for you.

22
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,380
For... me?

23
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,250
C.O.D. even.

24
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,780
To top it off, no return address.

25
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,310
I had no choice but to accept it...

26
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,090
H-Hey! Wait!!

27
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,260
HEY! What about the 6300 woolongs?!

28
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,230
Busy woman.

29
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,140
Could it be a collection agency
from the life extension firm?

30
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,160
Or...

31
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,730
No, could it be...

32
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,800
Oooh... I just have too
many things it could be...

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,370
So for now, I'll just run away!

34
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,650
Don't you think it's fishy?

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,410
For a woman who always claims
other people's property...

36
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,220
...as her own to run away
without even touching it?

37
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,590
She seems to have picked up a lot
of grudges from all over, though.

38
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,730
I should do an explosives test and
a biochemical test just in case...

39
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,630
No!

40
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,830
I should return this to
the courier service...

41
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,600
...and have them refund
the money I paid for her sake...

42
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,900
Hey, Spike!

43
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,390
What the hell is this?

44
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,890
Does it make any ticking noises?

45
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,220
Nope.

46
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,090
I got data!

47
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,290
Data from the courier service!

48
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,200
The sender is...

49
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
A nonprofit nunnery in Europa?!

50
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,960
There's more...

51
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,970
Pluto Prison?

52
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,100
Asteroid Actors' Studio?

53
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,310
Fourth Uranus Observatory?

54
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,840
Venus News Network?

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,820
Forwarded, forwarded,
and forwarded some more...

56
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,160
This thing's been passed
around the entire solar system...

57
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,550
Here.

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,030
Due to the explosion of the Lunar Gate,
all data from before 2022 has been lost.

59
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,660
An antique.

60
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,100
It seems to be something
called a videotape.

61
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,730
An artifact of the good old days.

62
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,540
She's the one that ran away.

63
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,570
She has no right to complain
even if we sell it off.

64
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,210
You think it will sell?

65
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,040
They say he's a maniac when it
comes to 20th century images...

66
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,180
- I'm sure he'd buy it.
- I just don't think this is worth anything.

67
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,090
The real worth of treasures like this
can't be determined from the outside.

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,290
You may be surprised at how
much you can sell it for!

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,260
I need to get enough to cover
the C.O.D. charges at least.

70
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,530
Excuse me!

71
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,190
<i>So...</i>

72
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,000
QUIET!

73
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,470
<i>Everything about this city is different</i>
<i>from Minnesota, where we were before.</i>

74
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,670
<i>Hey, brother, are you sure</i>
<i>we can get along well here?</i>

75
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,380
<i>Mm... To tell the truth,</i>
<i>I wasn't so sure that we could.</i>

76
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,780
<i>But, I'm sure we'll be all right.</i>

77
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,150
<i>Because I'm here with my twin sister.</i>

78
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,650
<i>Thanks, brother.</i>

79
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,920
<i>Oh man, I have to work in the morning!</i>

80
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,330
<i>Good night, brother.</i>

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,350
<i>Good night!</i>

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,830
GOD, that's good! Drama series
from the 20th century are so good!

83
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,840
On the other hand...
Drama series as of late are so...

84
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,970
I have something you want to watch...

85
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,440
Hey, hey, hey, you can't do that!!

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,210
The cigarette, man, the cigarette!

87
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,510
Don't you know that smoke can totally
screw up electrical appliances?

88
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,380
Sheesh, this is why I hate
people who don't know...

89
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,460
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! SHEESH!

90
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,260
What the hell do you guys want?!

91
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,990
What do you have against me?!

92
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,860
No grudges, but no gratitude, either.

93
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,890
I just have something we
want you to buy from us.

94
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,530
Ah! Is that a Beta cassette?!

95
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,690
That's amazing!

96
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,470
Where did you get a hold of this?

97
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,800
This is a true find, mister!

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,710
It's close to a miracle that
this thing exists in one piece!

99
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,670
Beta?

100
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,700
You don't know what this is?

101
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,810
Oh, all right, do you
want me to explain?

102
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,120
Back in the 20th Century, they didn't
use disks like we do to record movies.

103
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,080
They used things called video tapes,
which are in cassettes like this.

104
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,090
It's not digital! It's analog!

105
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,320
And to top it off,
it's magnetic... Yeah, magnetic!

106
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,060
They were recording with electromagnetic
signals! Ain't that amazing?

107
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,540
But a disagreement between
the companies who created...

108
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,230
...this technology resulted
in two standards, Beta and VHS.

109
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,210
Beta had a small cassette
for their day...

110
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,110
...and the playback decks were
compact and didn't take much space.

111
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,980
You didn't get that much
noise when using the special...

112
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,670
...replay features like
still frame and slow motion.

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,450
And, because Beta had
high quality images...

114
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,350
...users who were into good graphics
supported it really heavily.

115
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,590
But, there begins the unfortunate
history of the Beta tape.

116
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,060
You don't need to tell me.

117
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,450
This is just the introduction!

118
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,660
I told you what we wanted.

119
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,530
So how is it? Are ya gonna buy it?

120
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,970
Well, that depends on what's on it...

121
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,760
Hey, what's wrong?

122
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,000
It's so hard to adjust the tracking
for these early Beta tapes...

123
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,770
This way?

124
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,240
Or this way?

125
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,720
It's eating the tape!!

126
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,960
It's not getting any better...

127
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,070
It's coming...

128
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,440
It is... It is...

129
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,840
I got it!

130
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,880
Dogs are better than horses after all!

131
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,340
Most things get better if I kick 'em.

132
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,120
You just don't know when to quit.

133
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,560
<i>Dammit, repay me for breaking my deck!</i>

134
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,130
You again...

135
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,930
<i>You broke someone else's</i>
<i>valuable machinery...</i>

136
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,870
<i>...and you're not going</i>
<i>to take responsibility for it?!</i>

137
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,270
And how are you going to take
responsibility for our valuable tape?

138
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,640
<i>Early Beta decks often eat tapes!</i>

139
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,940
<i>In any case, I'll have you</i>
<i>pay for the repair costs!</i>

140
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,500
We'll call it even with
the cost of the tape!

141
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,810
<i>WHAT?! Be...</i>

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,710
Sheesh...

143
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,380
Hello, Beta deck!

144
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,310
There's just one of those.

145
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,260
Where is this?

146
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,230
The Underground City
Electrical Museum in old Asia?

147
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,630
I'm going to figure out what's
on that tape at any cost!

148
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,190
Is it really something
worth all the trouble?

149
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,440
It's coming...
It's... It's... It's...

150
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,910
YEAH! I got it!!

151
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,900
Really, I wonder if those guys were
sucking up all my luck all this time.

152
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,470
<i>Ah... Hello.</i>

153
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,810
Hello?

154
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,350
Hey, helllllloooooo...

155
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
<i>Ah... it's... Faye... Yoohoo...</i>

156
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,820
Wait... Hello?

157
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,320
What is this, where are you guys?

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
<i>Earth...</i>

159
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,150
<i>Earth!</i>

160
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,320
Earth?!

161
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,730
Wait a minute, you guys left me
behind to go that far away...

162
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,700
<i>Spike... and Jet...</i>

163
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,360
All right, just a little longer.

164
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,130
Is there really one left
in a place like this?

165
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,090
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

166
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,900
28th underground floor.

167
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,380
It's not moving?

168
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,860
The cable broke, so it's stuck.

169
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,940
Why are we going through all of this?

170
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,570
It just means that
treasure-hunting isn't easy.

171
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,180
Treasure?

172
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,980
What was the treasure we were after?

173
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,680
The Tamatebako, was it?

174
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,360
I kinda see why the
man turned into an...

175
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,880
...old geezer after
opening the Tamatebako now.

176
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,760
Even if we head back now,
we're not gonna be any younger.

177
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,100
This is some Ryuuguujou...

178
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,340
Where DID that broad go
in the first place?!

179
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,870
It's coming... It's, it's...

180
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,790
Oh well, nothing I could've done.

181
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,520
Races are all luck anyway.

182
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,360
Is it here?

183
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,810
It's here.

184
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,830
All right.

185
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,950
Is this it?

186
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,820
Yeah, that's gotta be it.

187
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,830
And?

188
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,690
Which one are we taking back?

189
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,830
Let's see...

190
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,300
Well, bigger is always
better, they say.

191
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,450
What's wrong?

192
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,820
The size...

193
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,720
Isn't it all right?

194
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,750
It's not going in.

195
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,550
Force it in.

196
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,390
But...

197
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,660
Ah! That's not it!

198
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,260
That's VHS, so...

199
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,530
...ya can't see the tape!

200
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,050
Oh, hello, it's me.

201
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,970
<i>Ein, who are you talking to?</i>

202
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,770
<i>Oh, it's Faye!</i>

203
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm glad there's an organism
there that I can talk to.

204
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,910
<i>What is it?</i>

205
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,380
Was there anyone who went
there to visit me?

206
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,010
<i>Visitors?</i>

207
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,380
Like scary middle-aged guys.

208
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,050
You know, guys that
scream stuff like...

209
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,020
..."gimme back my money!"
or "You're under arrest!"?

210
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,420
<i>Yeah there was one.</i>

211
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,080
Eh? And?

212
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,630
<i>Something about repay him, even with</i>
<i>tape munch, munch and grind, bye -bye!</i>

213
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,530
Eh? Okay...

214
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,520
Oh, well.

215
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,300
Where's Spike and Jet?

216
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,270
<i>Disappointed and zoned out.</i>

217
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,010
I see... Hmm...

218
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,370
That's how...

219
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,470
Oh, well.

220
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,350
If they're so lonely without me,
I guess I have no choice.

221
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,650
I'm coming back!

222
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,320
What?!
Another package for that broad?!

223
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,730
I won't accept it!
Take it and go back!!

224
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,200
Shit, why do I have to
pay for HER C.O.D.?!

225
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,180
And not once, but TWICE!

226
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,440
You sure are persistent.

227
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,460
A Beta!

228
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,080
We can see the tape with this?

229
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,220
Yeah.

230
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,730
Hey guys, long time no see.

231
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,470
It's done.

232
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,510
Hold up.

233
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,710
If you're going to watch...

234
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,220
...pay back the C.O.D. charges.
With tax, a total of 31,500 woolongs.

235
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,620
Oh, fine.

236
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,790
We have something!

237
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,400
Ooooh... what's this?

238
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,670
Shut up and watch.

239
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,060
<i>Um... Everyone decided to...</i>

240
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,830
<i>...send a message to themselves</i>
<i>ten years in the future.</i>

241
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,400
<i>Oh, come on, don't laugh!</i>

242
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,070
<i>Um...</i>

243
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,220
<i>This makes me blush after all!</i>

244
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,740
<i>Eh? Something I want to say?</i>

245
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,790
<i>Good morning...</i>

246
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,790
<i>Oh! Nevermind!!</i>

247
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,610
<i>Good morning, me.</i>

248
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,400
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

249
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,610
<i>And did you wake up well?</i>

250
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:01,550
<i>Does the light and the wind, the air</i>
<i>and the smell, all feel brand new?</i>

251
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,550
<i>Is each and every cell</i>
<i>in your body awake now?</i>

252
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,320
<i>Today, you are who you are today,</i>

253
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,890
<i>You are a newer version of me.</i>

254
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,190
<i>Myself ten years from now...</i>

255
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,640
<i>That's so far away for me that</i>
<i>I can't even begin to imagine.</i>

256
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,470
<i>Am I alone?</i>

257
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,670
<i>Or is there a wonderful</i>
<i>person next to me?</i>

258
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,650
<i>Well, knowing me, I'm sure I am</i>
<i>troubling a lot of different people.</i>

259
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,520
<i>But that's all right.</i>
<i>There's no problem.</i>

260
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,290
<i>I will always be cheering you on.</i>

261
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,590
<i>And now for a big cheer...</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

262
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,370
<i>Go! Go!</i>

263
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,340
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

264
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,430
<i>Do your best, do your best!</i>
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

265
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,310
<i>Don't lose, don't lose!</i>
<i>Me, me, me!</i>

266
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,280
<i>I don't know...</i>

267
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,780
<i>I can't remember...</i>

268
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,290
<i>Is this... me?</i>

269
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,790
<i>I am no longer here.</i>

270
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,360
<i>But I'm here today, and I'll always</i>
<i>be cheering for you right here.</i>

271
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,140
<i>Cheering for you, my only self.</i>

272
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,190
COMING EPISODE

273
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,480
You know, I'm starting to get tired of
us doing all the previews like this.

274
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,740
Once in a while, can't we
have someone else...

275
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,250
Oh? Oh! You're perfect. All right!

276
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,780
Here, you try doing it this time.

277
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,860
Oh! So, THAT'S how it is!

278
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,390
Wow, this is going to be
an interesting episode!

279
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,260
Next Episode: Wild Horses.

280
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,000
Hey, it spoke!

281
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,230
WILD HORSES
