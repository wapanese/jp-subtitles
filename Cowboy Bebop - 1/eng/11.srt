<i>Space travel log 0968.</i>

3
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>We were wasting our free time.</i>

4
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,170
<i>It sounds good to call the</i>
<i>bounty-hunting job a "freelance" job...</i>

5
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,970
<i>...but all that means is</i>
<i>that we're self-employed.</i>

6
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,910
<i>When we have no jobs,</i>
<i>we have none at all.</i>

7
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,970
<i>Well, that's all a
</i><i>part of our destiny...</i>

8
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,210
<i>...but it's troublesome</i>
<i>that we're out of money,</i>

9
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,420
<i>And so, we get urges</i>
<i>to make quick cash...</i>

10
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,290
Any problem with using these?

11
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,330
Evens!

12
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,110
Evens, is it?

13
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,000
No, odds after all!

14
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,010
Odds, is it?

15
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,450
Yeah... odds.

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,920
Double ace... Even.

17
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,640
I can't eat any more...

18
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,540
Well, it would be easiest for
me if you paid up in cash...

19
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,050
So, what'll it be?

20
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,290
A man does not take back his word!

21
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,660
That's why I told you not to do it...

22
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,720
<i>Humans were meant to work and</i>
<i>sweat for their money after all.</i>

23
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,760
<i>Those that try to get rich quick...</i>

24
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,570
<i>...or live at the expense of others...</i>

25
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,170
<i>...all get divine retribution</i>
<i>somewhere along the way,</i>

26
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,510
<i>That is the lesson...</i>

27
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,110
<i>But one thing about</i>
<i>humans is that they...</i>

28
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,240
<i>...quickly forget the</i>
<i>lessons they just learned.</i>

29
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,450
Dammit.

30
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,960
There was a fridge way back here?

31
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,470
<i>"Survival of the fittest"</i>

33
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,680
<i>I've never had anything good</i>
<i>happen to me when I trust others.</i>

34
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,550
<i>That's the lesson.</i>

35
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,030
How much did you swindle?

36
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,430
Would you stop saying things
that would hurt my reputation?

37
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,060
He lost on his own!

38
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,960
Because he couldn't
see through this cheat?

39
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,560
It's part of one's skill
to see through it.

40
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,630
At least give his clothes back to him.

41
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,040
I'll lend them to him.

42
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,770
Greedy, aren't we?

43
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,300
It's rough out there in the real world.

44
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,290
Hey, what's up?

45
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,450
Something bit me.

46
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,260
What do you mean, "something"?

47
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,140
I-It wasn't a rat!

48
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,240
Look at this! This wound on my neck!

49
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,140
HEY!

50
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,670
This is silly. It was a waste
of time running over here.

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,170
Spike! I was bitten around that fridge!

52
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,980
Fridge?

53
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,420
Hmm? You have a clue?

54
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,390
I'm sure... there was something...

55
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,900
Nope, can't remember.

56
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,820
You sure this is gonna work?

57
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,020
The only thing it doesn't work on
are nearsightedness and cavities.

58
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,020
Then it works on athlete's foot?

59
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,390
Of course.

60
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,730
Don't you have something more
legit that would get rid of sores?

61
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,730
That would be this.

62
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,830
That gets rid of sores?

63
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,770
Yeah.

64
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,830
Crush this, and you boil it
in 3 cups of water until...

65
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,810
...the liquid simmers down
to 1 cup, and you drink it.

66
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,110
Spike, isn't there something more...

67
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,880
...different?

68
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,280
Oh, I got just the thing.

69
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,550
Yeah, gimme that...

70
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,850
Gimme what you had before.

71
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,890
Hey... I'm feeling a lot sicker now...

72
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,200
Do I look pale?

73
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,170
You're pretty pale to begin with.

74
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,400
What is this awful smell?

75
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,460
Herbal medicine.

76
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,000
Herbal medicine? THIS?

77
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,920
It smells like you just left a rag
that cleaned up spilt milk out to dry!

78
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,250
I think it's more like rotten soybeans.

79
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,980
Knock it off!
I have to drink this ya know!

80
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,300
Oh brother.

81
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,600
Hey now, this goes
too far for a joke...

82
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,190
It was a rat, right?

83
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,280
There's nothing to make a fuss about.

84
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,860
Am I wrong?

85
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,790
I have no clue.

86
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,300
He seems to have gotten some poison
that's not in this database.

87
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,260
Looking at similar poisons...

88
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,230
Cryptosporidium...

89
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,260
...that's not it...

90
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,570
Cholera?

91
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,200
Nope...

92
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,240
Ebola virus?

93
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,770
Nope...

94
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,840
Bifidobacterium?

95
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,550
Not even close.

96
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,820
What is it?

97
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,550
Ein, you're being noisy.

98
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,620
I can say for sure that
it wasn't an ordinary rat.

99
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,250
Hey, keep it quiet.

100
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,890
So what is it?

101
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,060
Well, it's...

102
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,460
A mysterious space creature!

103
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,840
Spooky! The attack of
a horrible space creature!

104
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,070
Oh yeah, there's that possibility...

105
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,100
Heh... Yeah, right.

106
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,610
Then what is it?

107
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,410
It's not in the database.

108
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,180
Yeah...

109
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,180
These base-pairs are weird, too.

110
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,980
You think so?

111
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,110
We've never seen symptoms
like this before either.

112
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,490
Other than a space creature,
what is it? What is it?

113
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,120
Well... um, perhaps something like
a rat went through a mutation...

114
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,190
...and evolved into
some mysterious creature...

115
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,170
...and carried a mysterious poison...

116
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,690
What's that about?

117
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,770
That isn't too different from the
"mysterious space creature" theory!

118
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,740
This is too silly.

119
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,340
Aiya... what are we gonna do, Ein?

120
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,540
It's a space creature!

121
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,880
It's spooky!

122
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,580
All right. This is made
to sense heat sources.

123
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,860
It's usually used to find
bounties that are hiding.

124
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,560
Can you see me?

125
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,260
All right, I'm gonna test it,
so move just like I tell you...

126
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,270
Ein! Where are you going?

127
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,330
Hey, wait!

128
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,570
HEY!

129
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,140
That's weird... Is it broken?

130
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,580
Was that response from you?

131
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,150
That story you were telling, about some
mysterious creature or something or other...

132
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,530
Oh, yeah.

133
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,890
What happens if you're bitten?

134
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,230
I can't say for sure until we catch
the creature, but I'm going to guess...

135
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,960
...death?

136
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,140
No... why did it have to be this way?

137
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,700
I still have a lot to live for...

138
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,980
I haven't committed any crimes...

139
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,850
I'm still young and lively...

140
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,210
Lively?

141
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,920
Oh, poor little me!

142
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,930
Hey now, why are you
getting into this?

143
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,920

Hey! This isn't hide-and-seek!

150
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,180
Exploration, experimentation,
exclamation.

151
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,490
Lights shine bright in the many towns.

152
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,520
I will come back alive.
I trust you, Ed.

Really...

158
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,160
Ein, Ed... What happened?

159
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,270
Ein!

Where's Ed?

162
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,840
I can't believe it got you this easily.

163
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,120
You're a dog!
Where're your natural instincts?!

164
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,070
No choice...
Guess I'm going in!

Ed! You aren't here, are you? Hey!

171
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,580
Did that thing get her, too?

172
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,160
Don't surprise me!

Got 'im!

177
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,770
This thing seems familiar...

178
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,720
I guess I shoulda eaten that...

179
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,850
Oh yeah, it should be in the fridge...

180
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,960
<i>That was when</i>
<i>I remembered everything.</i>

181
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,760
<i>It was... oh, one year ago.</i>

182
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,360
<i>When I had gotten ahold</i>
<i>of a real lobster...</i>

183
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,670
<i>...I hid it in the fridge</i>
<i>in this stockroom...</i>

184
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,970
<i>...just so nobody,</i>
<i>else would eat it.</i>

185
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,410
<i>But I had forgotten about it, and</i>
<i>left it in there for a whole year...</i>

186
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,650
<i>I wonder what it looks</i>
<i>like in there now...</i>

187
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,970
Shit!

188
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,440
Dammit!

189
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,090
<i>You shouldn't leave</i>
<i>things in the fridge.</i>

190
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,560
<i>That is the lesson.</i>

191
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,680
Sweet bean roll!

192
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,380
Mmm... can't eat anymore...

193
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,190
COMING EPISODE

194
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,790
And so... they all passed away.

195
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,360
Everyone, it was brief,
but thanks for your support.

196
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,530
This was the last episode.

197
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,760
I hope they rest in peace.

198
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,700
Amen.

199
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,110
And starting next episode,
we bring you "Cowgirl Ed"!

200
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,010
I'm the main character!

201
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:32,880
Hey, wait a minute!

202
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,440
What kinda selfish crap is that?!

203
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,180
Next episode: Jupiter Jazz, part 1.

204
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,180

205
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,740
There really is another episode!
