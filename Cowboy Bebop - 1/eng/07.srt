1
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,870
HEAVY METAL QUEEN

2
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,910
VT! Your shift's up?

3
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,180
Finally. How about you?

4
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,210
I'm off to Europa now.

5
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,380
That's got pretty good pay.

6
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,250
It's nothing compared to yours.

7
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,920
I heard you made a round-trip
from here to Venus in 4 days?

8
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,520
Three days.

9
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,930
See what I mean?

10
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,860
Anyway, take it easy.

11
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,520
Thanks.

12
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,620
Oh yeah, I forgot.

13
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,270
VT!

14
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,540
You're still not giving up?

15
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,440
Of course not!
How much do ya think I lent ya?

16
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,600
Suit yourself...

17
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,950
All right. You only get
one shot, and you get no clues.

18
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,580
Yeah! VT, your name is...

19
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,550
Vivian Tillana.

20
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,350
Nope!

21
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,830
Oh, man...

22
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,830
This is a bad omen...

23
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,890
You be careful now.

24
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah, you know that Cock-Eye guy that
was worth 8 million the other day?

25
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,470
Believe it or not,
I was the one who caught him!

26
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,840
What do you mean, the other day?
That was 10 years ago, you old geezer!

27
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,940
What are you saying, you younguns!
I was the one that taught Telpsicorei!

28
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,010
You mean the legendary bounty hunter?

29
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,280
Every bounty cowered in fear just
at the mention of his name...

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,260
Oh, Everyone knows THAT.

31
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,160
Hey, Zeros.

32
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,860
Welcome, VT. The usual?

33
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

34
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,910
What's going on today?
The place is usually empty.

35
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh, this?

36
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,510
Apparently a bounty named Decker
is gonna pass by around here.

37
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,210
They're all bounty hunters.

38
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,980
No wonder they all look so cheap.

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,590
What was that about
'top secret' information?

40
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,590
This place is full of our kind.

41
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,390
And I got a hangover today, too...

42
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,500
Besides, we don't know the face. The
only clue is a dragon-shaped tattoo...

43
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,800
Faye?

44
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,530
Like that place is gonna be any better.

45
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,800
<i>Welcome to Woody's!</i>

46
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,070
<i>Right now, all of our friends who</i>
<i>are celebrating their birthdays...</i>

47
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,450
<i>...can get their pictures taken</i>
<i>with Mackey and Mannie!</i>

48
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,910
<i>Moms and Dads, please tell your server!</i>

49
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,850
Hi.

50
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,990
Whadduyawant? Ya wanna get some?

51
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,500
I'd rather be the one that gives some.

52
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,330
I'm fine with that.

53
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,360
Hands in the air, Decker!

54
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,840
Don't be so difficult!

55
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,870
Just get the hell over here.

56
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,170
But I have work!

57
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,110
Just make yourself comfortable!

58
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,120
Git!

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,010
P-Please, stop.

60
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,350
I'll give you a good time.

61
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,590
Stop!

62
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,320
Someone!

63
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,980
What the hell are ya?

64
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,050
VT!

65
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,690
So it's a bounty hunter's job to chase
a woman's ass instead of a bounty?

66
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,970
Sorry, but this is my job.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,030
W-What...

68
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,510
Don't play dumb with me.

69
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,840
That dragon-shaped tattoo
is unmistakable proof.

70
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,540
Y-You got the wrong man...

71
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,980
Hey, you over there!

72
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,880
Call the police!

73
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,480
Tell them I caught Decker the bounty!

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,530
This is?

75
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,660
Yakkun, the eight-eyed eel...

76
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,730
Don't be so mistakable!

77
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,350
Why you!

78
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,370
You!

79
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,580
VT!

80
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,180
You're wearing my patience thin...

81
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,050
W-What the hell are ya?

82
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,290
Grudges over lost food
aren't a pretty sight!

83
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,260
Shit, let's get this guy too!

84
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,240
Found him!

85
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,000
Shit, I'll get you back for this!

86
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,540
Uh, just kidding.

87
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,130
Forget about us!

88
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,320
My 12 million...

89
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,260
Really. Bounty hunters
are all stupid scum.

90
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,220
You think so?

91
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,250
Yeah!

92
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,730
As far as I know, they're all
living their lives by gambling.

93
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,690
Well, maybe so.

94
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Come over here.
I'll treat you to a drink.

95
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,240
What? Bean sprouts are good for you!

96
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,480
Give me a break! That's all we have!

97
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,040
Oh! Here it comes!

98
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,390
Oh, it's you, Faye. That was quick...

99
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,050
WHAT!?

100
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,400
But that sure is a disgusting drink.

101
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,260
It's a prairie oyster.

102
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,660
It's good for hangovers.

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,570
You're the second person I've
met that drinks that stuff.

104
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,600
And the first one?

105
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,800
My husband.

106
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,440
VT!

107
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,210
We'll get it this time.

108
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:35,910
The money!

109
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,040
Once for the three of you?

110
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,280
Yeah!

111
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,450
Suit yourself.

112
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,060
All right! Here we go!

113
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,260
VT, your name is...

114
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,560
I think Adrienne is good...

115
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,030
That doesn't start with a V.

116
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,630
That's why I said we should
stick with Leticia!

117
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,500
You think so?

118
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,600
I can have that money if
I guess your name?

119
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,870
Yeah.

120
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,880
I don't remember who started it...

121
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,280
...but it kept piling up
and here we are now.

122
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,580
Can I try too?

123
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,010
<i>Spike! It's me!</i>

124
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,280
<i>Faye let Decker get away.</i>

125
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,260
<i>Go after him now...</i>

126
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,250
Spike!

127
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,960
Get lost!

128
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,300
Idiotic lying scum!

129
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,360
I ain't treating YOU!

130
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,470
No, Spike!

131
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,010
Oh, my.

132
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh, this, those whachamacallit brothers
did this before they took off.

133
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,320
And you were watching?

134
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,450
Uh-huh.

135
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,160
Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,120
What? I just told you right now!

137
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,230
What?

138
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,940
Hey, VT... going home?

139
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,000
Got a problem with that?

140
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,240
Come on, Zeros.

141
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,750
...and what are YOU doing?

142
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,520
Hitchhiking.

143
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,790
My machine was vandalized.

144
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,950
You're really a stupid...

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,730
...lying, shameless scum
of a bounty hunter?

146
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,260
If you don't stop with all this!

147
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,030
Follow me.

148
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,470
Can I bring someone with me?

149
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,460
MAN! HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO SAY THE SAME THING!?

150
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,090
HE WAS SHORT, BALD, WEARING
GLASSES, AND A SARASVATI...

151
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,820
HUH!? WHAT!?

152
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,350
I JUST SAID...

153
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,460
REALLY! CAN YOU TURN THAT
SHIT-LOUD NOISE OFF!?

154
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,700
They say, "When in Rome,
do as the Romans do."

155
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,000
And it's not shit-loud noise.

156
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,410
It's called heavy metal!

157
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,660
Really, both of you together...

158
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,160
Who do you think is
going to repair these?

159
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,760
What the hell am I supposed to do
with that little bit of information?

160
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,400
How many bald people with glasses do
you think there are in this universe?

161
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,570
So I said, bald, short, with glasses...

162
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,700
...and driving a gaudy truck
with Sarasvati painted on it!

163
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,440
Yeah?

164
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
<i>That you, VT?</i>

165
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,680
Oh, Otto. What's up?

166
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,790
<i>I got into a hit-and-run.</i>

167
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,260
<i>The guy cut in line at the gate</i>
<i>entrance, rammed me, and took off!</i>

168
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,090
<i>Shit, I gotta make him pay for repairs!</i>

169
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,960
<i>Tell me if you see him!</i>

170
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,430
<i>Anything specific?</i>

171
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,960
Let's see...

172
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,440
There was some oriental
goddess drawn on...

173
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,130
<i>Wait a minute! Was it Sarasvati?</i>

174
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,440
Oh yeah, her. How'd you know?

175
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,480
Zeros.

176
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,680
<i>Breaker one nine, Breaker one nine.</i>

177
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,690
<i>To all truckers in the asteroid belt.</i>

178
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,810
<i>This is Heavy Metal Queen.</i>

179
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,620
<i>Ring me up if you see a gaudy truck</i>
<i>with Sarasvati painted on it. Thanks.</i>

180
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,420
<i>VT, this is Love Machine.</i>

181
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,190
<i>What's up with it?</i>

182
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,930
<i>Some guy you were chasing ran away?</i>

183
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,630
<i>Something like that.</i>

184
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,970
I haven't seen the guy,
but I'll be on the lookout.

185
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,940
<i>Thanks. It'll help.</i>

186
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,070
This is Sneaky Snake. Did you
say it was a painting of a clown?

187
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,140
<i>Nope.</i>

188
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,020
<i>This is Spider Mike,</i>
<i>Black Panther of Jupiter.</i>

189
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,480
<i>VT, I've never met you but I hear lots</i>
<i>of rumors about the Heavy Metal Queen.</i>

190
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,220
Thanks for the compliment.
So, any info?

191
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,620
I passed by someone like the one you're
looking for about 10 minutes ago.

192
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,920
It was around the Linus mines.

193
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,490
<i>That help?</i>

194
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,900
Thanks, I'll owe you one.

195
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,140
I gotta exchange this too...

196
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,450
There he is!

197
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,300
Trying to throw me off his trail...

198
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,440
Maybe in the next century!

199
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,440
Hey, is the stupid, lying, shameless
scum of a bounty hunter around?

200
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,650
What!? The Linus mines!?

201
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,590
You're being reckless!

202
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,290
<i>What did you say?</i>

203
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,920
Stay away from Decker!

204
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,050
His cargo is dangerous!

205
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,260
HEY!

206
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,630
Wait! I called first dibs on Decker!

207
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,300
What is this? Really?

208
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,870
Do I have to put this silly thing on?

209
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,150
I would have preferred that it was
your loud mouth that broke.

210
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,850
I heard that.

211
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,680
I'm going out, Jet!

212
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,160
Spike, the main gun on that
thing isn't fixed yet!

213
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,520
Nice try, buddy...

214
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,910
What is this?
Isn't this a little risky?

215
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,750
This way!

216
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,800
My 12 million...

217
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,400
<i>Hey Are you alive?</i>

218
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,910
<i>If you hear me, answer!</i>

219
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,580
<i>I'm fine. It takes more</i>
<i>than that to kill me.</i>

220
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,810
We gotta run. Now!

221
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,350
<i>Decker was a master of explosives.</i>

222
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,910
<i>He's currently hauling the solid</i>
<i>nitro he was making deals with.</i>

223
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,190
All of it? That's enough to
blow up this entire asteroid!

224
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,630
<i>On top of it,</i>
<i>this place was an excel mine.</i>

225
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,630
<i>The reactors have been randomly,</i>
<i>exploding for a while now...</i>

226
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,100
We gotta get this truck outta here.

227
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>How much further is the exit?</i>

228
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>A little further...</i>

229
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,100
<i>20 degrees to the left.</i>

230
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,380
There, the exit.

231
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,120
No good.

232
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,680
Behind us!

233
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,750
No! In front!

234
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,450
<i>What's with that?</i>
<i>That's nowhere near enough!</i>

235
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,020
My main gun is busted!

236
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,260
This is all I got!

237
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,860
<i>And THIS is all I have!</i>

238
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,630
What are we gonna do?
Isn't there another way?

239
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,260
<i>Yeah, there is.</i>

240
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,870
There's a ton of it in
the truck behind us!

241
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,070
<i>I don't like this.</i>

242
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,810
<i>I'm not one for delicate</i>
<i>operations like this!</i>

243
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,920
Quit whining.

244
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,180
Let's hit it big!

245
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,490
<i>Yeah, now grab one.</i>

246
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,360
That's easy for you to say.

247
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,170
<i>...something is leaking...</i>

248
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,830
<i>That's probably the stabilizer.</i>

249
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,270
<i>That means...</i>

250
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,780
<i>Touch-sensitive.</i>

251
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,970
<i>Wait a sec!</i>

252
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,750
<i>At worst, you screw up and die.</i>

253
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
<i>I got one.</i>
<i>What do you want to do with it?</i>

254
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,060
<i>This pod will shoot towards the exit</i>
<i>and self-destruct in 40 seconds.</i>

255
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,060
<i>So get that thing in this</i>
<i>pod within 40 seconds.</i>

256
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,940
What are YOU going to do!?

257
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,300
I'm gonna do... this.

258
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,250
Zeros, we're opening the hatch!

259
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,790
Bingo!

260
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,380
It's clear!

261
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,560
This sucks.

262
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,740
Really...

263
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,320
Thanks for the help,
Victoria Telpsicorei.

264
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,850
And give your husband my thanks.

265
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,990
I figured out your
name because of this.

266
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,460
Unless you're a hermit,
everyone knows about him...

267
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,930
About the legendary
bounty hunter, Telpsicorei.

268
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,240
It will be a while.

269
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,470
My husband's working
in Heaven right now.

270
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,910
I see...

271
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,210
Give the rest to your husband.

272
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,350
I'm sure he's suffering
from a hangover...

273
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,250
...so I'll treat him
to a prairie oyster.

274
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,320
COMING EPISODE

275
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,420
Once in a while,
I'll do the preview by myself.

276
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,830
I'm Jet Black, 36 years old.

277
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,930
I'm often told that I don't look 36...

278
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,340
...but you shouldn't judge people by
their looks or how much hair they have.

279
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,000
Things are never what they seem to be.

280
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,700
The next episode is like that, too.

281
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,040
A fairy tale that seems
very unlike Bebop.

282
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,050
Next episode: Waltz for Venus.

283
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,950
Stuff like this is
good once in a while...

284
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,300
WALTZ FOR VENUS
