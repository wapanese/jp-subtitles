1
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,740
WILD HORSES

2
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,790
Really, this just
doesn't suit my style...

3
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,270
...to just sit and wait like this.

4
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,440
We pick our spot, then wait patiently.

5
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,740
That is the secret behind fishing.

6
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,310
<i>Did you ever consider that maybe</i>
<i>this was the WRONG spot?</i>

7
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,250
The bait has no right to complain.

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,020
What are you fishing for?

9
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,960
"Starship Pirates." A group that
calls themselves pirates.

10
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,220
Pirates?

11
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
A group of people that
like to attack a ship...

12
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,270
...and rob anything and
everything from them.

13
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,230
Like to rob, rob, drunken slob!

14
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,240
<i>Besides, where the hell did Spike go?!</i>

15
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,830
<i>He left to overhaul his ship,</i>
<i>and still hasn't...</i>

16
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,310
Thanks.

17
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,250
But Spike... Man...

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,250
What's he doing now,
without giving us a heads-up?

19
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,230
You're late, Doohan!

20
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,250
Yeah! Go, go, go!!

21
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,410
Hey?

22
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,180
HEY!

23
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,050
<i>Strike three! Batter out!</i>

24
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,390
<i>He just let that one slide by...</i>
<i>and that's the game!</i>

25
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,610
Man!

26
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,130
Why didn't they just
send in a pinch-hitter?

27
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,890
Come on, Eightwood is getting OLD!

28
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,860
Don't ya think?

29
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,300
Where's Doohan?

30
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,200
The old man's kinda busy right now.

31
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm Miles, his assistant.
Nice to meet ya.

32
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,140
Man, they were really great when
they won the pennant 14 years ago.

33
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,450
They just kept hittin' the ball one after
another, and turned losing games around!

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Especially when Randy, Blanket,
and Hills hit consecutive homers!

35
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,860
I really wish you coulda seen it.

36
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,220
And ya know...

37
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,170
Hey, do people often say
you're the silent type?

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,510
And people often say you
talk too much, right?

39
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,000
Kinda.

40
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,070
The... Swordfish, right?

41
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,980
The machine back there...

42
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,140
Yeah.

43
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,740
That's the amazing mono-racer
that the old man built, right?

44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,120
It's just an old machine.
I don't want it, but it's a part of me.

45
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,550
I hear ya...

46
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,920
Us Blue Sox fans feel like we
fell for some wicked broad.

47
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,220
Really! I can't remember how many times
I've thought about giving up on them!

48
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,950
Jesus, not again...

49
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,210
Yo, old man!

50
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,400
Yo. Long time no see.

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,370
Yeah.

52
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,160
Miles, where's the checklist?!

53
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,330
It's out there!

54
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
I put it on the ship's body!

55
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,830
He's been fixing that ancient thing?

56
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,210
I think it's useless.

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,910
The computer isn't compatible
with the mono-system.

58
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,310
Miles! Gimme the EV Transmitter,
the absorber for the main gear...

59
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,290
...and the three-eight pneumatic tube!

60
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,150
A three-eight?!
I don't have something that special!

61
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Order one from Reggie.
His place has them!

62
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,060
Yeah, yeah. You really
are some slave driver!

63
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,540
Some hobby!

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,710
Did we catch it?

65
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,640
It wasn't me! Where is it?

66
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,340
It's close! Shit, I used bad bait!

67
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,070
Hey!

68
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,620
This is a good machine.

69
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,930
Attacking blessed people like
them and giving to the poor...

70
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,590
<i>...is human equality,</i>
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

71
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,390
Heh, heh, I get it.

72
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,030
This is what ya call social reform.

73
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,670
<i>Yeah. It's only right for us,</i>
<i>the poor, to take from them!</i>

74
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,670
Something's coming!

75
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,470
Cops?!

76
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,970
Hi.

77
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,470
<i>That's enough.</i>

78
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,840
Bounty-hunter?

79
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,610
Harman.

80
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Be a good girl and come here...

81
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,620
Faye, above you!

82
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,430
What the?! Is this a joke?!

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,570
It's not me!

84
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,770
Ruth! One more behind us!

85
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,200
<i>And it's HUGE!</i>

86
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,740
I know.

87
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,900
What a tattered old ship!

88
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,170
Leave me alone!

89
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,330
<i>Abnormality found in the mono-system.</i>
<i>Booting the emergency pilot program.</i>

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,100
<i>Hey, stop this thing!</i>

91
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,740
<i>Like I know how!</i>

92
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,420
Looks like he's taken
you on quite a few spins.

93
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,260
Cut it!

94
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,590
The accelerator pump is all worn down.

95
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,640
I know.

96
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,570
And the fuel injector doesn't
have a silencer on it...

97
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,230
Don't need one.

98
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,570
But it's noisy, and it trembles...

99
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,580
If you put one in, then I can't
hear what it's telling me!

100
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,240
Just hurry up and connect the injector.

101
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,490
First of all, a three-eight
isn't popular anymore.

102
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,850
Why don't you switch to
the new five-zero?

103
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,230
Miles.

104
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,100
And if you change the
navigation to full-auto...

105
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,650
...then you can glide
along without manual steering...

106
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,760
Do you want to use a machine,
or do you want the machine to use you?

107
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,670
Which is it?

108
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,870
I wasn't exactly...

109
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,340
Just go!

110
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,910
You haven't changed a bit.

111
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,010
At this rate, another assistant
is gonna leave you.

112
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,990
And you! The Swordfish wants
to run away from you!

113
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,320
I haven't heard that before.

114
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,260
If you keep being reckless with her,
she'll really throw you off someday!

115
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,430
Unfortunately, I'm not
one for delicate controls.

116
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,810
Sorry to keep you waiting!

117
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,000
I got something you don't see often...
A three-eight pneumatic tube!

118
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,880
Yes, hello?

119
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,980
Oh, it's you, Missing Man.
Where are you right now?

120
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,830
I'm still with Doohan. How's Jet?

121
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,760
<i>He seems rather busy right now...</i>

122
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,960
Saying something about some bacteria...

123
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,230
Bacteria?!

124
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,470
A virus!
We got a computer virus!

125
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,930
Same difference.

126
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,100
Starting with the mono-system,
orbit calculator...

127
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,610
...flight path selector, engine
regulator, communications circuit...

128
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,680
<i>...they're all shot.</i>

129
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,220
I don't get it.
Gimme a simple explanation.

130
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,680
The computer broke and we're
just drifting along!

131
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,660
Well, I understood that.

132
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,630
How about it? It's the newest one.

133
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,860
You haven't seen one floating
around anywhere else, right?

134
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,690
A mono-computer?

135
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,100
How about it? 150K... No, 100K.

136
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,490
A bargain, huh?

137
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,830
When it's sold THAT cheap,
you lose money even on salvage.

138
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,310
So, who did it?

139
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,000
Where did you get this?

140
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,910
A truck? Any features?

141
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,670
A penguin...

142
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,410
...logo on...

143
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,350
...the delivery truck?!

144
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,320
Are you sure about the info?

145
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,260
Yeah. They apparently were
dealing at the Orbit Drive-in.

146
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,900
I see... nobody would be suspicious
of a delivery truck wandering about.

147
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,270
And how are we going
to counter the hacks?

148
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,230
Don't get harpooned!

149
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,870
...and?

150
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,180
That's IT?!

151
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,180
They laughed this ship
off as "tattered!"

152
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,390
And they made that mess
out of my Hammerhead!

153
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,790
Unlike SOMEONE I know,
I always pay back what I owe.

154
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,120
What a wonderful principle.

155
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,530
I'm really not up for this...

156
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,830
I have an invoice from Doohan here.

157
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,210
Because they're PHYSICALLY
sending the virus...

158
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,540
...they haven't developed
a vaccine for it.

159
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,610
That is where this secret
weapon of ours comes in.

160
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,350
What? That's just our
normal communicator.

161
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,190
If you get infected by the virus,
cut off the entire mono-system.

162
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,090
Then, all navigation and
communication will go down.

163
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,960
As I said...
I will navigate you with this.

164
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,760
Because this is set to the frequency
for an old communications satellite...

165
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,740
...it has nothing to
do with the mono-system.

166
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,910
<i>Oh, another run scored</i>
<i>against the Blue Sox!</i>

167
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,950
That's some secret weapon...

168
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,540
It was a penguin, right?

169
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,280
Yeah. A purple penguin.

170
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,920
There are two of them?

171
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,050
Wait a minute, it might be
a real courier service.

172
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,460
It's a matter of how to
figure out if they are legit...

173
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,260
That's easy.

174
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,730
We fire a shot, and the one
that runs is the one we want.

175
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,230
This is the first time
I agree with you on something.

176
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,540
Y-You guys!

177
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,770
What are you gonna do
if they're both real?!

178
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,720
<i>They both ran?</i>

179
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,120
<i>We didn't consider that option...</i>

180
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,660
I'm trusting you with that one!

181
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,020
I have to pay them
back for yesterday, too.

182
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,540
Forgive us!

183
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,480
W-We'll pay the parking fee!

184
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,190
This way?!

185
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,890
<i>Spike! Draw them out!</i>

186
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,060
<i>It'll be a mess if they,</i>
<i>let the virus go in there!</i>

187
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,530
<i>I know!</i>

188
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,490
So, let's see what ya got...

189
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,730
He's here.

190
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,670
Waste of time.

191
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,420
He's after the arm...

192
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,580
He's not taking us seriously! Ruth!

193
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,080
Ready to go anytime.

194
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,660
Take that!

195
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,490
Welcome...

196
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,000
Excellent!

197
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,160
Bingo!

198
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,970
He's holding up pretty well.

199
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,590
Cut off the mono-system!

200
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,310
I'm doing it!

201
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,800
That idiot cut off his mono-system!

202
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,060
Hey... George...

203
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,460
And he's in Earth's
gravitational field...

204
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,630
Old man! Here, here!

205
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,510
- This is pretty bad!
- <i>Align the D7. Ya did it before, right?</i>

206
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,550
<i>Like I remember!</i>

207
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,380
No good!
There's nothing we can do!

208
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,560
You idiot! Hurry up and
do something about this!

209
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,290
Dammit... Move! MOVE!!

210
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,730
Falling... We're falling!

211
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,160
Spike, I'll be right there.

212
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,690
<i>I'm calculating an</i>
<i>interception course.</i>

213
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,430
<i>Until then, somehow</i>
<i>keep control manually,</i>

214
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,870
<i>Even if everything was normal,</i>
<i>it'd be tough to get outta here.</i>

215
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,140
I can see that.

216
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,120
And I just had it overhauled...

217
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,280
Oh, well. Whatever happens, happens.

218
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,860
<i>Spike, above you.</i>

219
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,870
Your tattered ship
looks like a goddess!

220
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,010
Shit, the virus...

221
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,450
Spike!

222
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,630
<i>I'm still alive!</i>

223
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,590
<i>We have to start over!</i>

224
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,630
No way! Old man, ya gotta be kidding!

225
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Are you really gonna move
this ancient piece of...

226
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,640
Do you think I'd do this as a joke?

227
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,240
Don't just stand there!
Hurry up and get me some fuel!

228
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,310
All right!

229
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,760
Spike, can you hear me?
I got a calculation.

230
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,950
It'll take another 7 hours
for us to rendezvous.

231
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,220
Come on, you're joking, right?

232
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,930
<i>We're too close to Earth. The orbital</i>
<i>paths I can take are limited!</i>

233
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,160
<i>Isn't there a way for</i>
<i>you to just swing on by?</i>

234
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,000
<i>If I plunge in at this</i>
<i>angle, both the...</i>

235
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,730
<i>...Bebop and the Swordfish</i>
<i>will burn to nothing!</i>

236
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,810
Jet...

237
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,390
<i>I have some booze hidden</i>
<i>behind the fridge.</i>

238
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,800
<i>Feel free to drink some.</i>

239
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,870
Something wrong?!

240
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm outta gas.
Nothing I can do now.

241
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,900
<i>How about I go there and tow you back,</i>
<i>in exchange for that booze?</i>

242
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,130
I heard the conversation.
Give me the Swordfish's coordinates.

243
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,350
Doohan?!
How the hell do you?!

244
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,640
<i>Spike, I don't care how ya do it,</i>
<i>but slow down using an air-brake.</i>

245
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,470
Slow down?

246
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,300
If you slow down within
Earth's atmosphere...

247
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,400
...the gravitational pull
will accelerate you instead...

248
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,520
<i>...which will give you</i>
<i>enough speed to escape.</i>

249
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,250
<i>However, you have to maintain</i>
<i>the ship at a certain angle.</i>

250
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,580
<i>Too far either way,</i>
<i>and you'll be...</i>

251
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,380
<i>...thrown out to the other</i>
<i>end of the universe.</i>

252
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,450
Unfortunately, I'm not
one for delicate controls.

253
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,080
<i>Spike...</i>

254
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,690
I know you can do it.

255
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,360
I didn't give you the
Swordfish for nothing.

256
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,800
Don't you start crashing, either!

257
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,010
Maximum propulsion.

258
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,050
You didn't have to force
yourself to come with me.

259
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,520
You know how Blue Sox
fans love to party!

260
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,530
Let's go!

261
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,360
All right!

262
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,390
We're flying...

263
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,120
We're REALLY flying!

264
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,840
<i>Lower the nose by 0.6 degrees.</i>

265
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,110
<i>You're in too deep!</i>

266
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,050
<i>Spike, you'll burn to a crisp!</i>

267
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,250
<i>This is the last chance!</i>

268
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,740
It went in! It went in!

269
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,800
That was perfect!

270
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,290
Doohan, you saved me.

271
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,510
<i>Not quite.</i>

272
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,220
Most of the heat-resistant
tiles have peeled off.

273
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,480
The temperature is rising...

274
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,850
<i>T- The landing gear isn't</i>
<i>coming down either!</i>

275
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,920
<i>Oh yeah, and the #2 nozzle</i>
<i>won't work either.</i>

276
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,900
<i>WHAT?! Is that for real?</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

277
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,100
- <i>We can't land without them!</i>
- Oh, well... Whatever happens, happens.

278
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,800
<i>I KNEW I shouldn't have come up here!</i>
<i>I'm still too young to die!</i>

279
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,810
