00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,660
<i>Attention Guangzhou Flight 215 passengers.</i>

2
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,870
<i>The flight to Guangzhou departing at 11:45</i>
<i>is now boarding...</i>

3
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,660
<i>Hunger is eating at my soul.</i>

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,870
<i>A rare downpour in Beijing.</i>

5
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,330
<i>As if slurping a cold soup,</i>

6
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,700
<i>the subway systematically</i>
<i>gulps the people down.</i>

7
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,290
<i>The harsh city</i>
<i>makes the faces expressionless.</i>

8
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,620
<i>I'm probably one of them.</i>

9
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,540
<i>Going through the tedious cycle of life</i>
<i>and trying to regain what I had cherished,</i>

10
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,700
<i>I feel like I misplaced something.</i>

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>Numbed, we lose the taste of home.</i>

12
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,410
<i>That taste which I had forgotten</i>
<i>now comes back to me.</i>

13
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,120
<i>The memories, where did they all go?</i>

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,450
<i>As the season turns, I recall the taste</i>
<i>of rice noodles from my hometown.</i>

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,200
<i>What gave me strength</i>
<i>was the one with seasonal ingredients,</i>

16
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,910
<i>the San Xian noodles.</i>

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,950
"THE RICE NOODLES"

18
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,950
<i>For many people in Hunan, the day begins</i>

19
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>with a bowl of hot, steaming noodles,</i>

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,950
<i>sweat on their face</i>
<i>and taking in the moment.</i>

21
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,290
Two bowls.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
Thank you.

23
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,700
<i>My memories from childhood begin</i>
<i>at this noodle shop with no sign.</i>

24
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,450
Good morning.

25
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,910
Xiao Ming, my dear.

26
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,910
Grandma!

27
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,000
<i>Rice noodles here are handmade.</i>

28
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>They are transparent and beautiful.</i>

29
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,000
<i>The flavor has a playful bounce,</i>

30
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,200
<i>giving the day's start a leisurely feel.</i>

31
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,160
<i>It was my time with Grandma.</i>

32
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,750
<i>My parents were both working,</i>

33
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,080
<i>so it was with her I spent my mornings.</i>

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,540
<i>We ate San Xian noodles.</i>

35
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,500
<i>I was hooked on them.</i>

36
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,700
<i>The mushrooms were firm and fresh,</i>

37
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,950
<i>lustrous kikurage with a proper texture.</i>

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,290
<i>Blended into a thick soup,</i>
<i>the flavors overlap,</i>

39
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,500
<i>indulging my palate and melting my heart.</i>

40
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,620
Oh, my.

41
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,160
<i>Warm steam touching my skin,</i>
<i>the soup's aroma,</i>

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,290
<i>the sound of us munching.</i>

43
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,080
<i>No words could describe</i>
<i>how much I loved this moment.</i>

44
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,450
<i>There were more secrets</i>
<i>to its tastiness.</i>

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
<i>The meat and mushrooms</i>
<i>were minced together,</i>

46
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,660
<i>the eggs were soft and fluffy,</i>

47
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,790
<i>mingling with the noodles down the throat.</i>

48
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,330
<i>And the flavors were enhanced</i>
<i>by the amber-colored soup.</i>

49
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,290
<i>Other shops sometimes use MSG.</i>

50
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>But here, they spent time and effort,</i>

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,250
<i>just a husband and wife</i>
<i>making the rice noodles with care.</i>

52
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,040
Eat all you want.

53
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,540
-Do you want another bowl?
-Yes!

54
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
<i>I later found out</i>

55
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,160
<i>the owner was a renowned chef in Beijing,</i>

56
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,120
<i>one of the top masters in Hunan.</i>

57
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,450
<i>One day he set out on his own</i>

58
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,290
<i>and settled here before I was born</i>

59
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,410
<i>to open a noodle shop.</i>

60
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,750
<i>This shop made only San Xian noodles</i>

61
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,250
<i>and kept it up for 20 years.</i>

62
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,250
<i>The handmade noodles</i>
<i>always tasted the same,</i>

63
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,870
<i>as well as the soup.</i>

64
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,080
<i>They didn't talk much,</i>
<i>but their rice noodles were loved by all.</i>

65
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,830
<i>Many people traveled from far away</i>
<i>to eat it,</i>

66
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
<i>but there was no guarantee they could.</i>

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,910
<i>I lived right by the shop,</i>

68
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,410
<i>so I was lucky</i>
<i>to eat the noodles every day.</i>

69
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,250
<i>Grandma once told me,</i>

70
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,330
<i>"If you like eating,</i>
<i>you'll be blessed with delicious food."</i>

71
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,660
<i>All of a sudden, the owners</i>
<i>closed the shop and disappeared.</i>

72
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,910
<i>It was said they were pushed out</i>
<i>because of jealousy,</i>

73
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,040
<i>or an old client of theirs</i>
<i>wanted them back in Beijing.</i>

74
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,040
FOR RENT

75
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,950
<i>Wherever they go,</i>

76
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,410
<i>there will be many people who like to eat.</i>

77
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,950
<i>They are going to make those people happy</i>
<i>with their noodles,</i>

78
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,830
<i>that's for sure.</i>

79
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,580
<i>The noodles at the shop close to school</i>

80
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,040
<i>weren't handmade</i>
<i>and the texture was nothing special.</i>

81
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,450
<i>But the piping hot toppings</i>
<i>were delicious.</i>

82
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,410
<i>Fried vegetables exuded flavor</i>
<i>and flowed onto the soft noodles,</i>

83
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,160
<i>blanketing the soup.</i>

84
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,790
<i>It was different from the shop</i>
<i>I went to with Grandma,</i>

85
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,750
<i>but I liked it nevertheless.</i>

86
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,000
Aren't you a student at
Fourth Academy's middle school?

87
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,540
-Yes.
-My son goes there, too.

88
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,750
He's in his third year at the high school.

89
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,790
See you later, hon.

90
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,870
Maybe I can retire from this when my son
finishes school and gets a job.

91
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,120
You are a growing boy.
Eat to your heart's content.

92
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,790
Then study hard, okay?

93
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,580
Oh... thank you.

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,540
<i>That girl was one year my senior,</i>

95
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,790
<i>and she passed here every day</i>
<i>on her way to school.</i>

96
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,120
<i>Her hair glistened hazel in the sun.</i>

97
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,500
<i>I wanted to gaze at it forever.</i>

98
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,830
<i>One of the reasons why I came here</i>
<i>was so that I could see her.</i>

99
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,830
<i>It was the joy of my life.</i>

100
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,950
<i>I don't know why...</i>
<i>I just felt this would last forever.</i>

101
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,620
<i>That fall...</i>

102
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,660
What's the layout here?

103
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,660
<i>The noodle shop changed its appearance.</i>

104
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,910
<i>The husband wanted to switch jobs</i>

105
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,500
<i>and convinced his wife</i>
<i>to open a fishing shop.</i>

106
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,910
<i>The happy mornings disappeared abruptly,</i>

107
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,830
<i>and with them, the rice noodles</i>
<i>and the glimpse of her hair.</i>

108
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,790
<i>And so, the fishing shop opened,</i>

109
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,830
<i>but it seemed to not do very well.</i>

110
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,000
What's going on?

111
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,160
You piss me off!

112
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,410
Let's get outta here!

113
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,370
Somebody call the teacher!

114
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,000
What is it? What happened?

115
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,910
Are you okay?

116
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,290
It's all your fault!
You never say anything!

117
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,790
<i>The injured student</i>

118
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,290
<i>was the son of the woman</i>
<i>at the noodle shop.</i>

119
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,120
<i>I don't know what caused the fight,</i>
<i>but the fishing shop closed its doors.</i>

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,660
<i>In my third year of middle school,</i>

121
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,750
<i>the noodle shop came back.</i>

122
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,790
<i>But something was different.</i>

123
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,290
<i>The husband was helping at the shop.</i>

124
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,450
<i>And there was another.</i>

125
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,540
Thank you so much!

126
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,620
<i>They looked happier than before.</i>

127
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
<i>But...</i>

128
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,580
<i>I heard she recently graduated</i>
<i>and went to another school far away.</i>

129
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,910
<i>It marked the end of my first love.</i>

130
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,040
<i>A very sad morning.</i>

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,700
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I woke up to the smell of noodles.</i>

132
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,660
<i>The times I spent with Grandma,</i>

133
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,040
<i>and in middle school,</i>
<i>during those sweet moments looking at her.</i>

134
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,080
<i>Now I'm by myself.</i>

135
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,330
San Xian noodles, please.

136
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,450
Coming right up.

137
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,120
<i>Number 12, San Xian noodle.</i>

138
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,660
<i>The machine-made noodles were</i>
<i>almost too perfect.</i>

139
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,700
<i>The flavor of the Chinese-style soup</i>
<i>was not bad.</i>

140
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,500
<i>But there were fewer toppings</i>

141
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,790
<i>and the price was higher.</i>

142
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,330
<i>I used to love San Xian noodles,</i>
<i>but it just doesn't taste the same.</i>

143
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,290
Hey, Dad.

144
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,660
What is it?

145
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
<i>A 2.5-hour flight from Beijing.</i>

146
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,700
<i>I figured I could go home at any time,</i>

147
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,700
<i>but the distance</i>
<i>was further than I thought.</i>

148
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,370
<i>The bright lights below me</i>
<i>make my heart churn even more.</i>

149
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Is that you, Xiao Ming?

150
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,790
I'm sorry,

151
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,790
I don't think I can eat San Xian noodles
with you anymore.

152
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,540
Don't say that.
We are going to eat them together.

153
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,290
Grandma...

154
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,250
<i>My shadow, dragged out by the night,</i>
<i>melts away in the morning sun.</i>

155
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,500
<i>The torment I feel in my chest</i>

156
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,790
<i>will someday</i>

157
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,620
<i>heal with time.</i>

158
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,700
<i>Some things never change,</i>
<i>and some things will change...</i>

159
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,540
What can I get you?

160
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,540
-A bowl of San Xian noodles.
-Got it.

161
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:30,830
<i>The warmth still lingers today</i>
<i>from the comfort that left me yesterday.</i>

162
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,160
<i>Days that fled will never come back.</i>

163
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,700
<i>But I feel certain</i>

164
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,330
<i>something is pushing my timid self.</i>

165
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,750
<i>It stays in the back of my mind</i>
<i>as the seasons pass.</i>

166
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,200
<i>It was like a lonely, pale morning,</i>

167
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,620
<i>but also a morning blushed with hope.</i>

168
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,410
Here you go.

169
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,620
"THE RICE NOODLES"

170
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,330
<i>Ever since I was a child,</i>
<i>I've loved cute clothes.</i>

171
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,290
<i>If I was wearing my favorite clothes,</i>
<i>I'd be happy all day.</i>

172
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,370
<i>I felt invincible.</i>

173
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,620
<i>I liked choosing clothes</i>
<i>for my little sister.</i>

174
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,790
<i>We played princess with my hand-me-downs.</i>

175
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,040
<i>But I started growing taller,</i>

176
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,790
<i>to the point where we couldn't exchange</i>
<i>clothes anymore.</i>

177
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,830
<i>I've never liked being tall.</i>

178
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,910
<i>It attracts unnecessary attention,</i>
<i>and I bump my head a lot.</i>

179
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,290
<i>But now, I'm grateful to my parents.</i>

180
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,370
<i>Lacking any other talents, I got my career</i>

181
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,500
<i>thanks to the height my parents gave me.</i>

182
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,450
<i>Before I had a chance to thank them,</i>
<i>they passed away.</i>

183
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,080
<i>I always realize the value of things</i>
<i>after I lose them.</i>

184
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>Everything that's precious.</i>

185
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,410
<i>The world's changing rapidly.</i>

186
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,330
<i>Clothing trends, people...</i>

187
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,200
<i>and us models.</i>

188
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,370
<i>This career is not going to last forever.</i>

189
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,750
<i>But I still want to shine.</i>

190
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,790
<i>For my only family: my little sister.</i>

191
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,290
"A LITTLE FASHION SHOW"

192
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,370
-That's a wrap, Yi Lin.
-Thank you, everyone.

193
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,080
-Thank you so much.
-You are welcome.

194
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't do such a thing.
What if you get hurt?

195
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,500
-Those clothes are valuable, right?
-But still...

196
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,500
<i>I was so happy when my picture</i>
<i>appeared on a magazine for the first time.</i>

197
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,290
<i>My sister could see me</i>
<i>even though we lived far apart.</i>

198
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,580
<i>But now, it's an everyday thing.</i>

199
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,450
What do you see?

200
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,200
Cameras, lights, girls.

201
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,120
You are standing
where most girls can only dream of.

202
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,080
Such a dreary outlook. Anything else?

203
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,250
I'm not inspired to say anything witty
right now.

204
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,250
Sorry to ask you.

205
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,000
Great job, thank you.

206
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,290
Isn't that the new editor?
You have to say something charming.

207
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,750
-Oh?
-My dear...

208
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,580
How many years have you been doing this?

209
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,000
Can't you at least say something cute?

210
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm more of an action-over-words type.

211
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,910
That mouth of yours.

212
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,540
We're all done!
Thank you so much for your efforts.

213
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,620
I made...

214
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,370
a cake for you.

215
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,120
Maybe Sis is busy.

216
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,000
Everyone ready?

217
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,000
Yi Lin, Happy Birthday!

218
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,000
-Happy Birthday!
-Thank you.

219
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,330
NO NEW MESSAGES

220
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,450
I messed up.

221
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,700
Yi Lin!

222
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,160
Happy Birthday.

223
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,700
You came!

224
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,120
Your manager told me. Sorry to miss
the photoshoot, but I was busy at work.

225
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
How about later?

226
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,200
Sorry. I gotta go back to the office.

227
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,450
I understand, if it's work...

228
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,080
Yi Lin!

229
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,370
-Have we met?
-I'm Shui Jing. We're in the same agency.

230
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,700
-I've idolized you forever!
-Really?

231
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,330
You're so popular in our school.
Everyone copies you.

232
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,250
-Thank you.
-Still a student? You're very mature.

233
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,160
Yes!

234
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,330
You'll be a hit.

235
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,830
-A new generation's coming.
-Thank you.

236
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,080
I was hoping I could get advice from you
on how to be successful in this business.

237
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,580
Advice? I don't really have any.

238
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,330
Please.

239
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,620
-Give her some pointers.
-Let me think...

240
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,290
Shui Jing, over here.

241
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,330
I'm coming!

242
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,750
Excuse me, I have to go.

243
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,410
I didn't say anything.

244
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,870
-She has it, the shine.
-Didn't notice.

245
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,580
Don't think you're always going to be
on the top.

246
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,200
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I'm going to go say hi.

247
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,330
-Don't worry about it.
-Shut up. Today's my birthday.

248
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,290
-You have bad taste in men.
-Shut up.

249
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,830
Get hold of yourself.

250
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,830
Good evening, Lu Lu.

251
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,620
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it. Part of the job.

252
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,580
That's why I said to bring Lu Lu.

253
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,080
I don't like when there are
 lots of people.

254
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,910
-How are you going to meet anyone?
-You're one to talk.

255
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,080
Lu Lu's homemade cake is so delicious!

256
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,450
It really is good.

257
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,750
My Lu Lu's so handy, she can do anything.

258
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,830
That's not true.

259
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
You ate dinner, right?

260
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm sorry, but Steve will eat my portion.

261
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,000
What, me?

262
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,620
Home is the best. Lu Lu is here with me.

263
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,500
-Good night.
-You're being too irresponsible!

264
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,330
I'd love to show the staff
Yi Lin's true self.

265
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,950
I'm sorry. You prepared all this for her.

266
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,540
-I was just making dinner for myself.
-Such a feast?

267
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,580
It's all thanks to her.

268
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,950
Because of her, I could go to school.

269
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,250
Sorry I'm late!

270
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,500
-Sis...
-Long time no see, Lu Lu.

271
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,620
From today, we will always be together.

272
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,120
Let's go eat.
There are some great restaurants nearby.

273
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,250
<i>I thought Sis</i>

274
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,330
was so gorgeous, shining,

275
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,080
as if she was from another star.

276
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,950
And now she's a sea lion.

277
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,250
Steve!

278
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Don't be hitting on Lu Lu.

279
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,750
I don't hit on girls.

280
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,750
It's time for me to leave.

281
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,870
Yi Lin! Don't be late
for the audition tomorrow.

282
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,540
Got it.

283
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,200
Sis, it's morning. Wake up.

284
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,790
Morning, Lu Lu.

285
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:37,120
-I'm going to school. Are you good?
-No worries, see you later.

286
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,000
Five more minutes...

287
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,620
I'm in trouble... whole loads of trouble.

288
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,870
You're late. What's wrong with you?

289
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,500
-I overslept, all right?
-You...

290
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,500
DRESSING ROOM

291
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,540
You are late.

292
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,750
Next.

293
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,910
Nice.

294
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,660
Next.

295
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,040
Next.

296
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,660
That place is for kids.

297
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,160
You think I'm too old?

298
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,620
You're supposed to say no.

299
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,620
There's always next time.
Something more suitable for you.

300
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,540
Hi!

301
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,700
Next time, huh? It's crowded at the top.

302
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,200
On my way to work.
Talk to you later.

303
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,620
-I got the gig!
-Shui Jing?

304
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,540
What's going on?

305
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,160
They told me on our way out
Shui Jing was getting the job.

306
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Don't tell me stuff like that.

307
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,160
Fashion Week is coming up.

308
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,120
Shui Jing is gonna be in it, too.

309
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,910
It's from Lu Lu.
She's asking if you want dinner.

310
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,620
Why doesn't she ask me?

311
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,000
Because you don't answer.

312
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,870
Younger is better?

313
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,330
I can't believe something like this
bothers me so much.

314
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,580
-Hey...
-What is it?

315
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,660
Nothing.

316
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,830
-Did you eat?
-I don't want to.

317
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,700
You're not eating lately.

318
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,750
Got to get ready for Fashion Week.

319
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,620
Take care of yourself.

320
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,870
Don't worry, I've been doing this forever.

321
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,080
-But Sis--
-What do you know?

322
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,950
What is it?

323
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,580
I'm fine. Do your own thing.

324
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Sis... where are you going?

325
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,790
-To the gym.
-Don't overdo it.

326
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,290
<i>It's rough...</i>

327
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,410
<i>My secret to beauty?</i>

328
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,330
<i>Nothing special.</i>

329
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,830
<i>Yeah, right. I wish.</i>

330
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,370
<i>Do you know what it takes</i>
<i>behind the scenes?</i>

331
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,040
<i>But I don't want Lu Lu to see me this way.</i>

332
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,500
<i>I can't, I won't.</i>

333
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,620
<i>After our parents died,</i>
<i>we were sent to separate relatives.</i>

334
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,540
<i>I'm sure it was rough on her.</i>

335
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,500
<i>It was rough on me.</i>

336
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,870
<i>When I decided to take in Lu Lu,</i>

337
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,660
<i>everyone said it was a bad idea,</i>
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

338
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,040
<i>I am greedy.</i>

339
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,370
<i>A modeling career</i>
<i>and being Lu Lu's amazing sister...</i>

340
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,120
<i>I want both.</i>

341
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,620
You're kidding me...

342
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,540
<i>The only thing I've got going for myself</i>

343
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,290
<i>is this body.</i>

344
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,870
<i>Beauty will slip away if you let it.</i>

345
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,450
<i>No matter what it takes,</i>
<i>I'm not letting it go.</i>

346
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,700
You've been killing yourself.
What's the matter?

347
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,950
It's not a big deal. I'm a professional.

348
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,250
I'm worried about you.

349
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,620
Please... let me go out there.

350
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,410
Okay.

351
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,950
But know your limits.

352
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,450
You look awful.

353
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,830
Maybe you should skip this.

354
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,950
This is nothing.

355
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,040
I dreamed about this stage,
now it's gonna come true.

356
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,540
But now, I want to see what's beyond this.

357
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,290
Do you see it?
It's gonna happen right now.

358
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,120
It's almost showtime.

359
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,830
My glorious future!

360
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,450
Listen to me.

361
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,330
You watch me.

362
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,950
I still have it...

363
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,790
<i>I... messed up.</i>

364
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,370
<i>Yi Lin, are you okay?!</i>

365
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,500
<i>You really like those clothes, don't you?</i>

366
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,410
<i>Yes! I love this color the most.</i>

367
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,370
<i>Let's go, Lu Lu.</i>

368
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:51,870
Mom...

369
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,580
Awake?

370
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,830
-I saw Mom in my dream.
-A dream?

371
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,790
When we were kids, she was always sewing.

372
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:15,330
When I'm sewing, I remember Mom, too.

373
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:24,330
She told me when she was sewing,
she could see the skies of her hometown.

374
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,950
What's that mean?

375
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
I don't know.

376
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,910
What do you see, Lu Lu?

377
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,080
I see... the people who wear my clothes.

378
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,870
If my clothes make someone happy,
I'll be happy, too.

379
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,330
That sounds nice.

380
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,870
<i>My injury was going to take a while</i>
<i>to heal.</i>

381
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,250
<i>When I stopped working,</i>
<i>it seemed like I had disappeared.</i>

382
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,160
<i>There are plenty of replacements.</i>

383
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:19,950
<i>The world will move on just fine</i>
<i>without me.</i>

384
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,160
Now that rehab's done,
you can finally get back to work.

385
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,120
About that... I'm kind of sick of it.

386
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,790
-Do you want to take a break?
-I don't want to go back.

387
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,080
You want to... quit?

388
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,870
It may be time.

389
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,450
I see.

390
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,410
Can you teach me how to do that?

391
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,660
Using the sewing machine and stuff.
I want to learn a trade.

392
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,160
How dare you!

393
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,120
Why are you talking to me like that?

394
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,540
I have to work.
Who do you think I'm doing it for?

395
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,410
You mean you're doing it for me?
That ends the conversation, doesn't it?

396
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,870
Don't look at me that way.

397
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,910
You don't get it!

398
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,290
-Where are you going?
-School.

399
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,500
At this hour?

400
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,910
Geez...

401
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,000
This is cute.

402
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,540
<i>We lived together and I didn't know.</i>

403
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,290
<i>I didn't even try to.</i>

404
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,410
<i>I'm such a fool.</i>

405
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,700
Ever since,
she's been staying late at school,

406
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,410
like she doesn't want to see me.

407
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,620
After being a stranger for so long,
you call me for this?

408
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,080
We've never fought
since we started living together.

409
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,410
-It seems you're back.
-What're you talking about?

410
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,910
You can't fight without energy.

411
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,120
Anyways, you were...

412
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,910
just kidding me, right?
That thing about retiring.

413
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,620
Dead serious. I'm up there in age.

414
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,910
My job is over then.

415
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,950
-I guess so.
-Everybody leaves me.

416
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,370
You and me could've been a team
for a long time.

417
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,500
-What're you going to do?
-I don't know.

418
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,250
-I can't see the future.
-So you haven't a clue.

419
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,370
But I'm going to make money.

420
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,080
I'm giving up modeling,
but I want to support Lu Lu.

421
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,450
Didn't you say you wanted both?

422
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,700
You're gonna lose both your career
and Lu Lu.

423
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,290
You don't even have a man.

424
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,950
A loner.

425
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,660
-Why are you saying such mean things?
-I'm no longer your manager.

426
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,540
I'll say whatever I want.

427
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,410
After all the money you made from me,
you thankless ass!

428
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,040
You're the worst
when you say things like that.

429
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,500
Maybe you said to Lu Lu,
"Who do you think lets you live?"

430
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,660
No... I never said it that way.

431
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,330
But you say it in a different way.

432
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,910
Ugh. Disgusting.

433
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,370
Do you really think I can come back
after that embarrassing incident?

434
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,950
-It's up to you.
-You are so cold about things like that.

435
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,370
You're supposed to encourage.

436
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,660
Can't you be supportive?

437
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,500
-Stop laughing.
-You're getting your swagger back.

438
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,040
-That's the Yi Lin I know.
-What?

439
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,660
I want you to come here
at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

440
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,700
Huh?

441
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,160
What is it, a job?

442
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,410
-Don't be late this time.
-Wait a minute!

443
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,000
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

444
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,250
<i>That's the weak me.</i>

445
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,910
<i>Honestly, I'm scared of failing.</i>

446
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,410
Huh? There's something written.

447
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,580
<i>Go get 'em, Sis!</i>

448
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,000
<i>Lu Lu...</i>

449
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,750
We were expecting you.

450
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,660
This way.

451
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,410
What's this about?

452
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,410
-Sis!
-Lu Lu!

453
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,830
Did I surprise you?

454
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,120
-The show's starting, so get dressed.
-It's too sudden. I can't.

455
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,660
It'll be all right. Come now.

456
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,500
Wait a minute...

457
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,290
Which one is the older sister?

458
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,700
This dress...

459
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,620
It's my favorite color.

460
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,000
You remembered.

461
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,450
<i>Lu Lu made it just for me.</i>

462
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,500
Steve reached out to the people he knew.

463
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,250
You said you're not my manager anymore.

464
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,870
But I'm still your friend.

465
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,370
Thank you.

466
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,330
Lu Lu...

467
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,040
<i>What I see from here...</i>

468
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,250
<i>I don't want to lose it.</i>
<i>It's so dear to me.</i>

469
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,580
<i>I don't care if I embarrass myself.</i>

470
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,290
<i>I'm not letting it go.</i>

471
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,500
<i>After that, I finished school</i>
<i>and started making clothes for a living.</i>

472
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,250
<i>Sis seems to be enjoying herself more,</i>
<i>doing what she wants.</i>

473
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:23,120
<i>I make the clothes and she wears them.</i>

474
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,120
<i>Just by ourselves,</i>
<i>we have our own little fashion show.</i>

475
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:45,000
"A LITTLE FASHION SHOW"

476
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,790
<i>Have you ever thought about the future?</i>

477
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,370
FALL 2008

478
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>I was asked that question a long time ago.</i>

479
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,790
<i>Why did it cross my mind?</i>

480
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,910
<i>How did I answer?</i>

481
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,290
<i>I don't even remember.</i>

482
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,580
Li Mo, impulsive as always, huh?

483
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,040
When you say you're gonna move out,
you move out right away.

484
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,540
Haven't exercised much since graduation.
Today's been tough.

485
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,870
-What's the rent here?
-100,000 a month.

486
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,290
That's steep.
Can you afford it on your salary?

487
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,040
It's only been two years
since you started.

488
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:35,160
This dinky hotel in Shikumen?
You plan on building this?

489
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,410
It's urban development.
Our firm's reputation is on the line.

490
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,910
Have you ever thought about
the client's needs?

491
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,120
You don't see it, do you?

492
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,160
It's time you woke up!

493
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,910
Shut up! Just leave me alone!

494
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,500
I just said to wear warm clothes.
It's nothing to get upset over.

495
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,410
Those little things are distracting.
I need to focus on work.

496
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,790
I'm leaving the house.
Already picked an apartment.

497
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,160
<i>I knew it was childish...</i>

498
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,370
Talk to him...

499
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,660
<i>...but I said it,</i>
<i>so I'm going to follow through.</i>

500
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,540
Pan, one box is missing.

501
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,660
Really? I thought we got everything.

502
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,160
-We'll go pick it up tomorrow.
-Can't wait.

503
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,160
There are tools I need inside.
I've got to start on the blueprint.

504
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,540
This room's got a great view.

505
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,500
Don't open the window, Pan! The wind!

506
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,080
Wow, you can see Shikumen from here!

507
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:58,040
Some parts haven't been demolished.
Your grandma still lives there, right?

508
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,700
When we were kids,
that place was like a huge maze.

509
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,040
From here, it's just a blotch.

510
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,620
Leave the nostalgia for later
and give me a hand here.

511
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,870
This is from the high school exam prep...

512
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,120
A LITTLE RAIN, THEN SUN

513
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,370
This is a tape from Xiao Yu.
You still had it?

514
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,950
What do you mean?
What's it doing in here?

515
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,870
You were studying like crazy for the exam.

516
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,410
Xiao Yu asked me to give it to you.

517
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:57,450
It was kind of awkward,
so I gave it to your mother.

518
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,370
You didn't know?

519
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,830
Do you have a cassette player?

520
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,910
Do you know what year it is?
Of course I don't have one.

521
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,830
Over there.

522
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,910
Hey, where are you going?

523
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
What're you gonna do with this stuff?

524
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,370
<i>If it wasn't the end,</i>
<i>please let me hear it.</i>

525
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,040
<i>The love I shut out, the dream I chased...</i>

526
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,500
<i>Back then, you and me, we had it all.</i>

527
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,450
<i>Has too much time passed?</i>
<i>Is it too late to ask for</i>

528
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,040
<i>something other than a goodbye?</i>

529
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,750
<i>If you're not here,</i>
<i>my heart will still ache tomorrow.</i>

530
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:56,160
"LOVE IN SHANGHAI"

531
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,160
SUMMER 1999

532
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,200
It's under construction. Watch your step.

533
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,910
Hello, ma'am.

534
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,290
How are the glasses, sir?

535
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,290
Oh, hi, Xiao Yu.

536
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,950
They're great.
I can read the newspaper better.

537
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,450
Great to hear.

538
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,370
I got some flower seeds.
I'll bring them next time.

539
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,700
Pan, play Xiao Yu's tape first.

540
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:40,250
There's no "ladies first" among friends.

541
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,700
-You idiot--
-Stop, you two. Let's listen to the song.

542
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,660
Give me one, too, Xiao Yu.

543
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,200
I knew Xiao Yu liked Li Mo.

544
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,830
You're such an idiot, Pan.

545
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,790
Why are you getting so worked up?

546
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,580
I guess I was right.

547
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,330
Xiao Yu likes Li Mo!

548
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,830
Xiao Yu likes Li Mo!

549
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,830
Xiao Yu likes Li Mo!

550
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,330
I'm going to beat you up. Seriously.

551
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,500
The tape!

552
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,410
-This is beyond fixing.
-It's punishment from above.

553
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,540
-What'd you say?
-Calm down. Let's listen to mine.

554
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:18,080
Going home already, Xiao Yu?
Why don't you eat dinner with us?

555
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,750
Thank you, but there's a test tomorrow.
I have to study.

556
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,580
Such a good girl.

557
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,870
Why don't you walk her home?

558
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,910
Grandpa! You sound like Pan.

559
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,330
Xiao Yu!

560
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,620
So much development going on around here.

561
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,910
Yeah.

562
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,660
-The road's cracked and they don't fix it.
-True.

563
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,450
You can drop me off here. I can walk.

564
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:05,540
When I put you down earlier,
you were like, "Ow, ow!"

565
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,910
Shut up!

566
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,120
I was saying it for your sake.

567
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,790
Stop, it hurts.

568
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,830
Just stay on! It's dangerous.

569
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,830
Hold on tight or you'll fall!

570
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,200
Will you be able to go to school
with that leg?

571
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,660
If I can't go,
can you record the lesson in class?

572
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,290
On this tape.

573
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,830
Say something funny, too.
I'll listen to it over and over.

574
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,120
Sure, if it makes you happy.

575
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:03,870
Wow, can't wait!
But maybe you'll be distracted in class.

576
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,040
Will you shut up?

577
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,370
Oh, hi, Li Mo.

578
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,120
This is from the class.
Please give it to Xiao Yu.

579
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,620
Get well soon
so you can go back to school.

580
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:37,700
Okay.

581
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,870
XIAO YU

582
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,660
<i>Can you hear me, Xiao Yu?</i>

583
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,160
<i>Look at the second line on page six.</i>

584
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,120
Li Mo! What are you mumbling about?

585
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,080
What're you doing with a recorder?

586
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,120
If you want to sing, come up front.

587
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,000
<i>I can explain...</i>

588
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,160
Hey! Is your leg all right?

589
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:30,160
Yeah, thanks for your help.
I recorded something, too.

590
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:34,580
A LITTLE RAIN, THEN SUN

591
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,250
<i>Hey... have you thought about the future?</i>

592
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,120
<i>Where you're going to be,</i>
<i>what you'll be doing?</i>

593
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,080
<i>I have. I'm going to build a house</i>

594
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,290
<i>big enough for all of us.</i>

595
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:06,410
<i>Pan on the first floor, me on the second,</i>
<i>and you on the third.</i>

596
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:11,450
<i>We'll listen to songs together,</i>
<i>even when we're adults.</i>

597
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,660
<i>I never thought about it myself,</i>
<i>so I wanted to ask you.</i>

598
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,660
<i>That's... not bad.</i>

599
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,160
What's your favorite color?

600
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,790
I guess... red. It seems warm.

601
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,950
<i>Favorite flower?</i>

602
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,660
<i>Sunflowers, 'cause they grow</i>
<i>towards the sun.</i>

603
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,410
<i>Who is... your favorite person?</i>

604
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,370
<i>Li Mo, listen...</i>

605
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:50,790
<i>I'm taking the exam for</i>
<i>Yangpu University Affiliate High School.</i>

606
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:58,290
Are you serious about going to Yangpu?
That's a super-elite school.

607
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,700
You've never mentioned it.

608
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,750
You can go to Yangpu University on merit
from the high school.

609
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,540
My father insists I go.

610
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,450
Just because your parents tell you...

611
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,620
But it's far. How would you get there?

612
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,000
Well...

613
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,580
I'd have to move.

614
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,790
Xiao Yu...

615
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,410
What do you want to do?

616
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,410
I... don't want to move. But...

617
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,160
But you'll do what your parents say?

618
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,200
Go ahead then!

619
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,450
Where are you going? We're not done here!

620
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,000
What's wrong, Li Mo? You're not hungry?

621
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:05,040
Did something happen at school?
Your studies must be hard.

622
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,660
Here, eat some meat. You need nutrients.

623
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:15,040
Mother, don't be so soft on him.
It's not like he's aiming that high.

624
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,870
How about Xiao Yu?
Where does she want to go?

625
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,870
Yangpu University Affiliate.

626
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,750
Knowing her, that's not surprising.

627
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,040
She was always smart.

628
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:31,410
You should be more like her.

629
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,250
I'm going to shoot for Yangpu, too.

630
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:41,540
Are you serious? With your grades,
that's almost impossible.

631
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,790
And it's far.
How are you going to get there?

632
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,660
You're not just saying this, are you?

633
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,950
I'm serious! I'll go to the high school,
and then on to Yangpu University!

634
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,750
If you're serious, it may work out.

635
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,370
Work out?

636
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,870
A friend told me there's an opening
for an apartment in Yangpu District.

637
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,040
This area might be demolished,

638
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,290
so it may be a good opportunity
to leave Shikumen.

639
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,250
<i>Li Mo, give your best and don't regret it.</i>

640
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,830
<i>Clean your room and focus on your studies.</i>

641
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,620
<i>If you want to pass,</i>
<i>there's no time to goof around.</i>

642
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,200
Here is your tape.

643
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
There's nothing to record anymore.

644
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,700
Good luck on your exam.

645
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:49,000
Which school are you going to apply to?

646
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,660
A school close by, like everyone else.

647
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,620
180 DAYS TILL HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAM

648
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,620
Are you not going to say anything?

649
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,620
Yeah, it would be embarrassing
if I failed.

650
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,540
<i>If you say one word,</i>
<i>our friendship is over.</i>

651
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,870
<i>That's crazy. You're out of your mind.</i>

652
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,000
<i>Just because Xiao Yu is taking the test</i>

653
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,330
<i>you're reaching too high to be her match.</i>

654
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,000
It's not like that.
I just want to prove what I can do.

655
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,540
What did you just say?

656
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,870
Wait!

657
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,750
Studying is important, but so is rest.

658
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,000
Don't burn yourself out. And...

659
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,200
Grandpa and Grandma are staying.
So it'll only be us three moving.

660
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,160
And Pan asked me to give this tape to you.

661
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,200
He wants you to listen to it.

662
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,870
I don't have time. Put it in a box there.

663
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,540
What's the matter, Li Mo? What's the rush?

664
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,950
I need the cassette player.

665
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,540
I'm by myself,
so I don't cook that much anymore.

666
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,040
It's okay. Don't worry about it, Grandma.

667
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,040
Are you hungry?
Do you want some cookies?

668
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,160
They're demolishing this area, right?

669
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,040
Did you talk to Dad about it?

670
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:07,540
They started knocking down
that side of the street but stopped here.

671
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,870
It doesn't look like they'll restart
any time soon,

672
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,250
so it's hard for me to leave.

673
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,500
Hey! Xiao Yu!

674
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,540
Are you home?

675
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:30,120
Be quiet. Xiao Yu is not home.

676
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:35,450
Last night was so crazy I couldn't sleep.
Give me a break already.

677
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:39,540
Not home? What happened last night?

678
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,870
You are an embarrassment!

679
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,660
<i>It seems Xiao Yu failed the test.</i>

680
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,080
<i>Her father was so upset about it.</i>

681
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,370
<i>He got violent,</i>

682
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:52,870
and she was taken to the hospital.

683
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,000
Police came, and it was such a mess...

684
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,870
ACCEPTANCE LETTER

685
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,950
<i>Moving day came without seeing her.</i>

686
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,450
<i>Leaving home...</i>

687
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,250
<i>and Grandma and Grandpa.</i>

688
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,830
<i>Life in a new town will soon begin.</i>

689
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:22,950
<i>Xiao Yu...</i>

690
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,910
<i>It was school you were supposed to go to.</i>

691
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,790
<i>What happened?</i>

692
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,450
<i>I can't help...</i>

693
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,540
<i>thinking about you.</i>

694
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,120
<i>Looking at the sky above, after the rain.</i>

695
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,410
SPRING 2002

696
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,870
Xiao Yu,

697
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,700
let's sit and eat.

698
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:03,870
Okay.

699
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,080
You're quite an adult now, Xiao Yu.

700
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,370
It's been a while since you three met.

701
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,950
This calls for a celebration!

702
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,120
I hear you!

703
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,790
Let's drink, Li Mo.

704
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,120
You're in high school.

705
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,370
And it's still midday!

706
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,540
<i>We each went to different high schools.</i>

707
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,040
<i>We were once inseparable.</i>

708
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,290
<i>Now we can't communicate.</i>

709
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,910
<i>Unlike before,</i>

710
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,250
<i>we don't know what to say.</i>

711
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,660
You already have a CD player.

712
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:45,040
So does everyone else at school.

713
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:46,950
The sound's bad on tape.

714
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:52,700
I guess so... No more tapes...

715
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:57,370
That tape... you listened to it, right?

716
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,750
It's embarrassing,
so can you throw it away?

717
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,910
A tape? What are you talking about?

718
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:10,870
No... it's nothing.

719
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,160
I'll be okay from here.

720
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:27,250
Go back to everyone else.

721
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,370
It's all right, I'll walk you home.

722
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,500
We walked this road so many times,

723
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,290
I won't get lost.

724
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,620
I guess you're right.

725
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,450
Li Mo,

726
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:47,660
is it true that you chose that school
because of me?

727
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,330
Why do you say that?

728
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,540
I just wanted to prove to my parents
I could do it.

729
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,750
It had nothing to do with you.

730
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,250
Oh, okay.

731
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:00,750
Pan said it was because of me.

732
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,290
Don't be silly.

733
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,370
You can't believe what he says.

734
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,790
I guess not. Okay.

735
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,790
I'm gonna go now.

736
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:36,200
We were too late to send her off.

737
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,950
Gosh, when is it going to move?

738
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:46,500
She could've told us
about going to America to study.

739
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,500
I thought we were friends.

740
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,250
Excuse me, can you stop smoking?

741
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,160
It's smoky in the back...

742
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,910
<i>Hey, Li Mo, don't play</i>
<i>in the basketball game next week.</i>

743
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,370
<i>You're still injured.</i>

744
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,330
<i>Don't be reckless.</i>

745
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,540
I'll tell your mom
if you don't listen to me.

746
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,330
I'll do what I want.

747
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,200
<i>I don't care what other people say,</i>
<i>is that bad?</i>

748
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,700
Reckless or not,
I'm going to believe in myself.

749
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,790
<i>You said you liked sunflowers, right?</i>

750
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,700
<i>I want to face the sun and grow, too.</i>

751
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,870
<i>I don't want to give up.</i>

752
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:07,200
<i>I'm not gonna make excuses</i>
<i>to my future self and regret it.</i>

753
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,080
<i>Then... don't erase this tape, okay?</i>

754
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,000
<i>When we grow up,</i>
<i>let's listen to it together.</i>

755
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,950
<i>I... thought about it.</i>

756
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,200
<i>I want to grow like a sunflower, too.</i>

757
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,580
<i>I don't want to have regrets.</i>

758
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,580
That's why I won't go to
Yangpu University Affiliate High School.

759
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,000
Because...

760
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,000
I don't want to be without you.

761
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,200
<i>I can't rewind time.</i>

762
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,120
<i>I was too childish.</i>

763
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:01,750
<i>I didn't know...</i>

764
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,950
<i>as if burning the heart alive,</i>

765
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:07,910
<i>the twisting pain I inflicted on you.</i>

766
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,540
<i>Why didn't I...</i>

767
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,450
<i>listen to your voice?</i>

768
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:17,450
<i>If I ever have a chance</i>
<i>to see you again...</i>

769
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,580
<i>the dream we had...</i>

770
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,410
<i>I still want it for us.</i>

771
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,750
<i>Clinging to it...</i>

772
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,660
<i>praying...</i>

773
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,370
Please watch your step.

774
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:01,580
Shikumen is like an antique,
and the stairs are narrow.

775
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,830
You forgot the room key, Pan.

776
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,540
Welcome, do you have a reservation?

777
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,580
Li Mo! Xiao Yu! Hurry up!

778
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,040
Pan, don't run off by yourself!

779
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,290
He hasn't changed a bit.

780
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,410
Xiao Yu, wanna sit next to me?

781
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,370
You're over there!

782
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,700
Look how close the planes are.

783
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,540
Wow, you're right!

784
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,290
-I'm glad it's sunny today.
-Yeah.

785
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:46,830
<i>The flight to Guangzhou departing at 11:45</i>
<i>is now boarding...</i>

786
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,540
<i>Laughter and tears,</i>

787
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:52,540
<i>weaved into a song.</i>
<i>What kind of story will it tell?</i>

788
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,910
<i>From the standstill of yesterday,</i>

789
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,790
<i>guiding our spirits toward the future,</i>

790
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,870
