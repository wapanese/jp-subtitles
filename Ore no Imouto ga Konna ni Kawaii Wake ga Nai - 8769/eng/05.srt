Don't be so nice to me, I just don't know how to react

There's No Way My Little Sister's
 Best Friend can be this ●●●●

24
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,450
It really is you, Kirino!

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,950
Ayase...

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,040
That's so weird!

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,710
Fancy running into you here!

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,420
Yeah... what a coincidence...

29
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,880
Someone she knows?

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,590
Her best friend, apparently.

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,630
But why are you here?

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,930
I heard you were taking the day off from work because you were busy with the track team...

33
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,850
W-Well... um...

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,270
You want <i>me</i> to deal with this??

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,060
Yo!

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,530
Oh, it's Onii-san!

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,150
Might you two be out on a date?

38
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,060
Well, something like that.

39
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,200
Wait, what—

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,910
And what are you up to here?

41
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,000
We're doing a photo shoot.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,120
Right now I'm on break.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,580
Well, Aragaki—

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,210
You can just call me Ayase.

45
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,800
Ah, Ayase-chan then.

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,760
We're in a bit of a hurry right now...

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,930
Kirino? Are you feeling okay?

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,430
You're kind of quiet, and you look stressed...

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,600
Y-Yeah, I'm a bit under the weather.

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,220
How about I have someone drive you back?

51
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,930
I'll take your bags.

52
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,560
Thanks, but I'm fine!

53
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,230
Really?

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,320
Sorry for interrupting your date.

55
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,620
You know, I've been wondering, but do you know those people behind you?

56
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,620
Um...

57
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,200
Let's go.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,670
If we don't hurry, we'll miss the 5pm anime.

59
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,590
Sorry guys... thanks!

60
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,930
What was with those two?

61
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,930
They looked really strange.

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,680
Who knows?

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,600
I don't know those weirdos.

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,810
Hey, was something going on today?

65
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,360
Um...

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
It was probably Summer Comiket.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,690
Summer Comiket?

68
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,740
What's that?

69
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,910
I'm not sure myself, but they sell doujinshi and stuff...

70
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,290
"Doujinshi"?

71
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,750
She's hopeless...

72
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,080
Kirino...

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,740
Are you hiding something?

74
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,990
Of course not!

75
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,750
Sorry, we'll catch you another time!

76
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,090
Later, Ayase!

77
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,130
Wait.

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,800
Ayase?

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,050
Why are you running away, Kirino?

80
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,140
I'm not running...

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,930
Lies.

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,020
You're lying.

83
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,870
Lies, lies, lies, lies!

84
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,180
Don't lie to me.

85
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,930
You tried to run.

86
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,190
You're running away.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,570
You're running!

88
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,280
Ayase? This—

89
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,360
You be quiet, Onii-san!

90
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,650
I'm talking with Kirino.

91
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,160
Sorry...

92
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,790
Kirino, I'm worried about you.

93
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,750
So please answer me.

94
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,160
You're hiding something, right?

95
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,220
I'm not, Ayase...

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,020
I'm not...

97
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,200
You should know by now, Kirino.

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,170
I hate lies.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,140
You're not telling me?

100
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,520
You don't want to talk to me?

101
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,190
I'm shocked. And here I thought we were friends.

102
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,990
It seems that I misunderstood things.

103
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,190
Ow...

104
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,450
I'm sorry!

105
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,160
I want to help you, Kirino.

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,750
Something feels wrong today, and I can't just let you go...

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,460
What's in that bag?

108
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,170
"Comic Circle Market"...

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,510
Where are you going? I'm not done talk—

110
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,910
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,330
I can no longer be your friend.

112
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,080
Please don't talk to me at school anymore.

113
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,770
I don't know those weirdos.

114
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,640
I don't think Miss Kiririn was being serious there.

115
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,020
I know that.

116
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,820
Humans are such unfortunate animals.

117
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,700
Thanks for that back there.

118
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,160
Thanks to you, we managed to work it out somehow.

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,530
Sorry for using you like that.

120
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,910
I tried calling Miss Kiririn too, but she didn't pick up...

121
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,710
She was pretty tired.

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,420
She's already gone to bed.

123
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,000
Indeed? That's good to hear.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,460
Miss Kuroneko was also quite worried.

125
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,380
Sorry again about that.

126
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,510
I'll get her to apologize to her too.

127
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,680
You needn't worry about it.

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,720
Thanks a lot for today.

129
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,770
Bye then.

130
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,320
Do your best at training camp!

131
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,910
Of course!

132
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,160
Who do you think I am, Mom?

133
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,030
I'm off then!

134
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,920
You lose!

135
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,260
When she uses her tentacles, Reika's back becomes exposed.

136
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,390
D-Don't get me wrong!

137
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,760
It's not like I looked this up for you or anything!

138
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,030
On your marks...

139
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,780
Get set...

140
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,320
Go!

141
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,420
You win!

142
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,050
Now you can fight against other players!

143
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,190
I'm back.

144
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,910
Hey.

145
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,790
I can use my character against other players now.

146
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,120
Oh yeah?

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,470
It's been so long since we've done this.

148
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,760
Eh? Done what?

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,010
You know, walking home together.

150
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,140
Of course, we're older now.

151
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,900
Even during summer we'd only walk to the library or the park.

152
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Not that...

153
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
You don't get it.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,150
So, Kyou-chan, what's been troubling you lately?

155
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,700
What do you mean?

156
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,490
Nothing's troubling you?

157
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,700
Not really.

158
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,790
But you told me about Kirino's life counseling...

159
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,930
No!

160
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,120
Oh, so that's it.

161
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,660
Wh-What?

162
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,670
Kyou-chan?

163
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,130
Kirino...

164
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,680
Kirino-chan?

165
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,390
Sorry, Manabi.

166
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,520
I've gotta get something off my chest.

167
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
We'll study another time.

168
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,270
Okay.

169
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,560
Good luck, Onii-chan.

170
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,070
New term

171
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,360
Something happen to you at school today?

172
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,530
Not really.

173
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,570
Did Ayase break her promise and tell everyone about your hobby?

174
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,370
Ayase wouldn't do that!

175
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,250
Have you made up with her?

176
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,750
Hey!

177
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,040
Look this way!

178
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,460
If you don't say anything, I can't help!

179
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,420
Shut up!

180
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,340
What the hell?

181
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,080
I talk to you a little and now you're acting all gross!

182
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,590
And what's wrong with that?

183
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,550
Huh?

184
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,430
I said I don't care if I'm gross!

185
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,730
After all, I'm a perverted siscon idiot of a brother that thinks he's got something good going on after he got to know his sister a bit.

186
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm not letting you leave here till you tell me the whole story.

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,350
Wh-What's with you?

188
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,740
You haven't made up with Ayase, right?

189
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,530
How could I?

190
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,490
After what happened...

191
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,830
But you acted like nothing happened the day after.

192
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,330
I had training camp, so I couldn't disappoint anyone.

193
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,630
What's that supposed to mean?

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,050
A lot of people wanted to go to camp, and since I was chosen to go, I couldn't just stay depressed and not work hard.

195
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,640
That was a separate problem, and at the camp I had to focus on doing what I had to do.

196
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,180
I see.

197
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,390
So didn't you try calling her or something?

198
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,610
What do you think you're doing?

199
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,480
It's not like I can help it.

200
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,570
Isn't she your best friend?

201
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,650
Are you really just going to leave things like this?

202
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,490
You—

203
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,660
Shut up!!

204
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,120
Stop talking like you know what I'm going through!

205
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,870
Leave me alone!!

206
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,920
I can't stand the way you're just giving up like that!

207
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,500
It's not like you!

208
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,800
Normally you'd try to fix it any way you could, no matter how unsightly or how low the odds were!

209
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
What?

210
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,970
Why are you acting all mature all of a sudden?

211
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,510
Getting a lecture from you after this long really pisses me off!

212
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,140
Sorry, but I'm not going to sit and listen.

213
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,930
I'm not going to just nod and do what you say, like Neighbor-girl does.

214
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,560
Why you—

215
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,520
Don't touch me!

216
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,360
You've never cared about me my whole life, and only now you're trying to act the big brother part?

217
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,600
What did you just...

218
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,660
Shut up!!

219
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,240
Of course I can't leave it like this!

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,790
I know that already!

221
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,700
Wait—

222
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,370
Not like me?

223
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,000
Try to fix it?

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,330
Don't say it like it's so simple!

225
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,330
You don't understand anything!

226
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,250
You just don't understand!

227
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,960
You don't understand!

228
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,470
The life counseling isn't over...

229
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,230
Take responsibility for it till the end!

230
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,980
Just say that from the start next time, idiot.

231
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,980
I must refuse.

232
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,450
I cannot associate myself with someone with that kind of hobby.

233
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,990
Hey—

234
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,450
Let me ask you instead.

235
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,370
What do you think of it?

236
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,370
Though, the answer's obvious at this point.

237
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,580
Well, hold—

238
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,540
It's all your fault.

239
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,080
Kirino isn't that kind of person.

240
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,460
I said hold on!

241
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,040
Listen to me!

242
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,800
What did you say to Kirino today?

243
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,010
It was a futile effort.

244
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,180
I was her best friend.

245
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,310
Isn't it natural that I'd want to make up with her?

246
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,270
Yeah...

247
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,730
So I said to her,

248
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,480
"Drop that hobby and throw it all away."

249
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,530
Do you know what she said?

250
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,530
She told me, "Never!"

251
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,820
That means that hobby is more important to her than me!

252
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,030
How cruel...

253
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:38,710
I'm not trying to defend her hobby, but you don't really understand what kind of hobby it is, do you?

254
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,050
You've decided you hate it without really knowing anything about it.

255
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,920
I've seen it on the news.

256
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,550
Games and anime where people do lewd things to little girls are becoming more and more widespread in Japan.

257
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,640
A famous journalist reported on it.

258
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,060
Aren't those the kind of things Kirino has?

259
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,560
Well, I suppose they are...

260
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,570
So when I find out that my best friend has such a disgusting hobby, isn't it natural for me to try to make her stop?

261
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,780
That journalist also said...

262
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,540
People who play and watch those things will eventually have their minds broken, and lose their humanity.

263
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,370
That's an exaggeration.

264
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,470
And there was a man who was influenced by those games to electrocute a girl.

265
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:31,720
The culprit was one of those so-called otaku would-be-criminals, and he said he was trying to mimic what he saw in a game called "Siscalypse".

266
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,760
Don't you see?

267
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,350
Those kinds of games and manga shouldn't be allowed to exist!

268
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:34,970
SisCaly incident

269
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:34,970
SisCaly incident

270
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,180
SisCaly incident

271
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,310
SisCaly incident

272
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,520
SisCaly incident

273
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,680
SisCaly incident

274
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:36,890
SisCaly incident

275
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,060
SisCaly incident

276
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,310
SisCaly incident

277
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,850
SisCaly incident

278
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,190
Anyone who plays them or creates them is a criminal just waiting to come out!

279
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,900
Title: "Psychopath Attacks Girl, Imitating Popular Game"

280
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,730
They need to be regulated and controlled!

281
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,690
Title: "Culprit Statement: 'I wanted to mimic the game'"

282
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,140
This is a hobby that Kirino absolutely cannot have!

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,280
Title: "Another Game Copycat Crime, Otaku Numbers Still Growing"

284
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,150
All otaku should die

285
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,150
Make those games and manga illegal

286
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,540
Aragaki Ayase

287
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,540
Call time

288
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,540
So I guess she's seriously worried about Kirino...

289
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,050
It's going to be hard to deal with how all these incidents involving otaku really do strengthen her argument.

290
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,310
Hey Dad, can I ask you something?

291
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,230
What, about your future?

292
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,060
No...

293
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,820
A middle school girl I'm friends with recently saw a big haul of eromanga I got!

294
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,070
What should I do?!

295
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,320
Y-You okay, Dad?

296
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
You worthless son!

297
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,450
You came to me to discuss that, of all things?!

298
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,130
I just want to know something.

299
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,370
Please! Just hear me out!

300
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,630
What do you want?

301
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,840
So, what did you want to say?

302
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:56,640
You can't make up with Kirino because her hobby is indecent, and she won't give it up.

303
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,890
Am I right?

304
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,890
Yes. And so?

305
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:06,150
After we talked about that, I looked into a few things.

306
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,360
I have heard about that case.

307
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,860
An associate of mine at the station brought me the information.

308
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,780
And I also know about the journalist that wrote the article.

309
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,120
I just happened to be looking into the incident at the time.

310
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,410
Don't misunderstand.

311
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,290
It's not like I looked into it for you.

312
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,500
I'll start from my results.

313
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:34,180
At first, the culprit in the SisCaly incident did say he tried to electrocute a little girl in imitation of a game,

314
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,300
but he withdrew that statement later.

315
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,050
You're lying!

316
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,390
It's true.

317
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,600
He said that he took out the stun gun because he wanted to get violent on a girl.

318
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
It's a pretty sleazy way to go.

319
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,150
How did you discover that?

320
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,730
It was on the news.

321
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,530
The second article was a lot smaller than the first, though.

322
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,820
But then the journalist would have—

323
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,450
He published this apology.

324
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:05,460
"I apologize for stating something which may have caused a misunderstanding. I made a mistake in collecting information."

325
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:13,510
"I hope to inform you all of the truth with regards to the incident as the time calls."

326
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,220
They didn't say anything about that on TV...

327
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
I don't think everything they say is a lie.

328
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,390
Nor do I think all the otaku bashing is completely untruthful either.

329
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,610
But as far as this incident goes, I think that journalist may have just misinterpreted some of the information.

330
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,980
And part of the mass media jumped right on it.

331
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,740
There's more of it here.

332
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,490
Read it yourself.

333
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,740
Lies! No way!

334
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,330
And there's no evidence that playing games causes people to lose their humanity either.

335
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,250
So could you stop referring to otaku as criminals waiting to happen?

336
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,210
Sure, there might be some bad guys among them, but they aren't all bad.

337
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,260
Kirino said the same thing.

338
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,220
I understand.

339
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,100
This was a mistake on my part. I take back what I said.

340
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,020
But it doesn't change the fact that Kirino's hobby is disgusting.

341
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,690
You might see it that way, but can't you try to ignore it?

342
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,030
She keeps it to herself because she knows that she can't let anyone know.

343
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,570
You're right.

344
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,360
She's kept it to herself and lied to us all.

345
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,640
She just never had to tell you!

346
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
And more importantly, because she didn't want to lose your friendship!

347
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,950
You're her best friend! Why can't you understand that?

348
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,840
What about you? What do you know about us?

349
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,540
I know Kirino better than anyone!

350
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,170
That Kirino is fake!

351
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,680
Give her back! Give me back my best friend!

352
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,180
Give me back the real Kirino!

353
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,680
Oh, shut up!!

354
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,640
"Fake, fake"...

355
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,150
Can't you say anything else?

356
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,730
Kirino...

357
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,860
Move.

358
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,320
This is something I have to do.

359
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,280
Ayase, listen to me.

360
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,580
I'm not listening to a fake Kirino.

361
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,790
I want to talk to the real Kirino!

362
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,790
What's the real me?

363
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,460
Beautiful, overflowing with style and fashion sense, ace athlete, honor student,

364
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,380
surrounded by friends, the idol of the entire student body,

365
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,310
loved by the teachers, the star of the track team,

366
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,470
working as a model outside school,

367
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,140
depended on by everyone, loved by everyone—

368
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,060
that super-perfect, super-cool, super-cute, super-beautiful Kousaka Kirino?

369
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,560
Is that the real me?

370
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,440
Yeah! That's Kirino!

371
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,650
Sorry Ayase, but you don't really understand.

372
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,900
I like the manga that you call indecent!

373
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,570
I really like those eroge you call disgusting!

374
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,870
I never get tired of watching anime with cute girls no matter how many times I watch them!

375
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,080
I get really happy just looking at my character goods!

376
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,460
I really like those things!

377
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,330
I can even say I love them!

378
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,090
No matter what anyone says, that's who I am!

379
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,800
So I know you're worried about me, but I won't stop!

380
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,140
I won't throw away this hobby no matter what!

381
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,640
I like it!

382
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,350
I like what I like!

383
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,310
If I stop, I won't be me anymore!

384
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,350
Is it more important than your friends?

385
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,980
Is your hobby more important than me?!

386
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,860
Of course not!

387
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,740
I like you just as much as my eroge!

388
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,110
That's no lie!

389
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,280
If I were able to just pick one, I wouldn't have any problems!

390
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,120
But I love both my friends and my eroge!

391
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,370
Things turned out like this because I love them both!

392
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,630
And I don't plan on throwing away either of them.

393
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,000
I need both.

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,130
So I've decided.

395
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,500
I am going to make up with you!

396
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,340
And I will not throw away my hobby!

397
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,010
Do you have a problem with that?

398
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,100
You're not lying?

399
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,850
You love me a lot?

400
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,650
I understand how you feel.

401
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,190
I want to make up with you too.

402
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,360
But I can't accept your hobby.

403
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,280
I can't!

404
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,870
No matter what!

405
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,660
What are you talking about?

406
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,860
Didn't you just say you'd make up with me?

407
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,250
But... I can't stand that kind of manga...

408
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,790
It's so gross!

409
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,710
Kirino!

410
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,800
What should I do?

411
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,120
What? You want me to step in <i>now</i>??

412
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,340
Kirino, what should I...

413
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,100
What should I...

414
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,730
Ayase!

415
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,150
Look at this!

416
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,270
What?

417
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,530
What are you trying to do?!

418
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,780
I'll beat you to a pulp!

419
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,410
Filthy!

420
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,120
That right there...

421
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,620
is the symbol of love between me and Kirino!

422
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,920
Wha-wha-wha—

423
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
What kind of crazy talk are you—

424
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,760
We're in love with each other!

425
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,510
That's why we've been gathering tales of forbidden love!

426
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,470
If I hadn't found that, I would never have realized my feelings for Kirino.

427
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,020
Our relationship would have been frozen over forever!

428
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Kirino's hobby has repaired the bonds between us that were broken!

429
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,450
We were able to become true siblings through it!

430
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,780
You think we'd let anyone deny these feelings?

431
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,950
Listen up, and listen well.

432
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,040
I...

433
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,080
I...

434
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,370
I...

435
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,080
I love my sister!

436
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,340
Kirino, let's make up right now.

437
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,600
Ayase?

438
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,690
This wasn't the time to be fighting about something as silly as what's filthy or disgusting.

439
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,110
I'm so sorry I never realized it.

440
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,530
Get away from her, you freak!

441
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,200
Um... who?

442
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,160
Shut up! Don't talk, you freak!

443
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,240
You were the root of all the evil!

444
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,790
Don't ever touch my best friend again!

445
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,540
A-Ayase...

446
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,210
I'll protect you.

447
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,920
Let's go, Kirino.

448
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,430
Just as planned.

449
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,020
Mr. Lying Brother,

450
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,110
Your pervertedness has allowed me and Kirino to make up.

451
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:55,320
But if you do anything indecent to Kirino, I will beat you to death.

452
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,910
I'm back.

453
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,420
Don't worry.

454
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,920
He hasn't done anything you have to worry about.

455
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,420
Thanks, Ayase.

456
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,130
See you at school.

457
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,470
Hey.

458
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,180
Are you planning to just keep my computer?

459
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm not!

460
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,890
I'll bring it to your room later, happy?

461
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,940
Huh? What are you talking about?

462
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,070
Bring it here.

463
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,190
We're playing.

464
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,070
I'm going to kick your butt.

465
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,960
kurasumeito toha betsu no kaeri michi

466
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,960
My road home is different from everyone in class.

467
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,220
hayaku shifuku ni kigaenakucha

468
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,220
I have to hurry and change into my casual wear.

469
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,220
someta baka no kami wo yurasu

470
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,220
I let the wind take my newly dyed hair.

471
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,100
itazura na kaze wo kanjiteru

472
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,100
I feel it playing pranks with my hair.

473
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,980
michibata no chiisana hana

474
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,980
There's a small flower by the road.

475
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,610
kinou made kidukanakatta na

476
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,610
I never noticed it until yesterday.

477
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,200
ima doki doki suruyouna

478
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm getting nervous,

479
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,780
nanka waku waku suruyouna

480
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,780
but I'm getting excited.

481
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,830
kimochi nano

482
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,830
It feels like that.

483
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,170
yuuyake no sora orange

484
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,170
The sunset sky is orange.

485
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,050
kyou no atashi no kami to onnaji

486
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,050
Just like my hair today.

487
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,050
hoshi sae nemuru mayonaka no niji

488
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,050
Two in the morning, the stars are all asleep

489
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:42,890
dare mo ienai himitsu no jikan

490
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:42,890
I'm thinking about a secret I can't tell

491
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,980
ashita no asayakezora no orenji

492
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,980
The sky tomorrow at sunrise will be orange

493
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,030
kitto atashi no kami to onaji

494
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,030
I know it'll be just like my hair

495
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,450
itsuka donna kimochi wo wakariaeru

496
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,450
How nice if one day I can find

sonna hito ga dekitara ii na

498
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,540
Someone who'll understand me

499
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,540
There's No Way My Childhood Friend 
 Can Be This Cute

500
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,740
Next time:

There's No Way My Childhood Friend Can Be This Cute
