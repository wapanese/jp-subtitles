Take off her glasses

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,940
Don't take off her glasses

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,070
Kyousuke!

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,410
Could you go out shopping for me?

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,330
Oh?

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,500
Are you looking at porn sites on Kirino's laptop again?

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,130
What are you talking about, dear mother?

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,010
Look at this screen, with its clear skies as clean as my heart!

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,390
Thank god for the emergency escape key!

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,100
And wait, why do you know about the porn site thing?!

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,020
"Who browses porn sites on his little sister's laptop?"

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,480
"That's so gross!"

There's No Way My Little Sister

Dammit, using people like this...

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,880
It's pretty rare to run into you here.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,750
I know, right?

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,010
What are you having for dinner tonight?

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,380
As you can see, curry yet again.

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,760
How many times is that this month I wonder?

42
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,270
I wish Mom could learn even half of your repertoire.

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,390
You're good at making sweets and meals right?

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,810
Oh yeah!

45
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,900
Mom's going to be out for our next day off, and she was wondering how to deal with lunch.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,650
How about you come over and make lunch?

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,540
Go on in.

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,540
Sorry to intrude.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,310
That was Kirino-chan... right?

50
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,730
Crap.

51
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,030
G-Good afternoon, Kirino-chan!

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,240
Do you remember me?

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,410
I used to come ov—

54
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,410
Who might you be?

55
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,040
I guess you don't remember...

56
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,750
Then once again, I'm Tamura Manami.

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,880
Pleased to meet you!

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,510
And why are you here, anyway?

59
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,550
Hey, stop tha—

60
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,010
Come here for a second.

61
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,180
Wait!

62
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,390
What do you think you're doing, bringing a girl over when Mom and Dad aren't home?

63
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,730
That's so gross!

64
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,190
There's no ulterior motive!

65
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,900
I wasn't trying to sneak her in or anything!

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,860
I just brought here to make lunch!

67
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,400
I wonder about that.

68
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,530
And even if it weren't just for lunch, that'd have nothing to do with you.

69
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,370
You bring your friends here all the time, too.

70
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,290
I don't want to hear that from you.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,750
So you're saying if I brought over a boyfriend,

72
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,920
and h-h-had s-sex in the living room...

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,540
y-you'd be okay with it?

74
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,420
How'd it turn into that?!

75
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,550
We're not doing anything like that!

76
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,140
That's a totally different ballpark!

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,050
Um...

78
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,600
You shouldn't fight...

79
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,690
I'm sorry for showing up so suddenly, Kirino-chan.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,190
I heard your Mom wasn't going to be home,

81
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,450
so I thought I might help out a bit with cooking and cleaning.

82
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,740
I'll go home right after!

83
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,080
No good?

84
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,250
I wonder.

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,750
In that case, clean up the living room before you make lunch.

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,550
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

87
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,800
Please leave it to me!

88
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,010
Huh?

89
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,350
This looks amazing!

90
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,310
I didn't know how far I could go, so I couldn't get every corner...

91
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,560
No, this is more than enough!

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll make some tea, so have a seat.

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,110
Okay! Thanks!

94
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,000
Kirino-chan!

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,090
We're taking a break after finishing cleaning.

96
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,630
Would you like to join us?

97
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,680
So this is the best you can do?

98
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,220
What are you, some mother-in-law?!

99
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,560
Also, you've cleaned everything up so much that I don't know where anything is anymore!

100
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,980
It looked messy before, but I knew exactly where I put everything.

101
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,230
You overdid it.

102
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,610
I'm so sorry!

103
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,280
Where are my fashion magazines?

104
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,490
I left them here so I could find them easily.

105
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,860
They're right here!

106
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,120
Oh, I see...

107
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,410
What about the pedicure box I left here?

108
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,870
That had stuff inside it, so you'd better not have thrown it away.

109
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,130
I tidied it up for you.

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,960
Did we always have a box like that?

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,110
I re-used an empty tissue box!

112
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,380
That's so ghetto!

113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,390
Well?

114
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,260
Any other complaints?

115
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,930
Go away, then.

116
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,520
If that's all you came down to—

117
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,020
Wh-What is it?

118
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,160
Remember this!

119
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,530
This isn't over.

120
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,410
What's wrong with her?

121
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,170
Hey, lunch is ready!

122
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,380
Manami's asking you to come eat with us.

123
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,800
I'll come down after I'm done with this call.

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,890
Oh, okay...

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,310
Did she calm down?

126
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,210
Thanks for the meal.

127
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,730
It was delicious.

128
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,940
Oh, thanks!

129
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,680
I can do that!

130
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,450
I can handle it.

131
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,200
Hear that? She said she liked it.

132
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,950
That's good...

133
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,540
My room?

134
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,210
It's nothing special, so don't get your hopes up.

135
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,710
Well, come in.

136
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,970
Kyou-chan's room...

137
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,310
Why?

138
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,350
Why?!

139
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,560
I already gave this back to Kirino!

140
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,060
Why is it here with an eroge on?!

141
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,480
Who set up this trap—

142
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,400
Kirino...

143
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,070
It must have been her! Dammit!

144
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,990
That's why she was in a good mood!

145
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,700
Evil! Pure evil!

146
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,820
What's wrong?

147
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,490
Nothing, really!

148
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,490
Really!

149
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,950
It's nothing... nothing...

150
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,580
Kyou-chan! Your eyes are rolling around...

151
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,870
Are you feeling okay?

152
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,750
No, wait! Wait!

153
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,380
Oh! I can just hit the emergency escape key!

154
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,630
Wait! Wait!!

155
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,390
Kyou-chan?

156
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,890
Emergency escape key!

157
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,560
Sorry to surprise you like that, Manami.

158
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,780
Wow...

159
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,820
Why are they out?! I put those away earlier!

160
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,740
They're supposed to be in a box under my bed!

161
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,830
Is this another one of Kirino's traps?!

162
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,540
Dammit!

163
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,420
Don't look at those!

164
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,340
It was all girls with glasses...

165
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,380
That's not it!!

166
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,050
Well, they are, but that's not it!

167
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,050
This is a trap!

168
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,930
My heart is as clear as the blue skies—

169
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,970
Huh?

170
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,930
Stare.

171
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,220
M-Manami-san?

172
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,230
"Onii-chan is a pervert who only gets turned on by little sisters!"

173
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,320
Don't read that!

174
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,450
Why did it come back?!

175
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,700
Ah, I see...

176
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,990
An ero CG might sometimes  pop up at random when you hit the emergency escape key...

177
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, those jokers at the game company...

178
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,920
I see...

179
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,210
Um... Kyou-chan...

180
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,220
Um...

181
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,850
Would you like me to call you "Onii-chan" from now on?

184
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,530
Super Miss Kiririn

185
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,530
Miss Kuroneko

186
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,530
Mr. Kyousuke

187
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,530
Myself

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,030
Super Miss Kiririn

189
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,030
Miss Kuroneko

190
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,030
Mr. Kyousuke

191
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,030
Myself

192
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,660
Ah, whatever.

193
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,670
Excuse me, is there a reservation under Saori Vageena here?

194
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,930
Yes, may I have your name please?

195
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,510
Kousaka.

196
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,220
Kousaka Kyousuke?

197
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,930
Yeah.

198
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,930
It's room 301.

199
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,440
Ah, okay.

200
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,230
Thanks.

201
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,320
Kousaka Kyousuke's Personal Harem Party

202
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,580
Welcome home!

203
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,000
Master.

204
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,880
Miss Kiririn!

205
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,600
Welcome home, Master.

206
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,980
Ah, geez!

207
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,730
I can't take this anymore!

208
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,740
Lowering my head to this guy is just wrong!

209
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,990
What is this?

210
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,370
Just a taste of entertainment!

211
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,620
What do you think of my maid look?

212
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,910
Burning with desire?

213
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,000
Hell no.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,710
That's strange, I was told you had a glasses fetish...

215
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,920
Who told you—

216
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,260
Your little...

217
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,890
Maybe some sexier clothes were in order?

218
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,260
Look, when it's you and my sister doing it—

219
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,470
Ouch! Ouch!

220
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,850
What's with your attitude?

221
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,350
I do all this and that's how you act?

222
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,520
This is painful in more than one way!

223
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,400
Wait...

224
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,770
Where's Kuroneko?

225
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,910
It's not what you think.

226
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,280
I said it's not what you think!

227
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,250
No, no! You look lovely, Miss Kuroneko.

228
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,160
Don't you think so, Mr. Kyousuke?

229
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,920
Y-Yeah...

230
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,540
I don't need your flattery.

231
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,680
I hate to admit it, but that's really cute!

232
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,810
Hey, where do they sell these ears and tail?

233
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,100
I made them myself.

234
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Seriously?!

235
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,100
Oh man, that cosplay is just...

236
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,070
Damn... someone like her...

237
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,900
That ends my turn for now.

238
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,160
That means you're next, Miss Kuroneko.

239
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,450
Wait, turn for what?

240
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,160
Entertainment for Miss Kiririn's anime party, of course.

241
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,460
We'll go around and each do something.

242
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,380
I-I see...

243
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,590
All right.

244
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,470
This is a manga I wrote for today.

245
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,970
Manga? You?

246
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,730
I look forward to this!

247
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,440
Watch and be amazed.

248
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,820
Wait right there, you!

249
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,980
What's wrong?

250
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,360
Why does this character look exactly like me?!

251
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,360
And this one kind of looks like me.

252
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,410
Of course they do.

253
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,740
You two are the models for them.

254
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,410
But don't worry.

255
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,210
I only used your appearances and the siblings part.

256
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,590
I've got a bad feeling about this...

257
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,500
Well, whatever. Keep going.

258
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,630
Thank you.

259
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,140
"This is Onii-chan's underwear... Gulp."

260
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,640
Sniff sniff!

261
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,140
Stop right there!!

262
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,140
Stop right there!!

263
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,350
What's wrong?

264
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,020
You know exactly what's wrong!!

265
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,900
There are limits to what you can and can't do in manga!

266
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Why are you getting so angry?

267
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,650
My only intention was to write a fictional story.

268
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,790
When you react like that, you make it seem as though I may have accidentally reflected reality.

269
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,580
Don't tell me you really do sniff—

270
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,040
I don't! This is just in a manga!

271
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm glad you understand.

272
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,840
Then let's continue.

273
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,340
Rustle rustle. Rustle rustle.

274
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,590
"It's all girls with glasses!"

275
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,430
"Why doesn't he have any little sister ones?"

276
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,180
I'm confiscating this!

277
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,810
What are you doing?

278
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,940
The greatest holy war in human history is about to begi—

279
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,690
Shut up!

280
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,690
I want to go home...

281
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,940
Now then, today's main event!

282
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,440
Miss Kiririn's turn!

283
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,530
Go on!

284
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,490
Miss Kiririn?

285
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,030
Pass!

286
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Pass?

287
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,580
You idiot.

288
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,460
Don't you understand why you're here in the first place?

289
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,510
Now, now, Miss Kuroneko.

290
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,300
Miss Kiririn needs time to prepare herself too.

291
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,970
Perhaps we should have a pleasant little chat before the main event?

292
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,100
I guess we have no choice.

293
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,110
Hey, what's going on?

294
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,900
You guys know what Kirino's doing?

295
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,990
It doesn't matter.

296
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,110
So what did you think of my manga?

297
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,780
The house plan felt scarily real.

298
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,330
I did some detailed research.

299
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,250
But one part was wrong.

300
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,380
I've never been called "Onii-chan" or anything.

301
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,170
Then what does she call you?

302
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,630
Nothing really.

303
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,170
Oh, shut up.

304
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,130
Stay out of other people's family matters.

305
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,220
That must be lonely for you.

306
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,010
Then why don't I call you that?

307
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,680
What?

308
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,770
H-Hey, what?

309
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,560
You don't need to hold back, Nii-san.

310
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,400
Wait, something's not right here.

311
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,400
What's not right, Nii-san?

312
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,620
Wait, you, uh—

313
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,290
That hurt! What the hell!

314
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,200
You don't need to ask!

315
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,120
Stop being so gross!

316
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,540
Wai—Idiot!! Not that!

317
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,960
Getting all embarrassed like that... So shameless.

318
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,220
After being so depressed, all it takes is something like that to get you back on your feet?

319
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,430
You're so simple, I'm almost jealous.

320
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,560
What?

321
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,310
Look here.

322
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,940
I've been really depressed recently because of you.

323
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,070
It's not that Manami has been making fun of me or anything.

324
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,400
She's not that kind of person in the first place.

325
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,610
She's been trying to be nice instead.

326
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,240
But that weird feeling is just wrong for us!

327
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
And you're the reason for it!

328
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,660
Do you understand?

329
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:51,130
But we were going to celebrate today, so I thought I would set aside my own problems and celebrate.

330
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,710
But I come here, and then what?

331
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,470
The receptionist stares at me, you start yelling for no good reason,

332
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,930
and it looks like you're hiding something from me.

333
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,720
How could I possibly have fun like this?

334
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,560
We didn't mean to do that...

335
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm not blaming you.

336
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,110
But it's about time for you to explain yourself.

337
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,780
Mr. Kyousuke, please listen. We—

338
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,570
Wait.

339
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,320
I'll take my turn now.

340
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,620
What?

341
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,960
Miss Kiririn.

342
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,880
You understand, right?

343
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,630
I just have to do it, right?

344
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
Here, take it!

345
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,590
What?

346
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,510
I said you can have it!

347
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,510
I don't get it!

348
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,730
Oh, figure it out already! I'm giving you a present!

349
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,020
A present?

350
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,190
Right.

351
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,030
I'm sorry I did all that.

352
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,910
Thanks for everything.

353
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,790
Um... Did you hear me?

354
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,040
Y-Yeah...

355
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,540
Oh, really?

356
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,760
Good then.

357
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,510
This party was something we planned to cheer you up.

358
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,980
It was also meant for Miss Kiririn to apologize to you.

359
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,690
It's our fault you were upset.

360
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,480
We're sorry.

361
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,940
Is that why...

362
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,610
Hey, you know...

363
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,820
You probably can't figure it out unless I tell you, so I'll tell you now.

364
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,700
What?

365
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm really thankful for everything you've done for me.

366
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,540
If you weren't there for me, I wouldn't have been able to convince Dad.

367
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,960
And I wouldn't have made up with Ayase.

368
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,840
And I wouldn't have met these two.

369
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,180
Without anyone to talk to about games or anime, I'd be depressed, all alone.

370
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,390
I don't know how things would be now.

371
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,440
So... um...

372
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,230
That's how it is!

373
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,320
What are you crying about?!

374
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,490
Idiot! I'm not crying!

375
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,910
Stop that!

376
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,160
It's seriously gross!

377
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,000
Not like it's something to cry about!

378
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,080
Come on! Are you stupid?

379
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I've...

380
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,630
I've done all sorts of things to help Kirino.

381
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,890
But those were all things I decided to do myself, on my own terms.

382
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Even if she isn't cute, or if she makes me irritated, or if I'm jealous of her talents...

383
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm her brother, so I can't help it.

384
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,190
It's so natural, I can't help it.

385
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,780
That's why I don't need thanks, and I don't want any, either.

386
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,410
That's what I thought. And that hasn't changed.

387
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,530
That can't change.

388
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,330
But for some reason, the tears won't stop...

389
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,790
It's just not fair!

390
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,000
Sneaking in an ambush like this...

391
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,260
Thanks, Kirino.

392
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,300
I'll take good care of this present.

393
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,970
Sure, sure.

394
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,060
But don't say that yet. You haven't even opened it.

395
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,390
Oh, right. Can I open it?

396
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,230
D-Do what you want.

397
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,440
Okay.

398
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,120
What is this?

399
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,370
That's a seriously godly game!

400
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,920
You'd better play it!

401
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,170
Man, you...

402
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,420
Think of it as me and take real good care of it.

403
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,470
What?

404
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,930
What are you laughing about?

405
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,850
Is he broken?

406
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,940
No, I think that's the right reaction.

407
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,400
I see. So you're that happy?

408
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,450
I guess...

409
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,660
Thanks, Kirino.

410
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,400

411
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,400
