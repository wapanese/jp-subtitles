1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,040
Onii-chan!

2
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,920
Come on, how long are you going to stay in bed?

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,420
It's morning already.

4
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,640
Breakfast will get cold if you don't get up.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,180
I made it for you and everything.

6
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,640
Take off your shirt, I'll put it in the wash.

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,550
You're a fake.

8
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:58,780
You see, my sister would never wake me up or cook breakfast or do my laundry.

9
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,160
In fact, she completely looks down on me and treats me like an idiot, or outright ignores me!

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,790
She doesn't listen to a word I say!

11
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,830
There's no way she'd come into my room like this to wake me up!

12
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,800
Onii-chan?

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,340
Basically, what I'm trying to say is...

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,710
There's no way my sister can be this cu—

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,150
sonna yasashiku shinai de donna kao sureba ii no

16
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,150
Don't be so nice to me, I just don't know how to react

17
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:47,260
tsumikasaneta kotoba de mienaiyo kimi no yokogao

18
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:47,260
With all these words piling up, I can't even see your face

19
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,560
dokodakke? nakushita kagi ha mitsukaranai mama de

20
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,560
Where is it? I lost my key, now I can't find it

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,230
tameiki surechigai ni iji hatte tsukarechau

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,230
Sigh, I'll burn out if I keep acting like this whenever we miss

23
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,950
hon no sukoshi chikaku kimi to no kyori ga

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,950
Maybe we're close? I just can't figure out

25
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,320
umaku tsukamenainda ato chotto na no ni

26
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,320
Just how far away I am, even though you're right there

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,170
sonna yasashikushinaide hora mata kizutsukeatte

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,170
Don't be so nice to me, see? We hurt each other again

29
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:34,290
tsumikasaneta uso demo ugokenakunatteru

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:34,290
With all these lies piling up, I can't even move

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,600
sugu ni ai ni ikitai kedo kotoba ha mitsukaranai shi

32
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,600
I want to see you now, but I don't know what to say

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:51,940
saigo no ichi pe-ji kai? kimi ni ha egao misetai

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:51,940
Is this the end for our story? I want you to see my smile

35
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,680
There's No Way I Could Love My Sister

36
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,910
All right, here's yours.

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,410
Where's Kirino?

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,790
She left already.

39
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,330
She has morning practice today.

40
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,390
I see.

41
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,640
She broke her record again.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,830
They say she might be going to a big tournament soon!

43
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,850
I see.

44
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,720
Thanks for the food.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,030
"I see" is all you say these days!

46
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,430
Morning, Kyou-chan!

47
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,700
Kirino-chan had morning practice?

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,390
It's hard living in the shadow of an overachieving little sister.

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,350
She's smart and pretty too.

50
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,150
Everyone in the shopping district talks about her.

51
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,170
So I'm being shamed at a town level?

52
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,870
I just want to live my life out quietly...

53
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,850
Normal is best for us humans.

54
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,550
Mundane, ordinary, or like the majority.

55
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,800
By that definition, you're perfect.

56
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,630
If there were a Miss Normal contest, you'd easily take first place.

57
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,930
The Normal Queen.

58
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,400
Really? How embarrassing...

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,940
No, that wasn't really a compliment.

60
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,310
Take your seats.

61
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,260
We're starting homeroom.

62
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,370
"Bring me a tree of sleet, will you, Kenji?"

63
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,300
This line is from Miyazawa Kenji's "Morning of Final Farewell", which was written for his sister.

64
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,500
It means “Please bring me a tree of rain”.

65
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,010
Biographers of his life say that his sister was a major influence in his life.

66
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,380
...his younger sister.

67
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,010
Good, now in Japanese.

68
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,990
"Instead of George driving was his little sister."

69
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,560
And so Ono no Imoko was the one who delivered Prince Shoutoku's famous "Son of Heaven from the Land of the Rising Sun" letter.

70
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,140
Bye bye!

71
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,660
What the hell was with today?

72
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Some international little sister appreciation day?

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,350
What?

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,660
Nothing.

75
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,850
See you tomorrow!

76
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,900
Yeah.

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,150
Yeah, I went there too!

78
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,180
That place is crazy!

79
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,790
But don't you think the service sucks?

80
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,060
They ignored me the first time.

81
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,920
You too, Ayase?

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, the one with the fat legs!

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,460
What? That's so dumb!

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,590
I'm back.

85
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,450
No way, the other one!

86
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,660
You know, the place Kanako told us about!

87
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,160
Oh, what was it again...

88
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,830
Yeah!

89
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,560
Yeah.

90
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,060
You don't remember?

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,880
We went there together after the shoot!

92
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,690
Wasn't it in May?

93
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,580
Yeah...

94
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,050
Yeah.

95
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,800
That's okay, I'll take you there.

96
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,050
Oh, it's today?

97
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,490
Sorry.

98
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,500
Don't touch it!

99
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,200
I'm going out.

100
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,710
What the hell.

101
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,380
What?

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Why is her hair pink?

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,060
I'm home!

104
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,560
What's wrong, Kyousuke?

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,440
What's with the fetal position?

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,600
Don't mind me.

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,620
I just felt like a change of pace.

108
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,320
Oh?

109
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,400
I almost died as a member of society there...

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,580
So whose is this?

111
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,360
Dad's?

112
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,920
Mom's?

113
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,100
Kirino's?

114
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,990
None of them seem to fit...

115
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,310
Make Love with Little Sister! — Limited First Edition

116
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,250
Stardust Witch...

117
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,310
Little Sister...

118
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,100
Meruru...

119
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,150
Make Love...

120
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,490
Limited Edition...

121
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,550
R-18...

122
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,340
I make some pretty crazy mistakes!

123
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,490
I grabbed the nearest case while I was putting away this CD and switched the contents!

124
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,740
What the hell?!

125
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,370
Make Love? With Little Sister?

126
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,630
Like hell!!

127
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,440
What the hell do you want me to do?!

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,820
And R-18?!

129
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,950
This is an eroge, dammit!!

130
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,560
Kyousuke! Weren't the dirty magazines you hide under your bed good enough for you?

131
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,810
You're kidding me. That's seriously gross.

132
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,080
Die.

133
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,150
This is seriously bad...

134
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,840
If I'm caught with this...

135
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,120
Kyousuke!

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
Are you study—

137
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,640
—ing?

138
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,810
Did I come at a bad time?

139
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,870
Never mind me!

140
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,350
I'm just training my voice box!

141
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,370
And knock next time!!

142
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,020
Sorry!

143
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,560
I am definitely going to find out who the real culprit is!

144
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,120
What are you doing?

145
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
Huh?

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,710
None of your business.

147
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,610
That so?

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,650
At this moment, the suspect is obstructing justice by maintaining silence.

149
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,460
I'm going to the convenience store later. Need anything?

150
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,430
Get me some ice cream.

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,890
The culprit is among us!

152
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,650
Oh yeah, a friend of mine got really into this anime aimed at girls recently.

153
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,400
"Stardust" or something.

154
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,200
What are you talking about?

155
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,990
Well it sounded interesting, so I thought I might try it.

156
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,470
Isn't that what those "otaku" people watch?

157
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,160
They talk about them on TV sometimes.

158
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,700
Don't become like them.

159
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,030
Right, Dad?

160
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,260
Right.

161
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,920
Don't go polluting your mind with that filth.

162
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,990
Okay.

163
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,700
I guess that reaction rules them out.

164
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,920
Which means...

165
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,060
What's wrong, Kirino?

166
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,440
Thanks for the meal!

167
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,840
No way...

168
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,280
All right then...

169
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,120
I guess I'll head to the convenience store...

170
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,120
No way...

171
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,570
No way!

172
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,950
Hey.

173
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,620
What are you doing?

174
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,120
Who cares what I'm doing?

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,890
I care!! This is my room!

176
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,520
Move.

177
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,420
Answer my question.

178
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,950
Move!

179
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,910
This is what you're looking for, right?

180
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,470
So it is yours!

181
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,300
What are you talking about?

182
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,690
There's no way I'd watch an anime like that!

183
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,600
Your actions don't match your words!

184
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,700
If you weren't looking for this, what were you doing in my room?

185
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,060
I was...

186
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,930
I was...

187
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,690
I was...

188
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,950
Here, take it.

189
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,160
I said it's not—

190
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,650
Then throw it away for me.

191
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,030
Huh?

192
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,430
Sorry, I guess I misunderstood.

193
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,830
It's not yours then.

194
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,600
I don't want to carry it around though, so throw it away for me please.

195
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,980
F-Fine...

196
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,890
Do you think it's weird?

197
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:31,010
I said, i-if this were actually mine,

198
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,850
would you think that's weird?

199
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,360
Why would I think that's weird?

200
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,860
Really?

201
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,810
Yeah.

202
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,320
It doesn't matter what hobbies you have.

203
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,120
I wouldn't make fun of you.

204
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,640
I see.

205
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,250
What's with her?

206
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,630
Oh crap, I forgot about the ice cream...

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,310
What are you—

208
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,540
Be quiet.

209
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,120
Wh-What are you doing?

210
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,410
I-I need to talk to you.

211
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,910
Come to my room.

212
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,360
Can this wait till tomorrow?

213
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,380
No.

214
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,230
Don't stare at everything.

215
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,530
I'm not staring!

216
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,930
So, what did you want to talk about?

217
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,060
Hurry up or I'm out of here.

218
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,820
You said earlier...

219
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,320
Even if I had stuff like that, you wouldn't make fun of me.

220
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,170
Huh? Yeah...

221
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,870
Like, really really?

222
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,200
No questions?

223
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,630
Once is enough. I won't.

224
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,470
If you're lying, I'll kill you.

225
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,680
She'll kill me?

226
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,100
Uh—

227
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,920
—eling.

228
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
What? I didn't hear that.

229
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,180
I want some life counseling!

230
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,680
Life counseling?

231
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,470
You?

232
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,410
From me?

233
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,350
You have a closet?!

234
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,430
This room was originally Japanese-style.

235
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,650
It's probably left over from the remodeling.

236
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,860
So I turned it into this.

237
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,930
Y-You... th-this—

238
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,100
Wh-What is this?!

239
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,830
Oh, that's the PC version.

240
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,550
It originally came out on PS2, but it turned into a completely different series after the port.

241
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,050
It's a masterpiece, but it's a bit hard, so I wouldn't recommend it to an amateur.

242
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,720
I didn't ask about that!

243
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,750
By the way, I have everything before it too.

244
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,230
And what's that about amateurs?

245
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,810
Are you a pro? A professional?!

246
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,860
Here we go...

247
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,670
This is series 3, Super Sister-in-Law.

248
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,400
Series 2, Playing with Younger Sisters.

249
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,760
Series 9, Tengen Toppa 12 Sisters.

250
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,940
Series 16, Saishuu Heiki Imouto.

251
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,090
Are these all PC games?

252
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,140
Right.

253
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,480
Why are the boxes so big?

254
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,910
There are small ones too.

255
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:44,870
My Younger Sister Is Mai Waifu, Welcome to Younger Sister Land, Sister Collector: Imoking ~Sorry to Trouble You Every Sister~.

256
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,270
But these are the ones that go mainstream.

257
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,740
They're a completely different experience on the screen.

258
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,680
They catch your eye even if it's only by mail order.

259
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,220
Eroge are a race against the release.

260
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,220
Sorry, I have no clue what you're talking about.

261
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,770
What's this?

262
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,950
A special edition anime DVD box.

263
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,980
Special edition?

264
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,130
A re-edited complete version of the TV broadcast and unaired episodes on bonus disks and stuff!

265
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,400
And special booklets and mini-dramas and limited edition figures!

266
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,740
Amazing, right?

267
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,380
That... Stardust Meruru whatever thing?

268
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,200
Stardust Witch Meruru!

269
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,750
It's insulting if you don't get it right!

270
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,500
To who?

271
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,360
This is the broadcast version, this is the popular box, R1 version, R1 popular box, and Blu-Ray.

272
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,030
Why did you buy this many copies of the same thing?!

273
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,860
As an offering!

274
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
I seriously don't get anything you're saying.

275
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,860
Okay, calm down.

276
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,370
Try to understand this situation.

277
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,320
This is my sister's room.

278
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm so proud of my collection!

279
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,900
My sister is in front of me,

280
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,000
along with a mountain of eroge and anime DVDs.

281
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,000
Aren't these things expensive?

282
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
Kind of, I guess.

283
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,620
This was ¥41,970, and this was ¥55,000.

284
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,520
That's hella expensive!

285
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,430
You're a middle schooler!

286
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,820
Where did you get that kind of money?!

287
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,240
Royalties, obviously.

288
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,510
What?

289
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,440
You're a model?

290
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,310
Yeah.

291
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,890
I had no idea...

292
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,740
Isn't this a major magazine?

293
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,900
Are you like, amazing or something?

294
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,710
It's not a big deal.

295
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,670
Really.

296
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,400
And so?

297
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,610
What do you mean, "so"?

298
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,520
What do you think?

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,780
About my hobby.

300
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,190
Surprising.

301
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,430
Anything else?

302
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,030
What else can I say?

303
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,640
Is it weird for me to have things like this?

304
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,810
No, I mean,

305
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,650
it's unexpected, but you're buying it with your own money.

306
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,640
What you buy is your choice.

307
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,650
You think so?

308
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,290
Really?

309
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,100
Yeah.

310
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,650
You don't have to care about what people think.

311
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,540
I'm just surprised.

312
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm not making fun of you or anything.

313
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,950
I see. You're right.

314
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,810
You say good stuff sometimes!

315
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,170
Come to think of it...

316
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,450
Why are all these eroge the little sister love type?

317
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,730
Why do you think?

318
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,800
No clue...

319
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,720
Why are you backing away?

320
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,330
Well, you...

321
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,710
When you look at this package, don't you think it might be good?

322
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,090
What do you mean?

323
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,720
Look at it! Isn't it really cute?!

324
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,360
In other words, you have all those games...

325
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,290
...because you like little sisters?

326
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,730
Yeah!

327
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,450
Little sisters are just so cute!

328
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,770
Like in these galge, they call you "Onii-chan" or "Aniki" or "Nii-nii" or "Nii-chama"!

329
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,870
They all love me and have their own names for me!

330
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,740
It just makes me go crazy!

331
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,170
I-I see. That's nice...

332
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,960
Well, I've never been called anything like that,

333
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,880
and rather than going crazy, I'd get irritated...

334
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,900
In this one, I love this girl!

335
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,600
Younger sisters have to have black hair and twintails!

336
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:25,430
They look so pure, you just want to protect them, or hold them tight!

337
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,040
Your hair is brown.

338
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,430
You're pointing out your own problems yourself!

339
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,460
They're so lovely!

340
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,460
She's hopeless.

341
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,930
But why?

342
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,980
It's normally guys that buy things like that.

343
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,320
Why would—

344
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,590
Why do you like them?

345
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,180
I don't know.

346
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,330
You don't know?

347
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,430
I really don't know why!

348
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,260
I can't help it.

349
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,160
I fell in love with them before I knew it.

350
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,130
Even I know that this isn't a hobby normal girls have.

351
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,680
That's why I've been hiding it all this time!

352
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,470
But I really love them.

353
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:04,440
I Google them and try out the demos and before I know it I just have to buy them!

354
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,940
No matter how many times I try to stop, this cuteness just drives me crazy again!

355
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,610
Every news site keeps announcing new information every day and makes me want to buy them.

356
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,450
It's all KarzuSP and AkibaBlog's fault!

357
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,730
I don't really get it, but you could just stop reading them.

358
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,620
I wouldn't have any problems if I could.

359
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,960
Hey, what do you think I should do?

360
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,200
What you should do?

361
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,710
Maybe I should tell Mom and Dad—

362
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,500
Don't do that!

363
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,730
You wouldn't be worried if you could.

364
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,120
There will be big trouble if Dad ever finds out.

365
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,060
I don't even want to think about what would happen.

366
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,360
I see.

367
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,600
I get it. I'll help you out.

368
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,990
I'll make sure no one finds out about your hobby.

369
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,150
I don't know what I can do, though.

370
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,020
You will?

371
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,750
Sure.

372
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,020
If you need anything, just ask.

373
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,340
Anything that I can do, anyway.

374
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,380
R-Really?

375
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,340
Then I guess I will...

376
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,830
It might be a real help if you did.

377
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,010
I just want to confirm one thing though...

378
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,100
You play these little sister eroge because you love little sisters, right?

379
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,120
Huh? I said that, didn't I?

380
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,100
You don't have any ulterior motives?

381
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,150
Gross!

382
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,810
No way I would!

383
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,780
Get away from me!

384
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,430
This year's grossest!

385
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,570
Look here... in your games, the younger sister loves her brother, right?

386
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,420
Are you stupid?

387
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,950
Don't mix 2D and 3D!

388
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,670
No way any sister would love her brother in real life!

389
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,250
That's more like her.

390
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,220
We're done here, so get out now.

391
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,310
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,360
I guess I'll sleep.

393
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,680
Not cute at all.

394
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,750
What!

395
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,370
More life counseling.

396
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,110
Kyousuke

397
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:40,840
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

398
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:40,880
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

399
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:40,930
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

400
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:40,970
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

401
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,010
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

402
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,050
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

403
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,090
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

404
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,170
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

405
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:41,220
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

406
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,260
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

407
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,300
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

408
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,370
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

409
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:41,380
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

410
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,470
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

411
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,510
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

412
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,590
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

413
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,630
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

414
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,110
Wha... Sh-Shiori......?

415
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,260
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

416
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,340
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

417
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,380
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

418
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,510
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

419
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:42,590
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

420
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,680
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

421
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,720
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

422
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:42,800
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

423
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:42,880
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

424
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:42,970
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

425
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,050
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

426
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,220
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

427
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,300
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

428
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,380
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

429
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,170
Shiori is sleeping next to me. I...

430
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,170
Hug her gently and closely

431
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,170
Slip out of bed without waking her up

432
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,170
Screw that, kick her out of my bed!

433
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,760
Kyousuke

434
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:48,930
What the hell are you doing?!

435
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:48,970
What the hell are you doing?!

436
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,020
What the hell are you doing?!

437
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,060
What the hell are you doing?!

438
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,140
What the hell are you doing?!

439
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,180
What the hell are you doing?!

440
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,220
What the hell are you doing?!

441
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,310
What the hell are you doing?!

442
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,350
What the hell are you doing?!

443
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,430
What the hell are you doing?!

444
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,470
What the hell are you doing?!

445
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:49,520
What the hell are you doing?!

446
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,560
What the hell are you doing?!

447
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:49,600
What the hell are you doing?!

448
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
What the hell are you doing?!

449
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,020
What the hell are you doing?!

450
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,700
Same to you! What are you making me do?!

451
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,790
You're unbelievable!

452
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,530
How can you just kick your cute sister out of your bed like that?!

453
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,360
Is she seriously saying that to me,

454
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,680
after slapping me awake in the middle of the night?!

455
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,700
I'm not in the wrong here!

456
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,530
This is definitely her fault!

457
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:13,050
Where in this world is there a brother who would play a game about loving a little sister with his little sister?!

458
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,540
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry Onii-chan!

459
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,910
See? Don't you feel sorry for Shiori-chan?

460
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,380
What do you have to say for yourself?

461
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,550
Little sisters should treat their brothers with more respect—

462
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,950
Huh? What was that?

463
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,550
Nothing.

464
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,190
Now hurry up and carry on!

465
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:34,280
When I said I'd help you, I wasn't referring to this...

466
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,030
Huh?

467
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,810
You said to ask you if there's anything I need help with!

468
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,460
I was talking about keeping this a secret from Dad!

469
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,870
Why do you need me to play through an eroge with you?

470
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,340
Y-You just need to!

471
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,850
I want someone to give me an objective viewpoint of this game!

472
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,580
I want an actual opinion.

473
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,010
How can I be objective about this?!

474
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,220
Come on, look at it from my perspective.

475
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,740
Half a day ago I didn't even know this sort of game existed!

476
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,120
Isn't throwing me into a situation like this is a bit much?

477
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,810
So you're making fun of me after all.

478
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,940
You're all talk in the end.

479
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,970
You're prejudiced against this hobby!

480
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,740
That's not it!

481
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,530
This is just awkward!

482
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,730
It's like sitting together in the living room watching a drama and it suddenly gets to a kissing scene!

483
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,720
That's what it's like!

484
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,960
What? You're not making any sense.

485
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,940
This is an R-18 game, right?

486
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,940
"Those" kinds of scenes are going to happen, right?

487
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,800
Are you really okay with watching a scene where a brother and sister do that kind of thing with me?

488
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,390
Gross!!

489
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,970
Idiot!

490
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,750
Pervert!

491
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,250
Why are you actually thinking of that kind of thing?

492
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,290
It'd be more of a problem if I weren't!!

493
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,320
Fine.

494
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,300
I'll take out the all-ages version just for you then.

495
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,110
You should have taken that out from the start!

496
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,260
And you really don't get it!

497
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,770
You can only fully appreciate the story if you play the original release, though.

498
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,270
If you want to talk about that stuff, ask your friends.

499
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,480
Stop blabbing and take it.

500
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,410
It's pretty late already, you know...

501
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,090
How about you lend me your laptop?

502
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,080
Then I'll play the R-18 version when I have some free time.

503
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,880
Well, if you insist...

504
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,000
This is your homework then.

505
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,340
Clear this before next week.

506
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,580
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,000
Exit the game?

508
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,870
Onii-chan!

509
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,310
Let's play again!

510
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,860
Bye bye!

511
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,770
kimoi! kimoi! tte, sonna kakkou de atashi no tonari ni tatanaide yo

512
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,770
Gross! Gross! Don't stand by my side in public!

513
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,070
majisaitee! datte, kocchi jirojiro minna! kono baka aniki!

514
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,070
You're the worst! Don't stare at me that way! Stupid brother!

515
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,400
Chou rori - Chou moe - Chou rabu - Chou Puripuritii na imouto wo kudasai

516
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,400
Super loli - Super moe - Super love - Super pretty, give me a little sister like this!

517
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,060
chiisaku tte kirakira shiteru

518
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,060
Small and shining

519
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,910
atashi dake no suitto enjeru

520
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,910
a sweet angel for me alone.

521
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,620
atashi ni kawaii imouto wo...

522
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,620
Give me a cute little sister...

523
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,860
Hitori de nemurenai kara, issho ni netemoii?

524
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,860
I can't get to sleep alone, can I sleep with you?

525
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,760
...nanchatte, aa maji shiawase maji yabai! yabaissu!

526
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,760
... just kidding. Ah! I'm really happy. It's just awful! Awful!

527
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,480
tte haa? be, betsu ni koi na koto kangaeteru wake janai shi

528
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,480
What? I-It's not like I'm thinking about love or anything!

529
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,940
yume miru no wa ii janai

530
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,940
It's not good to wish for it

531
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,390
kuusou kurai noo puroburemu

532
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,390
but there's no problem when it's just a fantasy.

533
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:31,020
manneri na mainichi ni, chiisana shigeki no essensu

534
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:31,020
In your daily need, do you need

535
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,110
anata ni datte hitsuyou desho?

536
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,110
any bit of motivation?

537
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,840
itsuka kitto wakaru hazu

538
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,840
One day you should understand

539
