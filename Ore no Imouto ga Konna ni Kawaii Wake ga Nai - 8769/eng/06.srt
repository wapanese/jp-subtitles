1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,450
Halloween?

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, Halloween!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,450
Your place sells Japanese sweets...

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,750
That's got nothing to do with Halloween.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,800
Actually, we decided to hold a fair and make Western-style Japanese sweets.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,690
Then those are Western sweets...

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,510
You think so?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,250
Anyway, they're already made, and the fair is tomorrow, so I was thinking maybe you could come try some?

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,580
After school maybe?

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,520
Yeah, sure...

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,170
Great!

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,380
It's really something, so look forward to it!

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,870
Tamura-san!

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,380
Okay!

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,670
I've been wondering for a while, but are you and Tamura-san going out?

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,120
No. Do we look like it?

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,330
That's how I see it.

18
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,380
In fact, I can't see it any other way.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,310
That's not how we are.

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,870
We're close of course, considering how long we've known each other.

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,390
But you're saying there aren't any feelings beyond that between you two?

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,630
Right?

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,000
Akagi...

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,970
Let's say for example you had a very kind old Grandma.

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,640
Where's this totally unrelated example coming from?

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,680
One day, that Grandma gets magically transformed into a 15-year-old girl.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,230
How would you feel about her, keeping in mind that she practically raised you?

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,400
I don't think I can imagine how I'd feel in such a messed up situation.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,400
We're pretty much like that.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,660
You lost me.

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,530
Well, I don't really care if you understand or not.

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,080
Basically, you're not going out, and you never intend to?

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,290
Why are you asking me this?

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,300
So if some guy made a move on her, you wouldn't care?

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,340
Of course I would!

36
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,930
There's no way I'd allow that!

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,430
I'd beat the crap out of anyone messed up enough to do that.

38
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,060
So basically...

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,980
She's nothing more than a childhood friend to you...

40
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,770
You're not going out with her...

41
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,560
You have no feelings for her...

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,940
But you wouldn't allow any other guys to go out with her?

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,450
Yeah, so?

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,450
So what did you do last night?

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,740
That's a secret!

46
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,210
sonna yasashiku shinai de donna kao sureba ii no?

47
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,210

There's No Way My Childhood Friend

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
I'm back!

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,400
Welcome home.

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
A package arrived for you.

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,960
What did you buy?

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,000
A dakimakura!

74
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,130
I mean... something I found online that relieves stress.

75
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,360
Oh?

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,050
If it works, let me know.

77
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,180
Sure.

78
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,520
Can't let her know...

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,890
I see... sure is Halloween.

80
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,160
Are you going to get customers with this?

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,620
Of course!

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,960
We're doing an event for the first day too.

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,150
Event?

84
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,300
We're going to invite the kids from around the neighborhood and show them how to make sweets and hand them out.

85
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,800
The workers are going to be dressed up as monsters too.

86
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,660
I'm back!

87
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,280
You mean your Grandparents?

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,120
The rest of the family too.

89
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,660
So I'll be helpâ€”

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,920
What's wrong?

91
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,420
Grandpa!

92
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,940
Grandpa, you okay??

93
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,900
Hey!

94
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,170
He's cold!

95
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,490
Call an ambulance, Manami!

96
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,300
Okay!!

97
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,190
Grandpa...

98
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,560
Oh, it's Kyou-chan. Welcome!

99
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
Grandma!! Grandpa has...

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,090
Oh?

101
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,570
He's playing dead?

102
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,140
No wait, he really is dead!

103
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,450
His body's gone cold already!

104
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,060
He got into the shop refrigerator a little while ago.

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,730
So this is what it was for...

106
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,840
But he doesn't have a pulse!

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,590
He's always had a weak pulse.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,610
Why does he smell like a corpse?

109
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,220
That's his natural body odor.

110
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,220
But... wait...

111
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,230
Grandpa, if you don't cut it out, I'll pull the hairs out of your head one by one.

112
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,050
Dang, you're one devil of a wife.

113
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,990
How could you even think of harming what little hair I have left?

114
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,640
See?

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,690
Happy Halloween, Kyou-chan!

116
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,560
Trick or... what was it again?

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,500
Has your brain started to rot?!

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,400
Kyou-chan!

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
What's the number for an ambulance??

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,110
Like I know!

121
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm so glad you're still alive, Grandpa!

122
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,410
Ah, sorry about that!

123
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,830
I got a little carried away...

124
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,000
I want to punch him in the face!!

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,290
What's up, Kyou-chan?

126
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,400
Why were you playing dead?

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,090
I was just practicing my costume for tomorrow.

128
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,720
My zombie impression was great, right?

129
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,910
Actually, you seemed more like a normal corpse.

130
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,020
Any kid who sees you will get traumatized.

131
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,440
I don't think you should let them see that.

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,980
He's right, you know.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,660
Is that right...

134
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,870
Well fine then.

135
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,240
Not like I care anyway.

136
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,700
Don't bother consoling him.

137
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,330
If you play along with him he'll just go overboard again.

138
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,270
Understood.

139
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,690
I'll go get some of the Halloween candy then.

140
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,470
I'll go help her.

141
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,600
You seem to be popular with the grannies.

142
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,810
That doesn't make me happy!

143
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,390
And why was that plural?

144
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,770
Have you done it yet?

145
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,690
Done what?!

146
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,980
And of course we haven't!

147
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,730
Hey, it's An-chan! Been a while!

148
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,110
Yo, long timeâ€”

149
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,860
What happened to your hair?

150
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,190
I cut it all off!

151
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,240
What do you think?

152
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,220
Skinheads are popular nowadays!

153
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,740
That's a monk's buzzcut, you know...

154
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,450
No skinhead looks like that.

155
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,540
No way, An-chan!

156
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,550
The barber said, "Right, skinhead. Skinhead."
then cut it with his clipper.

157
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,010
He even asked how short I wanted it.

158
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,220
That's a totally different hairstyle.

159
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,800
You're supposed to use a special razor for that.

160
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Not that I know much about it...

161
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,970
No way!!

162
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,240
That barber ripped me off!

163
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,680
I thought so!

164
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,120
Ever since you came back with that I've been wanting to say,

165
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,210
There's no "skin" there!

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,770
for the longest time!

167
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,790
You should have just told him...

168
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:56,200
You cut your hair on a whim so you got what's coming to you!

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,870
Stupid Rock!

170
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,510
"Rock"?

171
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,750
Hey, get this!

172
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,540
When he got back from the barber he was all like,

173
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,280
"Check out my awesome hairstyle! From now on you can call me Rock!"

174
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,210
Your name's Iwao though...

175
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,630
Tamura Iwao...

176
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,780
Adults are all liars!

177
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,890
Don't trust those over-50s!

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,140
These are really elaborate...

179
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,580
Right?

180
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,240
P-Please go ahead and try some!

181
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,470
S-Sure...

182
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,750
It's great!

183
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,050
Really?

184
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,760
You put actual pumpkin inside?

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,930
Yeah! You can tell?

186
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,050
Did you make these?

187
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,600
Why?

188
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,020
Well, you wanted to know what I thought...

189
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,850
Yeah, I made them...

190
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm so glad you like them!

191
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,610
Yeah...

192
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,110
Why don't you two just get married already?

193
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,760
Grandpa!

194
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,410
Sometimes even he makes sense.

195
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, stop that you two!

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,420
Kyou-chan, let's go to my room.

197
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,520
Sure...

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,420
Woo! Getting hot up there!

199
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,610
That's so old...

200
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,610
Oh, really?

201
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,940
Wait here a second.

202
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,440
You need to hide something?

203
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh, come on!

204
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,250
Yeah, I guess this isn't <i>her</i> we're talking about.

205
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,180
What was that??

206
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,220
I knew it!

207
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Nothing's really changed here...

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,910
Stop staring!

209
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,840
Itâ€˜s embarrassing...

210
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,850
Um... what should we do?

211
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,000
Sleep.

212
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,050
I think I've been staying up late studying too much these days.

213
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,260
I feel like just relaxing and taking a nap.

214
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,860
That okay?

215
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,490
So that's what you meant...

216
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,180
No studying allowed.

217
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,560
I even left my textbooks at school.

218
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,940
I see...

219
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,520
Let's just relax then.

220
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,530
I'll go get some tea.

221
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:15,920
â€˜Kay.

222
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,160
Don't you need to help prepare for the fair?

223
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,620
Yeah, but that'll be after the shop closes.

224
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,340
The whole family will be working on it.

225
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
I'll lend a hand then.

226
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,880
Really?

227
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,710
That'd be a great help!

228
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,510
But aren't you tired?

229
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
It's fine.

230
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,260
Don't worry about me.

231
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,470
Thanks so much!

232
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,930
It's not exactly payment, but you can have dinner here then.

233
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,270
Look, a tea stalk is standing.

234
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,870
Hey, neat.

235
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,290
You bought a dakimakura...

236
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,760
You really have no intentions on stopping, do you?

237
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,410
Huh?! I worked hard to buy my things!

238
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,450
Moreover, a pillow is an everyday necessity.

239
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,520
You have no right to tell me what to do!

240
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,490
It's not really a necessity, is it?

241
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,940
It's just to satisfy a delusion for that little girl.

242
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,260
She's not a little girl!

243
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,540
Meru-chan is young lady.

244
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,940
A MA-GIC-AL GIRL..

245
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,950
Now, now. Calm down.

246
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,390
Anyway, Kiririn-san, what was your brother Kyousuke's reaction to it?

247
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,560
Well...

248
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,240
I thought I'd let him look at it.

249
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,400
But he still hasn't come home.

250
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,420
Seriously, whenever you need that guy, he's never around.

251
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,640
He probably felt the aura of a succubus in the house and feared for his life.

252
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,630
I don't blame him.

253
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,480
I think he went to the library with that plain girl.

254
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,630
The one he's always talking about.

255
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,070
Not that I really care.

256
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,930
Onii-sama is into that kind of girl?

257
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,940
I'm shocked. It didn't seem like him.

258
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,330
Huh? He never told you?

259
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm hearing it for the first time.

260
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,610
So, what's she like?

261
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,660
She's a childhood friend, wears glasses, and is an airhead.

262
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,030
What the? You're keeping a lot to yourself.

263
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,290
Tell us everything.

264
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,540
I see.

265
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,350
You eat breakfast every day with him, so it's obvious you know more.

266
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,500
I don't really understand their relationship,

267
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,870
but everything about her is so...

268
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,510
plain.

269
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,600
Woah, this is heavy!

270
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,710
Ah, thanks.

271
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,720
What the heck are you doing?

272
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,390
An-chan, I understand now.

273
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,260
Rock isn't how you look...

274
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,680
It's a way of life!

275
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,180
There's little difference between a skinhead and a short buzz!

276
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,750
Tomorrow, I shout with all my soul!

277
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,190
And why are you playing a shamisen?

278
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,760
That's more like a biwa player than a rocker.

279
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,010
We don't have a guitarâ€”

280
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,740
Help out.

281
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,780
Fine.

282
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,250
Man, I'm tired.

283
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,510
Good work, Kyou-chan.

284
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,780
Um... do you want dinner first or a bath first?

285
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,680
A bath?

286
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,470
It's been a while since you visited, so Grandpa and Grandma and Dad said you should stay over.

287
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,060
Oh, I see.

288
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,190
Grandpa and Grandma and Dad are really happy to see you again.

289
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,940
Grandpa'sâ€”

290
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,450
Grandpa and Grandmaâ€”

291
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,320
Graâ€”

292
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,820
Grandpa had Grandmaâ€”

293
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,660
I get it, I'll sleep over.

294
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,200
Are you sure?

295
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,620
Well, yeah.

296
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,960
Tomorrow's the weekend.

297
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,000
It's been so long since you slept over.

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,420
I guess you're right.

299
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,380
I used to come over all the time too.

300
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,630
It might be because, you know...

301
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:24,390
You're that age now, so you get nervous staying at a girl's house.

302
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,600
Why would I get nervous staying at your place?

303
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,840
You don't?

304
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,360
Of course not.

305
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,730
It's more relaxing here than at home.

306
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,570
Huh?

307
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,240
What's wrong?

308
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,830
Nothing, I just thought it might be better that way.

309
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,090
Where is he?

310
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,600
He's staying at the Tamuras'.

311
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,020
Honestly, he's always acting like a little kid.

312
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,390
Did you talk to the parents?

313
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,850
Of course.

314
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,020
They said it'd help with their Halloween.

315
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,270
Halloween?

316
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,270
Thanks for the food.

317
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,270
Yes.

318
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,110
Thanks for the meal.

319
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,700
An-chan, how do you play a C minor?

320
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,040
There aren't any chords on a shamisen, you know...

321
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,500
Kyou-chan, Dad's about to get out of the bath. Do you want to take one next?

322
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,420
I can go last. You take one first.

323
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,970
I'm fine going after you.

324
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,430
No, you take one first.

325
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,650
Then how about taking one together?

326
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,150
Kyou-chan, you're blushing!

327
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,030
Alright! Let's take one together!

328
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,950
Seriously?

329
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,200
Super serious!

330
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,080
You already invited me.

331
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,330
You can't take it back now, can you?

332
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,420
An-chan, you're a real man!

333
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,050
I know, right?

334
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,340
Damn! So cool!

335
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,090
Let's go, Manami!

336
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,450
I'll show you my hyper-weapon!

337
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,930
Grandma, what do I do??

338
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,520
Kyou-chan wants to take a bath with me!

339
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,230
Don't go telling everyone!

340
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,840
So take one with him.

341
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,730
Whaâ€”it was a joke!

342
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,730
You so want to, too.

343
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,990
I don't!

344
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,000
Idiot.

345
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,340
Thanks for the bath.

346
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,500
Anytime.

347
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,920
I put your futon in your usual room.

348
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,010
Thanks.

349
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,090
I guess I'll sleep then.

350
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,510
I'll go back to my room.

351
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,720
Hey, Grandma!

352
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,310
Teach me how to play this!

353
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,890
Sure.

354
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,390
What do you want to play?

355
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,380
Something rock.

356
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,070
How many years has it been since we were up until bedtime together?

357
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,110
Four years, I think?

358
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,450
Good night.

359
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,490
Yeah.

360
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,020
Kyou-chan! Kyou-chan!

361
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,750
My futon is...

362
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,250
Huh? My futon?

363
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,300
Apparently...

364
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,510
Wh-Why is it here?

365
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,910
And right next to yours?

366
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,470
Did you do this, Kyou-chan?

367
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,930
Like hell!

368
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,310
Calm down, calm down...

369
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,060
Analyze the situation.

370
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,810
Ah, so basically... I did it!

371
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,730
Kyou-chan, calm down!

372
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,480
Grandpa!

373
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,550
What are you doing?

374
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,030
Just a little something with my heart...

375
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,690
What the heck are you doing, Grandpa?!

376
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,040
It's trauma from the War.

377
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,590
If you don't sleep there with Manami, my chest gets wracked with pain.

378
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,390
What kind of trauma causes that?!

379
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,970
Oh, the pain!

380
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,390
Grandma's calling for me from across the River Styx...

381
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,100
Grandma!

382
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,580
Grandma's downstairs.

383
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,020
This is just weird!

384
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,190
We can't sleep together at our age!

385
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,110
I don't think sheâ€”

386
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,730
I'm...

387
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,780
I'm okay with it...

388
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,740
If you're okay with it.

389
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,070
Well, there you have it.

390
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,120
What?! Wait, you damn nutjob!

391
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,430
It feels like we're kids again.

392
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,380
We used to sleep like this all the time back then.

393
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,850
I never thought we'd do it at this age.

394
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,360
This is all that old codger's fault.

395
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,880
And Grandma... maybe some other time.

396
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,150
I'm going to sleep.

397
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,360
Good night.

398
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,490
Good night, Kyou-chan.

399
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,170
Still awake?

400
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,880
Still awake.

401
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,800
Um...

402
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,390
It'd be nice if we went to the same college.

403
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,410
Yeah.

404
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,560
I wonder how things'll be if we graduate and go to the same college.

405
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,900
How what will be?

406
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,400
Everything.

407
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,400
I don't think it'll change much.

408
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,180
Maybe.

409
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,370
Hey, Manami...

410
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,200
Yes?

411
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,330
What if someone told you they liked you?

412
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,210
What would you do?

413
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,000
Wh-Wh-What?

414
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,380
"What if"!

415
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,300
It's hypothetical!

416
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,130
That kind of fantastic guy might never appear!

417
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,390
If... I don't know what if.

418
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,060
Figured...

419
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,730
Sorry.

420
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,060
Kyou-chan?

421
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,860
If someone told you they liked you, what would you do?

422
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,950
I'd turn them down.

423
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,720
Why?

424
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,950
I like leading a peaceful life.

425
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,830
Things are fine the way they are right now.

426
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,670
Being able to relax in this kind of home is enough for me.

427
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,710
I see...

428
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,840
We've still got a long way to go.

429
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,300
Spoken like a true Grandma.

430
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,220
Well, you're talking like a Grandpa.

431
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,560
Kyou-chan...

432
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,900
Maybe next time...

433
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,650
Um... er...

434
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,030
Sorry... never mind.

435
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,070
Next time...

436
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,910
Want to come to my place next time?

437
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,370
Um...

438
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,330
Yeah, I'd like that.

439
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,380
Sometime soon then.

440
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,630
Okay.

441
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,300
Good night.

442
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,170
How many times is that now?

443
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,050
I'm going to sleep.

444
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,930
Fine, don't come back.

445
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,940
Idiot.

446
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:28,080
nagaku chikaku ni iru to mienakunaru mono

447
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:28,080
When youâ€™ve been together for so long, sometimes you just forget about it

448
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,460
itsuka dokoka de mitsukete watashi ha kawatta

449
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,460
Sometime, somewhere, I found it, but I had changed

450
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,090
nee anata ha kawaranai ne dakara modokashii no

451
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,090
Hey, you never seem to change, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so upset

452
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:47,100
demo tabun sou iu toko fukumete suki nanda

453
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:47,100
But I think thatâ€™s part of what I like about you

454
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,980
mata futari de kaeteyuku yo

455
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,980
Weâ€™ll just keep changing together

456
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,110
zutto konna kankei ga tsudzukeba ii no ni

457
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,110
Even though it would be so nice to stay like this forever

458
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:05,910
kyuu ni sunda kono maegami mitai ni

459
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:05,910
Just like my bangs that I suddenly cut short

460
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,540
mezameta omoi ga mou modoranai kara

461
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,540
My feelings all came up, now I canâ€™t go back

462
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,380
jimi na watashi dakedo sono mama de ii

463
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,380
I might be so plain, but thatâ€™s all okay

464
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,770
anata no kotoba atsuku atsuku nokotteiru

465
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,770
Everything you said still warms me deep inside

466
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,520
There's No Way My Little Sister
 Could Write a Novel

467
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
