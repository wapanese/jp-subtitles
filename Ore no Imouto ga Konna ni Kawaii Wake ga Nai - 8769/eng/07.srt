00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,560
I'm back!

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,610
No one's home?

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,460
You've done well to make it this far.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,330
Allow me to congratulate you.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,540
This is my home...

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:36,090
Don't be so nice to me, I just don't know how to react

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:36,090
sonna yasashiku shinai de donna kao sureba ii no?

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,350
With all these words piling up,

tsumikasaneta kotoba de

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,850
I can't even see your face

mienai yo kimi no yokogao

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,570
Where is it? I lost my key, now I can't find it

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,330
Sigh, I'll burn out if I keep acting like this whenever we fight

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,330
tameiki... surechigai ni iji hatte tsukarechau

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,000
Maybe we're close? I just can't figure out

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,180
Just how far away I am, even though you're right there

tsumikasaneta uso de mou ugokenakunatteru

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:33,230
With all these lies piling up, I can't even move

sugu ni ai ni ikitai kedo kotoba ha mitsukaranai shi

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,620
I want to see you now, but I don't know what to say

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:50,830
If this is the end for our story, I want you to see my smile

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:50,830
saigo no ichi pe-ji kurai kimi ni ha egao misetai

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,620
There's No Way My Little Sister
 Could Write a Novel

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,620
A screening? Of Meruru?

30
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,370
Yes.

31
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,870
Why do you guys have to do it here?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,540
A few days ago, in Akihabara...

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,990
What, you've only watched six episodes?!

34
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,090
Quiet. I'm busy with my own life, you know.

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,740
Be grateful that I've even watched to episode 6.

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,140
Frankly, it's incredibly boring.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,400
Even with these eyes which far surpass humans', I can't find anything good in it.

38
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,650
Maybe your eyes have gone bad from watching your Maschera.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,890
What did you just say?

40
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,120
There, there, there!

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,020
Why don't we have a screening of Meruru and Maschera this Thursday then?

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,580
Why?

43
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,130
You two are always having the same argument.

44
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,800
Your prejudices might be preventing you from seeing each other's anime in a different light.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,780
That's not—

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,480
If we watch it together and offer commentary, you might find a new perspective.

47
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,800
So, Miss "My parents are always gone Thursdays so I can watch anime on the big screen in the living room! Yahoo!"

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,910
...aka your little sister, gave in and agreed.

49
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,620
I see...

50
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,810
Wait, then where's Kirino?

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,520
Her room, probably.

52
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,710
And Saori?

53
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,820
Something urgent came up so she can't make it.

54
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,220
So basically, it's just you and Kirino today?

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Yes.

56
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,470
I get it.

57
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,060
I get it now.

58
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,520
I get it perfectly.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,480
You got into a fight with her.

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,980
Basically.

61
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,970
Mail Inbox

62
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,970
Saori

63
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,970
Mr. Kyousuke,
the rest...

64
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,970
Mr. Kyousuke,
The rest 'tis left to you.

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,970
Mr. Kyousuke, the rest ‘tis left to you.

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,980
‘Tis really left to me, Miss Saori?

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,230
It's more trouble than I want, but...

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,740
Mail Inbox

69
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,740
Saori

70
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,740
Mr. Kyousuke,
the rest...

71
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,740
I do owe Saori a lot.

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,110
Guess I'll have to.

73
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,450
Alright. Eat up.

74
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,620
Alright.

75
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,710
So, what did you get into a fight over?

76
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,420
Anime again?

77
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,920
Novels.

78
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,670
Novels?

79
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,760
Calling that aberration a novel goes against my principles, but your sister said,

80
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,310
"Oh, right. You wrote novels on some site or something, right?"

81
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,730
Woah, that was a scarily good!

82
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,060
She put her soul into that!

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,190
"I tried writing one too. Care to read it?"

84
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,320
"Well, it's perfect, like everything else I do."

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,900
That'd be enough to get me pissed off.

86
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,740
Right?

87
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,820
So, was it boring?

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
I wanted to kill her.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
It was that bad??

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,710
What was it about? I'm actually kind of curious now.

91
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,080
To start with,

92
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,250
the main character was a mirror image of the author.

93
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,840
She refers to herself with "atashi".

94
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,840
That's not all.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,720
She'll start a new paragraph after two or three words...

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
She'll start a new page just because she feels like it...

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
There are more symbols and emotes than actual words...

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
More than half of it is self-glorification.

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,990
And in the end, a goth loli character clearly modeled after me gets raped and dies.

100
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,490
That's so wrong!

101
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,370
Wow, yeah, that's definitely something to get angry about.

102
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,580
Go on. Eat up, eat up.

103
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,000
It won't make up for it, but...

104
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

105
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,590
But you write novels too?

106
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,510
No wonder you can point out flaws so easily.

107
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,010
I wouldn't be able to explain what's wrong with her novel.

108
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,810
It's hard to judge things like that unless you know how to write one properly yourself.

109
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,730
I think you're misunderstanding things.

110
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,610
There is no "correct" for a work of literature.

111
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,650
However it's written, it can't be "wrong".

112
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,410
That's what I think.

113
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,910
Everyone has a different reason for writing, so that's just naturally how it is.

114
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,660
There can be no absolute correct way to write.

115
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:45,170
My complaints just now simply mean that it was not something I could enjoy.

116
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,130
Don't get me wrong.

117
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,800
I see...

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,550
I don't get it at all.

119
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,440
Well, let me just go put this in my room.

120
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,690
Kirino!

121
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,820
You're there, right? Open up—

122
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,200
What are you doing?

123
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Eroge.

124
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,830
What kind of host invites a friend over then goes to play eroge alone?

125
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,340
It's got nothing to do with you.

126
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,590
And anyway, she started it.

127
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,670
Yeah, right!

128
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,060
She said your novel has a character modeled after her that gets raped and dies!

129
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,640
What?

130
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,600
What's she talking about?

131
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,350
Here.

132
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,770
Read this.

133
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,430
Manga and a novel?

134
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,780
That Kuroneko...

135
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,700
That <i>Kuso</i>neko wrote this Maschera alternate ending doujinshi.

136
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,790
You didn't have to start over just to insult her...

137
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,450
So, what about this book?

138
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:08,460
"Hmph. Then while I read this novel that already smells like crap, you can read this."

139
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,840
Woah, that was scarily good!

140
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,960
She put her soul into that!

141
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,960
Was it boring?

142
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,100
I wanted to kill her.

143
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,970
It was that bad??

144
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,020
What's it about?

145
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:30,280
After the last boss of the first season, Queen of Nightmare, is defeated by Shikkoku, she gets shifted back in time to the start of the story.

146
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,530
Oh, Shikkoku is Maschera's main character.

147
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:40,540
So she takes over the corpse of a girl that dies in the original story and gets closer to Shikkoku as a normal girl.

148
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,620
What's so bad about that though?

149
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,960
It actually sounds pretty interesting.

150
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,870
What?

151
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,960
You flipped through the pages a little, and now you think you can comment on it?

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,300
The worst part of this book isn't that obvious.

153
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,970
Look at this! The page is practically black!

154
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,760
Over 90% of it is words.

155
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
Ever thought of starting a new paragraph?

156
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,230
And there are so many obscure words and idioms too!

157
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,600
Can't you just simply say "Boom!" when something explodes, or "Augh!" when someone gets hit?

158
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:17,360
On top of that, this doujinshi requires that you read this 200-page encyclopedia of errata, otherwise you won't understand half of it.

159
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,580
Basically, she just wrote this for her own self-gratification!

160
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,370
And what pisses me off most of all...

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,500
A loli character clearly modeled after me is the main character's sex slave!

162
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,000
That's definitely something to get angry about!

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,670
Right? Right?!

164
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,300
Damn goth loli...

165
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,010
Turning my sister into a sex slave?!

166
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,640
Wait...

167
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,390
Didn't I just do something just like this?

168
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,930
What's wrong?

169
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,440
Nothing.

170
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,520
Wait a second...

171
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,770
Did you actually read through that entire encyclopedia?

172
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,730
I wouldn't be able to complain if I didn't.

173
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,410
You guys really are good friends...

174
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,370
Alright. I get it.

175
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,040
I get it now.

176
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,910
How about this?

177
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,080
The point of this visit was a Meruru screening, right?

178
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,420
Let's try doing that then.

179
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,170
Otherwise, it'll just be a waste of your time.

180
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,050
Fine, I guess.

181
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,260
And isn't this your once-in-a-week chance to watch anime on the big screen?

182
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,010
Not like I care.

183
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:23,970
Saori

184
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,060
Saori

185
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Saori

186
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,060
Saori?

187
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,730
Hello?

188
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,940
Mr. Kyousuke, it's me.

189
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah. What's up?

190
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,060
I'm done over here.

191
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,820
How are things going on your front?

192
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,860
Right now, it seems the first cannon may be lit at any time.

193
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,660
Sorry to keep you waiting!

194
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,790
Now then, let us begin our screening!

195
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,170
Hey, you can't watch it like that!

196
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,710
You need not worry!

197
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,130
I will play it here at the same time.

198
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,800
We may be far separated, but we are of one mind.

199
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,340
A new definition for "live screening"...

200
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,350
Well then, let's start the screening.

201
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,680
Stardust Witch Meruru!

202
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,300
Starts now!

203
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,310
Yes!

204
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,650
Meru-chan! Meru-chan! Meru-chan! Meru-chan!

205
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,820
Why are you going crazy right from the start??

206
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,570
My, it sounds like it's going well.

207
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,320
Stardust Witch Meruru, on the job!

208
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,200
Hey, isn't this kinda sketchy?

209
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,540
Can they really show this on TV?

210
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,620
This is the DVD version.

211
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,880
For the TV broadcast, ribbons hide the little girl's naked body.

212
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,170
Don't call her a little girl!

213
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,680
Fans went wild when some station aired the uncensored version one time.

214
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,090
Yeah... This is...

215
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,300
Kinda dangerous?

216
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,850
The first reason why I can't like this anime.

217
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,730
The opening theme is an electronic song.

218
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,370
With more force than (KIRA☆)

219
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,830
A meteorite (KIRA☆)!

220
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,850
She's basically saying, "I'm going to release my full-power magic into you at point blank, so don't move, bitch".

221
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,980
This girl can bombard her opponent with attacks with a smile on her face.

222
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,980
Disturbing.

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,660
Too many things these days mix loli and ero, and not just in anime either.

224
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,370
I can only weep over the fact that people keep buying this kind of vulgar crap.

225
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,870
The public needs to put more attention into maintaining an aesthetic sense.

226
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,870
You don't get it, do you?

227
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,210
The theme of Meruru is friendship.

228
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,510
Don't say things just because the Maschera DVDs line up well together.

229
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,630
Friendship?

230
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,970
Where in this story is there friendship?

231
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,890
Please explain.

232
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,770
In episode six, Meruru obliterates her friend-turned-Dark Witch Al-chan using her Meteo Impact.

233
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,060
With a huge smile on face.

234
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,780
I said that was unexpected!

235
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Nitpicking at all the small details...

236
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,450
And besides, she revives Al-chan during the B part!

237
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:32,040
You can bring back anyone who dies or anything that breaks in the magical field later!

238
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,530
Mr. Kyousuke? What's going on?

239
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,370
What kind of a cop-out plot device is that?

240
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,540
That's ridiculous.

241
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,790
It's perfectly fine!

242
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,080
Ah whatever, fight all you want...

243
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,080
And she was saved in the end, so it worked out fine!

244
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,880
And anyway, what's with the constant "I'm awesome! I'm awesome!" talk in Maschera?

245
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,880
Well, I guess this is friendship.

246
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,430
I'm back.

247
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,980
What's wrong?

248
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,650
Y-You...

249
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,730
My laptop...

250
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Something wrong with your laptop?

251
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,820
You were looking at porn sites on my laptop!!

252
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,410
Wh-What are you talking about?

253
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,660
The evidence is right there!

254
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,450
How could you even think of making me see something like that?

255
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,120
I can't believe it!

256
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,960
You're the worst!

257
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,880
Come on, don't cry!

258
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm not crying!

259
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,670
Sorry! I'm sorry!

260
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,630
I won't look at them again!

261
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,340
I'm sorry I did it!

262
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,720
I'm calling you Porn Hunter from now on!

263
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,680
Please spare me that!

264
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,980
You're going to make up for this.

265
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,230
Make up?

266
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,360
Life counseling!

267
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,150
What is this?

268
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,610
My☆Star

269
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,610
Imouto☆ Planet

270
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,610
By Rino

271
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,700
My latest work.

272
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,610
Another novel.

273
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,620
You're still writing?

274
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,160
What, got a problem with that?

275
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,620
No, not at all!

276
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,370
I figured out my writing style from the last one.

277
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,370
So this time I figured I should just write about what I like.

278
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,880
And that's what this is?

279
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,130
My☆Star

280
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,130
Imouto☆ Planet

281

282
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,550
What's it about?

283
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,260
My☆Star

284
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,260
Imouto☆ Planet

285
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,260

286
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,380
My☆Star

287
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,380

289

By Kirino

292
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,380
Can't you tell from the title?

293
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,970
It's about me, an astronaut, winding up on a planet full of little sisters and doing amazing things.

294
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,010
That makes no sense to me!

295
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,560
It felt completely different when I finished writing it.

296
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,020
So...

297
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,530
Book

298
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,530
Up

299
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,530
Book

300
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,530
Up

301
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,530

Submission Site

303
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,190
I submitted it here.

304
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,530
You know the light novel publisher Raigeki Bunko?

305
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,660
An editor there read it and asked if I want it published as a book!

306
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,990
Eh? Seriously??

307
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,620
Yeah!

308
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,870
Your book's getting published?!

309
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,910
This is becoming a book??

310
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,500
Don't shout like that!

311
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,880
I don't want Mom and Dad to know yet.

312
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,550
Also, it's not for sure yet.

313
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,550
The editor said that it's hard for readers to get into something like this.

314
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,930
But he said he could feel my passion for little sisters in the writing!

315
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,560
He said it was overflowing with it!

316
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,440
Wow. Her love for little sisters is already at a pro level...

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,400
But I don't want to touch "My Star" again.

318
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,950
I kind of feel like I've finished it.

319
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,450
She's acting like an artist already?!

320
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,700
So I decided to write something new!

321
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:19,870

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:20,790
Imouto City

By Rino

365
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,120
My City

366
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,120
Imouto City

367
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,120
By Rino

368
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,590
Why on earth did I have to follow my sister here to help her do research?

369
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,430
So, what's it about?

370
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,470
It takes place in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo,

371
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:47,860
and the main character goes around saving girls and rebuilding the world with them.

372
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,980
Exciting, right?

373
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,740
Can't you write anything normal?

374
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,030
I'm surprised that this Raigeki Bunko place would publish something like that...

375
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,290
I want to see what one of the characters feels for myself, if possible.

376
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,290
I need you to walk into the middle of that and get hit by a runaway car.

377
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,630
Why??

378
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,290
A big one, if possible.

379
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,500
Like a bus or a dump truck.

380
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,550
I'll die!

381
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,760
It's the only way I can learn how to convey the fear and panic to my readers.

382
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,050
And after this incident, the main character learns how precious life is.

383
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,140
And my life isn't??

384
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,180
Why do I have to get turned into a red splatter on the ground on Christmas?!

385
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,560
You're useless...

386
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,310
Fine then.

387
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,270
I'll just figure out how to do it with some pictures.

388
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,190
Be grateful.

389
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,940
You'd better be more useful at the next spot.

390
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,450
Hey, shopping here can't possibly have anything to do with your novel.

391
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,000
Have you even read the plot?

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The main character starts by going on a date here for Christmas Eve.

393
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,210
After she leaves, the incident happens.

394
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,970
Shiori-chan survives and appears here too.

395
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,970
So you got this idea from an eroge?

396
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,480
Also, the clothes and accessories bought here are given to the little sisters in other towns.

397
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,310
It's an important point at the start of the book.

398
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,980
What kind of convenient survival is that??

399
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,560
And what other towns are there, anyway?

400
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,690
Akiba, Otome Road, Harajuku, and Nakano Broadway.

401
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,570
That's completely messed up!

402
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,240
Anyway, buy this for me.

403
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,120
Like hell I can!

404
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,910
And why do you need that in the first place?!

405
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,330
You really don't get it.

406
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,380
It's things like this that become emotional support in the future!

407
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Isn't that natural, if you receive it from the person you love?

408
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm talking about the story in the novel, of course.

409
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,720
Come on, stop complaining and go buy it already.

410
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,560
There are other places we need to go.

411
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,310
Lend me some cash then.

412
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,140
What?

413
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,600
I've only got ¥18,000 on me.

414
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,690
If you want to give me the difference, I'll go buy it for you.

415
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,400
You're unbelievable!

416
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,900
Why don't you have enough cash on you?

417
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,620
Who would normally be able to just slap down ¥30,000 on an accessory??

418
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,120
What kind of boyfriend is this supposed to be?

419
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,160
A young president for a venture capitalist corporation.

420
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,130
Why don't you just use him for the survival story?

421
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,670
Instead, you're hitting him with a car and stealing his little sister?

422
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,920
You're pretty hardcore.

423
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,930
Fine then.

424
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,090
We can go to my usual shop.

425
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,680
They sell cheap but pretty accessories there.

426
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,190
And why do you want me to buy something for you that badly?

427
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,740
Okay, next is...

428
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,700
There's more?

429
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,790
It's getting cold. Let's go home already.

430
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,870
Why are you complaining?

431
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,700
You've been useless the whole time.

432
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,290
Well, sorry.

433
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,330
I'm a simple high school student.

434
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,210
I'm not qualified to be an author's assistant.

435
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,960
What, are you trying to be sarcastic?

436
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,260
Not really.

437
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,300
I'm just a bit annoyed at having to pay for your "research".

438
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,220
Aren't you just doing this for your own self-gratification?

439
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,610
I don't know what the editor told you, but your story is just ideas out of your eroge in the first place,

440
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,780
so it's not like you need to resear—

441
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,160
Wha—

442
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,040
What are you doing?!

443
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,170
When he first finds Shiori-chan, she's standing in the pouring rain.

444
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:43,300
Pinned down by the debris, her screams for help are heard by no one.

445
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,550
She's cold, and losing hope...

446
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,560
The main character is the only one who hears her voice.

447
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,350
Well?

448
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,440
Pretty powerful scene, right?

449
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,780
I'm not doing this for self-gratification or anything...

450
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,030
I get it.

451
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,740
I was wrong. Come on!

452
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,080
Where next?

453
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,790
Let's see...

454
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,880
Kyou-chan?

455
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,340
M-Manami?

456
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,220
Need something?

457
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,640
You said you were busy today, right?

458
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah...

459
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,980
I made some Christmas cake, so I was thinking if you wanted, you could come over and try some after you're done.

460
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,360
Alright, if I have time I'll drop by.

461
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,940
Okay! Thanks!

462
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Why are you saying thanks?

463
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,490
Manami

464
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,490
Duration

465
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,860
Kyou-chan... are you...

466
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,480
...with a girl right now?

467
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,990
W-Well, I'm with my sister...

468
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,120
Kirino-chan?

469
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,950
Yeah...

470
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,330
So you're on a Christmas date with her?

471
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,420
Not a date...

472
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,170
That shower brought me back to life.

473
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,760
This hotel's bathroom has some weird gadgets...

474
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,510
Huh?

475
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,260
Manami

476
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,260
Duration

477
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,260
Hotel?

478
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,010
Oh no I'm losing reception!!

479
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,930
Huh?

480
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,600
Were you talking to someone?

481
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,020
Oh, Neighbor-girl?

482
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,020
Put on something, will you?

483
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,940
Gross!

484
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,280
Are you fantasizing about your own sister?

485
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,030
Siscons really are the worst.

486
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,280
You're the one person I don't want to hear that from!!

487
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,290
I'm supposed to spend a night here sleeping with Shiori-chan...

488
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,660
But that's enough research.

489
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,290
I'm sensing danger from you already.

490
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,170
Hurry up and dry your hair and clothes already!

491
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,290
Let's leave!

492
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,710
So did this help at all?

493
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,920
Was it worth ruining your Christmas Eve?

494
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,180
Eureka! I've got it!

495
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,560
I've got a great idea!

496
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,020
About what?

497
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,070
What are you doing?

498
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,950
The light's are going to change.

499
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,090
It was one messed up Christmas Eve.

500
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:34,390
But at that point I had no idea what was about to happen...

501
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,990
Masquerade! Kono yoru wa DRESS no kuro ni mi o makasete

502
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,990
Masquerade! On this night, I surrender myself to my black dress

On the days when I waited all alone for the invitation to the ball

507
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,980
Yuki no shiro ni kuroi kafusu akai akai hitomi ni wa namida

508
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,980
My cuffs were black in the white snow and tears were in my red, red eyes

509
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:28,770
Mahou no basha de mukae ni kitte

Awaku namida sora e tokete yuku yo

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,540
My tears will fade and dissolve into the sky
