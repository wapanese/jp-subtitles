1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,850
I'm home.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,240
It's just you?

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,490
Well, I'm terribly sorry to disappoint.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,490
Were you waiting for a friend or something?

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,780
Nothing to do with you.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,410
And I thought it came too, since I heard a motorcycle...

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,010
She's been kind of restless the past few days...

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,510
The next life counseling will be the last one.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,600
She hasn't said anything since that, either.

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,520
What's she thinking?

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,270
I'll leave your dinner in the fridge.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,990
Mom and Dad said they'll be back around 10, so eat it whenever.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,450
Hey, are you listening?

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,700
Dammit, I want to play it already!

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,790
Damn you people who got it on the first day!

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,620
She's not even listening...

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,040
It's here!!

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,550
It finally came!

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,970
You're so late!

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,550
I've been waiting so long for you!

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,560
What is that?

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,060
An eroge.

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,560
Ah, I see...

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,150
sonna yasashiku shinai de donna kao sureba ii no?

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,150
Don't be so nice to me, I just don't know how to react

26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,370
tsumikasaneta kotoba de

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,370
With all these words piling up,

28
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:47,460
mienai yo kimi no yokogao

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:47,460
I can't even see your face

dokodakke? nakushita kagi ha mitsukaranai mama de

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,590
Where is it? I lost my key, now I can't find it

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,230
tameiki... surechigai ni iji hatte tsukarechau

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,230
Sigh, I'll burn out if I keep acting like this whenever we fight

34
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:13,020
hon no sukoshi chikaku kimi to no kyori ga

35
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:13,020
Maybe we're close? I just can't figure out

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:20,240
umaku tsukamenainda ato chotto na no ni

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:20,240
Just how far away I am, even though you're right there

sonna yasashikushinaide hora mata kizutsukeatte

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,460
Don't be so nice to me, see? We hurt each other again

40
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:34,300
tsumikasaneta uso de mou ugokenakunatteru

41
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:34,300
With all these lies piling up, I can't even move

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,590
sugu ni ai ni ikitai kedo kotoba ha mitsukaranai shi

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,590
I want to see you now, but I don't know what to say

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:51,940
saigo no ichi pe-ji kurai kimi ni ha egao misetai

45
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:51,940
If this is the end for our story, I want you to see my smile

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,660
There's No Way My Little Sister
Can Play Eroge Like This

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,660
It's so slow...

48
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,450
Game start!

49
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,130
Good morning.

50
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,510
It's almost time for lunch.

51
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,470
Good morning...

52
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,560
This looks good!

53
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,980
Where's Mom?

54
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,600
Everyone went out.

55
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,780
Then it'll be just the two of us all day?

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,360
Yeah, I'll be home all today.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,530
Well, maybe I should more often.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Manami

59
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,050
I wonder if she plans to go out anywhere...

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,140
You're my brother?

61
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,440
You've got to be kidding me.

62
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
This is the worst...

63
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,860
So this is Rinko-chan...

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,400
Nice to meet you, Onii-chan.

65
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,070
And this is Miyabi-chan?

66
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,410
This might be pretty good...

67
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,080
Which route should I do first?

68
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,330
Who is it now?

69
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,920
Oh, work...

70
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,490
Sensei, thanks for taking care of Ayase today.

71
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,700
Oh, no problem.

72
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,660
I wonder what Kirino's doing?

73
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,760
The number you have called is unreachable because the phone is either out of service or turned off.

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,510
Oh, right...

75
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,010
She turns it off when she studies so she can concentrate.

76
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,600
That's so Kirino.

77
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,810
I should learn from her, too.

78
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,650
Rinko-chwan~

79
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,530
Gross! Don't act all friendly.

80
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,360
Come on, don't say that...

81
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,780
Shut up! You're so annoying!

82
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,120
Are you stupid?

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,310
Cut that out already!

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,310
Bear with it......

85
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,630
Cut that out already!

86
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,530
Bear with it......

87
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,250
Cut that out already!

88
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,340
Cut that out already!

89
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,110
Bear with it......

90
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,340
Bear with it......

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,430
You're not mad even after all I've said?

92
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,300
What a pitiful guy.

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,930
What do you want me to do?

94
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,220
You should really just die.

95
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,270
There's no point to someone like you living anyway, right?

96
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,060
Th-This damn game...

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,560
You've got a pretty big mouth!

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,030
Who brought you up like that?

99
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,110
Aren't you the little sister?

100
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,820
Shut up! Who do you think you are?

101
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,200
Stop acting like you're my brother!

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Wh-Who do you think you are?!

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,330
Now you've gone too far!

104
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,250
I don't have to sit here and listen to you mouth off!

105
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,210
Who the heck is she arguing with?

106
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,170
Dammit!

107
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,180
Dammit! Dammit!

108
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,680
Dammit!

109
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,230
I'll do your route later!

110
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,810
An eroge?

111
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,900
What are you drawing?

112
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,990
Meruru!

113
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,990
I see...

114
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,750
Do you want to watch Meruru on TV?

115
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,250
Yeah!

116
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,710
I'm sorry, Onii-chan.

117
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,880
Please don't get mad at Rinko.

118
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,770
I'm sure she feels happy deep down that she got a big brother too.

119
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,560
Really?

120
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,480
Yeah. Rinko's pretty shy about these things.

121
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,730
She's not even on that level.

122
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,780
She's 100% tsun and 0% dere.

123
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,160
I bet this character was just made to make fun of the players.

124
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,780
She's a ridiculous heroine.

125
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,790
Can't she show the slightest bit of a cute side?

126
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,670
You know, Onii-chan...

127
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,170
I'm really glad that I got to meet you.

128
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,050
I'm sure Rinko feels the same way.

129
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,800
I can tell, since we're twins.

130
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,430
I love you, Onii-chan!

131
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,580
I love you, Onii-chan!

132
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,720
I love you, Onii-chan!

133
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,430
Oh man, oh man!

134
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,770
You're too cute, Miyabi-chan!

135
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,730
Are you trying to make me fall for you?

136
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,860
I love you, Onii-chan!

137
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,200
This is a godly game!

138
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,660
What the hell is she doing?

139
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,300
Now I'm tired...

140
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,470
We haven't even started!

141
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,060
Go! Meteo Impact!

142
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,730
Is it fun?

143
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,940
Yes!

144
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,150
I see...

145
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,450
Pomecha-kun, watch out!

146
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,870
W-Why are you here?!

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,370
That's my line!

148
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,880
I made a promise to go on a date with Miyabi-chan, so why are <i>you</i> here?!

149
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,000
No way, you too?

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
Huh?

151
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,630
D-Dammit, Miyabi tricked me!

152
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,640
What's with this plotline...

153
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,890
Did I miss the branch point?

154
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,150
This one was straight to a bad end, so...

155
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,650
That means...

156
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,950
Geez...

157
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,950
Maybe I picked the wrong choice last time...

158
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,200
No way, Miyabi-chan!

159
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,540
Fine, whatever.

160
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,710
Since I came all the way here, I'll just put up with you.

161
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,380
That is not cute at all...

162
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,420
I-It's not a date!

163
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,680
You're gross, so don't come any closer!

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,970
I'm spending my time on you, so you'd better appreciate it!

165
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,020
Fine, I'll finish your route first!

166
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,980
You'd better appreciate it!

167
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,200
Yes?

168
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm here to deliver an item you had ordered the other day.

169
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,660
I've been expecting you.

170
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,880
What do you think?

171
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,260
My, it's perfect.

172
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,840
This is excellent.

173
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,510
It's a pleasure to serve.

174
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,600
With this height, I can't cosplay without an order-made outfit.

175
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,980
How about these?

176
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,730
We made them with the sizes you gave us the other day.

177
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,320
Thank you.

178
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,650
Are you going to an event with your friends?

179
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:48,740
Yes, I'm planning a party where everyone can have a lot of fun.

180
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,290
I'll think up a reason for the party later.

181
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:00,550
Now then, how will I get them to wear this special outfit?

182
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,810
Children are pretty simple-minded, getting excited over something like this.

183
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,830
Kousaka Kyousuke

184
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,370
Hello?

185
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,370
Yo.

186
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,040
Why the sudden call?

187
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Well, it's nothing in particular, but...

188
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,210
What are you doing right now?

189
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,970
I was making a cursed magical artifact.

190
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,010
That figures...

191
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,470
So does that mean you're busy?

192
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,560
N-Not really.

193
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,270
With my magic, I can do this with one hand.

194
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,700
What about you?

195
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,200
Your 2nd year winter's almost over.

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,160
Do you have the time to be calling me?

197
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,210
That seems rather lax of you.

198
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,540
I can't really deny that, but for some reason I just can't get into a studying mood.

199
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,800
So I just called to see how you've been doing.

200
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,890
Please don't use me as an excuse to procrastinate.

201
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,100
Ah, my bad.

202
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,600
By the way, I heard there's a Maschera event soon.

203
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,270
Yes. I plan on attending, of course.

204
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,730
I see...

205
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,940
Then how about we—

206
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,980
Finally, her dere side!

207
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,900
You're so cute, Rinko-rin!

208
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,620
Did I just hear a bizarre scream of some kind?

209
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,240
There's a monkey making a ruckus next door. Don't worry about it.

210
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,710
Must be hard on you too.

211
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,050
Stupid Aniki.

212
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,920
Come here...

213
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,130
H-Hey...

214
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,390
Be gentle, okay?

215
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,680
W-Wait a second!

216
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,560
Let me go shower first...

217
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,020
Why are you in such a hurry?

218
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,280
Who cares?

219
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,570
Hey.

220
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,740
What?

221
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,950
What is it now?

222
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,580
You dropped them.

223
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,090
Huh? W-Wai—

224
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,710
Die, you pervert!

225
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,090
Just... Just die!

226
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,770
H-Hey...

227
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,110
Be gentle, okay?

228
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,160
Alright. Alright!

229
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,530
Alright! Here I go!

230
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,870
Sorry for the wait, Rinko-rin!

231
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,130
I'm all ready for you now!

232
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,460
What's she getting so worked up about?

233
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,380
Sheesh...

234
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,050
Woah, Rinko-rin!

235
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,630
That's pretty hot!

236
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,310
Oh wow, oh wow!

237
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,480
That is so hot!

238
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,890
Are you sure?

239
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,310
This really sucks.

240
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,400
It's been a while since I've felt this awkward.

241
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Why do I have to sit here and listen to my little sister playing eroge?

242
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,910
What kind of punishment is this?

243
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,950
Oh, wow!

244
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,580
This is too much!

245
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,460
So hot!

246
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,420
Shut up already!

247
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,300
In case you haven't realized, I can totally hear you!

248
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,050
Wh-Wh-What's with you?!

249
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,930
You pervert!!

250
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,770
Eavesdropping on your sister's room??

251
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,350
What's wrong with you?

252
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm not eavesdropping!

253
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,150
I can hear it without even trying!

254
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,190
You don't have to yell like that just because Mom and Dad aren't home!

255
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,690
I can do whatever I want!

256
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,910
At least be a little more considerate!

257
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,000
Hearing my sister's moaning from the other side of the wall is beyond awkward!

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,710
D-don't tell me you recorded it?

259
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,960
You aren't recording it, are you?!

260
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,170
You're the real pervert for even coming up with that idea!

261
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,220
That stuff you said about not caring about H-scenes was a total lie!

262
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,600
That's totally different from this!

263
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,730
I was just enjoying Rinko-rin's ero-cuteness with completely pure motivations!

264
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,560
Where's the difference?!

265
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,360
Everything's different!

266
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,030
Ring ring. Click.

267
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,030
Yes, indeed. I know.

268
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,960
We must break Belvegolle's spell in order to save him.

269
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,290
We must free him from the chains of his previous existence.

270
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,880
Impossible!

271
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,720
You're saying the Angels are making a move?

272
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,430
It's starting to get interesting now...

273
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,930
I am the fallen angel, Kuroneko.

274
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,400
From the day I received the protection of the night—

275
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,650
I'm sorry, Aniki...

276
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,190
You got hurt because of me.

277
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,700
They say we can't see each other anymore...

278
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,280
Since we're siblings...

279
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,330
We can't be together...

280
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,210
Why did things have to end up like this...

281
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,880
This isn't how it was supposed to be...

282
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,220
Did I pick the wrong choice?

283
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,490
I've actually always known about you, since long ago.

284
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,280
I'd always wondered what kind of person my brother was...

285
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,990
I got curious, so I went to meet you...

286
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,620
Do you remember?

287
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,080
When we were little, we played together in the park.

288
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,920
That was me.

289
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,050
Goodbye, Aniki.

290
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,180
I always, always loved you.

291
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,020
Are you stupid...

292
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Kuroneko's Diary

293
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
A Moment in Isolation

294
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
Clamor in the classroom.

295
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
A flock of fools wearing masks, laughing.

296
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
My world, disconnected.

297
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
Light and darkness.

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
All in passing.

299
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
What is the real me?

300
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,580
Sickening.

301
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,290
kiririn@miyabichanismaiimouto

302
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,290
I read up to "I was lonely this week too."

303
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,290
I've been able to decrypt this person's jibberish lately. Kinda scaring myself lol

304
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,820
kiririn@miyabichanismaiimouto

305
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,820
I read up to "I was lonely this week too."

306
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,820
I've been able to decrypt this person's jibberish lately. Kinda scaring myself lol

307
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,820
Saori

308
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,820
If you have time again next week, shall we go somewhere?

309
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,310
Nee-sama, please read me a book!

310
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,890
In a bit.

311
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,020
I'm talking to the denizens of the world of darkness right now.

312
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,780
Are these people the denizens of the world of darkness?

313
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,330
No.

314
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,830
Those people are...

315
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,550
Friends that live in the same world as us.

316
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,590
I guess I'll wait until tomorrow to go for the good end.

317
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,600
*Rinko Route* A new scenario has been unlocked

318
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,650
Kirino! Hurry up and take your bath!

319
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,980
Okay!

320
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,290
Taking another bath?

321
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,080
Ow...

322
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,800
What the hell was that for?!

323
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,760
Gross! Don't act all friendly.

324
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,510
You know...

325
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,010
Shut up! You're so annoying!

326
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,800
Are you stupid?

327
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,970
What's with you?

328
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,470
What are you so mad about?

329
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,680
Shut up! I'm just annoyed, that's all.

330
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,020
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,310
You're always like that.

332
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,150
Stop acting like you understand me.

333
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,110
Sure, sure.

334
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,610
Hey, Kirino.

335
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,830
Good night.

336
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,520
gakugyou yuushuu spootsu bannou na ue

337
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,520
Perfect grades, and an ace athlete

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,360
youshi tanrei kanpeki na atashi

339
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,360
With unmatched beauty, look, I’m perfect

340
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,120
demo ne ano ko ni muchuu na koto naisho na no

341
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,120
But don’t tell anyone, I’m actually crazy for this girl

342
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,620
imoutogee anime konpu zumi yo

343
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,620
I played the imoutoge and watched the anime through

344
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,840
shouganai ja nai suki nandamon!

345
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,840
I just can’t help it, I love her!

346
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,050
unmei no itazura? soretomo wana??

347
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,050
Is fate being mean? Or is it a trap??

348
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,810
dame to iwaretatte kono omoi tomerarenai!

349
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,810
I can’t stop these feelings even if you say no!

350
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,100
suki yo suki yo suki nandamon!

351
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,100

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,940
zutto suki yo suki yo suki nandamon!

353
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,940
I love her, I love her, because I love her forever!

354
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,450
There's No Way My Little Sister
