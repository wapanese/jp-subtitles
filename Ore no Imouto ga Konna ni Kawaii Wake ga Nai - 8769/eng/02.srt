1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,170
What's that, Kirino?

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,500
A guy?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,090
No way!

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,670
I'm just checking out some work stuff.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,140
Man, you popular models are always so busy.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,620
But you don't have anything on today, right?

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,850
Oh... yeah.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,230
Let's head home then.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,980
Okay.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,520
Want to go anywhere?

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,560
So, I bought some shoes the other day...

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,820
And frankly, I'm out of cash now.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,400
Mind lending me some?

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,240
Kanako, have you ever heard the saying "No work, no food"?

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,990
What's that mean? What language is that?

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,870
That was really hard to understand...

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,790
Seriously? A hidden character in Siscaly?

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,710
I've never even seen this stage!

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,330
How'd you find it?

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,420
Here.

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,960
Okay Kirino, let's go!

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,030
Right...

23
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,510
Man, can't those otaku shut up?

25

Is this the end for our story? I want you to see my smile

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,650
There's No Way I'd Go To an
 IRL Meetup With My Sister

45
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:45,180
What should I say I've been doing? Study, that's right. I'm studying. Studying.

46
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,690
Hey.

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,150
What?

48
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,800
Have you played it?

49
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,350
Played what?

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,900
You haven't played it.

51
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,980
Well...

52
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,250
Why? Why haven't you played it?

53
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,660
I told you I have homework.

54
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:11,920
Well, I had a lot of other things to do... But that doesn't mean I haven't played at all like you thought!

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,630
What? An excuse? Where's your motivation?

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,380
Why? Why is my sister talking to me like this because I haven't played an eroge?

57
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,970
There's no reason for her to talk like that!

58
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,770
Bring the laptop to my room.

59
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,640
We'll advance far past the beginner's level!

60
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,590
I can't believe you!

61
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,970
You haven't gotten anywhere!

62
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,360
What have you been doing these last three days?

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,870
Living a normal life...

64
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,560
Normal people would take less than three days to clear this!

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
I've never played a game like this before!

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,820
I don't know what I'm doing!

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,170
There. I turned on hints whenever you get a choice.

68
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,070
If you can't clear it now, you're better off dead.

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,050
O-Okay...

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,450
Hurry up and finish it.

71
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,790
They're waiting on you.

72
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,460
Are you going to lend this game to someone else?

73
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,330
I can just play it after—

74
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,540
No, you idiot!

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,380
The next game is waiting on you!

76
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,380
What, I have to play more than just this one?

77
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,550
You think you can understand anything after just one game?

78
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,220
You've only just stepped foot into the eroge world.

79
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,680
When did this happen?

80
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,100
Give me a break!

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,580
If you want to talk about games, why don't you talk to your school friends?

82
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,440
You don't have to drag me—

83
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,410
Wait, you don't have any friends into this kind of thing?

84
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,450
Like it matters.

85
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,370
I see...

86
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,220
Kirino...

87
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,120
Want to make some friends?

88
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,250
You asked me earlier right?

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,090
"What should I do?"

90
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,190
Here's my answer.

91
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,110
You want friends that you can talk to about your hobbies, right?

92
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,640
Someone you can talk to about anime, games, and eroge as much as you want.

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,020
And if it's someone in the same boat as you, they won't make fun of you.

94
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,610
In other words, you're telling me to make otaku friends?

95
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,570
No way.

96
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,380
They'll think I'm the same as them.

97
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,630
But you are one of them.

98
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,390
I told you I wouldn't make fun of you no matter what your hobbies are.

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,920
But what about you?

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,770
Why wouldn't you want to be grouped with otaku?

101
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,270
Doesn't that make you the one making fun of otaku?

102
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm not making fun of them!

103
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,780
I'm talking about the societal consequences!

104
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,890
Societal?

105
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,600
It's true I like anime and eroge a lot.

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,790
No, I can say I love them.

107
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,480
You can?

108
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,790
And I love being with my school friends too.

109
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,570
But I love this stuff just as much!

110
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,530
I can't pick just one!

111
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,420
My love for each one is a part of me!

112
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,430
But I know how the world looks down on otaku, too.

113
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,840
Especially middle school girls.

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,930
They hate otaku the most out of anyone.

115
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,310
So it's okay for you to know, but no one at school can ever know.

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,350
If they ever found out, I'd never be able to go again.

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,560
So basically, you have to make otaku friends without your school friends finding out?

118
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,650
Yeah, I guess...

119
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,960
You have an idea?

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,000
Nope.

121
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,880
You're useless.

122
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,680
What's wrong, Kyou-chan?

123
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,830
Nothing to do with you.

124
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,830
Don't worry about it.

125
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,290
It has everything to do with me!

126
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,180
Why?

127
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,940
If I were depressed, would you just look away and say "Nothing to do with me"?

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,430
Fine, fine. Geez...

129
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,060
An IRL meetup?

130
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,940
Yeah!

131
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,650
There are sites for people with the same hobbies and services to meet new people, right?

132
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,330
Social net-something.

133
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,960
You mean SNS?

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,410
Yeah, that!

135
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,660
You can join one of those manga and anime...

136
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,970
...um... "communities" and make new friends there.

137
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,750
And once you get to know each other, you can meet up and talk as much as you want.

138
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,230
Well, that's how "IRL meetup" stuff works.

139
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,720
I already knew that.

140
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,610
And your explanation sounds kind of lame.

141
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,630
kiririn@theidiotbehindmeisbeingreallyannoying

142
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,640
Who gave you the idea?

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,810
My secret weapon—Grandma's bag of wisdom.

144
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,110
So it was Neighbor-girl, huh?

145
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,390
Don't call her Neighbor-girl!

146
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,100
What are you getting worked up about?

147
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,120
Are you stupid?

148
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,140
Otaku Girls Unite!

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,190
I hate hearing anyone who isn't me badmouthing her.

150
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,190
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,900
I don't really care either.

152
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,530
Sender

153
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,530

Subject

155
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,530
I'd like to participate

156
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,590
You just look stupid when you're all over each other.

157
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,270
Saori

159
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,270
Greetings

160
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,460
"Pleased to meet you, Kiririn-sama."

161
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,270
"I am Saori, the moderator for the 'Otaku Girls Unite!' community."

162
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,760
"Thank you for showing interest in joining our community."

163
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,110
She sounds like a really polite person.

164
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,850
Her writing sounds very refined.

165
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,110
Like a well-brought-up young lady?

166
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,810
Shut up. You're gross.

167
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,190
"We welcome you with open arms."

168
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,500
"I believe we can be good friends as we share similar hobbies."

169
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,190
Isn't that great?

170
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,780
I said shut up!

171
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,950
"If you'd like, please join us at our tea party next week. We will be meeting in..."

172
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,260
Akihabara!

173
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,380
We don't have time to sightsee.

174
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,500
You can look around after the meetup.

175
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,840
I know that!

176
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,090
And don't come near me.

177
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,840
I don't want anyone to think we're on a date.

178
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,280
So? Where are these otaku girls having their tea party?

179
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,480
The way you say it really pisses me off.

180
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I said don't come near!

181
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,820
Fine, do the rest of this yourself!

182
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,780
You think you're not part of this?

183
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,240
You're coming too!

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,040
Why?

185
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,200
Because this is my first time doing something like this,

186
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,700
and I don't know what kind of people are coming,

187
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,180
so going alone is kinda...

188
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,080
How am I going to be any help?

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,630
This "Otaku Girls Unite!" thing is girls-only, right?

190
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,090
How would I join in?

191
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,130
You could cross-dress.

192
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,840
They'd know!

193
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,550
Oh, right.

194
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,440
Why weren't you born a pretty boy?

195
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,640
Shut up.

196
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,520
Well, I guess I need to take some responsibility for the idea.

197
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,150
How about this then?

198
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,610
I'll go to the cafe first and sit near where you'll be.

199
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,710
I can't say anything, but I'll watch.

200
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,960
That okay with you?

201
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,160
Fine. That's okay.

202
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,470
Here?

203
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,220
Welcome home, master!

204
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,430
Master, how would you like to be addressed?

205
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,810
What's that?

206
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,560
You can pick what you want us to call you.

207
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,120
Master, my lord, whatever-kun, Onii-chan, etc. There are many other options.

208
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,120
Whatever you want.

209
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,530
Then how about Onii-chan?

210
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,620
Onii-chan!

211
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,450
Of all things, a little sister?!

212
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,200
Onii-chan, what do you want to eat?

213
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,490
Um... How about omelette rice?

214
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,410
Okay!

215
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,000
I can write a message for you in ketchup. What would you like?

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,040
I'll leave it up to you.

217
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay!

218
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,390
Welcome home, Ojou-sama!

219
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,390
Oh they're here?

220
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
She's huge!

221
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,900
What is she??

222
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,520
I have a reservation for one hour.

223
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,440
Okay! Under what name?

224
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,910
Saori Bajeena.

225
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,860
<i>You're</i> Saori-san??

226
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,290
And why "Bajeena"?

227
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,820
Ah! Onii-chan, are you alright?

228
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,280
S-Sorry...

229
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,920
Take your time drinking, okay?

230
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,930
Well then, I think we can officially begin the "Otaku Girls Unite!" IRL meetup.

231
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,670
It may be short, but let us talk to one another and deepen our friendship.

232
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,940
It may be our first time meeting in person, but we are all drawn together by being otaku.

233
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,260
We can understand each other's hearts.

234
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,800
Here's some more water, Onii-chan.

235
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,770
Let us get to know each other through our passion!

236
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,190
She's not fitting in...

237
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,770
Well, she is dressed like that...

238
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,450
Now then, pleasant chatting!

239
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,480
Will she be okay?

240
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,320
Kiririn-san, what coupling do you like in DesGuri?

241
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm into Anna x Haru.

242
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,160
No way! I'm for Anna x Haru too!

243
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
They're so cute!

244
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,790
That necklace is really pretty.

245
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,590
Where'd you get it?

246
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,370
Where I got it? It's a limited from Clock.

247
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,370
I saw it at a shoot and ended up buying it.

248
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,710
Really?

249
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,880
It's hard getting tickets these days...

250
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
I know what you mean! It's probably better to go to stuff nearby instead of the city.

251
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,240
Here! Thank you for waiting.

252
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,760
I love Onii-chan ♡

253
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,270
There's something we do here to make omelette rice taste really good!

254
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,830
Yeah, that would work!

255
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,400
So, what character?

256
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,250
I said just listen!

257
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,000
Alicia from LoveDera.

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,450
Wow, that's going to be pretty hard!

259
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,140
Thanks to all your efforts, I declare our first tea party over!

260
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,270
I will inform you of any future events when they are decided. Please join us next time!

261
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,030
I'm still planning more events besides this gift exchange.

262
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,530
As for any afterparties, I leave it to your discretion.

263
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,400
Well then, dismissed!

264
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,610
Want to go to Animate?

265
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,790
How about Tora after that?

266
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,910
That coupling totally doesn't match...

267
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,780
Let's go somewhere else to discuss it then.

268
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,040
Take care, Ojou-sama!

269
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,060
You did a good job.

270
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,840
Good to see you've still got life in you.

271
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,690
How about seeing the sights in Akiba since we're already here?

272
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,060
I couldn't talk to anyone.

273
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,560
Well, when you're dressed like that, anyone would get scared.

274
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,940
They were mostly normal girls, you know.

275
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,030
Take care!

276
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,440
Why?

277
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,710
I did everything like I usually do.

278
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,700
Why did they avoid me?

279
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,910
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

280
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,430
Hey! Miss Kiririn!

281
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,460
I'm glad I managed to catch you!

282
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,690
Saori-san?

283
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,720
Just Saori, please!

284
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,310
And this is... your boyfriend?

285
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,850
No!!

286
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,850
No!!

287
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,680
Oh? No?

288
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,830
I do believe he was staring at you the whole time.

289
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,940
I thought it as the look of love!

290
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,150
Stop that! Gross!

291
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,590
I'm Kousaka Kyousuke. Her brother.

292
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,950
I see, I see...

293
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,240
You don't look much alike.

294
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh, shut up!

295
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,750
Oh, pardon me.

296
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,160
Then how about coming along?

297
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,810
Miss Kiririn, would you like to join us in an afterparty?

298
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,130
An afterparty? You mean more of what we just did?

299
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,220
Indeed. I thought I would invite members I wasn't able to talk to.

300
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,860
Will there be many others?

301
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,180
Not at all. Including us three...

302
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,780
Thank you for waiting, Miss Kuroneko.

303
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,120
This is Miss Kiririn and her elder brother.

304
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,620
Um... N-Nice to meet you.

305
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Kousaka Kyousuke. Sorry to join in halfway.

306
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,210
Handle name Kuroneko.

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,300
And so, what do you intend to do with these members?

308
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,770
Just like I said, I want to deepen my friendship with the members I couldn't talk to!

309
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,270
Come to think of it, wasn't she on her cell phone in the corner?

310
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,480
Well, that's really all, Miss Kuroneko.

311
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,650
You can drop the formal titles and just call me Saori!

312
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,690
Let's forget ranks here!

313
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,320
Calling yourself Saori when you look like that?

314
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm surprised you can even say your name.

315
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,160
So shameless.

316
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,080
It's not even funny as a joke.

317
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,450
Call yourself "Psycho Gundam" or "Bigzam" from now on.

318
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,660
And that manner of speech and those clothes...

319
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,290
...like a gross otaku from a decade ago.

320
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,170
Hey! Forgetting ranks doesn't mean you're free to insult people!

321
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,460
Apologize!

322
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,640
Well, insults on this level feel like a light calm breeze.

323
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,310
Feel free to verbally abuse me too if you'd like, Mr. Kyousuke.

324
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,400
I can't figure out if you're a nice person or a weird person.

325
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,570
On the topic of clothes...

326
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,440
Why did you come here in that getup?

327
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,070
Fashion like that doesn't belong at an IRL meetup in Akiba.

328
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,280
Well, <i>sorry</i>!

329
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,330
I can't help it. These clothes are me!

330
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,620
What about you?

331
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,590
What?

332
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,460
What is it? Do tell me.

333
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,130
What's with that dress?

334
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,590
Cosplay? Are you supposed to be Suigintou?

335
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,930
Completely off. What are you looking at?

336
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,850
It's the Queen of Nightmare from Maschera.

337
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,510
Maschera?

338
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,350
Some sort of anime?

339
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,810
Yes. The full name is "Maschera ~Lament of a Fallen Beast~".

340
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,070
An anime with superior story and art.

341
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,610
It runs at 5:30 pm on Thursdays.

342
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,200
I recommend you watch it.

343
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,410
Oh, that's the show on at the same time as Meruru.

344
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,870
That fancy-dress teen-complex anime.

345
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,160
You've just said something unforgivable.

346
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,670
Meruru? You mean Stardust Witch Meruru?

347
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,590
That piece of crap that only kids and childish men and maniacs and unemployed and NEET watch?

348
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,390
Battle-type magical girl stuff is out of style.

349
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,770
And any kid's anime not on a weekend morning is blasphemy.

350
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,730
In terms of ratings, <i>that</i> is what's on at the same time.

351
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,400
I ask that you stop spouting ignorant nonsense.

352
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,280
Ratings? Let me tell you what people in the real world think, you post-Evangelion biter.

353
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,690
The shows I watch are what's "on".

354
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,530
Anything else is "at the same time".

355
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,910
And the way you say it, you haven't even watched Meruru before!

356
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh, how pitiful. During the last battle, you could die from the moe of the insert song along with the fluid animation!

357
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,260
Don't look down on kid's anime!

358
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,550
The same to you. Don't give it a good rating just because it's a kid's anime.

359
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,800
Your moe and whatnot is just a trick to detract your attention from the plot holes and what your show really is.

360
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
What it really is?

361
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,560
Your thing just lines up difficult kanji together so only you teen-complex freaks can keep up.

362
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
That term is what I hate second-most in the world.

363
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,740
And what I hate most are the ignorant pigs that abuse the word in criticism.

364
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,070
Are you one of them? Then please oink like one.

365
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,780
Getting mad because you know I'm right?

366
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,830
You're a complex among teen-complexes. Maybe I should call you the Teeny Complex Queen?

367
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,840
Wait, wait, wait! Stop that!

368
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,460
Calm down, it's just an anime!

369
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,210
"Just an anime?"

370
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,960
Slip of the tongue...

371
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,090
What a nice personality you have.

372
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,730
That's why no one talked to you during the meetup.

373
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,140
Who are you talking about?

374
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,930
You were tapping your cell phone the whole time!

375
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,860
Just sad.

376
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,860
I had an urge to check my news sites.

377
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,650
Looks like they've gotten pretty close to each other.

378
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,870
Have you been watching the same thing I have?!

379
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,740
No matter how you look at it, they're so full of energy now.

380
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,780
You chirp well for a worthless human.

381
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,740
Fine. Come outside, bitch.

382
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,460
I will carve the meaning of true fear into you.

383
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,540
Either way, they sure can talk a lot even though they just met.

384
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,540
"Worthless human"? What generation are you from?

385
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,630
Well, you know, it's because they really do love what they're talking about.

386
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,090
They have nothing to hold back.

387
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,560
Every word you say grates my ears, you pretentious emo girl!

388
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,520
P-Pretentious?

389
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,850
E-Emo girl?

390
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,020
Now you've gone and said it.

391
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,280
Ah, how pitiful.

392
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,240
I don't know what might happen to you now.

393
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,530
Even I can't stop my evil conceptions.

394
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,990
Are you stupid?

395
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,370
Don't you feel ashamed to be alive?

396
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,950
Think it's about time to stop this?

397
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,950
Why don't you just go die?

398
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,380
See? Meruru doujinshi are all aimed at adult males.

399
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,210
She's simply a hole for their lust.

400
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,350
And Maschera is all just BL.

401
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,680
Look at this perfection! It's art!

402
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,180
Art doesn't need a "clothes off" feature.

403
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,600
XXL?

404
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,400
Men's?

405
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,370
My, we've spent quite a bit of time.

406
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,740
You were far too excited.

407
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,860
I couldn't help it!

408
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,820
It's my first time in Akiba.

409
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,280
Sorry for all the trouble.

410
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,620
Not at all.

411
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,740
We'll be taking our leave here.

412
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,220
I guess we should head back too.

413
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,430
Don't ignore me!

414
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,980
You were both gone all day, right?

415
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,600
Where'd you go, Kirino?

416
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,490
Shopping with some friends.

417
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,230
Oh, with Ayase-chan?

418
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,360
Yeah, something like that...

419
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,870
Don't boys try to hit on you?

420
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,370
You two really stand out when you're together.

421
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,160
Well, we ignore them—

422
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,790
Don't go too far.

423
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:07,380
Work is fine, but if you wear clothes like that all the time you might make a mistake.

424
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,880
Come on Dad, you know Kirino works hard—

425
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,340
Thanks for the meal.

426
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,640
Here.

427
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,270
And no one cares where I went.

428
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Intellect

429
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Lacking

430
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Strength

431
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Average

432
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Looks

433
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Work harder

434
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,530
A hard-worker who's smart and athletic?

435
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,160
That's just dumb...

436
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,370
Enough of this...

437
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,840
Onii-chan...

438
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,300
We'll always be together from now on...

439
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,470
I've done it!

440
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,470
I've beaten Shiori!

441
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,230
Complete!

442
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,770
Good job me!

443
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,230
Yahoo!

444
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,950
What's this feeling?

445
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,210
It's like a calm from the surge of resignation that comes after a wave of accomplishment.

446
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,510
I may have discovered something profound.

447
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,510
What?

448
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,050
Nothing, I'm just returning the game.

449
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,260
You completed it?

450
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,880
Yep.

451
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,260
Well?

452
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,180
Okay, I guess?

453
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,390
No, I mean, it was pretty good.

454
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,970
What part?

455
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,180
Specifically.

456
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,730
In the Shiori route?

457
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,190
The last part was a good read.

458
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,400
You know, the part where their parents are against their relationship and Shiori runs out of the house?

459
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,240
And then when the main character chases after her and they look into each other's eyes in the sunset...

460
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,210
W-Well, it looks like you understand a bit now.

461
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,460
But that wasn't the only good scene!

462
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,380
My top three were—

463
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,470
Wait! I'll listen to that later.

464
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,760
Um...

465
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,220
How's it going with the people from today's IRL meetup?

466
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,720
Oh, them?

467
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,730
Well, I've sent them a couple messages.

468
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,770
It looks like the dark one lives nearby, but the big one lives pretty far away.

469
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,610
We started talking about meeting at the next IRL meetup.

470
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,070
Well, I can't really help it, so I thought I might go.

471
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,490
I guess we've been talking a bit.

472
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,780
I see.

473
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,370
So you made friends.

474
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,250
Shut up, you idiot!

475
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,880
Just don't drop another eroge.

476
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,890
Life counseling, complete.

477
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,110
Kanari ii po-zu wo

478
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,110
I strike a pretty cute pose.

479
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,300
Wakatteru sonna koto demo tomerarenai

480
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,300
I know that's not going to stop you.

481
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:46,690
Guuzen jya naiyo kiseki demo naiyo kimi ga iru koto

482
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:46,690
It's no accident or miracle that you're here.

483
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:54,050
Itsu no mani kawari hajimeta kazamuki ni sukoshi

484
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:54,050
The sudden change in the wind's direction confuses me,

485
00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:05,750
Tomadottemo kono jyounetsu wa darenimo tomerarenai ima wa

486
00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:05,750
But nobody can stop the passion burning inside me now.

487
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,170
Azayaka ni irodorarete yuku mahou no kyanbasu

488
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,170
The magical canvas gets colored in.

489
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,720
Egaki tsudukeru kotoga Shining Way of My Life

490
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,720
Continuing to draw is the shining way of my life.

491
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,240
Taisetsu na koto wa kitto shinjiru koto

492
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,240
The most important thing to do is to believe.

493
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:31,880
Kyuu na saka demo issho ni nobotte kurerune

494
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:31,880
Even if the hill is steep, you will go up with me.

495
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,580
There's No Way My Little Sister 0000Can Be This Cute

496
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,970
Next time:

497
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,880
There's No Way My Little Sister Can Be This Cute

498
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
