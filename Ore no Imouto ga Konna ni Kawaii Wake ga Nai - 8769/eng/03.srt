1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,410
Got tickets for the premier showing?

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,300
Nope. Radio Taikan was completely out.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,230
And it was over after only two shots at the raffle.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,290
I went for back-row seats from the start, too.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,590
It looked a lot easier based on the time and energy it would take.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,670
And there's Summer Comiket too.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,490
We'll need to save up the Perika.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,490
Note: Currency in Kaiji

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,980
Note: Famitsu points sytem, similar to Xbox live points

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,980
Man, I have plenty of Gabasu...

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,500
Kirino!

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,250
Let's go.

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,250
Yep.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,820
Let's take a break.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,720
Kirino, are you free this Sunday?

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,100
I've got work in the morning, but do you want to go out somewhere after?

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,960
Sorry, I've got stuff to do...

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,150
Oh? Are you working that day?

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,900
It's not work...

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,410
Ah, your club?

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,130
Well...

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,200
Sorry! I just can't do that day!

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
It's fine...

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,750
Lately you seem kind of distant though...

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,800
O-Of course not!

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,430
Don't tell me you've picked up a boyfriend?

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,210
No way, no way!

28
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,690
Not a chance!

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:36,150
sonna yasashiku shinai de donna kao sureba ii no

30
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:36,150
Don't be so nice to me, I just don't know how to react

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:46,260
tsumikasaneta kotoba de mienaiyo kimi no yokogao

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:46,260

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,380

tameiki surechigai ni iji hatte tsukarechau

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,320
Sigh, I'll burn out if I keep acting like this whenever we miss

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,950

40
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:19,320

sugu ni ai ni ikitai kedo kotoba ha mitsukaranai shi

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,600
I want to see you now, but I don't know what to say

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:50,940
Is this the end for our story? I want you to see my smile

49
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,200
Come to think of it, it's just ridiculous.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,390
Elena

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,390
That's why we should go to the beach!

52
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,200
The beach again?

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,680
The setting and story are a complete failure.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,270
Might you be talking about Maschera?

55
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,990
What else?

56
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,510
You practically begged me to watch it the other day, remember?

57
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,400
I don't recall asking you any such thing.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,530
Oh?

59
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,540
Well, I went and bought all the DVDs at once.

60
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,660
I finished watching them...

61
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,450
Let's take a bath together!

62
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,450
Isana

63
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,210
So to start with, why are their lines so freaking annoying?

64
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,830
Yaaaaaay!

65
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,830
Kushina

66
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,730
We have to wash our hair...

67
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,730
Isana

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah...

69
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,000
Kushina

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,540
What do you mean?

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,540
But it hurts my eyes.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,540
Isana

73
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,690
Like "Observe!" or "Your lamentations into mad screams!"

74
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,240
It's like I have to use a dictionary for every other word!

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,420
It's sad that your vocabulary isn't even at that level.

76
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,140
Ah, wait a second.

77
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,680
Use a shower cap

78
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,680
Don't use a shower cap

79
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,680
What should she do?

80
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,680
What?

81
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,470
Use a shower cap

82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,470
Don't use a shower cap

83
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,470
What should she do?

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,550
And saved...

85
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,080
Use a shower cap

86
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,080
Don't use a shower cap

87
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,080
What should she do?

88
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,360
Anyway, don't you think his outlook fits precisely because of the way he talks?

89
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,810
Let's go in then.

90
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,900
Wow! My eyes don't hurt!

91
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,900
Isana

92
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,290
Kushina

93
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,290
A victory for science!

94
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,910
His life is already full of discord and on its way to ruin.

95
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,200
The lines are fit for someone who has left their life to that—

96
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,200
Ah, wait a second.

97
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,990
Use a shower cap

98
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,990
Don't use a shower cap

99
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,620
What should she do?

100
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,990
Save loaded

101
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,620
Use a shower cap

102
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,620
Don't use a shower cap

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,250
There we go.

104
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,140
Let's go in then.

105
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,200
It huuuuurts!

106
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,200
Isana

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,500
Because you got sand in it.

108
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,500
Kushina

109
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,140
Wait, are you playing a galge while talking to me?

110
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,710
It's an eroge, not a galge.

111
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,600
I have to get all the CGs.

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,440
You're living quite the otaku life, aren't you?

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,770
Must be nice.

114
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,810
Anyway, what about you?

115
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,760
Have you watched Meruru?

116
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,010
There isn't a chance in hell that I'm spending any of my allowance on Meruru.

117
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,970
What the hell?

118
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,020
You're really annoying.

119
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,750
She came to me for something like life counseling.

120
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,460
She went to <i>you</i> for life counseling?

121
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,090
Why do you look so surprised?

122
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,050
I-I would never do something so thoughtless!

123
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,570
Wait, how did you know?

124
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,850
Can you see me??

125
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,540
I can't, but I got that feeling.

126
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,400
Though, it wasn't really counseling so much as just me listening to her.

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,380
I seriously didn't expect—

128
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,120
I'll tell you the details on Sunday.

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,850
Catch you later.

130
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,420
Ah, okay.

131
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,560
Good night!

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Yeah.

133
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,590
I'll bring it on Sunday then.

134
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,740
Do you have a Blu-Ray player?

135
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,690
If I had to choose between whether I do or don't...

136
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,320
I'd say I don't.

137
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,510
Just say that from the start!

138
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,910
Then I'll bring the DVDs.

139
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,700
Is the first season enough for now?

140
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,870
Just bring the part with the smooth story.

141
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,930
Smoothly.

142
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,320
That's just rude to the staff!

143
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,370
If you don't watch it from the start, you'll only get half the experience!

144
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,020
Fine, do whatever you want.

145
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,050
Ah, I need to go help my little sister take a bath.

146
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,070
Fine then.

147
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,540
I'm hanging up.

148
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,600
Yeah, I'll catch you tomorrow.

149
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,100
Later!

150
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,600
What am I missing?

151
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,220
Coming!

152
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,040
Thank you very much.

153
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,070
Morning.

154
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,780
It’s not morning.

155
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,730
Oh, come on. It’s Sunday.

156
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,240
Where’s Kirino?

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,570
She went shopping with a friend.

158
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,780
She’s been doing this a lot lately.

159
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,950
I see.

160
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,120
It’s rare to see you concerned about Kirino.

161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,510
That’s not it!

162
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,350
Kyousuke.

163
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,920
Don’t talk back to your mother.

164
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,050
Fiiine.

165
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,050
I’m gonna head out, too.

166
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,500
Manabi Station.

167
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,640
Oh?

168
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,540
What about lunch?

169
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,200
I should be fine for lunch.

170
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,790
That’s right, dear.

171
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,850
Her new magazine came in.

172
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,690
Already?

173
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,810
The elusive ImoFes version!

174
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,440
I have to buy this!

175
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,150
You're pretty simple aren't you.

176
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,320
Shut up!

177
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,510
We came all the way to Akiba, so if I don't buy it here, I can't buy it anywhere!

178
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,480
Any purchase is once in a lifetime.

179
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,060
Let it go once, and you'll never get a chance again.

180
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,410
In this world, we do say "Leap before you look, buy before you think."

181
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,440
How very Bourgeois.

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,180
Excuse me!

183
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,020
Could you open that one please?

184
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,370
Yes! This one!

185
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,740
Thank you!!

186
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,490
So I guess it's working out for her.

187
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,750
School is school, and the other stuff is the other stuff.

188
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,120
That's good to hear!

189
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,880
So she doesn't need to consult you anymore?

190
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,680
Yep, it's great!

191
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,520
I can finally return to my peaceful life.

192
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,380
I see...

193
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,140
I really wonder what it was all for...

194
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,310
Man, I didn't get enough sleep.

195
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,660
K-Kyou-chan!

196
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,910
G-Go ahead!!

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,450
And what?

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,080
You idiot.

199
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,920
Why are you angry?

200
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,960
Because you're dumb.

201
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Let's get going.

202
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,220
I'll treat you to anything you like as thanks for the advice.

203
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,970
You don't have to...

204
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,400
It's fine.

205
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,140
I owe you for helping me study too.

206
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,110
Okay!

207
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,910
What should I get?

208
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
Could you not drool over your eroge so brazenly in public like that?

209
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,710
I'm free to do what I want!

210
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,130
I'm holding myself back from going home right now to play this.

211
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,130
Be more appreciative!

212
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,680
Appreciative of what now?

213
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,800
I understand how you feel, Miss Kiririn!

214
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,350
I get to read the doujins I worked so hard to find later...

215
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,270
Or maybe I'll read them tomorrow...

216
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,810
Pushing it back a day is another kind of pleasure.

217
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,520
Oh, right...

218
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,030
Here's the DVDs, as promised.

219
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,990
I don't remember agreeing to anything...

220
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,820
Oh?

221
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,740
Weren't you begging me to lend you the Meruru DVDs earlier?

222
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,000
What kind of image do you have of me, exactly?

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,090
It's good to see how well you two get along!

224
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,050
I actually recorded Meruru but never got around to watching it...

225
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,560
After hearing you talk so passionately about it yesterday, I figured I should give it a try.

226
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,390
What?!

227
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,770
You're missing out on life if you haven't watched it!

228
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,640
Go and watch it immediately!

229
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,060
Understood!

230
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,900
When I get the chance.

231
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,190
By the way, why Akiba?

232
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,150
We could have met somewhere closer.

233
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,370
Well, I have some stuff to do here...

234
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,160
And we can't hang around home, right?

235
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,860
Haven't you been keeping this hobby a secret from your parents?

236
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,240
There's no way I'd be able to keep it secret...

237
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,700
Huh?

238
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,790
How does that work?

239
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,300
It just does? I just live normally.

240
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,920
It's stupid to care about what other people think.

241
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,510
Didn't you take a shot at me for looking at my eroge earlier?

242
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,090
Shut up.

243
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,300
I'll put a curse on you.

244
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm the same way.

245
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,220
I don't really get any hassle for it.

246
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,510
As long as I do everything else properly, it doesn't really matter what hobbies I have.

247
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,100
I see...

248
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,570
That makes sense.

249
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,980
So where are we going after lunch?

250
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,020
I absolutely have to see Uchimizukko Event!

251
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,330
What's that?

252
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,910
Crap...

253
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,840
Kyou-chan?

254
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,430
Mr. Kyousuke,

255
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,430
Our happy couple are acting just like one.

256
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,430
I have sent you a photograph.

257
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,800
You're doing well.

258
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,090
What's wrong, Kyou-chan?

259
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,430
Nothing.

260
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,310
Alright, let's keep at it a little longer.

261
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,770
I'm back.

262
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,590
I didn't see exactly what happened,

263
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:47,260
but apparently she bumped into Dad when she came back and dropped that DVD.

264
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,810
And inside it was... what do you call it?

265
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,520
Something very indecent, and Dad caught a glimpse of it.

266
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,690
You don't look surprised.

267
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,360
Did you... know?

268
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,010
Huh? What?

269
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,150
That Kirino had that kind of thing.

270
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,410
Yeah, I knew.

271
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,410
Why on earth would she have that?

272
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,790
It's been a long time since I saw Dad so angry...

273
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,630
Who knows what'll come of this...

274
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,240
Kirino!

275
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,430
Kirino!

276
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,640
Kyousuke, go after her!

277
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:32,990
Okay!

278
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,150
She's fast!!

279
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,750
Dammit, what kind of flag is this?

280
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,160
Damn!

281
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,540
If this were an eroge I'd have found her already!

282
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,920
What the hell!

283
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,920
Damn! Damn!

284
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,930
Damn! Damn! Damn!

285
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,180
This damn...

286
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,930
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

287
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,870
You stupid, damn...

288
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,690
You're the stupid one.

289
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,860
Oh, it's you?

290
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,780
Why are you here?

291
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,740
Because you just ran out!

292
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,280
I came looking for you!

293
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,200
Gross.

294
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
This, huh?

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,770
This is what you came home with all ecstatic over?

296
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,420
Got a problem?

297
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,720
So what did Dad say to you?

298
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,890
I have no complaints about your makeup, flashy clothes, or bags.

299
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,400
You worked and paid for them yourself.

300
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,690
But this is different.

301
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,130
Even the news says that this is a bad influence on children.

302
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,200
Of course, I take it with a grain of salt,

303
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:19,230
but they label people who do these things at this age "otaku".

304
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,060
It can't possibly have any good influence.

305
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,440
If you intend to indulge yourself in such a worthless hobby, I must correct that before you go completely astray.

306
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,050
He called them worthless...

307
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,120
My favorite anime and games and the meetup I went to today...

308
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,270
All of it! All of it!

309
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,810
Even though they aren't... they aren't...

310
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,610
But... I...

311
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,260
I couldn't... say anything back...

312
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,970
Dammit...

313
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,280
Hey, am I weird?

314
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,530
Is it wrong for me to like those things?

315
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,660
Dad will say that.

316
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,910
Any normal parent would think so.

317
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,080
And then there's the social consequences.

318
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,410
You already know, right?

319
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,170
That's why you didn't tell any of your school friends or fellow models.

320
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,290
But Dad found out.

321
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,340
So now you have to choose.

322
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,550
Are you telling me to stop?

323
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,340
If you did, everything would be just peachy.

324
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,470
Dad would relax, and you wouldn't need to sneak around to do all this.

325
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,770
You're a star athlete, an honor student, and a graceful beauty.

326
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,230
Get rid of this, and you're perfect.

327
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,320
I know that already!

328
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,820
But I won't stop.

329
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,570
I definitely won't.

330
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,160
I love them. I really love them.

331
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,700
I can't stop it.

332
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,750
No matter how much you love them, it's just a worthless hobby to Dad.

333
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,630
He might force you to stop.

334
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,710
Even then...

335
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,590
I won't stop. I won't stop loving them.

336
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,380
Working hard at school and as a model, and getting completely absorbed into anime and games...

337
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,720
They're both a part of me.

338
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,430
If I stop either one, I won't be me anymore.

339
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,060
Even if he forces me to throw away my anime and games,

340
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,650
it won't change who I am right now.

341
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,730
So I definitely won't stop loving them!

342
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,940
I see.

343
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,110
Not a bad answer.

344
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,570
Kirino.

345
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,780
Leave it to me.

346
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,120
Is this all you need?

347
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,330
Yeah.

348
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,420
Kirino will be back in around half an hour.

349
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,630
Can you leave me and Dad alone until then?

350
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,930
Okay. I'll go buy some beer or something.

351
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,010
Thanks.

352
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,640
Who'd have thought?

353
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,850
What?

354
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,480
Never mind. Good luck.

355
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,300
Dad.

356
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,350
Where are your manners?

357
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm home.

358
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,180
I need to talk to you.

359
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,290
About Kirino.

360
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,190
It looks like you knew she had these things.

361
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,440
Yeah...

362
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
And so?

363
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,490
I want you to let Kirino keep her hobby.

364
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,160
What kind of joke is that?

365
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm serious.

366
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,960
I won't let you get rid of her hobby or throw away anything she's hidden.

367
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,980
She's hiding things?

368
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,820
Anyway, just don't take anime and games away from her!

369
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,630
Why are you covering for her?

370
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,340
Tell me that first.

371
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,720
You can be stubborn after that—

372
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,180
She knows perfectly well that her hobbies are weird.

373
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,210
That's why she's been enjoying them in secret until now.

374
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,650
But she still wanted someone she could talk to about them.

375
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,880
She finally found someone and worked up the courage to meet them, and she finally found friends.

376
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,570
And this was only recently!

377
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,640
She met those friends today, too.

378
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,140
Kirino worked hard and found friends!

379
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,890
Don't call them worthless before you know them!

380
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,730
I've seen what she holds dear with my own eyes!

381
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,800
I've met other people who love them just as much!

382
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,450
Sure, they're completely weird, but they're not bad people at all!

383
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,830
I mean, it's stupid how excited they can get.

384
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,580
They'll make a scene, yelling at each other even though they've only just met!

385
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,870
I kept wondering just how much they love those things.

386
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,110
For Kirino and them to get that mad, it can't be something worthless!

387
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,550
They get that absorbed into what they love!

388
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,050
They were already friends that could talk to each other about anything!

389
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,270
Is that bad? What's bad about something they can get so absorbed in?

390
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,750
I said nothing about her friends.

391
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,560
I'm talking about bad influences from playing games like this.

392
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,570
Where do you see it?

393
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,590
What are these perfect grades and this pile of awards?

394
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,590
Your daughter's amazing!

395
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,050
That is part of our agreement.

396
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,040
That's why I let her wear those clothes and work as a model.

397
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,980
It's no concern of mine.

398
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,230
Stop being so stubborn!

399
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,790
At least let her have a weird hobby!

400
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,090
This is part of raising a child.

401
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,240
Is that all?

402
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,970
No! There's more!

403
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,410
I asked Mom to get this for me.

404
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,640
She said that it was your treasure.

405
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,170
No concern, you said?

406
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,650
Look how much effort you put into keeping your daughter's pictures!

407
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,710
It's my daughter's job.

408
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,960
I have to keep tabs on it.

409
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,590
That's all there is to it.

410
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,110
And what do you think?

411
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,300
I have no worries about it.

412
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,850
Then what about this?

413
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,270
What's this picture?

414
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,020
It's a picture Kirino's friends sent to me.

415
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,670
Do you think you need to worry about this?

416
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,420
This is what Kirino managed to find!

417
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,420
Everything here is part of Kirino!

418
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,700
If you take any of it away, she won't be her anymore!

419
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,310
If you can look at all this and still say you won't let Kirino have her hobby, I'll beat the crap out of you for her!

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,020
I understand what you're trying to say.

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,270
I will take back saying that they're worthless.

422
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,990
I will let Kirino keep her hobby.

423
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,150
Really?

424
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,240
But this is different.

425
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,700
I can't allow her to have something so indecent.

426
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,830
It's not a question of good or bad.

427
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,000
What do you think this symbol means?

428
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,460
So it came down to this after all...

429
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,130
This is where Dad is completely right.

430
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,130
I do have a plan for this, but...

431
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,260
I'm going to Kirino's room.

432
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,260
She will throw away these at the least.

433
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,020
Obey Dad

00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,020

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:23,690
Save the "Little sisters"

555
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:23,730
Save the "Little sisters"

556
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,150
Save the "Little sisters"

557
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,740
...am completely messed up!

558
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,360
That...

559
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,490
...doesn't belong to Kirino.

560
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,080
What are you saying now?

561
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,910
That is a game for a computer.

562
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,080
Kirino is the only one with a computer in this house!

563
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,250
Like I said, this is mine!

564
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,010
I asked Kirino to hold it for me!

565
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,380
I borrowed her computer and played it!

566
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh?

567
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:58,230
You were in your sister's room, using your sister's computer to play a game about doing indecent things to your sister?

568
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,140
It was really amazing.

569
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,020
Got a problem with that?

570
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,730
What's wrong with a high schooler having eroge?

571
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,110
You know Mom's seen all my porn!

572
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,530
I'm not throwing this away!

573
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,780
I'll defend this to the death!

574
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,200
Listen up, Dad!

575
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,620
I like anime and eroge with a passion!

576
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,450
I can say that I love them!

577
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,120
If I throw this away, I won't be me anymore!

578
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,380
Eroge are my soul!

579
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,090
You hear me?!

580
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,720
You worthless son!

581
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Do as you will!

582
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,470
I don't care anymore!

583
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,100
Morning.

584
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,480
Kyou-chan, good morn—

585
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,320
Y-Your face!! What happened?

586
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,780
Well, uh... stuff.

587
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,490
I see. Stuff happened.

588
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,160
Yeah. Stuff happened.

589
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,000
Good job, Kyou-chan.

590
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,710
Sounds like you did well.

591
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,170
I guess.

592
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,670
I'm back.

593
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,180
What? Did you actually watch it?

594
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,140
How did you come to that conclusion then?

595
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,230
She might have changed a bit now.

596
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,150
I can't believe you.

597
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,440
This is why no one cares about your pretentious opinions.

598
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,690
Looks like she's doing fine without me.

599
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,860
Maybe I'm really done now.

600
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,910
Enough. Whatever.

601
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,950
You really need to get out of that teen complex stuff.

602
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,200
See you.

603
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,210
Hey.

604
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,670
Thanks, Aniki.

605
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,220
Wait, what?

606
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,970
Impossible...

607
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,230
There's no way...

608
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,480
There's No Way My Little Sister 
0000can be This Cute

609
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,290
There's no way my little sister can be this cute!

610
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,410
Moshimo negai kanau nara

611
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,410
If my wish could come true,

612
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,560
Zutto soba ni ite ne

613
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,560
I just want to be with you.

614
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,760
Mada tooi kaerimichi

615
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,760
It's still a long way back.

616
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,150
Hanasenai himitsu wo

617
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,150
I'm still holding this secret

618
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,040
Pocket ni shimatta

619
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,040
tightly in my pocket.

620
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,490
Taisetsuna kimi no koto

621
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,490
I still let go of you

622
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,800
Hanasanai de itanda

623
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,800
because you're so important to me.

624
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,260
Wasuretai koto bakari da ne, doushite?

625
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,260
Why is it all the things I want to forget?

626
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,320
Mawari wo ki ni shiteru dare datte

627
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,320
Everyone cares about their surroundings

628
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,290
Hora ochikonde mimi fusagu

629
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,290
I drown out everything in my depression.

630
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:11,070
Sou ne kitto kudaranai koto de Zutto nayanderu desho tte

631
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:11,070
You laugh it off saying,"Yeah, you're worrying over something stupid again, aren't you?"

632
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,660
Waratte sumaseteru kedo chigau no

633
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,660
But it's really not like that.

634
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,060
Moshimo kimi ga inakute

635
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,060
If you weren't around

636
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,780
Zettai kimi ga aenaku tte

637
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,780
and I never met you

638
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,880
Sonna mirai ha IYA dakara

639
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,880
I would hate life.

640
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,020
Himitsu ni shite ite ne

641
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,020
Keep it a secret okay?

642
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,570
There's No Way My Little Sister 0000would go to Summer Comiket

643
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,960
Next time:

644
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,760
There's no way my little sister would go to summer comiket
