1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,560
These are fan letters.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,810
Wow, that's a lot!

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,690
It's pretty rare to get so many.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,110
People are writing their impressions on the net, so there are more emails.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,370
Perhaps because they heard of this "mysterious middle school writer"?

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,080
Of course, the book itself is their main focus.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,870
There's even another run of it being printed, after all.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,830
Okay! Thank you!

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,500
Also...

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,500
It's only something I heard, but...

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,470
So this way, it becomes more exciti—

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,590
What?!

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,010
Into an anime??

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,100
sonna yasashiku shinai de donna kao sureba ii no?

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,100
Don't be so nice to me, I just don't know how to react

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,360
tsumikasaneta kotoba de

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,360
With all these words piling up,

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,400
mienai yo kimi no yokogao

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,400
I can't even see your face

dokodakke? nakushita kagi ha mitsukaranai mama de

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,540
Where is it? I lost my key, now I can't find it

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,170
tameiki... surechigai ni iji hatte tsukarechau

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,170
Sigh, I'll burn out if I keep acting like this whenever we fight

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,970
hon no sukoshi chikaku kimi to no kyori ga

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,970
Maybe we're close? I just can't figure out

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:27,190
umaku tsukamenainda ato chotto na no ni

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:27,190

Don't be so nice to me, see? We hurt each other again

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,200
tsumikasaneta uso de mou ugokenakunatteru

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,200
With all these lies piling up, I can't even move

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,540
sugu ni ai ni ikitai kedo kotoba ha mitsukaranai shi

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,540
I want to see you now, but I don't know what to say

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,880
saigo no ichi pe-ji kurai kimi ni ha egao misetai

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,880
If this is the end for our story, I want you to see my smile

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,600
There's No Way My Little Sister
Could Get an Anime

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,110
Oh, so your story is going to be on TV?

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,110
I guess, yeah.

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,990
There's still a lot that I need to decide on, though.

40
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm guessing it's an anime?

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,620
That's right.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
Sounds fun...

43
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,400
I didn't think you'd have that kind of talent, too.

44
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,840
I've been pretty busy doing other things,

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,280
so I don't know when we'll be able to hang out.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,040
Sorry.

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,380
Oh, I see.

48
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,500
Also, can you keep it a secret please?

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,630
I wouldn't want this to spread around school.

50
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,580
It'll be our secret!

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,420
Are you guys lesbians or something?

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,490
Don't say stuff like that, Kanako.

53
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,520
You know, I saw the TV rankings yesterday.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,140
There's something about an otaku novel?

55
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,290
A junior high girl wrote it or something.

56
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,210
My City?

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,000
That!

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,410
That thing's super famous.

59
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,530
It's already being bought out to hell and back.

60
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,220
Damn, it's so annoying!

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,310
Maybe I should write something, too.

62
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,040
Have you written anything like it before?

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
Nah.

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Wouldn't writing an eroge be easy?

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,970
It's not that easy, right?

66
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,680
Y-Yeah.

67
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,600
Congratulations again on your anime!

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,520
Well it's not for sure yet...

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,690
Though that said, there's no way they won't go with it!

70
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,780
So which is it?

71
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,780
MediAscii must be pretty desperate to have even considered picking up your delusional pileup novel thing.

72
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,200
What's that?

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,790
Do I hear jealousy?

74
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,790
Feeling the weight of a loser wannabe being beaten out to getting a debut and an anime?

75
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,420
If you don't shut up, I'm going to write "anime otaku use only" on that huge forehead of yours.

76
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,590
What do you mean "use"?

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,510
I'm not allowed to say something that indecent in public.

78
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,550
Why you—

79
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,390
Now, now, now...

80
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,770
So Miss Kiririn, what did you call us together for?

81
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,810
Well basically, today is the first meeting with the anime staff.

82
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,320
Okay...

83
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,780
So I was thinking, if you guys wanted to so badly, I could let you come along.

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Why exactly do we have to accompany you to your meeting?

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,330
Like I said, you guys know about the studio, staff, and voice actors, right?

86
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,960
I'm giving you a chance to support me with that stuff in the meeting!

87
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,680
It's pretty rare to see you nervous.

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,180
So that's why you want us to come along?

89
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,600
D-Don't be stupid!

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,480
Who'd get nervous over a silly little meeting?

91
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,480
Here's your Justeen!

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,520
Who's in charge of this?

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,480
A lady named Fate-san.

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,530
Fate?

95
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,240
That's actually her real name.

96
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,070
She's a quarter, and her name is Iori Fate Setsuna.

97
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,740
What a cool name...

98
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,160
Understood!

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,500
I'll accompany you, if you want.

100
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,170
What about you?

101
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,960
If you come, I'll introduce you to Fate-san.

102
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,260
For me, it's not really a question of what I'll get out of it,

103
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,760
but my schedule happens to be open today, so I'll come along just for you.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,810
Be thankful you're so lucky.

105
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,270
You're seriously annoying.

106
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,900
The staff is already here.

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,780
Ah, okay.

108
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Excuse me.

109
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,960
Don't be so nervous!

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,630
You're infecting me with it!

111
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,670
I'm not nervous at all.

112
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,180
The purpose of today's meeting is to have a chance to talk about the "My City" anime.

113
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,890
So to start with, how about we discuss the general direction we want to take with it?

114
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,230
These two here are Rino-sensei's assistants.

115
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,930
I had them accompany me.

116
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,770
I figured it'd be good to have opinions from the readers.

117
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,690
I see, that makes sense.

118
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,030
My name's Saori.

119
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,700
I'm Kuroneko.

120
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,910
When exactly did I become your assistant?

121
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,820
Calling me that sullies my name.

122
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,660
You needn't mind us. Please go ahead with the meeting.

123
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,120
So how about we start with the director?

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,420
Alright.

125
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,880
Do you have anything in particular you want with regards to the anime?

126
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,840
Um... well...

127
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,050
I wrote some notes yesterday for today's meeting.

128
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,600
Notes?

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,430
Yes!

130
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,600
First, here's a list of the characters' voice actors.

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,730
We can't do this without Hoshino-san!

132
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,900
She has the exact image I had in mind when I was writing!

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,530
Also, I'd like Burigaki-san for one of the sisters.

134
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,650
And Youhei-san too!

135
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,070
I heard her in Meruru, and she has a great voice!

136
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,290
And I was thinking Chuuganji-san would be great to have for character design.

137
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,700
His takes on copyright characters are always full of ero.

138
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:24,590
Also, the idea just occurred to me, but would it be possible to change the opening and ending every episode?

139
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,000
So, 52 songs total.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,880
It'll be such an awesome hit!

141
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,010
And how about doing "My Star" for number 001?

142
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,060
I wrote this story for the net, but I'm sure the audience would be in tune with it!

143
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,140
Ah, for the soundtrack, I had a hard time deciding between Garyuu-san and Yoroi-san,

144
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,560
but maybe we can have them collaborate?

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,900
It'd be great to have all the voice actors for the sisters sing together!

146
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,740
I just thought of it, but maybe we could get a bunch of different manga artists and illustrators to do the character designs!

147
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,030
Maybe if we ask them from Raigeki Bunko's side...

148
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,000
And having end cards would also be great!

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,420
Also, this story starts in Shibuya, so could we use real shops in those scenes?

150
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,920
Like a homage to the original?

151
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,670
Also, Director, you did MoeSis too, right?

152
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,800
Can we get Bakkoin-san to do the animation for this?

153
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,550
I love the way he makes things move so smoothly!

154
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,600
Oh, and when you show panties on screen, you normally have to block it with shadows or light, right?

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,940
So for this, how about we say they aren't panties, but some kind of survival gear instead?

156
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,820
And lastly, for the credits, could you use "Super Original Work" instead of just "Original Work"?

157
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,830
Understood...

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,830
We'll take all that into consideration.

159
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,840
Ah, there is one thing we need to mention.

160
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,050
This is going to be a half season—13 episodes.

161
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,340
Were you planning on it being a full season?

162
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,470
W-Well...

163
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,600
Right now the base work is only one volume.

164
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,480
We plan to take that and add some anime-original episodes to pad it out.

165
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,850
Oh, okay...

166
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,810
I'll think up some additional content then...

167
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,860
Um...

168
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860
You don't have to do it right now.

169
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,370
Oh! I have notes for a character that I never ended up putting in the book, so we could use that...

170
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,870
I'll give it a read.

171
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:31,630
But I think restructuring the content, decreasing character details, and creating a backbone for the world may be enough to pull us through.

172
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,380
I-I see...

173
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,510
Indeed.

174
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,880
Also, about the schedule...

175
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,890
We're planning the broadcast for the July season.

176
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,060
What's wrong?

177
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,890
That's pretty soon...

178
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,560
That's why changing the opening or ending will be pretty difficult at this point.

179
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,450
Putting that energy into improving the main feature's quality may be better for its success on TV.

180
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,280
Oh... I see...

181
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,200
In regards to the voice actors...

182
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm glad you have an image in mind for them,

183
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,540
but given their schedule, it may be necessary to use people who aren't on your list.

184
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,460
I hope you can understand.

185
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,500
I see...

186
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,920
And as for the story...

187
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,760
I have some questions I'd like to ask.

188
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,260
Yes?

189
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,560
Why do all these little sisters come to like the main character?

190
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,060
Well...

191
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,850
Because she saved their lives?

192
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,150
But the main character is a girl.

193
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,940
Yes...

194
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,070
Why?

195
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,320
I wonder...

196
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,620
Because the author is projecting herself onto her, obviously.

197
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,830
Miss Kuroneko!

198
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,330
What do you think about changing the main character to a male lead?

199
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,470
I'm back.

200
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,230
Hey! What the hell?

201
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,320
Hey...

202
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,740
What happened?

203
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Shut up...

204
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Hey!

205
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,330
What's wrong?

206
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,370
Kirino!

207
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,540
She's still in bed?

208
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,670
Sheesh.

209
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,590
Both her body and mind are just so weak.

210
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,340
It's understandable though...

211
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,640
They completely turned around all her ideas,

212
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,390
so it probably came as quite a shock to her.

213
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:56,820
I suppose that's a natural reaction when you see the story you worked so hard on get turned upside-down.

214
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,150
I don't really get it...

215
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,570
Why didn't anyone want to hear her ideas?

216
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,950
It's her book they're turning into an anime, right?

217
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:12,120
That's true, but the process of creating an anime involves a huge number of people at great cost.

218
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,220
They have to release an episode once every week.

219
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,170
It'd be unrealistic to let one person have their way with everything.

220
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,720
It's a different league from books or manga where you can do all the work solo.

221
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,640
If the author doesn't like it, they can turn down the whole anime project, but...

222
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,600
You feel like you want to watch it, despite your gripes.

223
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,900
What a hassle.

224
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Mr. Kyousuke...

225
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,610
I actually looked into it a bit...

226
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:48,120
It would seem that this whole project was only decided very recently, after a different anime was suddenly cancelled.

227
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,080
I thought as much.

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,920
It seemed far too aggressive, pushing an anime for a new work with only one volume on sale.

229
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,750
So basically...

230
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,760
They're just using this to fill in a gap?

231
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,760
To put it bluntly, yes.

232
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,720
So that's why they're ignoring Kirino's opinions and just bulldozing forward with production...

233
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,270
That's definitely a possible explanation.

234
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,940
That really sucks.

235
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,520
Though again, it's just what I heard.

236
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:25,780
I don't really get this kind of stuff, but isn't having the story you worked so hard on trampled all over really unfair?

237
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,610
Of course it is.

238
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,030
What should we do?

239
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,540
You're suggesting we do something?

240
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,660
Is there any other choice?

241
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,460
If we don't, her anime is going to be a total mess.

242
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,420
Wouldn't that be a job for your sister?

243
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,960
The one you hate so much?

244
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,170
That's right, I hate her.

245
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,180
But I can't leave this one alone.

246
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,550
It pisses me off too much.

247
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,060
I don't know what, but I feel like I need to do something.

248
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,020
Mr. Kyousuke...

249
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,810
I feel the same way.

250
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,820
Don't misunderstand.

251
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,450
I'm just following along because I'm bored.

252
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,910
Her brother?

253
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,950
Thank you for looking after my sister.

254
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,170
She's in bed sick today, but I asked her for her opinions.

255
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,710
Please let me stand in.

256
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,420
O-Okay...

257
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,760
She already sent me her opinions on the plans though...

258
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,470
She came up with more besides those.

259
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,140
There shouldn't be any problem.

260
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,470
They get along well enough to know how each other thinks.

261
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,350
Please treat his opinions as hers.

262
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,980
And you two came today too?

263
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,110
Her brother?

264
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,990
Sorry for the change.

265
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,160
He's received instructions from the author.

266
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,700
Please treat him as her proxy.

267
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,750
I see...

268
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,210
You still have time.

269
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,090
Tuck your tail and run?

270
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,960
Just watch me.

271
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,340
We made these changes based on comments made at the last meeting.

272
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:19,060
Given that most fans of the book are male, I think we should change the main character to a young man.

273
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,860
With a young man and little sister characters as the cast, the whole "Onii-chan" theme becomes more realistic.

274
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,030
The viewers will find it easier to project themselves onto the main character.

275
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,240
That sounds good.

276
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,400
We have a comment from the author about that.

277
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,070
What is it?

278
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,740
If possible, she wants to keep the main character as a girl.

279
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,200
Any reason?

280
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,580
She didn't give one in particular...

281
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,670
Um, if I may?

282
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,460
Yes?

283
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:51,090
I'm not sure myself, but I think that's a major point for her.

284
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,390
I think she has some meaning in mind behind the idea of girls getting along with girls...

285
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,390
Damn, what am I saying?

286
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,390
And what might that be?

287
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,940
Um... well...

288
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,400
I can't really put it into words myself...

289
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,780
Then I can't really see it.

290
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,610
Excuse me.

291
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,120
Having both the hero and the ones being saved be girls might limit the user demographic,

292
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,370
but the original was successful on that dynamic.

293
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,170
Let's leave the decision to the director.

294
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,050
Say what you think, dammit!

295
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,850
Having a young girl as the main character may cause some physical problems in several scenes.

296
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,800
You think?

297
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,850
You wouldn't normally have a girl lifting rubble.

298
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,060
Couldn't you use something at the scene?

299
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,730
Doesn't it make more sense in that setting to have an ex-soldier or something?

300
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,310
You think?

301
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,320
They completely ignored me...

302
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,110
How about this?

303
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,820
Keep the original as the original, but make the anime a story happening at the same time nearby?

304
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,830
But then there'd be no meaning in using My City...

305
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,910
We can still use some material from the original.

306
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,170
If we make the main character of that one a girl, doesn't that fit everyone's conditions?

307
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,420
What does the author think?

308
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,680
We can't know unless we ask, but she's sick today...

309
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,430
We can ask her later then.

310
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,260
So we can just move on with that idea for now?

311
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,220
No, wait!

312
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,890
Wait a minute!

313
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,190
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

314
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,810
Using her book has no meaning this way!

315
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,190
And frankly, that version sounds so standard it's boring!

316
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,030
Can't you just do it the way she wrote it?

317
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,450
Look here...

318
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,120
There are too many problems with turning this book into an anime.

319
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,710
Yes, but doing that is your job, right?

320
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,460
She did make the story.

321
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,210
Our job is making animated stories.

322
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,720
Not pleasing the original author.

323
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,340
You're not supposed to say that...

324
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,260
She might be a sister to you,

325
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,220
but to us, she's a business partner.

326
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,390
If we could make the original directly into an anime, we would.

327
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,020
But books for which that doesn't work will fail as anime.

328
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,230
That's why sometimes changes are necessary.

329
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,610
Ultimately, the content we produce must be profitable.

330
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,530
We have to consider this from that perspective.

331
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:28,540
If we don't make a good work into something even better, our customers won't watch or buy it.

332
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,250
Frankly, I've turned down this story once already.

333
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,340
The concept is good, but I don't see how it can succeed as a series.

334
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,260
Most importantly...

335
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,430
I personally don't find it interesting at all.

336
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,520
I've tried to voice my ideas despite that.

337
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,820
But if you don't like them, we can cancel it now.

338
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Er... well...

339
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,570
So you're just running away now, you pathetic swine?

340
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,280
"Swine"?

341
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,200
This may be oversimplifying, but in other words,

342
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,620
you're out of ideas, so you're trying to turn it into something you've done before.

343
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,040
Hey, wai—

344
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,460
Who can say your method is the right one?

345
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,550
If you have time to complain all day then reread the original.

346
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,010
Excuse me—

347
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,970
But I will agree that the novel is boring.

348
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,850
The setting is stupid, the story flops around, and the style is incomprehensible.

349
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,480
Yet it's a bestseller?

350
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,190
It gets an anime?

351
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,980
That's so wrong it's not funny.

352
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,490
Any publisher or company or studio supporting this crap would be better off going bankrupt.

353
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,490
Hey!!

354
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,540
I've spent years studying and submitting.

355
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,960
It's frustrating.

356
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm so jealous I can't stand it.

357
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,920
You're the same way, right?

358
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,340
You've written many novels before.

359
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,100
But nobody ever read them and they're all out of print now.

360
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,180
Combined, they haven't sold even one tenth of this book's sales.

361
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,520
I can understand how your pride must be getting in the way of scripting something written by a middle school girl.

362
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,690
That's enough! What are you saying?!

363
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,030
You're one to talk.

364
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,030
Why is it always about your sister?

365
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,360
Don't try to tell me you haven't thought about that.

366
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,280
I...

367
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,580
That has nothing to do with this!

368
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,870
She's right.

369
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,620
Why does she have all the talent?

370
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,170
Why does everyone love her?

371
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,830
Why does she get all the attention?

372
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,500
Why does everyone sing her praises?

373
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,090
Why does everything go so perfectly for her?

374
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,300
I've thought about it.

375
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,420
And...

376
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,430
After watching what happened at the last meeting, I was ecstatic.

377
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,930
That girl needs to be kicked down more often.

378
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,440
Ahh, I hate it so much.

379
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,810
I hate everything in this world.

380
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,110
If only a bomb would just blow everything away.

381
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,200
When Kirino was depressed, I felt relieved.

382
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,120
I was basking in her misfortune.

383
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
But that's that.

384
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,420
I hate Kirino.

385
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,040
But as my sister...

386
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,260
I have no choice but to do this for her!

387
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,930
I'm her brother.

388
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,930
My sister is a crazy anime otaku.

389
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,690
She’s so excited that her novel is becoming an anime.

390
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,730
Practically jumping up and down like a little kid.

391
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,030
Even with school, work, and club all over her schedule,

392
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,740
she worked until she collapsed, writing exactly how she wanted the anime.

393
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,750
So if it doesn't turn out right, she'll die of depression.

394
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,710
She'll cry, and she'll be heartbroken.

395
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,420
I understand that this is a job for you.

396
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,180
I understand perfectly that I have no place to say this.

397
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,800
But this is all I can say.

398
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,770
She might be a business partner to you, but she's a sister to me.

399
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,190
Please! Listen to what she has to say!

400
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,440
My sister put everything she had into writing it!

401
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,450
She worked so hard!

402
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,780
You guys are anime pros, right?

403
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,490
Then show us what you can do!

404
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,910
If not, she'll be devastated by an anime—by what she loves!

405
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,630
Isn't that turning everything you've done until now into nothing?

406
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,300
Please...

407
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,430
Don't waste all the effort you've already put into this!

408
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,010
Your argument is slipping off topic.

409
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,810
Shut up!

410
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,310
But I agree.

411
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:06,820
This is not something we can just blow off, no matter how envious we are.

412
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,030
Please.

413
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,660
Think it over again.

414
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,210
Keep everything today a secret from Kirino.

415
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,600
There's no way I'd even consider telling her.

416
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,140
Let's just hope it was enough to convince them to change their plans.

417
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,350
I hope so too.

418
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,360
Well, I guess we can leave the rest to Fate-san.

419
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,030
We're technically unrelated to this, after all.

420
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,990
What?

421
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,530
This is a good opportunity, so let me ask you.

422
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,870
Why do you do so much for your sister, even losing face for her?

423
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't really know, myself.

424
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,460
Siscon?

425
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,840
Absolutely not!

426
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,380
Masochist?

427
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,510
Not that either!

428
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,380
Then why?

429
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,640
Because I'm her brother, obviously.

430
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,560
Really.

431
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,060
I see.

432
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,190
Must be nice.

433
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,200
So after all that talk, they still went with most of my ideas.

434
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,240
I guess my passion got through to them.

435
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,710
Or maybe being that direct was a good idea.

436
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,170
I always figured that communication is the key to pulling off anime based on original works.

437
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,040
Oh wow!

438
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,210
Chuuganji-san might do the character design?

439
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,220
I need an autograph!

440
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
You don't get one.

441
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,930
I don't want one.

442
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,390
And don't talk to me like you know me or something.

443
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,980
You started this conversation!!

444
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,440
Hey...

445
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,990
The next life counseling will be the last one.

446
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:41,200
Waratte sono kuuki ga tokeau toki no

447
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:41,200
Smile. Our spaces start to merge into one.

448
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:48,590
Senaka wo mitsumeteru dake umareru koufukukan

449
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:48,590
Just looking at your back makes me content.

450
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,710
Furete tashikameru taion no sonzai wo

451
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,710
Let's touch to feel each other's warmth,

452
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,500
Mou nidoto nakusanai youni

453
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,500
So I won't ever lose you again.

454
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,550
Niwaka ame kara mamotte miseruyo

455
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,550
I will protect you from the drizzle.

456
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:13,370
Omocha wo narabete kimi no kyoumi hiku

457
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:13,370
I lay out toys to draw your attention

458
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,080
Kiete shimau koto wo osorete

459
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,080
because I'm afraid you'll disappear from my sight.

460
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,260
Kamereon do-ta-

461
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,260
Chameleon daughter.

462
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,070
Ikutsumo kao kakushi motte iruno

463
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,070
I carry around many faces

464
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:33,830
Renzu no oku ni fuserareta hitomi

465
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:33,830
hidden behind these galsses.

466
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,800
Aseru koto naisa

467
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,800
There's no need to rush.

468
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,660
Sukoshizutsu kokoro no doa hirakou

469
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,660
Let's slowly open the door to the heart.

470
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,010
Kirameku keshiki ga matte irukara

471
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,010
A wonderful view will be awaiting you.

472
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,590
There's No Way My Little Sister
 Can Play Eroge Like This

473
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,960
Next Time: There's No Way My Little Sister Can Play Eroge Like This
