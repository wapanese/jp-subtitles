00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,410
Go back home!

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,990
You have a brother waiting for you.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,250
Hey...

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,420
You canned yourself into your room all morning during the weekend playing eroge.

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,050
You're the one who forced me to play it!

31
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,930
Don't look down on me! You should be praising me!

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,640
You're the spitting image of an erogamer.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,060
That's not a compliment!!

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,980
So? Have you cleared it once at least?

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
No, I haven't yet...

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,660
This game's special feature is the ability to use the character from your cleared saved game in a fighter!

37
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,570
If you still haven't completed it, you can't play against me!

38
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,910
Go fight with someone else...

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,750
Can't you do it online?

40
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,870
I can't win online.

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,500
Just go find a walkthrough site.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,880
Why do you think I set it up so you can use the internet?

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,590
The SisCaly ATWiki is really detailed.

44
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,640
Read it and spend all tomorrow clearing the game.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,970
It's even a Sunday.

46
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,980
Yeah, fine fine.

47
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,770
I just need to clear it, right?

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,980
Tomorrow then.

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,900
Oh, I forgot to mention...

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,240
I have friends coming over tomorrow.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Make sure you don't come out of your room.

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,450
They're cute, but if you try to talk to them, I'll kill you.

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,450
Don't even look at them.

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,240
You'll contaminate them.

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,830
It's not like I give a damn about your friends in the first place.

56
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,420
Right...

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,010
I don't get it at all.

58
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,400
Huh? I can login?

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,150
Isn't this her character?

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,280
Alright!

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,660
Time to give up!

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,000
Good day, Kiririn-san.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,710
If you have a moment, would you like to chat?

64
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,800
You really are a totally different person online.

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,470
Kyousuke-onii-sama?

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,970
It has been some time.

67
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,470
Have you been doing well?

68
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,310
Normal.

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,140
<i>She's</i> doing too well.

70
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,310
Thanks for looking out for her.

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,810
Not at all...

72
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,810
I'm able to put Kiririn-san to good use in this game.

73
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,650
Thanks to her,

74
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,690
I've managed to maintain an 8:1 win ratio.

75
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,700
So you're the reason she's so moody...

76
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,080
Can you show me the ropes for this game then?

77
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,000
She's forcing me to play this,

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,670
so I figure if I can get good at it, I can beat her as revenge.

79
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,210
It's lovely to see you two getting along so well.

80
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,800
Like hell!

81
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,350
Hello?

82
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,600
If that's the case then I'll walk you through it over the phone!

83
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,350
Totally different person!

84
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,300
I'll be right there!

85
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,680
I've been waiting for you!

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Pardon the intrusion.

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,660
Heya!

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,850
You can just head upstairs.

89
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,310
I'll bring some drinks up.

90
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,080
Sorry to intrude.

91
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,780
Gross.

92
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,050
I told you not to look!

93
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,240
Why are you here?

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,810
I told you to stay in your room.

95
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,950
I seriously don't want you running into them, so hurry up and go to your room!

96
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,810
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,960
You idiot, if you go up now, they might see you!

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,460
What's wrong with your brain?

99
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,140
Why am I doing this?!

100
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,280
Yeah, right!

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,860
Let's see your phone then!

102
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,360
You can't!

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
That's an invasion of privacy.

104
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
That's so suspicious.

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Why don't you just admit it?

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,020
I told you, I don't have a boyfriend!

107
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,610
But you've been acting weird recently.

108
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,460
Huh? Wh-What do mean by that?

109
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,860
No way~

110
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,380
That character you're putting on is so gross!

111
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,410
I saw you talking on your phone one time, and you sounded really angry, but you looked kind of happy.

112
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,260
And after hanging up you had this huge smile.

113
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,620
It's definitely a boyfriend!

114
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,390
That's not really...

115
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,480
Come on, stop already!

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,750
I don't have a boyfriend or anything!

117
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,260
The goosebumps!! She's making me sick!!

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,950
That's enough, you two.

119
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,950
By the way, the person downstairs was your brother, right?

120
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,040
Wh-What about him?

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,120
Why do you look so annoyed all of a sudden?

122
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,580
He looks like a kind brother.

123
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,040
You need to see an optometrist.

124
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,790
You definitely have some eye disease.

125
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,960
So cruel!

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,210
I saw him too!

127
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,030
It was only for a moment, but he didn't look like you at all.

128
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,220
Shut up, dumb kid.

129
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,260
Leave me alone!

130
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,780
How to describe him...

131
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,430
He seems like the kind of guy who'll end up as your average manager at some office branch in 10 years.

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,850
Like, totally plain?

133
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,150
Middle school girls can sure run their mouths.

134
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,900
Why did you get all quiet, Kirino?

135
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,920
No reason...

136
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,740
Thank you!

137
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,360
To: Kousaka Kyousuke 
From: Makashima Saori

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,360
Who's this?

139
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,960
What's that?

140
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,880
No idea.

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,370
That box!

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,970
It's yours?

143
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,310
Why does it have my name—

144
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,720
It's an "Eternal" box!

145
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,390
No way!

146
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,850
Why? How?

147
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,310
Is this for me?

148
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,130
Wait...

149
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,440
Wow!

150
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
Even I can't buy any of their stuff!

151
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
Wait, that's—

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,650
No choice then.

153
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,530
I'll take care of it for you.

154
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,640
Now we're even for that unnecessary stress you caused me with your screwup earlier.

155
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
That's not what I mea—

156
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,250
Hello?

157
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,800
Mr. Kyousuke? It's me, Saori.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,670
Did you get my package?

159
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,470
It was you?

160
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,970
You mean the cosmetics maker box you sent?

161
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,510
Yes, that one!

162
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,310
You see, I know Miss Kiririn's address and phone number, but I never asked what her real name was.

163
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,810
So that's why you sent it to me?

164
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,730
Well, I gave it to her already.

165
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,360
She looked very happy.

166
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,860
Thanks.

167
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,030
Are you sure you're okay giving that brand of cosmetics to her?

168
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,160
Isn't that stuff really expensive?

169
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,250
The contents of the box are completely unrelated to the box itself, you know...

170
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,080
What?

171
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,540
Then... what's inside?

172
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,400
What Miss Kiririn asked for.

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,010
A Meruru and SisCaly doujinshi set.

174
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,880
Wha—

175
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Ero stuff?

176
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,510
To say the least.

177
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,790
I'll call you back later!!

178
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,310
Oh crap this is bad!

179
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Hey!

180
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,190
What are you doing, barging in like that?

181
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,610
Sorry, there's been a mistake...

182
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,490
Get out!

183
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,410
Right now!

184
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,310
Could you give me back that box?

185
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,660
You already gave it to me!

186
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,160
You're not making sense!

187
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,580
Just get out already!

188
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Sorry!

189
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,150
Sorry for interrupting!

190
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,570
Stop!

191
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,130
I'll explain later!

192
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,860
Shut up!

193
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,680
Stop making excuses!

194
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,620
Give it back!

195
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,790
I said no!!

196
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,360
That hurts! Stop!

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,180
Die! Die die die die!

198
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
Look out!

199
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,950
What is this, some eroge?!

200
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,460
Kirino?

201
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,710
Woah, you're in that kind of relationship with your brother?

202
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,880
N-No!!

203
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,880
N-No!!

204
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,810
Don't you dare come back inside until everyone's gone home, you freaking pervert!

205
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,080
Thanks for having us!

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,970
Um...

207
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,290
Uh... yes?

208
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,800
Does that box have something that Kirino shouldn't see?

209
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,570
I didn't feel like you were just trying to harass her earlier...

210
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,070
You seemed desperate, trying your hardest...

211
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,160
So I thought maybe there was a reason for it...

212
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,810
Is it a present for her for some special day?

213
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,920
Nothing like that.

214
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,290
I see.

215
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,840
But there's some reason for it right?

216
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,010
I don't know what it is, but please forgive Kirino!

217
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:15,100
She's a bit selfish, but I'm sure she doesn't actually hate you or anything!

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,140
I see...

219
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,230
Thanks for the advice.

220
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,590
I'll keep that in mind.

221
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,840
Thanks for looking out for her all the time.

222
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,860
Not at all!

223
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,820
We're best friends, after all.

224
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,450
Since we got a chance to talk...

225
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,460
Thank you very much!

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
My name's Kousaka Kyousuke.

227
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,960
And you?

228
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,630
Sorry for the late introduction.

229
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,050
I'm Aragaki Ayase.

230
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,300
Sorry about that!

231
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,370
What were you talking about?

232
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,020
I get it now,

233
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,650
but couldn't you have done it some other way?

234
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,860
No!!

235
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,030
It's your fault for just grabbing this and running to your room!

236
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,760
What? Are you trying to blame me for this?

237
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,330
Things got this confusing because you went and secretly became friends with Saori!

238
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,270
See, you're already distracted.

239
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,330
Shut up!

240
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,170
And what was with you going all ga-ga for Ayase?

241
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,880
Don't check out my friends like that!

242
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,380
You pervert!

243
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,800
<i>You're</i> calling <i>me</i> a pervert?!

244
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,540
You're going to take responsibility for embarrassing me in front of everyone.

245
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Huh?

246
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,060
I'm going to be busy with my club this summer, so I won't be able to go out much.

247
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,550
I have training camp the second half of August, too.

248
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,650
So...

249
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,480
Basically you want me to take you out somewhere?

250
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,820
Like the beach or the mountain?

251
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,110
I can go to those kinds of places with Ayase.

252
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,320
Where do you want to go then?

253
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,810
Think about it yourself.

254
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,010
Why did I have to get up so early and come to a place like this?

255
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,580
Well, after thinking about it, I asked her in the end.

256
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,310
I proposed we make our Summer Comiket debut.

257
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,340
I was actually already thinking of inviting you.

258
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,840
I had some responsibility for the incident, after all.

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,650
Whatever.

260
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,280
How long do I have to wait in line?

261
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,700
My feet hurt.

262
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,820
No one cares.

263
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,530
Quit complaining and just wait.

264
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,200
You're annoying the people around you.

265
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,490
Well, I guess this line is tough on first-timers.

266
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,880
Sorry about this. And you even lent us a chair...

267
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,720
Though, if she really didn't want to be here, she wouldn't have come.

268
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,350
I guess as her brother you know her quite well.

269
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,810
Hot... Gross... Annoying...

270
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,150
Could you please be quiet?

271
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,570
You're making the discomfort index go up.

272
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,740
But why do all these people line up for hours in this inferno for?

273
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,910
Do they want doujinshi that badly?

274
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,250
Not everyone's here for the same thing, but I'm sure you'll understand once it begins.

275
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,210
When does it begin?

276
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,910
This year's Summer Comic Circle Market is now open!

277
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,470
Please enter calmly, and no pushing!

278
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,610
Hot... Loud... Smelly...

279
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,650
What a frail human.

280
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,280
It's better than it was yesterday.

281
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,700
You came here yesterday?

282
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,160
I was actually here two days ago too.

283
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,410
A battle is something you stick with from the start.

284
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,580
Seriously, what's so fun about this?

285
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,080
The answer to that is right over there.

286
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,280
Running is dangerous!

287
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,920
Please do not run!

288
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,890
The ceiling's so high!

289
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,780
Miss Kiririn, did you have any artists you liked from the doujinshi I sent you?

290
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:40,040
Well, if I had to choose, I'd say Yamanashi Ganma's Meruru book and QQQ's Reika book.

291
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
And... Oh, right!

292
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,000
Sakura G. Sakura did the artbook, right?
She's doing Meruru's comic version, right?

293
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,670
That was so cute!

294
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,570
Total recovery!

295
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,800
Actually, those books were all made by people I know.

296
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,470
What?

297
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,320
Wait, seriously?

298
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,310
I was thinking of making my rounds to say hello.

299
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,330
Would you like to join me?

300
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,440
S-Seriousl—

301
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Fine, I'll go with you.

302
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,360
But only if you insist.

303
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,900
Please do join me.

304
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,900
It's a bit cooler because it's cloudy, but isn't it really harsh wearing a costume like that in summer?

305
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,690
If it's too hot, you stuff ice packs in them.

306
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,570
You don't have a drop of sweat on you either.

307
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,580
You do things like that?

308
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,700
Well...

309
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,210
I put up a thin curtain of dark energy which protects me from the sun and heat.

310
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,250
What? What does that mean?

311
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,000
You wouldn't understand.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,460
Just give up.

313
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,970
I'm afraid you don't have the eyes of the "Children of the Night".

314
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,260
You can't possibly see dark energy.

315
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,500
And now you've turned all teen complex again.

316
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,510
You're cosplaying again today? That Maschera character?

317
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,010
Where exactly are you looking at?

318
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,470
You're totally wrong.

319
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,930
These are my normal clothes.

320
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,020
If these are your normal clothes, then you can make them a bit cooler.

321
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,770
W-Wait, don't—

322
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,690
Much better.

323
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,530
I said that this heat was nothing to me.

324
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,990
Sure, sure. Whatever.

325
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,370
You look pretty cute when you're not wearing those thick clothes.

326
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,790
Could you stop giving compliments with your "I'm still better" attitude?

327
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,290
Seriously? Getting embarrassed?

328
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,920
Hold.

329
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,300
What?

330
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,470
West Halls 3 and 4 are for industry booths.

331
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,060
Let's go!

332
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,020
There's something I want at the Alice+ booth!

333
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,350
Alice+? I've heard that name somewhere before...

334
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,270
They made SisCaly.

335
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,900
I'll go ahead! I need to buy that Limited Edition Summer Comiket Disc!

336
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,610
Limited edition disc?

337
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,160
A collector's item with data for the new SisCaly.

338
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,950
But...

339
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,620
Sold 
Out

340
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,710
You would have needed to line up as soon as it opened to buy it...

341
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't worry about it.

342
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,420
Too bad...

343
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,630
Well, you couldn't really help it.

344
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,130
Shut up. Don't touch me.

345
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,510
Excuse me...

346
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,680
Um... there's one disc left...

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,530
It looks like you can get the disc if you can beat him.

348
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,030
Sounds interesting. I'll give it a go!

349
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,370
That staff member's won 50 straight games these last three days.

350
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,120
They don't plan to let anyone win.

351
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,750
He's also a high-ranking player on the PC version.

352
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,250
If you give him an unanalyzed new character...

353
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,590
That was fast...

354
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,090
Damn this crappy game!

355
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,760
Like I could win!

356
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,800
That's such a ripoff!

357
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,470
Well... you weren't great at Siscalypse to begin with...

358
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,810
Saori is much bette—

359
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,850
My deepest apologies.

360
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,730
I thought I had him, but...

361
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,270
It's fine, no one's winning that.

362
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,820
Too slow!

363
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,360
Naive!

364
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,790
You're mine!

365
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,580
She got me!

366
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,500
It'll be over soon.

367
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,880
Impossible!

368
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,720
And you call yourself a little sister? How silly!

369
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,020
Kuroneko-dono!!

370
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,890
How could you!

371
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,980
I had no idea you were so good!

372
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,100
Stifling...

373
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,190
Could you stop that?

374
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,200
Wh-What?

375
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,700
You can have this.

376
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,000
What? What do you mean?

377
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,040
Oh? You don't want it?

378
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,420
Or maybe you don't understand what I'm saying?

379
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,300
If you don't want it then throw it away.

380
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,840
I-I didn't say that!

381
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,180
Why not just accept it then?

382
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,510
Or is my beauty overwhelming you?

383
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,300
What a boring human.

384
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,260
Why is everything you say so annoying?

385
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,680
I don't see a single speck of beauty anywhere on you!

386
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,100
She just can't be honest...

387
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,850
Indeed... both of them.

388
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,060
Well if you insist, I'll take it off your hands.

389
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,230
Be grateful!

390
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,110
Hey! What's so funny?

391
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:03,880
Comiket can certainly be pretty harsh, but if you put your all into it, you can find all sorts of fun.

392
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,300
That's why I figured we should come here together.

393
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,010
I see...

394
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,060
Well, it has nothing to do with a normal person like me, though.

395
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,850
Could you give me back my coat now?

396
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,860
Thanks a lot.

397
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,070
I'm sure she—

398
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,690
What might you be talking about?

399
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,160
Hey, come on!

400
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,570
Kirino!

401
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,620
Ayase?

402
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:46,920
tsuyoku tsuyoku negatteita

403
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:46,920
Strongly, strongly, I wished

404
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,180
anata ga kakusu hontou no egao

405
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,180
To see the true smile you’re hiding

406
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:01,520
tooku tooku miuketai

407
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:01,520
From afar, from afar, I want to see

408
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:09,570
watashi kara tsutaeru sayonara

409
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:09,570
A goodbye from me to you

410
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,710
anata ga hontou ni taisetsu ni shitai mono

411
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,710
I try to understand that

412
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,380
hitotsu dake janaitte wakatteitai kedo

413
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,380
You hold more than one thing dear

414
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:39,060
ne onegai watashi dake wo mitsumetsudzukete yo

415
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:39,060
But please, just look only at me

416
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:46,070
kakimidasarenu kegarenaki kokoro

417
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:46,070
With your pure, incorruptible heart

418
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,030
dekiru nara mitometai (mitomerarenai)

419
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,030
I want to accept it (I cannot accept it)

420
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,120
shiroi kyanbasu ni egakareta tomo

421
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,120
Even if drawn on white canvas

422
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:05,080
subete seotte ikiteyuku no

423
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:05,080
I’ll undertake it all and live on

424
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,420
There's No Way My Little Sister's
 Best Friend can be this ●●●●

425
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,890
Next time: There's No Way My Little Sister's
 Best Friend can be this ●●●●
