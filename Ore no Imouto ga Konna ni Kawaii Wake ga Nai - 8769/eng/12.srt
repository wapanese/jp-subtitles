00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,390
Oh, good morning.

2
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,630
Thanks.

3
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,760
Here.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,350
Thanks.

5
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,030
Pass it here.

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,510
Here.

7
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,640
Yours.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,170
Thanks...

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,760
Kirino, Kirino!

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,040
Yesterday, when Dad was watching you work, he tried to take a picture and got mistaken for a stalker!

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,540
Seriously? No way!

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,040
You didn't need to...

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,290
He got nervous and was all, "N-No, this is—my daughter—"

14
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,140
Don't mock me!

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,050
Come on, Dad!

There's No Way My Little Sister's
Life Counseling Can End Like This

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,770
Wait, really?

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,900
Yep, really!

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,110
The president really likes Kanako.

42
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,660
She's going to have an interview soon.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,530
If it goes well, they might hire her.

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,540
Like another step to being an idol?

45
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,330
Maybe it was a good thing to do that crappy gig.

46
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,170
Sorry, but I'm going to blow right past your level before long.

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,170
Congratulations, Kanako!

48
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,010
I'm sure you'll pass. Good luck!

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,350
My sister would never say "Good morning" or "Thanks" or "Here's yours".

50
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,230
That is not Kirino.

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,230
That is something else wearing her face.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,360
You don't need to worry about it.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,740
I'm sure Kirino-chan just feels like thanking you properly now.

54
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,790
No, I don't think so...

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,290
Ew.

56
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,250
"Ew"? You don't need to—

57
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,470
Hello, Onii-san.

58
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,720
Thanks for your help last time.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,890
No, don't mention it.

60
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,850
Kirino was really happy.

61
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,640
That's good!

62
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,560
Kyou-chan, do you know her?

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,140
One of Kirino's friends.

64
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,270
Pleased to meet you. My name is Aragaki Ayase.

65
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,360
Likewise! I'm Tamura Manami.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,150
Um... I'm Kyou-chan's childhood friend.

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,740
Hey, Ayase...

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,910
Yes?

69
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,370
She hasn't really been acting differently...

70
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,460
It's the usual Kirino.

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,330
I see...

72
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,500
If anything were to happen, I would know.

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm her best friend.

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,420
I guess.

75
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,590
Sorry to ask such a weird question.

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,680
Yes. I'll be off, then.

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,100
Yeah. See you.

78
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,760
Good bye.

79
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:02,610
Well, I did suggest the event, but Miss Kiririn was quite active in the preparations.

80
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,570
I don't think she was forcing herself or anything...

81
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,030
Maybe I'm just overthinking things?

82
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,120
Well, I suppose it's natural for you to be concerned about Miss Kiririn.

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm not, idiot!

84
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,380
Sorry to bother you.

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,380
I'm out.

86
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,590
See you.

87
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,920
Nyoro~n.

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,560
What's up?

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Can you come to my room?

90
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,580
Your room's a lot cleaner than last time.

91
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,950
I cleaned up a bit.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,750
So, what did you want to talk about?

93
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,000
Is it that final life counseling you were talking about?

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Well, that's one way to put it.

95
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,260
Well, whatever. Let's hear it.

96
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,220
Wha—

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,180
Hm?

98
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,390
Nothing.

99
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,640
I want you to buy me an eroge.

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,890
What the hell?!

101
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,150
This one!

102
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,780
"I'd Never Steal Something Like Onii-chan's Pantsu!!"

103
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,900
And this one!

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
3D Custom Imouto!

105
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,160
OniPan and CusImo.

106
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,080
What kind of abbreviations...

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,870
I want you to line up for the midnight release and get it for me.

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,130
This is seriously your last life counseling?

109
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,880
Yeah.

110
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,670
Why are you asking me to do this?

111
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,670
Because I want to play them as soon as possible, obviously.

112
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:55,220
My plan is to sleep in the afternoon until you get it, then play until morning, finishing at least one route.

113
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,930
What is with you? You'd go that far?

114
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,440
Of course I would. Naturally.

115
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,480
But that store is in Akiba, right?

116
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,490
Even if I buy it at midnight, I won't get back until after 1.

117
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,070
If Dad finds out—

118
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,200
I'll take care of that.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,410
I'll give you status updates on him by phone.

120
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,120
I want to play it as soon as possible!

121
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,290
Please? This is the last time...

122
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,790
Please?

123
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,550
Fine! I just need to go buy it, right?

124
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,300
Really? Alright!

125
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,980
Sorry, Akagi. Can you make it look like I'm staying at your place tonight?

126
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,560
Yeah, sure. Go get that Tamura-san, eh?

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,190
See you.

128
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,030
Sounds like he's misunderstanding this...

129
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,780
Man, it's cold.

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,210
Are these all... Kirino's kind?

131
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,220
All customers for the midnight release, line up here!

132
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,900
Someone came here on that?

133
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,030
Um... Is this the end of the line?

134
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,570
Oh, yeah.

135
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,490
A-Akagi?!

136
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,620
Kousaka?!

137
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,670
I asked you to make it look like I'm staying at your place!

138
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,380
What are you doing buying eroge?!

139
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,500
It's a long story...

140
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,510
Wait! I thought you were going somewhere nice with Tamura-san!

141
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,380
What are you doing buying eroge?!

142
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,390
It's a long story...

143
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,810
It looks like we both have extenuating circumstances.

144
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,900
Why don't we say we never met here?

145
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,240
Neither you nor I was at a midnight release in Akihabara.

146
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,160
We did not line up.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,700
Of course, we did not buy any eroge!

148
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,960
Friends expect nothing in return!

149
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,210
Customers with pre-orders for Homoge Club, line up here please!

150
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay!

151
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,890
Y-Y-You!

152
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,850
Is that what they call a full-on homo game?!

153
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,310
Kousaka?!

154
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,690
You are definitely misunderstanding things!

155
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,850
Listen to me! Look into my eyes!

156
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,860
Stay away from me!

157
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,610
I'm not homo!

158
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,440
Sure, that's a full-on homo game!

159
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,740
But my sister asked me to get it!

160
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Your sister is still a middle schooler!

161
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,500
No matter how you look at it, a middle school girl asking her brother to go buy an eroge is totally—

162
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,500
...possible, actually...

163
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,290
Why did you suddenly accept it?

164
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,260
This world is full of things that defy all common sense.

165
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,890
I'm sorry I doubted you.

166
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,970
As long as you understand...

167
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,430
Your sister plays homo games?

168
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,520
My sister is what they call a fujoshi.

169
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,070
Not "fu" as in "wife", but as in "rotten".

170
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,870
She can't help but shriek in joy when she fantasizes about men in love or in intimate relations.

171
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:48,080
She's all like, "I like homos! I like them a lot! I love them!"

172
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,630
Why are they clapping at us?

173
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,010
Hell if I know.

174
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,930
Whatever, I got it. Don't mind me and get into that line.

175
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,260
Alright. See ya.

176
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,730
Thank you for waiting! Time for the midnight release!

177
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,560
Please follow directions from the staff for your purchase!

178
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,280
Now then, first ten people in line!

179
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,530
Pantsu here!

180
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,320
Onii-chan no Pantsu here too!

181
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,360
The register is over here!

182
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,330
I hope I make the last train...

183
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,390
Did you get it?

184
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,720
How big is your head?

185
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,390
I told you I would make you a pair of nekomimi, didn't I?

186
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,060
So hurry up and tell me how big your fat, round head is.

187
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,940
What, it's you?

188
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,820
Can't you just mail me about that stuff?

189
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,700
The server is down tonight for maintenance, so I thought I would leave a message.

190
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,000
I could have asked tomorrow, but I figured I might as well ask tonight.

191
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,580
Nice to see you up this late.

192
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,830
So, who did you think I was?

193
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,970
How cruel.

194
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,430
It's incredible that Nii-san has enough patience to put up with your insolence.

195
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,560
Shut up.

196
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,430
And can you stop calling him that?

197
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,480
Nii-san?

198
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,270
Frankly, it's gross.

199
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,110
And he goes all dere when you say it. It's just gross.

200
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,360
I don't see that happening.

201
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,610
Well, no matter.

202
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,530
I'll be calling him something different soon enough.

203
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,060
Kyousuke

204
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,300
Hey! Where are you?!

205
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,130
Look out your window.

206
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,910
Here.

207
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,420
Thanks.

208
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,290
Sure...

209
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,750
Guess I'll go to sleep.

210
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,590
I should get at least some today.

211
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't be late to school.

212
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,550
W-Wait!

213
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,350
Want to play together? It's been a while since we did.

214
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,940
Hey, get off me.

215
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,810
I can't help it. I can't see the screen if I don't.

216
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,570
Oh, it's installed!

217
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,450
I'd Never Steal Something Like Onii-chan's Pantsu!!

218
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,370
This game only has one heroine, but it has a lot of routes for her.

219
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,210
Each time you clear a route, you get more choices and the ending changes, well, just like most other games.

220
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:27,130
And there are minigames spread through, and based on the items you get in them, different flags get raised.

221
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,180
What's with this ending...

222
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,220
It's way too sad!

223
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,520
You think?

224
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,690
It's not like they're separated by the grave or anything.

225
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,850
They can always talk on the phone.

226
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,900
Stupid! You're so stupid!

227
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,110
Don't you get anything?

228
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,570
It's lonely not being able to see each other!

229
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,490
Try putting yourself in their shoes!

230
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,990
I guess...

231
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,160
If you think about it that way, this is a lonely ending.

232
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,120
I got it.

233
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,500
As long as you get it.

234
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Oh, I need to get the other branch.

235
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,500
Let Fana go

236
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,500
Stop Fana

237
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,130
Well, that's the end. I can go, right?

238
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,090
W-Wait a second!

239
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,260
What now?

240
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,640
Life counseling!

241
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,930
Wha—you said that this was the end of your life counseling!

242
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,140
I bought your eroge for you!

243
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,860
But it's not over yet...

244
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,650
Fine, what is it? Let's hear it.

245
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,620
Is it growing?

246
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,840
Yeah, well, it's been nine months since then.

247
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,170
Remember what happened that time?

248
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,460
Well, sure.

249
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,220
Actually, there was something embarrassing that I couldn't show you that time.

250
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:05,810
You kept it a secret, and you didn't make fun of me, and you helped me out a lot, so...

251
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,690
Wait a second...

252
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,570
She has something even crazier than anime and eroge?

253
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,820
It's embarrassing... but I'll let you see.

254
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,830
I don't want to!

255
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,300
It's more normal than I thought it would be,

256
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,100
but there's no way anything my sister owns is normal.

257
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,390
Especially that. That album looks bad!

258
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,850
I don't want to know what's in it!

259
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,310
And so...

260
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
This album...

261
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,610
Take a look?

262
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,690
Look

263
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,690
Don't Look

264
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:49,820
Look

265
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:49,820
Don't Look

266
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:49,940
Look

267
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:49,940
Don't Look

268
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,070
Look

269
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,070
Don't Look

270
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,190
Look

271
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,190
Don't Look

272
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,360
Look

273
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,360
Don't Look

274
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,610
Look

275
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,610
Don't Look

276
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:50,940
Look

277
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:50,940
Don't Look

278
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,360
Look

279
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,360
Don't Look

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,860
Look

281
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,860
Don't Look

282
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,280
Look

283
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,280
Don't Look

284
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,110
Fine.

285
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,610
Show it to me.

286
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,870
S-So you'll look?

287
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,620
I've gotten this far. I'm ready for anything.

288
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,790
Or rather, it's harder on me if I know about it and don't look!

289
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,210
Come on. Hand it over.

290
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,380
I changed my mind!

291
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,630
What?! You brought all this up!

292
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,930
Shut up! I changed my mind!

293
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,760
That's it, so leave already!

294
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,260
What the hell?!

295
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,520
You have me running around town all night and now you're acting like this?

296
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,980
I said show it to me!

297
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Name

298
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Kousaka Kirino

299
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Itinerary

300
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Tokyo/Narita

301
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Los Angeles/Los Angeles

302
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Flight Ticket Claim Receipt

303
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,780
Huh?

304
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,280
Are you going to America?

305
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,540
Departure Date

306
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,540
Departure Time

307
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,210
Huh?

308
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,020
Tomorrow?

309
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,540
Wait, today?!

310
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,710
Nothing to do with you.

311
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,290
Nothing to do with me?

312
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,210
What are you doing there?

313
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,970
When are you coming back?

314
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm getting track coaching there.

315
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,680
I won't be back until high school.

316
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,270
I got invited by a coach from there during the summer training camp.

317
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,400
It's a good opportunity, so I thought I'd take it.

318
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,440
Why so suddenly...

319
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,230
It's not sudden.

320
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,780
I've been saving up funds for half a year now, money from my job and my book.

321
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,200
I talked to Dad and Mom too.

322
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,830
I just need to go to the airport in the morning.

323
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,830
Why didn't you tell me?

324
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,540
I didn't need to tell you.

325
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,220
It's none of your business if I go away.

326
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
But wait, I'm your—

327
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,640
Don't tell me you're going to tell me not to go now.

328
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I've already got everything packed.

329
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,680
And you don't like me anyway,

330
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,060
and I don't like you either!

331
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,740
It's just like you say.

332
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,070
Track... America...

333
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,820
It's a good opportunity.

334
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,870
I don't have any reason to stop you.

335
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,000
Go. Just go!

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,580
It's got nothing to do with me.

337
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,830
I'm going whether you tell me to or not!

338
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,250
Yeah! Go!

339
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,210
I'm going!

340
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,170
Go! Go now!

341
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,720
Just go, dammit!!

342
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,720
You—

343
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,430
Wait—

344
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,390
Shut up!

345
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,180
Stop, stupid!

346
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,890
Dad—

347
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,430
Shut up!

348
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,320
Die! Die! Die!

349
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Stop Fana

350
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:38,990
Stop Fana

351
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:39,990
Stop Fana

352
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,070
Stop Fana

353
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,280
Stop Fana

354
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,030
What's wrong with you?!

355
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,120
What do you want me to do?!

356
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,200
Tell me not to go, Onii-chan!

357
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,790
If you say so, I won't go anywhere.

358
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,640
I can reach my dreams anywhere, but I can only be with you here.

359
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,720
Thank you, Onii-chan!

360
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,640
We'll always be together from now on!

361
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,230
Go.

362
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,980
Do what you want!

363
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,370
When did you get back?

364
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,870
Just now...

365
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,000
I see.

366
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,720
Oh, you're back?

367
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,140
Oh no, I don't think I made enough for you too...

368
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,640
Kirino is—

369
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,770
Shut up.

370
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,600
Out of the way.

371
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,140
Good morning, Mom, Dad.

372
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,360
Morning.

373
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,030
What time's your flight again?

374
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,070
You have time for breakfast, right?

375
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,950
Have you told him already?

376
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,250
About that...

377
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,960
I've decided not to go to America.

378
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,920
Sorry!

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,470
Wait a second...

380
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm really sorry!

381
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,390
I'll go apologize to everyone today and explain.

382
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,930
Why, all of a sudden?

383
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,720
I-Is that right?

384
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,310
Well, I don't mind...

385
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,190
America is pretty far off anyway, and you're still in middle school too.

386
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,160
You kept pestering me to go so much it got me really irritated and annoyed.

387
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,750
Even though you had nothing to do with it.

388
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,960
That right?

389
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,800
Well, I think I need to study English more, anyway...

390
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
And there's the Meruru movie coming out, too.

391
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,220
And I'd be lonely being away from Ayase and them...

392
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,600
It'd be easier to transfer for high school, too.

393
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,430
And they’ll return a bit of my money.

394
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,350
Also, Mom and Dad and...

395
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,600
They'd get lonely without me.

396
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,150
And I wouldn't be able to buy eroge there—

397
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,610
What have you been grinning about all this time?

398
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,860
It's really gross!

399
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,370
I haven't been...

400
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,950
Stupid!

401
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,630
Morning Kyou-chan!

402
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,800
Yo.

403
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,550
You seem to be in a good mood today.

404
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,800
Really?

405
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,010
What've you been thinking about?

406
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,220
Nothing important.

407
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,810
It's just, there's no way my little sister...

408
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm back!

409
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,580
You know...

410
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,580
What?

411
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,250
The life counseling...

412
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,510
...isn't over.

413
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,010
Okay!!

414
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:58,700
soshite itsumo doori kaze wa soshiranu kao de

415
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:58,700
And as usual, my cold passes like nothing

416
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:06,880
kyou mo waraiaeru yasashii netsu dake ga nokoru

417
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:06,880
I can smile again today, with just a gentle fever

418
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:15,220
itteshimau no watashi ga saki kanau

419
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:15,220
I might be leaving, my dreams might come true

420
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:22,520
demo mou sukoshi dake isshou ni iyou ne

421
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:22,520
But let’s stay together just for a little longer

422
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:30,820
itsumo hanashikakeru kokoro no naka gyutto tsunagu

423
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:30,820
You always talk to me, joining our hearts together

424
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:39,700
kono shunkan tabitatsu hi made renshuu suru no

425
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:39,700
From now, until I have to leave, I’ll practice

426
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,330
kitto atarimae de arikitari de

427
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,330
I know it’s something everyday, something ordinary

428
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,670
kakegaenai kyou ni kawaru

429
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,670
But they’ll become an irreplaceable today

430
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,680
watashi no memoriizu kira kira shiteru

431
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,680
My memories shining in my eyes

432
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,100
shiawase na hibi mabushii ne

433
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,100
Happy days are just so bright

434
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,610
There's No Way My Little Sister's
 Life Counseling Can End Like This

435
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:13,880
Next Time:

436
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,080
There's No Way My Little Sister's
 Life Counseling Can End Like This
