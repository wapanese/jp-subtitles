00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,110
Sorry to call you here out of the blue.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,660
It's okay...

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,630
So, did you want something?

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,990
The truth is, Onii-san...

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,010
I need your help.

There's No Way My Little Sister
Can Cosplay Like This

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,050
If it's a present from you, she'd be happy no matter what you gave her.

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,350
Well...

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,850
That's true...

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,940
And why would I know what a middle school girl would like, anyway?

33
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,810
Anything you'd pick would be way better.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,820
But then...

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,280
It wouldn't be what she wants the most.

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,200
What?

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,950
What'd you say?

38
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,950
Kirino...

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,410
Kirino would be happiest getting something related to her hobby.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,500
That's why I'm asking you for help!

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,380
Are you accepting Kirino's otaku hobby?

42
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,970
I haven't accepted it.

43
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,890
I haven't accepted it!

44
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,390
But it's a celebration for her, so I'm making an exception this time...

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,940
Also, Kirino has been talking to me a little about anime...

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,650
Ones that aren't indecent, anyway.

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,660
But it's still not good enough for her.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,580
Last time I visited...

49
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,660
Look at them! Aren't they cute?!

50
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,960
Why do you have so many of the same ones?

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,550
They're all different! Look at the colors.

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,430
It's hard to collect them all.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,470
What do you do after you collect them?

54
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,060
She wouldn't talk to me for a while after that.

55
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,030
I was on the verge of tears...

56
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,570
Those are on the top three list of things you shouldn't ask.

57
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,570
That's why I want to make up for it now!

58
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,780
I decided to give her something related to her hobby,

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,000
so I'm asking you to help me think of what would make her the most happy!

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,460
So...

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,340
She's thinking about Kirino in her own way.

62
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,300
Got it.

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,470
I'll look into what kind of present she wants.

64
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,560
Th-Thank you so much!

65
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,600
What?

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,560
Are you thinking of giving me a present or something?

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,190
Ew... Gross.

68
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,700
Sorry. I can't do this, Ayase.

69
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,740
Hey, come on.

70
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,990
You made me buy stuff for you on Christmas Eve, didn't you?

71
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,040
That was for my research, so it doesn't count.

72
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,330
Don't take that the wrong way.

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,710
And come to think of it,

74
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,330
you've been making passes at my friends recently.

75
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,250
You were all over Ayase.

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,280
And you've been meeting with the dark one and Saori without me.

77
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,890
Th-They're my friends now, too!

78
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,890
So I can get along with them however I want!

79
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,640
You don't deny it?

80
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,850
Well, whatever. I don't care.

81
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,100
Why are you being so picky?

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,980
What are you, my girlfriend?

83
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,040
So you got into a fight and couldn't find out from her?

84
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,620
You really do lack grace.

85
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,960
More importantly, did you tell Kirino about what we did?

86
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,130
It was unavoidable.

87
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,090
Actually, a few days ago...

88
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,140
Hey, the restroom here is the cockpit for the Omega!

89
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,270
That's the Justeen Cafe for you.

90
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,730
I wonder what the men's side is like.

91
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,950
It's the bridge.

92
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,400
How do you know?

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,320
Your brother told me last—

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,160
What were you thinking?!

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,830
Don't worry.

96
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,660
She didn't find out about the anime studio incident.

97
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,860
We said you really wanted to see us and called us here.

98
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,620
What the hell?!

99
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,000
What kind of cheap guy did you turn me into?!

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,630
Now, now, now.

101
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,170
Let's get back to the topic.

102
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,680
Basically, you want to know what Miss Kiririn wants, right?

103
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,970
Yeah.

104
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,180
I figured you guys would definitely know better than me.

105
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,060
I see...

106
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,020
Well, we were also thinking of holding a party celebrating her anime.

107
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Oh? Really?

108
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,940
Saori is just saying that.

109
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,570
I've done absolutely nothing.

110
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,740
Oh, okay.

111
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,950
Thanks.

112
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,990
Oh no, it's nothing.

113
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,330
I'm doing it because I want to.

114
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,290
But now that we're ready, let us search for what Miss Kiririn desires!

115
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,430
The first thing that comes to mind would probably be this kind of stuff.

116
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,850
It wouldn't be too hard.

117
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,850
It matches her tastes perfectly.

118
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,850
They don't sell them either, so there's some value to it.

119
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,890
Yeah...

120
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,610
But it doesn't feel quite right...

121
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,280
This seems a bit weird for what she'd want the most.

122
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,370
Then perhaps a visual fanbook for eroge she likes?

123
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,990
Or perhaps rare doujinshi?

124
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,080
Uh... thanks for the suggestion,

125
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,000
but the requester would murder me over this.

126
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,500
There's no point in coming here.

127
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,130
She probably already has everything she wants from here.

128
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,930
Yeah...

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,180
The greatest work of art ever to grace the Earth at the hands of Man, for ¥980?

130
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,730
What will they do next?

131
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,610
This please.

132
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,900
You're buying it?!

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,450
Man, we can't find anything.

134
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,870
Are you sure a Meruru plushie isn't good enough?

135
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,870
It's probably the best thing we've found so far,

136
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,960
but I get the feeling there's something even better out there.

137
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,130
It's just not coming to mind.

138
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,840
It just has to be backwards compatible with that, right?

139
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,510
Something she would like, and isn't indecent.

140
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,140
Something hard to obtain, with real value behind it.

141
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,560
Something like that won't just pop—

142
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,650
Y-You're right!

143
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,320
This might be perfect!

144
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,830
Please repeat what you just said.

145
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,710
Kirino is a huge fan of that anime.

146
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,540
I know that.

147
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,710
It doesn't look like something indecent.

148
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,170
So I was thinking, maybe a figure they don't sell would be perfect.

149
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,550
It's hard to get your hands on, and for people into the stuff, it's invaluable.

150
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,890
What do you think?

151
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,560
Yes.

152
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,230
Goods for this anime are fine.

153
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,980
But I don't see how we can obtain this item that isn't for sale.

154
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,740
It's the prize for winning a Meruru cosplay competition.

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,000
You're telling me to participate?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, I mean, you're a model...

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,750
And you're beautiful, and you can definitely go for first place...

158
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,220
Ayase-san?

159
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,260
Might you be angry?

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,930
Of course I am!!

161
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,350
How could I appear on stage wearing something as embarrassing as this?!

162
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,770
Do you want me to kill you, you pervert?!

163
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,980
C-Calm down!

164
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,810
Listen to everything I have to say!

165
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,520
And you wouldn't look good in Meruru's outfit anyway!

166
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,030
I've done my research here!

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,660
This is the winner of the last one, Bridget-chan!

168
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,530
No matter what kind of mind-melting performance you do, you can't win against this!

169
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,370
And I wouldn't do a mind-melting performance in the first place!

170
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,540
Moron! Pervert!

171
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,540
Look closer! This contest is all about fitting the role!

172
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,750
It's more about looking like the character than the impact!

173
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,430
And it's not like you don't have a chance.

174
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,180
You're definitely prettier than her.

175
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,680
And you're a professional model, too.

176
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,930
You know how to bring out the best in clothes.

177
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,980
You can definitely win with the right character.

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,770
It sounds like you're saying there's a character that looks like me.

179
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,030
Yeah.

180
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,860
Fine. Show me.

181
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,570
What costume will I wear?

182
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,280
This.

183
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,330
Dark Witch Tanatos Eros EX Mode—

184
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,910
She's practically nude!!

185
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,500
Die!

186
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,460
Look properly!

187
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,750
She's only nude in the transformation sequence!

188
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,670
She's lewd enough even after the transformation sequence!

189
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,550
I will never wear such lecherous clothes!

190
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,760
Then what about Kirino's present?

191
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,770
I can't think of anything she would want more than this!

192
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,900
Y-You pervert!

193
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Why is she acting like I'm blackmailing her?!

194
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,910
We just need to win this contest and obtain the prize, correct?

195
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,830
Well, yeah, but...

196
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,790
You can't win against this girl with any other character.

197
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,080
No. We can win.

198
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,420
We just need an even cuter cosplay that looks more like the character than this girl.

199
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,060
Good grief...

200
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
Kyousuke-dono:

201
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
I have acquired the item you requested.

202
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
I pray for your success in this mission.

203
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
Saori

204
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
Struggle all you may against futility.

205
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
That alone may allow you escape

206
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
from the chains of failure.

207
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
Kuroneko

208
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,570
Those two...

209
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,570
Sorry!

210
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,580
Sorry to keep you waiting!

211
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,540
This is my classmate, Kurusu Kanako.

212
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,630
Nice to meet you!

213
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,300
I'm Kurusu Kanako!

214
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,550
Call me Kanakana!

215
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,340
Nice to meet you, Kanakana-chan.

216
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,850
I'm Aragaki's manager, Akagi Kouhei.

217
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,770
What? You're not a producer or anything?

218
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,020
Dammit, I acted cute for nothing.

219
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,150
And don't call me Kanakana like you know me.

220
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,230
It's gross.

221
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,240
This brat...

222
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,820
Why don't we go put your clothes on?

223
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,930
Damn, she looks like her!

224
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,180
Is she the real thing?!

225
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,060
We're all good here.

226
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,480
You can go now.

227
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,190
And she cut off her escape route!

228
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,150
Now then, let's head to the event!

229
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,820
What?! The hell's this?!

230
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,870
This is like something out of brat anime crap!

231
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,700
What the hell?!

232
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,410
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

233
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,250
The contest today is actually a cosplay contest.

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,540
Cosplay?!

235
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,000
Why do I have to be in something stupid like that?!

236
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,710
I'm not doing it!

237
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,380
I see...

238
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,420
That's too bad...

239
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,850
I wonder where the car with your clothes has gone now...

240
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,720
You tricked me, damn you!

241
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,850
Stardust Witch Meruru...

242
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,980
Starts now!

243
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,450
Dang, that's a lot of people.

244
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,950
This is an anime for kids, right?

245
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,790
Why are all these adult males here?

246
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,870
You're asking me...

247
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,500
It's proof that it's popular among all demographics maybe?

248
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,510
Welcome to the second official Stardust Witch Cosplay Contest, everyone!

249
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,800
Today we have 23 girls who will be characters from Meruru on stage!

250
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,010
It's going to be fun!

251
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,890
I'll be your host, Hoshino Kurara!

252
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,020
Are you ready?

253
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,280
They're really into it...

254
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,030
What's wrong?

255
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,780
Onii-san...

256
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,660
Look there.

257
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,040
Wahoo! Kurara!

258
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,750
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Kurara!

259
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,040
Kurara!

260
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,210
Th-That's Kirino, right?

261
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,250
Yeah, it is...

262
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,800
Well, it's no surprise she's here...

263
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Or rather, we should have figured she'd show up.

264
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,760
Good thing she's not going up there.

265
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,930
I'm glad I'm not participating in this...

266
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,730
If Kirino saw me cosplaying in that, I would die...

267
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,520
I think she'd be really happy, though...

268
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,150
Now then, this is the winner's prize—the trophy!

269
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,280
A special Meruru figure!

270
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,160
There's only one of these in the world!

271
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,450
Special Meruru! Yes! Yes! Yes!

272
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,410
I want it so bad! Dammit!

273
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,910
If only there were a character that looked like me!

274
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,830
She wanted to participate!

275
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,380
It looks like we picked the right present for her.

276
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,920
Yeah...

277
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,760
But Kanako will see her if she's up there making a racket like that.

278
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,260
I'll go warn her.

279
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,560
We should split up here.

280
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,690
It'll be a hard to explain if she sees us together.

281
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,810
Yes.

282
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,440
We can meet up where we were earlier.

283
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,530
Give this to Kirino.

284
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,530
Now then, entry number 1!

285
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:21,830
We have last year's winner, coming all the way from England again this year, Bridget-chan!

286
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,470
Taste my blade!

287
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,530
Yeah! Real Al-chan, so awesome! So cute! Be my sister!

288
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,980
Quiet down, you idiot!

289
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,080
Dammit, every single time, you!

290
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,620
Why are you here?

291
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,750
And what's with your hair?

292
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,120
I've got my reasons.

293
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,250
We can talk later.

294
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,920
For now, hide your face with that.

295
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,380
You don't want your school friends to know about this.

296
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,420
Is someone here?

297
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,430
Someone you know is participating.

298
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,680
Explain yourself later.

299
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,190
99 points! Did she win it already?

300
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,410
Hey, who's this person I know?

301
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,490
Did they go on already?

302
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,790
No, you should be able to tell once she comes out.

303
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,590
Now then, entry 21, Kanakana-chan, come on out!

304
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,920
Okay!

305
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,430
Stardust Witch Meruru!

306
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,560
Starts now!

307
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,990
Meerumerumeru merumerumerume

308
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,870

Majiikaru jetto de teeki wo utsuu

312
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,190
shooting at the enemies with the Magical Jet

313
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,460
What the hell?

314
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:40,660
Mahou no kuni kara chikyuu no tame ni ochite yuku nagareete

315
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:40,660
For the Earth, I've fell from the Land of Magic

316
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,250
She is crazy good at singing!

317
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,260
Wait, how does she know this song?

318
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,760
So cute!

319
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
What is this? What is this?

320
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,410
Konnichi wa hoshikuzu uicchi Meruru

321
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,410
Hello, I am Stardust Witch Meruru

322
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,560
CG? An illusion? Is she 3D? 3D?!

323
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,680
Calm down!

324
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,600
Oh crap. I've got a nosebleed!

325
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,240
Shooting Star

326
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,730
Hey, isn't that a bit embarrassing for a girl?

327
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,910
Shooting Star

328
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,210

Thank you, everyone!

341
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,700
There we have it! 100 points!

342
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,200
Kanakana-chan got a full 100 points!

343
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,250
Wow, she's amazing.

344
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,250
Hey, so...

345
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,960
When does this person I know come on?

346
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,920
See? Just like I said.

347
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,640
It wasn't just because she's the spitting image.

348
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,020
Right? Kanako's amazing, you know?

349
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,400
Man, this sucks.

350
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,610
What's with those gross otaku freaks?

351
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,610
Like I'd even think of coming within a hundred feet of them.

352
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,990
Ka-Kanakana-chan, you can't say something like that...

353
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,620
They all cheered for you...

354
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,220
Me-Meruru turned into a dark witch!

355
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,760
Gross! Shut up, brat.

356
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,520
Hey! Don't make little kids like that cry!

357
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,270
So, what did you think about my performance?

358
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,860
Oh right, how did you know that song?

359
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,900
Did you know about this anime?

360
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,990
Nope.

361
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,820
But I do idol auditions regularly.

362
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,910
I practice at karaoke places too.

363
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,620
I can remember a song like that after hearing it once.

364
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,670
Amazing, right?

365
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,420
Amazing, sure.

366
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,340
But...

367
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
What?

368
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,880
You looked like you were having fun singing it. Was that an act?

369
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,180
Were you just acting like it and making fun of the fans inside?

370
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,930
Well...

371
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,770
It was fun.

372
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,690
I like it when people call me cute.

373
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:47,860
I think that "moe" stuff is stupid, but I like the feeling of being worshipped when they go crazy over my singing and dancing.

374
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,570
I see...

375
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,950
You might make a good idol.

376
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,210
Of course!

377
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,880
Here.

378
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,630
Thank you so much!

379
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,050
She's late!

380
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,970
When do I get my clothes?!

381
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,890
Ayase!!

382
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,330
