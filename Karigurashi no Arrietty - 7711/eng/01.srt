1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,140
<i>I'll never forget that summer.</i>

2
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,730
<i>I spent a week in the old house</i>
<i>where my mother grew up.</i>

3
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,130
Almost there. Feeling all right?

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,380
Yes.

5
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,620
Haru... how many times have I told her?

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,210
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

7
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,640
Haru!

8
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,260
You're blocking the driveway again.

9
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,560
Sho?

10
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,400
Where are you?

11
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,640
Don't touch!

12
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,770
These aren't for you.

13
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,080
-Arrietty!
-What?

14
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,130
You went outside again, didn't you?

15
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,920
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.

16
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,630
It's my own little garden.

17
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,640
If you ask me, it looks like a mess.

18
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,890
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

19
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,030
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early.

20
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,160
Enough for a whole year.

21
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,870
But the bay tree's so far away.

22
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
If a human being saw you...

23
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm always careful.

24
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,960
The world is full of dangerous creatures.

25
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,300
Your great uncle...

26
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,930
...was eaten by a frog. Right?

27
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,890
Doesn't that shiso smell lovely?

28
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,010
Yes, it does.

29
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,560
With a bit of sugar
I could make shiso juice.

30
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,190
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

31
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,200
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.

32
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,160
Papa's home.

33
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,460
Welcome back.

34
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,800
-Papa, about tonight...
-There's a boy in the house.

35
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,800
I saw him.

36
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,840
-No! Arrietty...
-He didn't see me!

37
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,220
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

38
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,940
I won't hear of it. It's too dangerous.

39
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,560
But he's just a child!

40
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,190
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

41
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,320
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

42
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,570
I'll be fine!

43
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,660
Youngsters go to bed early.

44
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,210
Thank you Papa!

45
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,040
But Pod...

46
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,500
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

47
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,590
But still...

48
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,380
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

49
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,100
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

50
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,230
Someday she'll have to
survive without our help.

51
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,610
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

52
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,930
Whatever you need, just ask Haru.

53
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,010
All right.

54
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,050
Haru, I'm depending on you.

55
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,140
Yes ma'am.

56
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,440
Let's shut the screen. Keep the bugs out.

57
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,740
Oh?

58
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,910
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

59
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,080
I already decided!

60
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,830
I hope you can borrow some tissue paper.

61
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,710
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

62
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,840
We could have shiso juice
and sugar for the tea.

63
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,180
But anything's just fine.

64
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,060
We'll be back soon.

65
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,180
-Please be careful.
-We will.

66
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,430
Arrietty!

67
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,610
Sorry!

68
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,280
-Hold these for me.
-Yes, Papa.

69
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,190
Hold on tight!

70
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
Arrietty?

71
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,490
-Ready?
-Yes.

72
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,540
Everything's so huge!

73
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,960
The world of human beings.

74
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,080
The sugar's over there.

75
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,760
Wait for me down there.

76
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,140
Papa, you're great!

77
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,680
Now let's get that tissue.

78
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,080
Papa, look.

79
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,920
Your first borrowing.

80
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,790
Be careful, it's sharp.

81
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,960
I will!

82
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,530
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

83
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,490
Look down there.

84
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,040
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

85
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm not afraid.

86
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,420
I'm ready for anything. I've got this!

87
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,430
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.

88
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,600
What is this place?

89
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,650
Human beings made it for their dolls.

90
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,280
It's just perfect for us!

91
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

92
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,660
These things aren't for borrowing.

93
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,710
If anything went missing
they'd know right away.

94
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,960
Oh...

95
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,060
Don't be afraid.

96
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,620
I saw you.

97
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,670
In the garden. It was you, wasn't it?

98
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,930
My mother told me about you.

99
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,810
She saw little people here
when she was young.

100
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,270
Was it you that she saw?

101
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,070
Was it?

102
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,740
I'm sorry, Papa.

103
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,330
He saw me today, out in the garden.

104
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,330
I should've been more careful.

105
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,880
I hope he didn't frighten you.

106
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,050
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

107
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,720
All right.

108
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,850
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

109
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,030
We're home.

110
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,080
Safe and sound.

111
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,510
And...?

112
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,470
Things didn't go well this time.

113
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,680
This light gave out before we finished.

114
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,020
Oh dear.

115
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,600
We had to give up on the sugar.

116
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,730
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

117
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,030
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

118
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,000
What a pretty pin.

119
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,090
Time for bed.

120
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,930
Good night.

121
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,190
She looks worn out.

122
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,980
Shall I make some tea?

123
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,840
Sho!

124
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,760
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

125
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,480
A cube of sugar? But whatever for?

126
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,270
He left it by the grating.

127
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,650
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

128
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,440
What?

129
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,200
What do you mean, you dropped it?

130
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,330
Don't touch it. Do you understand?

131
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,380
It's a trap.

132
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,750
They're trying to catch us!

133
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,510
We'll have to stop borrowing for a while.

134
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,510
Maybe they already know where we are.

135
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,390
Pod, we'll have to move!

136
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,270
This was such a lovely house.

137
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,690
Now we'll have to start all over again.

138
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,400
Well, let's see how things go.

139
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,650
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

140
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,910
Why did it have to be sugar?

141
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,390
Thank you Arrietty.

142
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,390
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

143
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,310
You know I love doing laundry.

144
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,780
-I'm going to nap for a bit.
-All right.

145
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,410
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING

146
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,410
You came back.

147
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,250
Wait, don't go.

148
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,380
Please leave us alone.

149
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,010
I wanted to tell you that.

150
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,380
I want to talk to you.

151
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,050
Human beings are dangerous.

152
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,230
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

153
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,440
You have a family? I envy you.

154
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,690
Don't you have one?

155
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,150
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

156
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,780
Mother's so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

157
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,080
Really...

158
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,920
My name's Sho. What's your name?

159
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,670
Do you have one?

160
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,130
Of course I have a name!

161
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,930
It's Arrietty.

162
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,890
Arrietty... Arrietty...

163
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,930
That's pretty.

164
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,700
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

165
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,170
Just a peek. Please?

166
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,310
What's happening? Oh my gosh, it's a crow!

167
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,570
You can't come in here!

168
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,670
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

169
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,510
Maybe it's nesting season or something.

170
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,560
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

171
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,720
Are you all right?

172
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,900
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

173
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,980
Thanks, Haru.

174
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,730
I feel fine.

175
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,780
The nesting season, eh?

176
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,800
Have yourself a nice long rest now.

177
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,020
Papa...

178
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,110
-I told you to stay away.
-I'm sorry.

179
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,070
I wanted to do something to help.

180
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,790
But he didn't see me.

181
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,120
You put your family in danger.

182
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,250
I won't say it again. Understand?

183
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,750
Yes.

184
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,810
We'd better start looking.

185
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,770
It's time.

186
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,280
Pod...

187
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,250
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING

188
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,310
Afternoon! Package for you.

189
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,780
Thanks again ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.

190
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,950
Listen, know any good
pest control companies?

191
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,610
Pest control?

192
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,040
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

193
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,500
Squeaky Klean Service?
Let me just write that down.

194
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,840
Having problems with mice?

195
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,630
Maybe it's mice,
or maybe it's something else.

196
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,760
Between us, it's little people.

197
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,350
I've seen them myself.

198
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,190
A crow tried to fly into your room?

199
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,320
I hope it didn't scare you.

200
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,950
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

201
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,500
I was so astonished!

202
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,660
I never saw such a huge...

203
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,380
Excitement's the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

204
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,460
He came here for peace and quiet.

205
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,550
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

206
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,640
I know, I know.

207
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,220
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

208
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,390
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

209
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,400
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

210
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,900
I don't mind.

211
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,400
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped.

212
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,160
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?

213
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,880
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little house in my room?

214
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,510
It's amazing.

215
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,930
You mean the doll house?

216
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,100
That doll house belongs to your mother.

217
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,600
She left it here when she moved out.

218
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,680
It was hers?

219
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,400
My father had it made to order in England.

220
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,770
It was for the little people.

221
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,610
My father claimed he'd seen them.

222
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,360
He waited for so many years.

223
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,660
He always said that house
was a present for them.

224
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,960
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

225
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,880
Not in my father's lifetime, nor in mine.

226
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,010
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

227
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,640
Unfortunately... no.

228
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,140
It's been in our family
for four generations.

229
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:32,270
If you like it, it will be yours someday.

230
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,060
You mean it?

231
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,480
Yes.

232
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,570
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!

233
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,790
-Haru, could you turn off the lights?
-Yes'm.

234
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,260
This is the living room.

235
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,430
All the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker.

236
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,060
Isn't it wonderful?

237
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,570
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

238
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,570
But the next room is my personal favorite.

239
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,570
Haru, could you open that up?

240
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,490
Let's see, I think it opens this way.

241
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,830
Everything is so detailed!

242
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,380
Detailed and just like the real thing.

243
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,590
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

244
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,090
Beautiful, just beautiful.

245
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,800
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

246
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,720
And it's been so long...

247
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,140
Maybe the little people are gone now.

248
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,750
Mother, we've had
these pictures three years.

249
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,960
Don't you want new ones?

250
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,210
I love those pictures.

251
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,170
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

252
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,510
Besides, there's no point
changing them now.

253
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,720
Papa's later than usual.

254
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,640
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

255
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,400
-Papa?
-That's the back door.

256
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,570
Papa! Welcome back...

257
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,660
Twisted my leg.

258
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,830
It's lucky Spiller found me.

259
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,340
Pod?

260
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:10,920
Oh dear, you're hurt! Hurry, bring him in.

261
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,600
Does it hurt?

262
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,970
It's not broken. I'll be fine in no time.

263
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,180
I'll get some cold water.

264
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,860
Here's a towel, better dry off.

265
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,070
Who's this?

266
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,450
It's not just the three of us after all.

267
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,460
Gotta go.

268
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,460
Wait, at least stay and have some tea.

269
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,890
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

270
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,850
Okay.

271
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:07,060
Thank you Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

272
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,940
We're so grateful for your help.

273
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,620
Listen, have you seen other Borrowers?

274
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,450
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

275
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,210
This many.

276
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,040
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

277
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,590
Can I see your bow?

278
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,850
You use this for hunting.

279
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,860
Give that back. It's not a toy.

280
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,830
Gotta go.

281
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,960
Won't you stay and have a bite?

282
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,970
Got this.

283
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,180
A cricket's leg!

284
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,270
Want some? It's real good.

285
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,180
No thanks!

286
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,900
Take care.

287
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,030
Thanks again.

288
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,360
I'll see him out.

289
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,460
You were looking for a new place.

290
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,880
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

291
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,260
Really...

292
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,010
His territory reaches past the river.

293
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,760
And he knows a few places we could live.

294
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,390
That's good I suppose.

295
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,150
I'd hate to camp out.

296
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,650
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

297
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,910
I'm glad there are still others like us.

298
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,990
Do you have friends and family, Spiller?

299
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,370
Family? No, just me.

300
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,830
Well, I hope you can come again.

301
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,920
My mother's stew is the best in the world.

302
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,450
Haru?

303
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,470
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

304
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,010
Pull it apart and do it again.

305
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,730
Why do we need such a big sack anyway?

306
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,940
I'm going to look in on Papa.

307
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,950
Papa, can I come in?

308
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,330
How's your leg?

309
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,540
I'll be walking soon.

310
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,040
Papa?

311
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,130
Are we going to move?

312
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:43,880
We were seen. We've no choice but to move.

313
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,430
I don't think every
human being is dangerous.

314
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,140
Arrietty...

315
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:59,060
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

316
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,570
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

317
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,440
The other one moved away.

318
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,820
They were seen by humans.

319
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,950
No matter what happens,
we've got to survive.

320
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,830
Papa...

321
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,060
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

322
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,710
Mother!

323
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,920
It won't open.

324
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,090
The frame's buckled.

325
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,950
The... the wall!

326
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,360
Homily!

327
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,660
Homily!

328
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,040
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

329
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,350
This again?

330
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,810
Gather only the things we need.

331
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,280
We can't carry all that.

332
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:40,160
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house.

333
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,160
I'll make sure it's safe.

334
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,330
-Stay with your mother.
-Yes, Papa.

335
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,330
You finally came.

336
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,090
Do you like your new kitchen?

337
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,130
Our house is a disaster.

338
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,470
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

339
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,940
Can I look?

340
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:15,800
You're beautiful.

341
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,140
We have to move.

342
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,060
We were seen.

343
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,600
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

344
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,390
Borrowers...?

345
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,310
We borrow from human beings.

346
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,690
Things we need. Things they won't miss.

347
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,950
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

348
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:42,660
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.

349
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,120
No one ever saw them?

350
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,250
Probably.

351
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,210
It's all my fault.

352
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,170
Niya, don't be like that. Be nice to her.

353
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:03,800
Are there other little people
like you in the house?

354
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,970
No, it's just my father and mother and me.

355
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,930
What about in other houses?

356
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,150
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

357
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,820
Oh.

358
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,610
Soon you'll be the only one left.

359
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,700
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

360
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,790
You're a doomed species, you know.

361
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,620
That's not true!

362
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
There's lots more of us. Spiller said so!

363
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:37,800
Spiller?

364
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,880
He's one of us.

365
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,090
And he said there's lots more.

366
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:49,430
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

367
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,520
There are 6.7 billion of us.

368
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,520
Six point seven billion...?

369
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,650
What about you?

370
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,860
I don't know.

371
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,160
There's probably just a few of you.

372
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,410
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

373
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,170
Lots of species are already extinct.

374
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,790
I've only seen them in books, though.

375
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,590
So many beautiful species...

376
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:24,760
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

377
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:30,140
It's sad, but that's what fate
has in store for your kind.

378
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,390
Fate, you say?

379
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:38,820
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

380
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,940
We have to survive. That's what Papa said.

381
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,820
So we're leaving,
even though it's dangerous.

382
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,370
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

383
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,750
We're not going to die out that easily!

384
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,500
I'm sorry. You're right.

385
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,760
I'm the one who's going to die.

386
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,810
It's my heart.

387
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,100
They're going to operate next week,
but it's probably hopeless.

388
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,560
Your heart...?

389
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,190
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

390
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,610
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

391
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,870
I can't even do that.

392
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,950
I hope you can forgive me.

393
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,330
I didn't know you were so sick.

394
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,360
What in the world is this doing here?

395
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,410
What?

396
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,430
It's the kitchen from the doll house!

397
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,660
Found you!

398
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:00,410
What's wrong?

399
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:04,340
My mother... I heard her voice.

400
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,490
This really is a great kitchen.

401
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,160
You're not the only
little one here, I bet.

402
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:05,860
I have to go.

403
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,480
Help!

404
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,200
Help!

405
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,160
Let me out! Help me!

406
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:24,980
There we go.

407
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,650
Please, let me out!

408
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:30,690
Please!

409
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,390
The ceiling's tilted.

410
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,110
<i>Hello?</i>

411
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:37,400
-Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?
-<i>Yes.</i>

412
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,030
-I have an emergency.
<i>-For extermination?</i>

413
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,860
There's something small
in the house. No, not mice.

414
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,370
<i>Not mice?</i>

415
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,120
I don't want them killed.

416
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,290
<i>You need trapping services?</i>

417
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:51,330
Yes, that's it. I want you to trap them.

418
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:05,430
Sho! Sho!

419
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,930
Arrietty!

420
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,020
Mother's gone!

421
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,110
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!

422
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,580
Momma...

423
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,210
We'll find her.

424
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,370
What?

425
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,920
It's locked.

426
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:23,090
Let's try the room next door.

427
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,240
Can't budge it.

428
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,490
Wait!

429
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:56,910
I can fit.

430
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,450
Amazing!

431
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,490
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

432
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,830
There's a dirt road. Turn in there.

433
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:19,120
-<i>Before the bridge?</i>
-No, not that one!

434
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:28,960
Haru opened this.

435
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,680
Then she must've taken Mother someplace.

436
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,630
Are you okay?

437
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,560
What's taking them so long?

438
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,060
Mother! Where are you?

439
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,160
But the lock...

440
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,030
Lock?

441
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,580
Could I have some hot milk?

442
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,670
Okay, wait just a minute.

443
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,340
Thanks.

444
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,800
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

445
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,520
Mother!

446
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,440
Mother!

447
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,490
-Mother?
-Arrietty!

448
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,960
Here I am, Arrietty!

449
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,420
Mother!

450
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:57,090
Arrietty!

451
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,450
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

452
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,940
Another human being!

453
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,440
It's all right, Mother.

454
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,220
We'd like to take a look around first.

455
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,470
Take your time.

456
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:50,200
SQUEAKY KLEAN SERVICE

457
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,540
Now who can this be?

458
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,870
-Don't be too rough.
-Haru?

459
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,420
-Haru!
-Yes?

460
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,130
What's going on here?

461
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,220
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!

462
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,430
Little people?

463
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,180
That's right.

464
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,430
And what little thieves they are!

465
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,610
<i>It's really true.</i>

466
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,120
They steal from all over the house.

467
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,620
That's why things were going missing.

468
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:39,330
Haru, what's gotten into you?

469
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,960
<i>All these years I thought</i>
<i>it was my imagination.</i>

470
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,720
<i>Well, it wasn't.</i>

471
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:49,220
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

472
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:53,470
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

473
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,480
You'll believe me when you see this.

474
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,440
This is their nest.

475
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,570
Nest?

476
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:12,580
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.

477
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,750
What? I swear I saw it.

478
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:23,340
Haru, I'm sending the exterminators away.

479
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,880
Now, wait just a minute.

480
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,130
The doll house!

481
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:40,100
Young Master? May we come in for a minute?

482
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,060
<i>All right.</i>

483
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,950
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.

484
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,460
You'll see, it's gone.

485
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,340
It's not gone.

486
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,630
Such a pleasure to look at.

487
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:24,860
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

488
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,860
I wonder what's gotten into Haru.

489
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,160
Hmm?

490
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:36,830
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

491
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,890
Someone was making tea!

492
01:20:56,010 --> 01:21:00,180
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

493
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,690
Yes, there are.

494
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,440
So Haru really saw them.

495
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,190
Though she accused them of stealing.

496
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,570
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

497
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,200
I mean, I wish I could see them.

498
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,710
I bet they're here somewhere.

499
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,170
I'm sure they are.

500
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,610
<i>Excuse me, ma'am!</i>

501
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,400
Where'd you like us to start?

502
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,910
Are you all right?

503
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,620
It got away.

504
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,250
I had one and it got away!

505
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:11,300
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

506
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:14,840
Next time I swear I'll get them!

507
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:33,820
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

508
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:38,280
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.

509
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:44,750
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

510
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,100
Let's hurry.

511
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,020
I can't do it...

512
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,340
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

513
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,420
What?

514
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,010
I'm so sorry.

515
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:45,720
It's my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

516
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,310
That's in the past.

517
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:56,530
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

518
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,450
I'm going outside for a bit.

519
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,870
Don't go too far, now.

520
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,620
Niya!

521
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,100
Niya...

522
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,580
Just a little further.

523
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,020
Spiller!

524
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,420
That's everything.

525
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,880
Now let's get moving.

526
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,340
Okay.

527
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:09,010
Mother, are you all right?

528
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,520
Arrietty!

529
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,220
Sho!

530
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,480
Arrietty...

531
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,960
We're leaving now.

532
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,590
I'm glad I made it.

533
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,800
Niya showed me the way.

534
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,270
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

535
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,070
I brought this.

536
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:01,290
I hope you'll accept it this time.

537
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,590
Thank you.

538
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,270
I have to go.

539
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,650
When is your operation?

540
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,690
The day after tomorrow.

541
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:34,490
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

542
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,870
For luck.

543
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:51,210
Thanks.

544
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,600
You protected me after all.

545
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:04,270
Arrietty...

546
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:09,650
I hope you have the best life ever.

547
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,900
Goodbye.

548
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:22,410
Arrietty, you're a part of me now.

549
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,790
I'll never forget you, ever.

550
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:46,980
<i>I'm fourteen years old, I'm pretty</i>

551
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:52,780
<i>A light-hearted little lady</i>

552
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,570
<i>For a long time, under the floor</i>

553
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:05,120
<i>I've been living as a Borrower</i>

554
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:12,880
<i>Sometimes I'm happy</i>
<i>Sometimes I'm blue</i>

555
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:17,260
<i>I'd love to meet somebody</i>

556
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,840
<i>I want to feel the wind in my hair</i>

557
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:23,140
<i>And to gaze at the sky</i>

558
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:27,640
<i>I want to bring you a flower</i>

559
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:31,270
<i>It's a different world out there</i>

560
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,110
<i>Look, butterflies are dancing</i>

561
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:38,610
<i>Waiting for me</i>

562
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:44,080
<i>Yes, nothing ever changes</i>

563
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:50,120
<i>In my little world</i>

564
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:57,470
<i>It's not that I hate it</i>
<i>But I want to know</i>

565
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,640
<i>More and more about you</i>

566
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:09,020
<i>My happiness and sadness always</i>

567
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:13,060
<i>Get mixed up with each other</i>

568
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,860
<i>I want to feel the wind in my hair</i>

569
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,900
<i>And to gaze at the sky</i>

570
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,160
<i>I want to bring you a flower</i>

571
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:26,540
<i>It's a different world out there</i>

572
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:30,080
<i>Look, butterflies are dancing</i>

573
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:34,380
<i>Waiting for you</i>

574
01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:00,440
<i>Under the sun</i>

575
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:03,450
<i>And surrounded by flowers</i>

576
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:07,910
<i>I want to spend the days with you</i>

577
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,710
<i>With these memories in my heart</i>

578
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,830
<i>I'll live my own way</i>

579
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,210
<i>In a new world</i>

580
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:05,840
THE END
