Sensei, could I...

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,230
Yes?

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,350
Kobuchizawa.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,450
From my grandma?

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,720
Yes, please return home at once.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,600
Did something happen to my grandma?

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,280
Well...

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,370
<i>It was almost like a dream.</i>

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,800
<i>"Oh. I'm not waking up.</i>

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,030
<i>Why aren't I waking up?" I thought.</i>

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,810
<i>That feeling never ended.</i>

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,820
<i>It still hasn't ended.</i>

For three weeks?

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,110
It's not too far, but we can't 
get there via helicopter.

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,030
You mean...

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,120
...we take the snowcat?

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,180
Righto!

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,870
Yeah!

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,480
We finally get to take one!

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,460
It's not particularly fun.

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,910
They're very slow!

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,050
We have to avoid crevasses and 
other dangerous places as we go.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,690
We'll be going one way, then 
have to alter course a bit...

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,510
Kanae.

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,260
I meant to do that! Totally meant to do that!

30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,820
You're the one always complaining about 
how annoying long hair is, aren't you?

31
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:30,270
Please make sure to turn
the tap off after doing laundry.

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,610
Well, it's better than when Takako 
used to cut it, at least...

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,610
What about you?

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Can I?

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,910
Of course! That's why we're inviting you.

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,450
Could you give me time to think about it?

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,950
Understood.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,920
I thought she'd be jumping at the chance...

39
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,330
The hole in the ozone layer was 
discovered during an expedition here,

40
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,480
and they were the first in
the world to report it.

41
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,020
These weather balloons 
are released twice a day,

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,490
simultaneously, at places all over the world.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,740
Three, two, one. Release!

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,250
Shirase-san didn't come, did she?

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,430
She probably needs time 
to be alone and think.

46
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,260
She hasn't had much to say since 
the captain made the offer...

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,020
It's here.

48
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,770
This is the point where 
we lost communication.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,510
Right...

56
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,660
Here you are!

57
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,120
They're nice and cold!

58
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,120
That's nice of you.

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,270
Thanks!

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,120
What's the matter?

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,100
Nothing! We finished our 
recording, so I thought...

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,520
Hey! It's pretty warm today, huh?

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,900
Is it? It seems a bit chilly 
for the middle of summer...

65
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah, I guess...

66
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,490
They launched a weather balloon earlier!

67
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,680
Could you see it from here?

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,430
Yeah.

69
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,340
I hear today's pick-me-up is anpan!

70
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,280
What is it?

71
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,050
N-Nothing...

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,850
It's just... you know...

73
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,750
How to put it...

74
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,750
What now?!

75
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,010
That's my line.

About my mother?

83
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,160
Kimari, your lack of planning is making 
this more complicated than it should be.

84
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,170
Why did you even say you'd go talk to her?

85
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,490
Because...

86
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,650
Sorry.

87
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm not particularly depressed 
or stressed out about it.

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,860
I actually feel pretty normal, I guess...

89
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,280
Maybe... too normal, I guess?

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,700
Normal?

91
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,620
I was convinced that when I arrived 
in Antarctica, I would start crying.

A Place Further
Than the Universe
Kobuchizawa Takako

93
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,370
"These are the same sights my mother saw."

94
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,520
"My mother was so moved by these sights."

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,290
"This place is so wonderful, 
it's no wonder she wanted to come."

96
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,840
I thought that's what I'd be thinking.

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,680
But that wasn't what I 
ended up thinking at all.

98
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,220
The most I could muster was 
"Wow, it's just like in the pictures."

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,610
Is that why the first thing you said 
when we got here was "in your face"?

100
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,190
It was?

101
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,360
You don't remember?

102
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,490
But you came here because your 
mother was waiting, didn't you?

103
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,080
You wanted to come here because 
your mother was here, right?

104
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,250
Yeah.

105
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,340
That's why you asked Kanae-san over and over,

106
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,470
took all those jobs, 
worked so hard to get here...

107
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,630
I know that.

108
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,010
You said that your mother 
was waiting for you here!

109
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,860
Kimari.

110
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,200
That's not a nice thing 
to say to Shirase-san...

111
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,480
I know all that.

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,110
It's like, why did I even come this far, then?

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,410
But...

114
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,400
But?

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,010
But... once we get there, 
there's nowhere left to go.

116
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,910
It'll be all over.

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,160
If I go, and nothing changes, I think...

118
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm going to spend the rest of 
my life feeling the way I do now.

119
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,550
So, before we head inland,

120
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,260
I'd like to talk for about thirty minutes 
about the civilian research projects

121
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,430
that will follow Challenge For Antarctic.

122
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm freezing to death.

123
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,300
The beer's icing over.

124
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm kidding.

125
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,590
We just have a few simple words to say.

126
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,180
Gin-chan?

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,310
Let's go.

128
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,510
Cheers!

129
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,070
Cheers!

130
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,280
Okay, this one's cooked!

131
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,070
Cold!

132
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,530
If you don't gobble it up fast, 
it'll go cold in no time!

133
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,730
No time to lose!

134
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,120
That's the thrill of the Antarctic barbecue.

135
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,010
I dropped my marshmallow!

136
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,210
You got it too close.

137
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,860
By the way, I heard... 
Kobuchizawa-san's unsure she'll go?

138
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,150
I suppose...

139
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,120
Are you sure you don't want 
to say anything to her?

140
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,830
"To act is not necessarily compassion.

141
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,980
True compassion sometimes 
comes from inaction!"

142
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,170
More nonsense...

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,220
But that's basically what we decided.

144
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,730
I envy you guys.

145
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,120
The ability to give each other space 
is the proof that you're good friends.

146
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,610
What the hell are you doing?!

147
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,760
Did she say we were good friends?

148
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,120
Yeah.

149
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,050
We're good friends!

150
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,630
Aren't you going to go?

151
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,100
You should know by now that
I'm not good in party situations.

152
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,690
What do you think?

153
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,810
About what?

154
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,980
Mom.

155
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,820
If you have to ask me that, 
you probably shouldn't go.

156
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,910
I may not want to believe it, 
but the fact is that Takako is dead.

157
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,430
I can talk about dying wishes 
and what she would have wanted,

158
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,500
but none of us know if that's how she really 
felt, if it's what she really wanted.

159
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,250
Then why did you come to Antarctica again?

160
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,610
Because I wanted to come.

161
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,120
Because I latched on to the 
idea that Takako wanted me to.

162
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,370
At the end of the day, those ideas we 
latch on to aren't enough to motivate us.

163
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,590
But when we run around on 
the injustices of reality,

164
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,770
they're the only things 
that can break through,

165
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,350
make the impossible possible, 
and allow us to proceed on.

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,850
That's what I believe.

167
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,790
You're saying I shouldn't 
leave it to anyone else?

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,390
That's right. But...

169
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,660
That's how you've always 
done things, isn't it?

170
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,900

I know that!

176
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,960
I know I'm being unreasonable!

177
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,210

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,040
Factory.

182
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,120
Factory.

183
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,860
Cashier.

184
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,920
Delivery.

185
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,850
But... I really want to go.

186
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,300
Cashier.

187
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,070
Because... my mother is waiting there.

188
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,830
Amazing!

189
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,840
Right? They said it's hand-drawn.

190
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,620
Apparently we're taking 
this on the trip inland!

191
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,210
Really?

192
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,790
Good luck!!
Inland Exploration Squad!!

193
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,750
Team Girls

194
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,470
Is that your luggage?

195
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,420
Yeah!

196
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,070
Too much. Halve it. You have five minutes.

197
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,970
No way!

198
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,730
Good morning.

199
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,900
Good morning.

200
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,200
<i>And so, our final journey began.</i>

201
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
<i>14,000 kilometers from Japan.</i>

202
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,420
<i>To that place further than 
the reaches of the universe.</i>

203
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,400
<i>The place that seemed out of reach.</i>

204
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,550
I thought we were taking the snowcat...

205
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,340
That's S-16, the departure point 
for the inland expedition.

206
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,850
Today's mission is loading materials 
onto the snowcats stationed there.

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,330
Hup.

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,590
So cold!

209
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,190
It's going to be a lot colder here 
than it was at Syowa Station, yeah.

210
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,070
This scenery is more like how 
you imagine Antarctica, right?

211
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,470
It really is...

212
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,220
Slow, isn't it?

213
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,230
Well, have you got two sevens?

214
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,730
Two sevens.

215
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,240
Okay.

216
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,110
You had them?

217
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,980
Have some sympathy for person 
who's lost three times straight...

218
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,170
<i>114 here. We've passed through S-18.</i>

219
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,780
112 here. Roger.

220
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,220
What's going on?

221
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,920
It's time to work.

222
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,630
We'll be going outside, so get ready.

223
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,210
Ouch! Just breathing hurts my chest!

224
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,310
I've lost all feeling in my nose!

225
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,690
It's going to get colder as we get higher up.

226
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,900
Think I can manage it?

227
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,500
You brought that?

228
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,560
Here.

229
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,570
Thank you very much!

230
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,160
I can't feel anything!

231
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,620
Eat fast or it'll get cold!

232
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,970
We're turning off the 
engines at night, right?

233
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,830
Yeah, we don't have enough 
fuel to keep it running.

234
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,290
<i>Syowa here. Syowa here.</i>

235
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,240
<i>Inland team, do you read? Over.</i>

236
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,420
It's a regular check-in.

237
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,370
Practice it.

238
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,590
Because none of us knows what's 
going to happen out there.

239
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,220
It's going to get very windy tonight,

240
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,100
so when moving between cars, 
make sure to use this rope.

241
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,220
Don't assume you'll be fine 
because it's just a few meters.

242
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,110
If you end up out in a blizzard, 
you're never making it back.

243
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,950
What's that?

244
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,860
What?

245
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,120
It's the sun... right?

246
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,610
Looks kind of apocalyptic, huh?

247
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,770
It's called a "sun pillar."

248
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,630
It's an optical illusion 
caused by ice crystals.

249
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,700
Did my mother see this, too?

250
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,280
Yes, she did.

251
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,260
You could say she gazed 
at it as she slept there.

252
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,780
It's here.

253
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,160
What, a blizzard?

254
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,560
There's no question.

255
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Don't worry.

256
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,500
As long as we stay in here...

257
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,370
I can't see anything!

258
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,000
Neither can I!

259
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,880
I see. This is your first 
time seeing a real one?

260
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,440
Yes...

261
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,640
Was it like this when my mother went missing?

262
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,690
We think she left something 
at the inland station,

263
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,780
or maybe she slipped...

264
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,330
Takako?

265
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,490
The next thing I knew, she was gone.

266
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,060
And moments later, a blizzard was raging.

267
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,030
<i>It's beautiful...</i>

268
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,300
Takako!

269
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,290
<i>It's so...</i>

270
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,650
<i>very beautiful.</i>

271
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,980
Shirase-chan.

272
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,650
Are you okay?

273
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
You can't sleep?

274
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,580
No... I'd been asleep, but I just woke up.

275
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,620
Do you like Antarctica, Kimari?

276
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,870
Yeah, I really like it.

277
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,150
I see.

278
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,570
But I'm not sure if I would have 
liked it if I were here by myself.

279
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,760
Really?

280
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,220
It's because I'm here with you guys.

281
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,920
As long as I was with you guys, I'd probably 
feel the same way about the Arctic.

282
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,030
Hey, Shirase-chan...

283
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,440
Thanks for taking me.

284
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,230
Thanks to you, I got the 
most out of my youth.

285
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,270
<i>Dear Mom.</i>

286
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,590
<i>I've made friends.</i>

287
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,500
<i>I, who thought I'd be fine by 
myself forever, now have friends.</i>

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>They're all a little weird,</i>

289
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,010
<i>a little frustrating,</i>

290
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,110
<i>a little broken...</i>

291
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,400
<i>But I have friends who were willing 
to travel to Antarctica with me.</i>

292
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,320
<i>We fought, we cried,</i>

293
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,520
<i>we had problems...</i>

294
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,230
<i>But they were willing to 
travel this far with me,</i>

295
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,690
<i>to this place where you were...</i>

296
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,190
<i>I was able to come this far because of them.</i>

297
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,040
<i>Mom,</i>

298
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,440
<i>what can you see from where you are?</i>

299
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,040
<i>Will I be able to see the 
same sights that you saw?</i>

300
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,500
<i>I'm going to be there soon...</i>

301
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,430
<i>the place where you are.</i>

Challenge For Antarctic 1st Team Observatory Site

303
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,810
It's been a while, huh?

304
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,000
Sorry for the wait.

305
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,610
Though we're going to keep you 
waiting a while yet, still...

306
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,780
Is this okay like this?

307
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,620
Of course it's not.

308
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:31,380
Challenge For Antarctic 1st Team Observatory Site

309
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,830
We need to fix the foundation, 
build the building,

310
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,250
carry supplies piece by piece, 
create a telescope...

311
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,610
It's going to be a long time before the 
Kobuchizawa Observatory is finished...

312
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,880
But...

313
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,840
Kobuchizawa...

314
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,400
She's probably remembering...

315
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,900
seeing this with my mom...

316
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,720
Shirase...

317
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,710
We're not going to find any traces of my Mom.

318
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,140
It was three years ago.

319
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,870
You don't know that!

320
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,750
Yeah.

321
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,890
The fact that no one's been here for three 
years makes it more likely that we will!

322
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,460
It's okay! We're not going to find anything!

323
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,630
You can't give up!

324
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,250
Anything at all... even one single piece!

325
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,760
It's fine!

326
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,630
No, it's not!

327
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,130
You won't find anything!

328
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,510
How can you be sure?

329
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,510
It's okay.

330
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,870
Just making it here was enough.

331
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,900
I've accomplished my goal.

332
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,850
I made it to the place my mother was.

You've come this far, that's why...

338
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,670
Just one piece!

339
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,650
There has to be one piece of 
proof that your mother was here!
