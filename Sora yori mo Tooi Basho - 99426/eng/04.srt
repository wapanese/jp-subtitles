so if you're interested,
come see management.

<i>I say it over and over again.</i>

10
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,750
We're going to Antarctica!

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,330
She actually said Antarctica!

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,810
You don't care?

13
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,330
No.

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,330
It's not as if they'd believe 
me right now anyway.

15
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,590
I'll say it after I've really gone,

16
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,840
"In your face, in your face, in your face!"

17
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,380
You're kind of a jerk, you know.

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,550
I certainly am.

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,010
You mind?

20
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,870
Nope!

Always check the lower door before 
and after closing the freezer door

26
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,990
You're serious about this?

27
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,280
You need two days off for 
this "summer training,"

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,810
and then you'll be taking time 
off beginning in December?

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,600
Yes.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,130
What do your parents have to say?

31
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,670
We have their permission.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,750
I hereby grant permission as guardian of your student
(Kobuchizawa Shirase) for them to take the following time off:
(Student's Class) Year 2 Class 2 
(Student Name) Kobuchizawa Shirase
(Guardian Name) Kobuchizawa Koumi
To join the Civilian Antarctic Expedition 
"Challenge For Antarctic" team and...

33
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,340
Tamaki-san?

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,530
Um...

35
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,480
What do you think, Rin?

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,770
Seems pretty normal.

37
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,080
She didn't slam the refrigerator door,

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,730
and the rhythm of her 
chopping seems normal...

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,570
Okay!

40
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,480
Wait!

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,670
I'm suspicious. It's <i>too</i> normal.

42
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,570
Like it's all a front, to trick us...

43
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,910
Mari-chan.

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,830
Y-Yes?

45
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,330
I bought some bath salts. 
Could you take them to the bathroom?

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,830
Sure!

47
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,720

Limited Time

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,100
They started selling those recently.

52
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,100
<i>Does she already know?</i>

53
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,120
<i>No, it might just be a coincidence...</i>

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,220
<i>If I jump to conclusions, 
I might be digging my own grave.</i>

55
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,210
<i>But what if she knows?</i>

56
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,430
<i>If she does, then trying to hide 
it might make the situation worse!</i>

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,990
<i>Maybe I should be just come clean, and—</i>

58
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,160
Mari-chan.

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
Is something the matter?

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,290
Or is there something on your mind?

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,330
Antarctica, perhaps?

62
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,630
H-Hey, Mom!

63
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,970
The truth is, I've decided 
to take a trip this winter...

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,390
Oh, that's a done deal, is it?

65
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,800
I simply hadn't heard a <i>thing</i> about it!

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,770
Not until a neighbor told me today.

67
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,080
Gosh, was <i>I</i> embarrassed!

68
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,770
W-Well, I meant to tell you...

69
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,230
I hereby grant permission as guardian of your student
(Tamaki Mari) for them to take the following time off:
(Student's Class) Year 2 Class 3 
(Student Name) Tamaki Mari
(Guardian Name) Tamaki Yoko
To join the Civilian Antarctic Expedition 
"Challenge For Antarctic" team...

70
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,230
It was just an issue of t-t-timing, 
and we needed to be sure it was happening...

71
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,650
Who filled this in, now?

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,740
And who stamped it?

73
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,830
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,600
At least put down the weapon!

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,340
It's not a weapon. It's a cooking utensil.

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,880
Though I could use it to dish out <i>something</i> 
to a certain idiot daughter of mine...

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,060
That's a terrifying thing to say!

78
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,940
I'm ho—

79
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,270
Dad!

80
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,620
Dad! Dad!

81
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,270
Forgive me, my daughter...

82
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,770
Dad! Da—

Social Studies
Terminology

84
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,520
This is pretty much all on you, Kimari.

85
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,190
You don't have to sum it all up like that!

86
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,290
Now I can't go unless I pass every single test!

87
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,770
And even without that, I won't have any 
time to study during our training camp...

88
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,030
You're really taking time 
off next week, then?

89
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,780
Yeah, it's four days, including the weekend, 
so I'll be off through Tuesday.

90
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,040
Are you sure about all this?

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,200
I read that they're not even sure 
if the boat will leave the harbor.

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,500
Well, it's not like I can 
do anything about that...

93
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,270
I gotta get to my job!

94
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,380
Rough life, huh?

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
See you!

96
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,260
Don't overwork yourself, okay?

97
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,770
If you work too hard and it doesn't go 
through, you're really going to regret it.

98
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,270
Right. See you!

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,160
I request your assistance!

101
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,720
No dice.

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Why not?!

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,540
Look, going to school means 
you're taking classes, right?

104
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,180
That means you've got tons of time 
allotted every day just for learning.

105
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,240
If you still can't do it, you're probably 
just not putting in the work.

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,050
Academics aren't like sports. 
Anyone can pick this stuff up if they try.

107
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,920
She's right.

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
Traitor!

109
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,310
I'm not a traitor.

110
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,720
Hinata's right, that's all.

111
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,400
Fine, whatever. I'll ask Yuzuki-chan!

112
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,690
She's younger than you.

113
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,310
I'm outside the gate.

114
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,720
She's here, she says!

115
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,980
Good morning!

116
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,450
You seem different today...

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
I was at work last time. 
I had to dress that way.

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
You had to?

119
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,100
I just look awful in that 
cutesy stuff, anyway.

120
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,310
It's really not "me."

121
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,160
Really?

122
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,090
I thought you looked cute...

123
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,700
I can't stand that "Look at 
me, I'm a girly-girl!" junk.

124
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,840
Why's she in such a bad mood?

125
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,990
Well, her job being what it is,

126
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,700
she probably deals with 
some complicated stuff.

127
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,850
Is this the place?

128
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,700
Yeah, definitely.

129
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,360
Sorry I'm late!

130
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,240
Sorry that it wasn't
the easiest place to find.

131
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,620
Go on, get in.

132
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,120
Oh, don't worry, I'll tidy it up!

133
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,500
Sorry, sorry!

134
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,710
This isn't quite what I was expecting...

135
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,770
Not quite what you were expecting, huh?

136
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,710
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be.

137
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,560
An Antarctic expedition 
is a very big project.

138
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,190
Even if we are civilians, you wouldn't 
expect a junky old minivan.

139
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,940
How are we supposed to respond to that?

140
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,440
Like I'd know!

141
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,280
But I never thought you'd manage 
to end up coming with us.

142
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,340
What happened to your million yen?

143
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,750
I still have it.

144
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,870
You don't need it, do you?

145
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,880
As I'm sure you've read, 
we don't have any money.

146
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Do not
insert tape!
DANGER!

147
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,150
So we're doing a whole lot to raise 
the funds to get to Antarctica.

148
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,160
That also means we're trimming 
every bit of fat that we can.

149
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,470
We won't let it be canceled. Don't worry.

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,990
You are?

159
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,050
Any time one of those reports comes out,

160
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,360
the rest of the team and I 
all shout together...

161
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,050
"Shut up, idiots!"

162
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,700

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,330

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,190
Yes!

167
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,790
Feels nice out here!

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,690
"Internal documents... handle with care."

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,200
Construction of new station

179
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,200
Wow, a snowcat!

180
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,850
This is so exciting!

181
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,450
Discovery of large numbers of meteorites

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,450
The collection of meteorites across the world...

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,450
17,100 discovered. The world's largest collection of meteorites.
Among them, we've located nine Mars meteorites and nine Moon meteorites.
(Reference) America: 17,301 China: 9,826 Korea: 21 Other (including Europe): 869

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,450
How meteors accumulate in Antarctica

186
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,440
Based on that documentation,
I'll be giving you a condensed version

187
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,210
of the summer and winter 
training the others get.

188
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,960
Antarctica is the only continent in the 
world with no permanent inhabitants.

189
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,200
Unlike Japan,

Prydz Bay

199
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,650
it has many rules surrounding its use.

200
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,970
I want you to be sure to memorize them all.

201
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,770
Got it!

202
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,940
You're not like this in school...

203
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,480
You aren't in my class!

204
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,250
Well, let's meet the team captain!

205
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,820
I am this Antarctic expedition's 
captain, Todo Gin.

206
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,770
Captain...

207
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,830
It's a woman?

208
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm going to start by saying this:

209
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,320
Whether the members of my team are 
researchers or just accompanying us,

210
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,340
I will treat you all the same.

211
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,860
We have many things to accomplish.

212
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,690
Just because you're in high school doesn't 
mean I won't ask you to do everything,

213
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,520
from laundry to hard labor, as necessary.

214
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,320
Keep that in mind.

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,010
Yes ma'am!

216
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,390
The ABCs of Antarctic Expedition

217
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,390
A: Always follow procedure
B: Be alert at all times
C: Common sense!

218
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,390
These are the ABCs of 
an antarctic expedition.

219
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,020
A: Always follow procedure.

220
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,900
B: Be alert at all times.

221
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
C: Common sense.

222
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,440
I want you to keep these in mind at all time.

223
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,030
1. I want to live
2. I want to know
3. I want to keep my team together
All of these apply on an Antarctic expedition.
No matter what, you must survive and come home alive.
Eagerly pursue knowledge and new experiences.
Lastly, never leave a member of your team behind.

224
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,290
She sure did sound like a real captain, huh?

225
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,880
If you dozed off around her, 
you'd have chalk coming your way, for sure.

226
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,170
If we had a test, I bet she'd fill 
it with all the hardest questions.

227
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,550
We're surveying a route tomorrow, right?

228
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,640
Yeah, we'll be going outside.

229
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,710
It'd be a waste not to, being up 
here in the mountains and all!

230
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,980
Still, this all looks pretty tough.

231
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,310
How did it go?

232
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,800
How did what go?

233
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Seeing her again after so long.

234
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,430
I told you, didn't I?

235
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,350
I'm going to treat her like 
any other member of the team.

236
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,430
Yeah, yeah...

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,580
Did you go against my wishes on purpose?

238
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,460
No, I didn't have any part of this.

239
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,100
That girl really got here 
through her own efforts.

240
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,840
Though I must admit, 
I had a feeling she would...

241
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,120
Since the first day she told 
me she wanted to come along.

242
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,600
She's Takako's daughter, after all.

243
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,060
What's this?

244
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,230
A transceiver, I think.

245
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,610
This is a compass, and that's a GPS...

246
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,290
And then we've got flags.

247
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,210
Hinata-chan, do you get it?

248
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,120
Yeah, she taught us most 
of it to us yesterday.

249
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,830
But why do we have to do this?

250
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,500
Antarctica's flat, isn't it?

251
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,460
We can get along fine without 
marking a route, can't we?

252
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,560
Totally wrong.

253
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,530
The landscape's white as far as you can see,

254
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,880
so it's easy lose track of 
your direction in a blizzard.

255
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,380
That's why you need to create 
a route to walk along.

256
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,930
So we set up the flags to 
serve as landmarks, huh?

257
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,190
But where do we put them?

258
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,140
Figuring that out is the 
point of the training.

259
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,690
Communication station

260
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,690
Route Creation Start Point

261
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,970
This is our current location.

262
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,430
And this is our destination.

263
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,150
Route Creation End Point

264
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,150
Route Creation Course

265
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,200
So we just have to get there?

266
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,640
But we can't just go right there.

267
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,700
We have to go here, here, 
and here on the way,

268
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,010
and set up flags at each point.

269
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,570
I see!

270
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,990
Okay, let's do it!

271
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,120
That way, right?

272
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,140
Wait, wait!

273
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,310
We can't just run off willy-nilly.

274
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,640
Do you even know where the points are?

275
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,460
There... ish?

276
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,460
"Ish"? Come on!

277
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,160
We'll need to keep precise 
track of our location.

278
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,890
I'm getting the feeling 
this is gonna be hard.

279
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,080
Forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty!

280
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,430
Right here!

281
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,570
Check the angle.

282
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,580
Which should I look with? 
Left eye or right eye?

283
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,700
Your dominant eye, probably.

284
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,010
Which eye is that?

285
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,800
I think you go like this...

286
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
Are you done yet?!

287
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,340
168 degrees.

288
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,840
More to the right!

289
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,200
Right?

290
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,300
Right!

291
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,160
Right?

292
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,340
Correct!

293
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,350
There!

294
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,000
Um, the latitude is...

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,490
And the longitude is...

296
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,270
It seems further away than 
the last one, doesn't it?

297
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,370
If the instruments are right, 
we should be right here, I think.

298
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,620
That's where they are, huh? 
They've gotten pretty off-track...

299
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,720
This reminds me of the first time 
I took part in one of these.

300
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,740
What's the story on the other three?

301
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,470
Well, the one is the girl we were supposed 
to bring along from the start, right?

302
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,800
They seem to have become 
friends at some point, but...

303
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,460
Oh.

304
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,510
She said the other expedition members 
would compete on time, but...

305
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,760
I think precision is more 
important than speed.

306
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,520
Safety first, right?

307
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,330
Okay, here I go.

308
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,780
One, two...

309
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,390
398, 399, 400.

310
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,740
Okay, here!

311
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,390
Two steps left!

312
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,010
Yes, there!

313
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,360
That was fast.

314
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,420
I'm impressed you could tell, though.

315
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,810
Kimari must be good with the compass.

316
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,490
She does seem cut out for it!

317
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,650
Just call me a compass expert.

318
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,390
A compasser, for short!

319
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,790
First comes rock! Rock-paper-scissors!

320
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,150
Okay, I'll take this one!

321
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,520
Feels like we're on a field trip!

322
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,800
Anyone bring any playing cards?

323
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,580
We're not here to play around!

324
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,440
Sleeping in a tent will 
be good training, too.

325
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,640
But it's not even 8:00 yet!

326
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,160
Come on, the captain said they'd always 
socialize at night during their training camps...

327
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,740
Less talk, more sleep!

328
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,170
Hey, let's talk!

329
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,220
Don't look at me.

330
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,310
Wanna tell scary stories?

331
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,060
I could just kill you right now.

332
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,440
Yuzuki-chan, do you not like scary stories?

333
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,190
Please shut talking now.

334
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,950
What does "shut talking now" mean?

335
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,850
You're my senpai, so I self-corrected!

336
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,760
You knew what I meant, 
so please leave me alone!

337
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,390
Please shut talking now.

338
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,450
Knock it off, Kimari!

339
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,100
Shirase-chan, are you asleep?

340
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,030
I was wondering about something...

341
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,030
Do you know the captain?

342
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,210
How could you tell?

343
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,810
Just had a feeling.

344
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,710
She and my mother knew 
each other in high school.

345
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,050
She went to Antarctica with my mother.

346
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,870
She came home.

347
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,060
My mother didn't.

348
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,900
That's all.

349
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,570
Because... my mother is waiting there.

350
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,880
What a big sky!

351
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,960
Where's the North Star?

352
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,200
Um, were supposed to trace something 
from the Big Dipper, aren't we?

353
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,470
I thought it was Cassiopeia.

354
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,280
What's the South Star?

355
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,540
South Star? Is there one?

356
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,480
There is, but you can't see 
it as clearly, I've heard.

357
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,790
Which is it?

358
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,480
You can't see it from here, duh.

359
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,480
"Never think the stars you see 
are all the stars there are."

360
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,770
Another of your sayings, Hinata-chan?

361
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,490
Yeah, that one kinda sucked, huh?

362
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,370
<i>This is Syowa Station. 
Aurora Team, do you read me? Over.</i>

363
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,560
We got it!

364
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,590
This is Aurora Team, Miyake.

365
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,330
We read you loud and clear. Over.

366
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,480
<i>This is your regular check-in.</i>

367
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,670
<i>Is everything all right there? Over.</i>

368
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,610
Four members of Aurora Team.

369
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,720
All personnel and equipment 
accounted for. Over.

370
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,980
<i>Understood.</i>

371
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,980
<i>It gets cold around dawn, so 
watch your body temperature.</i>

372
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,560
<i>This concludes your regular check-in.</i>

373
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,590
<i>Be safe.</i>

374
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,160
Be safe!

375
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,120
She really did contact us!

376
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,470
I almost forgot!

So cold...

384
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,900
Hey...

385
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,420
Is there something there?

386
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,560
What was Shirase-chan's mom like?

387
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,350
All I can say about her is 
that she was very strange.

388
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,910
Was she like Shirase-chan?

389
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,950
I don't know. I don't know 
her daughter very well.

390
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,220
But in stubbornness and conviction, 
she's her spitting image.

391
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,230
She's trouble.

392
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,460
Isn't trouble just the best?

393
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,910
A personality like yours 
will do well in Antarctica.

394
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,740
Really?

395
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,500
Why do you want to go to Antarctica?

396
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,670
Did she invite you?

397
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,660
Yeah...

398
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,750
But I'm the one who made the decision.

399
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,180
That I wanted to go with her.

400
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,260
That I didn't want my high school 
years to end the way they were going.

401
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,500
That I wanted to go 
somewhere that's not here.

402
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,760
I see.

403
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,050
But then I met Hinata-chan and Yuzuki-chan,

404
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,700
and I got to hear how the 
members of the expedition felt,

405
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,770
and I learned stuff about you 
and Shirase-chan, and now...

406
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,460
It's not just "somewhere" to me.

407
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,730
It's Antarctica!

408
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,320
I'm gonna go to Antarctica with all of you...

409
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,170
Everyone, wake up!

410
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,170
What is it?!

411
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,930
I'm not a morning person...

412
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,040
Just get up already! 
You, too, Shirase-chan!

413
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,530
Hurry! Hurry!

414
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,380
I wanna go with all of you.

415
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,900
I wanna find the South Star with all of you.

416
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,900
I wanna see auroras, eat shaved ice,

417
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,290
and take pictures with penguins!

418
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,240
We've got to go!

419
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,060
Yeah!
