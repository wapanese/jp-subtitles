1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,230
Ow!

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,980
It's because you're wearing all that!

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,580
What's the big deal?

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,730
It's over anyway.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,570
No, it's not!

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,320
There's gonna be a jump-rope 
contest on the return trip, too!

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,280
You saw the red meat that 
the winning team got!

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,400
We can't take last place again!

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,650
We need to pull out of fish tier, at least!

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,870
It's not red meat!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,610
What?

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,170
Shirase-chan, you're quite 
adept at jumping rope.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,140
Is that weird?

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,910
No, but you just didn't seem like the type.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,710
Why not?

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,880
Defying expectations is kind 
of Shirase-chan's thing.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,500
Like, she's clumsier than she looks.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,240
More short-tempered than she looks.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,320
More selfish than she looks.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,000
What's that supposed to mean?

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,610
Someone's birthday?

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,960
Um...

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm in love!

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,150

#HowsTheLoveLife #CantPutItIntoWords

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,270
High School Girls' room!!
You gotta KNOCK

29
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,270
You're in love?

30
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,930
With the team captain?

31
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,040
Um...

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,280
Zaizen Toshio.

33
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,790
<i>You're</i> in love with her?

34
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,480
Something wrong with that?

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Of course there's something wrong with it.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,080
Everyone you tell gets so exasperated 
they lose their capacity for words.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,460
See?

38
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,640
You're wrong!

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,560
They're just so stunned 
by my sudden confession...

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,250
We're too exasperated to speak.

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,210
Really?

42
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,450
By team captain, you mean Captain Todo Gin?

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,460
The beautiful, smart, determined...

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,670
Seems pretty out of your league.

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,590
That's so rude!

46
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm allowed to be in love with someone!

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,350
I've always loved strong women like her!

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,470
Why?

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,170
I feel like... they could protect me.

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,440
You could just die.

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,210
Did you just say something to me? 
Something truly cruel?

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,820
I'm really sorry.

53
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,640
You said it before, didn't you?

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,650
That you wouldn't bring romance onto the ship.

55
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,720
That's why I've held back until now!

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,030
But I can no longer stop myself!

57
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,440
I would love to hit you.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,660
You basically are hitting me!

59
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,540
So, why did you come to us?

60
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,880
Well, I heard that the captain had an 
old friend among the high-schoolers...

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,420
I was wondering if you had any information...

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,780
He means Shirase-chan!

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,450
How long have you known her?

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,210
I first met her about ten years ago, but...

65
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,270
Got any pictures from that time?!

66
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,060
Okay, you need to maintain a 
five-meter distance at all times.

67
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,310
When was that decided?!

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,890
But she was just a friend of my mother's.

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,730
I never talked to her much.

70
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,100
I see. Then what am I going to—

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,770
Just give up on her, like I said!

72
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,110
Toshio, you're such a—

73
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,150
That's it!

74
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,830
That's it!

75
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,290
Including the expedition members' love lives 
in our reports will make them more exciting!

76
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,410
Report?

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,140
I see! That's a great idea!

78
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,200
We've never even touched on it before!

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,950
Isn't that in poor taste?

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,880
It's fine.

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,800
Apparently our views have 
been in the pits lately.

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,150
You think people will watch?

83
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,290
Of course they will!

84
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,150
Whatever they might claim, 
everybody loves things like that!

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,510
You mean, my love for the captain will...

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,980
...be broadcast to the whole 
world over the Internet?

87
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,980
No, Zaizen-san, you can go back to your room.

88
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,980
We'll take it from here.

89
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
Sounds like you're in the way.

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,860
A Gift From Penguin Farms!!

91
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,860
Soft-Serve Day

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,860
Come eat!

93
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,860
What kind of person she was?

94
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,650
Yes! The captain's personality, 
her relationships with men...

95
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,490
I told you before. She was just someone 
my mom knew. I didn't especially...

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,960
She never really talked much.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm gonna buy some cabbage. Look after her.

98
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,960
Wait! What should I...

99
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,510
Here, your change.

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,760
Here, your change.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,470
You shouldn't give money 
to people you don't know.

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,010
Serious?

103
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,190
Sounds more eccentric to me...

104
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,020
So, what about her love life?

105
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,010
How would I know about that?

106
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,860
I was still in kindergarten back then.

107
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,200
We'll just have to ask her ourselves, then.

108
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,470
Ourselves?

109
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,830
We'll set up an interview, and lead 
the conversation in that direction.

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,830
Like a press conference with a celebrity!

111
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,580
"How's the love life?"

112
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,430
Why are you asking me?

113
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,020
Wait, who's supposed to go ask her?

114
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,090
No! No!

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,820
I feel like we've been through this before!

116
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,250
Have we really?

117
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,870
Why are you so desperate not to do it?

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,880
You talked to her on the deck 
before we set out, remember?

119
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,640
You were watching?

120
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,980
Why would you ever think we weren't?

121
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,070
You seemed close enough to me!

122
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,170
No, we just happened to 
run into each other, so...

123
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,690
You don't get along then?

124
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,650
I don't know if I'd say. It's more like...

125
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,240
There's a distance between us.

126
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,390
You talked to her on the 
deck before, didn't you?

127
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,480
You saw that?

128
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,370
You seemed close enough to me...

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,790
No, we just happened to 
run into each other, so...

130
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,340
We always had trouble 
communicating with each other.

131
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,190
So whenever Takako would leave, we'd just...

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,260
A penguin!

133
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,590
What on earth?

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,130
I don't have any children,

135
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,910
so I had no idea what to even say to her.

136
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,160
Takako was just determined to—

137
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,230
But Takako's gone now.

138
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,280
Are you sure you don't want to talk to her?

139
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,950
About Takako?

140
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,070
She's said that... that her 
mother is waiting for her.

141
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,960
We canceled the search.

142
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,270
It was my call.

143
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,460
Sorry for the wait. You can come in.

144
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,870
Hello!

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,010
Sorry to impose...

146
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,260
No problem!

147
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,000
K-Kanae?

148
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,520
Pardon us!

149
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,890
Where's Shirase-chan?

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,830
She had something else to take care of.

151
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,690
I see...

152
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,720
Okay, camera's rolling.

153
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,160
Wait a minute. What are you going to ask me?

154
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,370
We were hoping to ask some questions 
about your personal life!

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,790
Your favorite foods, what you do back home...

156
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,080
And... your love life!

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
What's your "type"?!

158
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,600
I will not answer questions unrelated 
to the Antarctic expedition.

159
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,640
Gin-chan, the high school 
girls have questions for you.

160
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,260
Please!

161
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,120
Our views have been dropping lately!

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,940
We need this!

163
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,850
Her ears are bright red!

164
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,600
They are not!

165
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,390
Captain, did you just get out of the bath?

166
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,500
What's your favorite bath salt?

167
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,230
What's your "type"?!

168
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,240
Maybe we should make the 
eyes a little larger...

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,230
I think she's fine the way she is...

170
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,500
They're so big!

171
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,710
They did say we were in the Antarctic Circle.

172
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,160
The sun's not gonna go down, is it?

173
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,390
Someone like a cloud?

174
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,310
What does that mean?

175
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,180
Dunno. But that's what she said.

176
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,430
There are lots of kinds of clouds...

177
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,430
Cirrus, stratus, cumulus...

178
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,370
You're so boring.

179
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,630
Why?

180
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,100
I think...

181
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,890
What big clouds!

182
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,870
Yeah...

183
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,490
Clouds are amazing, aren't they?

184
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,420
You can't grasp them, but when you 
look up, they're always there.

185
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,500
And... what does that mean?

186
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,230
I don't know.

187
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,390
I think I have an idea, though.

188
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,880
Yeah...

189
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,850
What? What is it?

190
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,600
How did the interview go?

191
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,060
Did Kanae...

192
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,900
No, I asked.

193
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,420
I was just curious to know

194
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,890
if you and Kobuchizawa-san's 
daughter were very close.

195
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,590
She didn't show up.

196
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,360
She probably hasn't forgiven me.

197
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,660
That is a problem.

198
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,840
A captain needs to be able to talk 
to their members and check in.

199
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,850
<i>From 0800 hours to 1200 hours, 
training is permitted on-deck.</i>

200
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,230
Ouch!

201
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,920
That looked like it hurt!

202
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,980
That happens a lot when 
you exercise in winter...

203
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,120
Shirase?

204
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,270
Penguins!

205
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,970
You know what it means? 
To be "like a cloud"...

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
I think so.

207
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,350
No way! What does it mean?

208
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,470
Tell me! What does it mean?

209
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,980
Can't put it... into words.

210
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,480
Why?

211
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,990
Why what?

212
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,050
Takako, you're trying to leave me 
and her alone together, aren't you?

213
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,640
I sure am!

214
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,910
She needs your spirit, after all.

215
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,000
Hey!

216
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,260
She's your child!

217
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,210
Ow.

218
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,270
You can't do it?

219
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,450
No.

220
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,000
What are you doing?

221
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,720
What do you want?

222
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,160
I wanted to know how you feel... about me.

223
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,750
Do you want me to tell you that I hate you?

224
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,340
I don't hate you.

225
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,310
When my mother decided to 
join the civilian expedition,

226
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,850
she told me over and over again...

227
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,220
that an Antarctic expedition 
can be dangerous.

228
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,270
But you're still going, right?

229
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,630
Yes.

230
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,910
I was fully aware of the kind 
of place Antarctica was.

231
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,150
But I was the team captain.

232
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,880
Did you make a mistake?

233
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,040
Was my mother left in Antarctica 
because of poor judgment on your part?

234
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,420
I didn't have any other choice.

235
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,550
Then isn't that enough?

236
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,240
Fine.

237
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,430
Let me just ask one more question.

238
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,930
Is that how you really feel?

239
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,060
You really feel that way?

240
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,190
I don't know.

241
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,960
This is why I didn't want to talk about it!

242
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,230
I have no idea how I feel.

243
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,960
All I know... is that, even though 
my mom wasn't coming home,

244
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,830
that day after day, my life 
wasn't going to change...

245
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,580
I lived every one of those days 
waiting for her to come home,

246
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,090
but nothing changed.

247
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,270
I told myself, day after day after day,

248
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,750
that it was like I was waiting 
for her to come home.

249
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,820
If I want to change things, 
I just have to go...

250
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,910
to where my mother is,

251
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,730
to the place further than the universe.

252
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,010
What?

253
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,040
All, slow astern.

254
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,920
All, slow astern.

255
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
It finally happened.

256
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,300
What is it?

257
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,170
We hit some fast ice.

258
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,500
We're going to ram through it.

259
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,500
You're right!

260
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,630
We're going to slam down on the ice?

261
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,010
Yes. We'll back up once, and then...

262
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,290
All, stop.

263
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,010
All, slow ahead.

264
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,720
All, stop.

265
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,990
All, slow ahead.

266
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,210
We'll slam the ice...

267
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
with all we've got.

268
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,520
We use the weight of the 
boat to shatter the ice.

269
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,620
That's why we call it an icebreaker.

270
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,590
What happens if the ice doesn't break?

271
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,330
We'll do it over and over again.

272
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,500
Again and again until it breaks.

273
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,090
Antarctica is tough, huh...

274
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,500
It's said that it's especially 
difficult to reach land from here.

275
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,090
Is it?

276
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,660
Then why did we specifically come here?

277
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,480
It's the only place we can go.

278
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,590
Rules about Antarctic 
exploration were formalized

279
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,730
after the second World War...

280
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,090
Ah, do you know about that?

281
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,290
Yes.

282
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,910
Japan had lost the war, 
so many countries were opposed

283
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,210
to Japan sending expeditions to Antarctica.

284
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,150
Of course, Japan didn't have much 
influence over the discussion.

285
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,280
In the end, we were allotted 
East Ongul Island,

286
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,630
which was even said to be unreachable.

287
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,380
You mean, they bullied you?

288
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,370
I'm not sure if I'd go that far...

289
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,320
but maybe that is what it amounted to.

290
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,480
An "If you really want to go there, 
go ahead and try" kind of thing.

291
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,770
That's very annoying.

292
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,390
But that just fired up everyone even more!

293
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,430
They raised large amounts of 
money from all over the country,

294
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,770
and the shipwrights worked as hard as 
they could to design and build a ship...

295
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,400
What then?

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,420
Time and time again,

297
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,450
they found themselves on the brink of giving 
up, but they dug deep and pressed on.

298
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,610
Just like breaking through the ice.

299
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,830
Step by step.

300
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,130
Again and again...

301
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,890
Two-thirds ahead!

302
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,390
Go!

303
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,390
Go!

304
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,640
Go!

305
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,240
Get 'em!

306
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,660
We did it...

307
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,560
Not yet. There's a long way 
to go until we get there.

308
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,250
Year after year. Again and again...

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm home!

310
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,350
Again and again.

311
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,600
Takako!

312
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,100
Takako!

313
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,610
Hey!

314
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,200
Takako!

315
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,610
Kobuchizawa!

316
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,130
<i>It's beautiful...</i>

317
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,370
Takako!

318
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,330
<i>It's so...</i>

319
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,740
<i>very beautiful.</i>

320
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,150
Um...

321
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,360
Just for the record, I was 
really, really, really serious!

322
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,540
I wanted to do something for her!

323
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
I told you, I get it.

324
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,520
But she didn't even notice me!

325
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,630
An expedition member can't help 
their captain. They won't let you.

326
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,890
Why don't you respect that,

327
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,460
and find someone more within your reach?

328
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,910
Yumiko...

329
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,150
Y-Y-Y-You...

330
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,580
No! That's not what I meant!

331
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,570
No!

332
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,810
How did it all fit in there so neatly before?

333
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,310
It's a mystery.

334
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,140
What will you do?

335
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,670
Have you finished cleaning up?

336
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,060
Yes! All finished!

337
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,400
How can you be so comfortable with lying?

338
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,900
Would you like to step outside for a minute?

339
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,300
Can we?

340
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,390
Yuzu! The camera!

341
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:39,900
Right!

342
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,910
Is this it?

343
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,600
It's just a brief stop.

344
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,560
Stay within five meters.

345
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,080
Okay, let's go!

346
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,800
Is this...

347
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,560
...Antarctica?

348
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,720
What should I do?

349
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,020
Shirase, you go first.

350
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,090
After you.

351
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,350
One, two...

352
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,080
We're here!

353
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,020
We're here!

354
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,780
We're here!

355
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,030
We made it!

356
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,210
Goal!

357
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,390
Shirase-chan...

358
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,620
It's nice, huh?

359
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,170
It's where your mother was.

360
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,100
In your face...

361
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,550
In your face, in your face, in your face!

362
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,180
You made fun of me and looked 
down your noses, but I believed!

363
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,810
You betrayed me, thinking it was 
impossible, but I didn't give up!

364
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,310
