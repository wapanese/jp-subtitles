00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,070
<i>This being the first civilian 
Antarctic expedition,</i>

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,310
<i>some are saying that this brings 
Antarctica closer to the average person.</i>

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,480
Now that Syowa Station has been 
transferred to civilian ownership,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,040
I believe there will be more 
chances for things like that.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,610
Do you intend to continue 
doing research like this?

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,240
Of course.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,490
Even having become civilians,

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,220
we'd like to keep sending expeditions 
and doing observation...

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,440
We want everyone to learn about 
the wonders of Antarctica.

00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:01,200

16
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's run a test.

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,500
W-Wait!

18
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,020
We're doing this for you, 
though, Shirase-san...

19
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,130
Let's go. One, two...

20
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,880
Jumping!

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,690
And as you can see, we've arrived 
in Fremantle in a snap!

22
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,880
Please, observe!

23
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,140
This is the expedition ship 
from Japan, the <i>Penguin Manju</i>!

24
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,940
This is the ship we're going 
to take to Antarctica!

25
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,900
Now, let's head inside the ship!

26
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,150
Now... take it, Shirase-chan!

High School Girl

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,710
Right! I am High School Girl 
Antarctic Expedition Member,

29
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,400
K-Kobuchizawa Shirase!

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,280
F-From here, I'll b-be making some 
c-c-catchy, witty, sensational reports

31
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,660
as I l-lead you all around Antarctica!

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,160
Miserable.

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,620
I told you I didn't want this stupid thing!

34
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,630
Stupid thing?! I wrote you a script 
because you said you wanted one!

35
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,170
Even so...

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,350
it sure is big.

37
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,950
It seems to go without saying,

38
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,560
but it did come all the 
way from over the ocean...

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,810
From Japan...

40
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,300
Congratulations on your long journey!

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,850
Come on up!

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,580
Kanae-san!

43
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,230
Welcome!

44
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,360
You've finally reached the starting line.

45
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,580
A lot of the rooms look the same,

46
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,070
so make sure you remember your number.

47
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,950
Passenger: Passenger: Passenger: Passenger:
Miyake      Tamaki      Shiraishi    Kobuchizawa
Hinata       Mari           Yuzuki      Shirase

48
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,950
Kanae-san!

49
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,700
The packages we just brought on...

50
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,820
I'll be there in a minute. Just wait.

51
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,790
A four-person room, huh?

52
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,430
Sounds fun, right?

53
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,860
There will be fights here.

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,900
Why?

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,380
Let's try to be optimistic.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,910
But it does seem likely.

57
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,010
Seriously, why?

58
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,680
You have desks and lockers, 
so figure out who'll go where.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
And those are the belongings 
you had sent from Tokyo.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't open them all.

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,650
We'll be carrying them to 
the station after we arrive.

62
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,440
I see!

63
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,680
Huh?

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,650
They're locked.

65
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,160
So they don't open by themselves 
when the boat sways...

66
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,220
Vice commander!

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,320
The welcome party will 
be soon, so until then...

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,980
Kanae-san!

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,950
Yes, I'm coming!

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,910
But what should we do?

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,030
Oh, there's also a rule: 
Don't step on the silver part here.

72
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,980
Just to warn you,

73
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,160
we're going to treat you like 
adults from now on, okay?

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,840
Figure things out for yourselves!

75
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,390
You know, if they see you like 
that, they're gonna kick you off.

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,100
It's going to sway a lot when 
the boat starts moving, I bet.

77
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,780
Maybe we should do the boat 
report now, while we still can.

78
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,840
Yeah!

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,430
Which way did we come from again?

80
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,000
There was a map in the brochure, right?

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,530
Yeah...

82
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,400
And so we open this, and...

83
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,650
We're outside!

84
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,860
We are up quite high...

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,380
Oh? Yuzuki-chan, are you acrophobic?

86
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,320
For real?

87
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
Why does that make you so happy?

88
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
Okay, let's go up!

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,690
Let's go over there!

90
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,760
I would like to die.

91
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,060
Let's go this way. This way.

92
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,060
It's the snow cat!

93
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,810
Yeah! So they store it in there, huh?

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,190
Okay, we definitely gotta cover this!

95
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,150
Shirase!

96
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,370
Is there a script?

97
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,450
Ad-libbing is a reporter's responsibility.

98
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,060
Filming now!

99
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,330
Wait!

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,780
It's so old. Is it really going to move?

101
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,070
They said it would be fine...

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,810
I have a feeling we don't have 
enough people down below, either.

103
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,420
Do your best!!

104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,420
Civilian Antarctic
Expedition Members!!

105
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,550
Maybe we should go help them later.

106
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,420
Yeah.

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,430
No rest for the wicked...

108
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,890
Um...

109
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,330
W-We're on the expedition ship.

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,650
And... there's a snow cat over there!

111
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,910
This is the ship's bridge.

112
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,690
We haven't left yet, so they 
let us stop by to visit!

113
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,560
This is the ship's captain, Mukai-san!

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,280
And the expedition's commander, Todo-san!

115
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,750
Worthless

116
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,730
This is the first civilian 
expedition in three years.

117
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,750
Could you tell us what 
your goal is this time?

118
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,040
We have several.

119
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,680
Syowa Station has been unmanned 
since the winter team pulled out,

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,410
so restoring it to normal functionality 
is our primary motivation.

121
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,130
Ow.

122
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,180
Thank you very much!

123
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,600
We'll be visiting that same 
Syowa Station very soon!

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,940
See you then!

125
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,270
Why can't you do what she does?

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,090
Thank you very much!

127
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,690
There's a reason she's a pro!

128
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,740
Well? Do you like the ship?

129
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,210
Oh, yes! It's so big!

130
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,140
Oh?

131
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,070
I gotta say...

132
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,410
I think this ship might be 
a little too big this time.

133
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,010
Captain.

134
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,390
Have you been to your room yet?

135
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,290
Y-Yes.

136
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,010
Take care of it.

137
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,170
That's the same room Takako used.

138
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,900
Find anything?

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,760
No. Not even a doodle.

140
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,090
Nothing in here, either...

141
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,810
I mean, even though it's the same room,

142
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,510
they might have changed all the equipment...

143
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,270
True...

144
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,600
Hey!

145
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,810
Yumiko-san!

146
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,030
I know you just got here, but do 
you have a little time to help out?

147
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,940
We're so short-handed...

148
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,530
When you're out, turn your card to red

149
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,620
Then there's eggs, milk, yogurt...

150
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,470
What about pudding?

151
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,460
No.

152
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,350
But eggs and milk... are those 
provisions for the boat trip?

153
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,420
I don't know, but...

154
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,740
What's wrong?

155
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,700
Nothing.

156
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,090
I just find it a little weird 
they're going shopping now...

157
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,640
Seriously.

158
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,950
I had this image of them dropping

159
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,520
this many-ton crate of 
provisions onto the ship...

160
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,180
Are you with an expedition?

161
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,450
Yes!

162
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,940
You're so young.

163
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,520
To think even girls like you are 
allowed to head out these days...

164
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,760
All this?

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,530
This isn't that much, actually.

166
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,030
The new ship that came by last 
week had a whole container full.

167
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,290
So heavy!

168
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,540
Learn anything?

169
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,040
There are quite a few...

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,410
"Not enough funds."

171
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,500
"Not enough people."

172
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,510
"The plan itself is unworkable."

173
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,070
"There's a new station and 
expedition ship anyway,

174
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,700
so doubling up is meaningless."

175
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,750
Sounds about right...

176
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,060
I'm turning it off. I don't have 
much room on this disposable SIM.

177
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,520
Shirase-chan, do you know anything about it?

178
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,820
I never even thought about that 
when we were coming here...

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,600
Yeah, guess you wouldn't...

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,520
Still...

181
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,110
I feel like things are a 
bit strange on board, too.

182
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,950
There don't appear to be enough people,

183
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,240
and there seem to be a 
lot of problems, too...

184
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
Welcome back!

185
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,450
How did your first errand go?

186
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,460
Good! This is enough, right?

187
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,960
Great job, great job.

188
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Well, I'm sure the locals are 
used to this song and dance.

189
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,470
They did seem to be...

190
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,810
What's the matter?

191
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,630
Um... could we ask an awkward question?

192
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,930
Can we really get to Antarctica?

193
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes.

194
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,650
Of course we will!

195
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,290
After all, Antarctica's not going anywhe—

196
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,800
Please, spare us.

197
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,300
Well, I don't know where you heard about it,

198
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,500
but I understand the nerves.

199
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,390
We have so few people and supplies...

200
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,460
Since we're civilians, 
we've had to make lots of cuts.

201
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,800
So it's true...

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
But...

203
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,340
as I said before, 
there's no way we're not going.

204
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,840
We've made all the necessary preparations.

205
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,850
First Civilian
Antarctic Expedition

206
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,610
And we've taken unprecedented 
precautions with safety, too.

207
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,730
And most importantly,

208
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,840
the people on this ship are determined to go.

209
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,480
Determined...

210
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,320
Antarctica is an unforgiving place.

211
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,060
Blizzards blow at minus dozens of degrees.

212
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,020
The air is so dry that 
your lips chap and bleed.

213
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,090
The sunlight is harsh, so if you forget 
sunblock, you can really get burned.

214
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,780
There's no Internet, 
and no places to have fun.

215
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,420
And yet, we're going.

216
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,960
Preparing little by little 
over three years' time...

217
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,220
Why are you going?

218
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,920
Good question.

219
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,100
If I had to put it into words...

220
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,280
This time, it's to see the sky, I suppose.

221
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,730
The sky?

222
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,460
Yes...

223
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,500
The sky.

224
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,510
What do you think?

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,420
I don't know.

226
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,270
She sounded honest, but also 
like she was hiding something.

227
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,030
She was absolutely hiding something!

228
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,090
You think so?

229
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,380
She said it herself! They're "determined"!

230
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,840
They must have a serious reason!

231
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,350
The sky, huh? I wonder what that meant!

232
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,950
No way to find out, I guess...

233
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,610
Yeah. No matter how we try to press it,

234
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,520
when an adult says something like that...

235
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
We must investigate!

236
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,670
Which way do we go?

237
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,990
Good thing we're all on the same page.

238
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,990
Don't be like that!

239
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,990
You're the one who told me to go, Yu-kun!

240
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,170
Why? Please!

241
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,790
Yes, I do want to go home!

242
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,510
You know I want to see you, Yu-kun!

243
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,630
I don't even know if this 
expedition is gonna work out...

244
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,260
I'm telling you, I love you!

245
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,760
I've told you I love you so many times!

246
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,460
Nobue-san!

247
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,010
We're going out for a drink!

248
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,260
Seriously, why does it have to be like that?

249
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,260
Okay...

250
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,080
Is the fact that I love you not enough?

251
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,650
That's true, only two days 
left for short sleeves...

252
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,310
Yeah!

253
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,250
I'll have a Kahlua!

254
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,900
I wonder if they have cocktails...

255
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,070
So, what did you want?

256
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,640
Well, I was thinking...

257
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,240
I think the project itself 
might not be possible.

258
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,950
That's your personal opinion, right?

259
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,030
The actual details haven't 
even been decided yet.

260
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,540
There's not really anything we can say yet.

261
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,240
That's our Yume-chan...

262
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,170
You're already sloshed...

263
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,470
Gonna carry her back?

264
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,790
Hell no!

265
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,240
All of us crammed in together, 
I'd never hear the end of it!

266
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,850
Let's get back to the plan!

267
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,060
Concretely speaking,

268
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,760
what we're doing right now isn't 
part of the official plan.

269
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,850
In other words, that's an 
extremely distant goal.

270
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,460
But the commander and Kanae-san 
are obsessed with it, right?

271
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,330
That's incorrect.

272
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,430
The other members are obsessed with it, too.

273
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,350
That makes it even more—

274
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,660
You sayin' you're 'gainst it, huh?

275
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,560
That's not it. I just...

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,670
A real man wouldn't grumble 'bout everythin'!

277
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,630
Shut up!

278
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,490
What's wrong?

279
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,170
High school girls in masks!

280
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,160
Where?

281
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,800
I told you! I told you!

282
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,020
You don't have to say it twice.

283
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,680
They have some amazing plan 
they haven't told anyone about!

284
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,940
But what could it be?

285
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,860
You think...

286
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,970
Antarctic People!

287
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,400
Nice one!

288
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,330
Perfect timing!

289
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,030
Please, take this seriously!

290
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,260
What if they're planning something awful?

291
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,170
They could force us to go along with it...

292
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,970
But thinking won't get us anywhere.

293
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,890
Even so...

294
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,900
We'll have to talk to Kanae-san 
one more time tomorrow...

295
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,050
Shirase-chan, that's my plushy.

296
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,440
What's that?

297
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,950
Glow-in-the-dark paint!

298
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,440
Shirase.

299
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,680
Wanna sleep here?

300
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,830
You think Shirase-chan's mother did that?

301
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,200
Maybe so.

302
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,950
<i>If I had to put it into words...</i>

303
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,330
<i>This time, it's to see the sky, I suppose.</i>

304
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,580
<i>A place more distant than the universe.</i>

305
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,590
<i>It's not a prison, a place trapped in ice.</i>

306
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,730
<i>It's a place, still unopened,</i>

307
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,060
<i>yet filled with possibilities,</i>

308
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,780
<i>Earth's greatest treasure chest.</i>

309
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,090
Want to look?

310
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,230
I think we all got a little 
too worked up to do it.

311
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,290
As civilians?

312
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah! After the new ship is finished,

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,430
they'll be deployed to the new station,

314
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,390
and the current ship and Syowa Station

315
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,460
will be transferred to civilian ownership.

316
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,550
You mean...

317
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,430
We can become the first civilian team—

318
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,980
Let's do it!

319
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,180
That was fast!

320
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,190
The ship and the station 
were both hand-me-downs,

321
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,340
but we were so excited.

322
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,590
There are almost no civilian 
stations anywhere in the world,

323
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,490
so we came up with all kinds of plans, 
gathered all kinds of researchers...

324
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,630
We all wanted to make it a success.

325
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,940
Because we knew that this journey, 
this road that we paved,

326
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,680
would continue on into the future.

327
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
That's why...

328
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,580
An astronomical observatory?

329
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,460
The plan's been out there for a while.

330
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,510
I'd heard they were building 
one at the new station, too.

331
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,180
That's all the more reason!

332
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,310
We might not be able to rival 
their scale and amenities,

333
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,570
but I think being able to do the 
same research as the new station

334
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,270
is the most important thing we can 
do as civilians in the future!

335
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,510
Yes...

336
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,580
As good publicity, then?

337
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,790
She was probably hoping to find 
something worthwhile somewhere.

338
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,290
Even though she knew that feeling 
could be very dangerous.

339
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,800
Somewhere out there...

340
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,510
Takako!

341
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,920
When we came home, we found a 
harsh reality waiting for us.

342
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,470
Sponsors, afraid of the damage 
to their image, withdrew one after another.

343
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,800
And the next expedition was 
indefinitely postponed,

344
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,400
and the winter mission was withdrawn.

345
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,190
I know that.

346
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,780
But we hadn't changed at all.

347
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,140
Three years ago, in the place 
we discovered with Takako...

348
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,540
with your mother, we would some 
day look at the stars again.

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,790
It didn't matter if it 
took ten years or twenty.

350
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,790
And it wasn't just us.

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,300
Most of the members who were with us 
three years ago are here again now.

352
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,960
Our budget has been mostly stripped away, 
and we'll get almost no compensation,

353
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,120
and there are some of us who won't have 
anything waiting for us when we return.

354
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,670
And yet we all came here.

355
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,810
And yet we're all still here.

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,310
That's the kind of ship this is.

357
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,950
<i>Hey, Gin. Want to go to Antarctica?</i>

358
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,950
<i>Huh? Antarctica?</i>

359
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,540
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

360
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,710
<i>You know, I...</i>

361
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,860
<i>I just...</i>

362
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,970
<i>love leaving my footprints in fresh snow!</i>

363
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,220
Hey, it's been a while!

364
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
I'm Maekawa Kanae!

365
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,720
How is everyone doing?

366
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,940
Yes, good!

367
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,410
Now, it's been three years 
since the last voyage.

368
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,400
I'm sure you've all been through a lot.

369
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,900
Some of you have lost hair, 
some have gotten divorced,

370
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,760
some have lost your jobs...

371
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,910
No one got married?

372
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,430
Well, let's all introduce 
ourselves one by one!

373
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,160
But first...

374
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,170
what you've all been waiting for, 
let's introduce our passengers!

375
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,830
Come on in!

376
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,520
Don't look at the floor.

377
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,260
But...

378
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,050
They're in high school!

379
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,160
They're not Goto or Yajima in drag!

380
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,130
They're real high school girls!

381
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,480
Now, a warning they're not legal.

382
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,730
I'll say it one more time. They're not legal.

383
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,100
Toshio, you hear me?

384
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,110
Why'd you single me out?!

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,870
All of our members who made that promise
three years ago have returned.

386
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,520
And with our new members, all of us here,

387
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,030
these members, are going to the station.

388
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,360
We're going to Antarctica!

389
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,900
All right! From right to left, 
let's have some introductions.

390
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,010
I'm Tamaki Mari. Please call me Kimari!

391
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,350
Um, I wanted to go somewhere new,

392
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,910
to make a real change in my life...

393
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,120
And the next thing I knew, 
I was heading for Antarctica.

394
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,200
I don't have any idea what I am doing, 
but I look forward to working with you!

395
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
Shiraishi Yuzuki here.

396
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,940
I'm a year younger than the others here, 
in my first year in high school.

397
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,490
I ended up on this boat for work.

398
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,730
The truth is, I really didn't want to come...

399
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,520
but I came here wanting to do 
something with other people.

400
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,970
I look forward to working with you!

401
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,840
Miyake Hinata here!

402
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,030
I'm cheerful and energetic.

403
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,140
I came here because I 
wanted to do something big

404
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,980
before I took my entrance exams.

405
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,830
I might be little, but I've got a big heart!

406
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,490
I look forward to working with you!

407
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,030
I'm... Kobuchizawa Shirase.

408
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,120
Shirase-chan...

409
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,650
I boarded this ship to do catchy, 
witty, sensational reporting!

410
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,730
I want to open the treasure 
chest of Antarctica

411
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,940
that my mother wrote about with my own hands!

412
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,470
Everyone, let's go to Antarctica together!
