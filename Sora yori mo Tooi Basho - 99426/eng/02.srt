The <i>Shirase</i> leaves port 
in Japan in mid-November,

00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,100
heads south across the 
ocean towards Antarctica,

Sidney

12
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,610
Cross the 55th Parallel

13
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,200
and makes a port call 
in Fremantle on the way.

14
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,610
Australia!

15
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,640
There, they'll resupply and bring 
the expedition members on board.

16
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,800
Then as December begins, they'll set 
course for the continent of Antarctica.

17
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,040
The people don't board in Japan?

18
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,500
They haven't done that for a long time.

19
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,750
Fremantle           Sidney

20
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,140
Nowadays, people typically 
board at Fremantle,

21
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,130
then fly home from Sidney.

22
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,830
So while the <i>Shirase</i> is in port there,

23
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,510
we'll want to take a plane 
from Japan to Fremantle.

24
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,820
Fremantle

25
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,910
Cross the 55th Parallel

26
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,020
Then we'll board the <i>Shirase</i>... 
and head for Antarctica.

27
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,020
Syowa Station

28
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,020
Depart Syowa Station

29
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,150
Will they let us on?

30
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,740
Antarctic expeditions are 
typically a state enterprise.

31
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,960
The boat is manned by the SDF,

32
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,030
and the expedition members have to 
pass strict screenings and training.

33
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,750
High schoolers would never be allowed in.

34
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,540
However...

35
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,290
This year is special.

36
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,160
What's this year?

37
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,300
Civilian Antarctic Expedition to Take Place for the
First Time in Three Years
A revival of the "Antarctic Challenge,"
 the first civilian Antarctic expedition held
three years ago, has been announced.

anticipation means?" I wondered.</i>

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,820

Morning. And yeah.

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,490
I told you about the cost of 
the plane ticket yesterday.

60
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,520
Shirase-chan wants me to earn it in advance.

61
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,210
Antarctica, huh?

62
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,860
Yeah. She also said, since I'll 
have to take time off from school,

63
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,650
I should attend every day now while I can.

64
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,530
Hey, look! This one's perfect!

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,150
What is it?

66
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,630
They're hiring high school-aged girls! 
It's in the hospitality industry.

67
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,380
It's a job where you talk to boys 
and go on walks with them and stuff.

68
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,810
If you do really well, you could 
even make a million yen per month...

69
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,710
If they catch you, you're dead.

70
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,440
I'll be fine!

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,210
I'll turn in a part-time job 
permission form to the school.

72
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,220
You're so ignorant.

73
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,600
Setting the money aside, do you 
really think they'll let you go?

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah! Shirase-chan told me all about it.

75
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,100
She's got some friends on the civilian 
Antarctic expedition that's going this year, so...

and commissioning of a new icebreaker ship,

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,660
the <i>Shirase II</i> and Syowa Station

and the safety of participants

I haven't had to write lines 
since elementary school...

100
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,550
You shouldn't have been reading it in class.

101
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,190
But I just couldn't wait...

102
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,840
So, what else?

103
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,930
There's nothing else.

104
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,930
For now, there's nothing about 
the project being canceled.

105
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,250
Then, it's okay, right?

106
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,750

108
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,710
Even if it hasn't been canceled, it won't 
be that simple for you to get on.

109
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,970
Just because it's for civilians 
doesn't change that.

110
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,200
Oh, but Shirase-chan is the 
daughter of an expedition member!

111
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,860
It's not like getting 
family seats at a concert.

112
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,390
They're not gonna let you 
on the ship that easily.

113
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,980
I see...

114
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,620
You're probably right.

115
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,120
You're going to see her soon, right?

116
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,110
You should just ask her straight up.

117
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,290

Punctuality is crucial.

121
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,810
That goes double when we're in Antarctica.

122
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,230
A few minutes can mean the 
difference between life or death.

123
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,940
But I told you, the teacher got mad at me...

124
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,950
Did you find a job?

125
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,270
I told you to pick one by today.

126
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,420
I know, but...

127
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,660
Look, it's just the cost of 
a ticket to Australia, right?

128
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm sure I can scrape up the 
money over summer vacation...

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,910
You should have as much money 
as possible, just in case.

130
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,740

I guess you can be pretty stupid 
sometimes, too, Shirase-chan...

I'm not stupid!

She's worried about whether or 
not they'll really let us go.

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,650
Is that enough to qualify?

160
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,460
I assure you, it is.

161

anymore, you can just say so.

It's not that I don't want to do it!

165
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,240
I just don't want to fail!

166
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,500
I don't want to think 
"I just shouldn't have bothered!"

167
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,250
I would rather think "I wish I'd gone!" 
"I wish I'd followed Shirase-chan's plan!"

168
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,720
I really am aware of the whole situation.

169
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,450
I've thought up a plan, too.

170
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,590
You do?

171
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,550
Yeah.

should keep making your preparations.

I got a job!

176
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,490
Welcome!

177
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,930
Do you wish me to warm that up for you?

178
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,580
Well, you can learn it as you go.

179
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,390
First, handle the restocking.

180
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,290
Miyake-san over there 
will tell you what to do.

181
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,190
Yes, sir!

182
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,580
Excuse me...

183
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,070
Um, I'm Tamaki. I'm joining 
the team as of today.

184
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,180
I look forward to working with you.

185
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,130
Tamaki?

186
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,340
Tamaki Mari.

187
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,070
Oh, that's why you're "Kimari".

188
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm Miyake Hinata.

189
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,520
How old're you?

190
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,290
Sixteen. Second year high school.

191
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,600
Same here! Nice to meetcha!

192
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,920
L-Likewise...

193
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,300
You go to Tatara Nishi High, right?

194
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,880
Yeah, "Tanishi."

195
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,580
Why the sudden need for a job?

196
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,260
There's a place I want 
to go, so I need money.

197
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,440
Would that place happen to be...

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,440
Antarctica?

199
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,940
Polar
Drink

200
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,940
Weddell Seal
Soda

201
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,950
You want to go?

202
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,160
Yeah, apparently she's been 
listening in on our conversations.

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey, you make it sound 
like I did it on purpose.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,340
I wasn't eavesdropping. 
You two were just talking so loud!

205
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,840
Loud?

206
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,220
"If you don't want to do this, just say so!"

207
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,970
"It's not that I don't want to do it!"

208
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,970
Enough! We get it!

209
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,640
That piqued my curiosity.

210
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,160
Then straight after, 
Kimari came in to get a job, y'know?

211
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,740
And I got to thinking, it's gotta be destiny!

212
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,670
Just to be clear, this isn't a game.

213
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,850
I know that!

214
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,600
It's dangerous, and you 
need to pay your own way.

215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,750
We're heading out in December, so you'll 
need to take time off from school, too.

216
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,050
I'm okay! It's all good!

217
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,980
I've got money from my job, 
and I don't go to school.

218
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,160
What, really?

219
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,290
It's not that surprising, is it?

220
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,460
You see them from time to time...

221
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,550
Sixteen-year-olds who don't go to school.

222
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,250
Don't get the wrong idea, though.

223
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,420
I'm as smart as anyone.

224
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,460
I got my high school certificate

225
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,930
and I got an A rating 
in the recent mock exam.

226
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,310
And you're still only in your second year?

227
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,360
Does that mean you're going to college?

228
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,260
Yep!

229
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,540
My current dream is to ace 
everything and show up everyone

230
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,030
who goofs off in high school and fails!

231
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,700
But then how would you have 
time to go to Antarctica?

232
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,910
A reasonable question,

233
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,900
but I still have almost two 
years before entrance exams,

234
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,260
and when I think about how I'll spend 
next year knuckling down for exams,

235
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,330
it makes me want to do something 
special while I can.

236
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,770
I get you! I so get you!

237
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,920
If you don't do it this year, 
you'll never get another chance, right?

238
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,420
Exactly!

239
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,440
Ah, must my sixteenth year come and go,

240
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,520
with nothing but meat buns 
and oden to show for it?

241
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,430
Precisely!

242
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,970
I'd love to have a drink out with you!

243
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,110
Even though I don't drink!

244
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,470
Same here!

245
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,020
Shut up!

246
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm the one making the plans here.

247
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,070
You need to follow my instructions.

248
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,590
We never said we wouldn't...

249
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,490
What? Is she the irritable type?

250
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,700
A tad.

251
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,070
This describes my plan.

252
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,830
We'll put it into action this Sunday.

253
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,250
This Sunday, then.

254
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,080
Okay.

255
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,230
Bye-bye!

256
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:27,010
How'd it go?

257
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,430
What do you think of her plan?

258
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,360
Dunno!

259
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,440
Seems like it'll be pretty tricky...

260
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,930
Yeah, it does...

261
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,860
But she knows a lot more 
about Antarctica than we do,

262
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,690
so it seems to me that we might as well try.

263
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,520
"If you can still turn back, 
it's not really a journey.

264
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,160
When you hit the point of no return, 
that's the moment it becomes a journey."

265
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,400
That sounds like a quote!

266
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,450
Who said it originally?

267
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,490
Me!

268
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,540
Oh.

269
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,450
I'm happy, though.

270
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,450
I've always liked you two.

271
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,560
You know? My store's close to Tanishi, 
so students come in all the time.

272
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,210
Right...

273
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,820
But you two seemed different, somehow.

274
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,600
You've got a different sort of vibe, I guess.

275
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,220
No one's ever said that to me before...

276
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,760
I really hate the thought 
of blending in with a crowd.

277
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
That's why I couldn't handle high school.

278
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,640
I really envied you two.

279
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,000
Envied what about us?

280
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,620
Hard to say...

281
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,630
The honesty, I guess?

282
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,750
Normal

283
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,750
Kuki

284
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,290
Do you feel sufficiently flattered?

285
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,620
Well...

286
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,240
That's how Hinata-chan works 
her way into your heart!

287
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,260
See you!

288
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,950
Sure!

289
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,860
Well, we'll do the best we can

290
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,100

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,480
But everything's flashing! 
I don't know where to look!

294
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,250
Calm down!

295
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,930
Kimari! Wait for me!

296
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,060
Don't leave me behind!

297
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,130

I'll be fine, but your school might 
get mad at you if they find out.

309
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,530
Just for walking around?

310
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,780
Well, it is Kabukicho...

Don't worry. Just act like you're in college.

Hey, here for a good time?

313

Just for a bit. Just stop in for a bit.

But this only says "lure someone out."

328
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,440
What does that mean?

329
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,510
Well, there are normally a lot of 
male participants in an expedition,

330
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,380
so I thought, being high school girls...

331
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,400
Are you talking about seducing them?

332
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,560
Well, Shirase-chan is beautiful, after all.

333
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,320
Me? No, I didn't mean me!

334
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,400
Wait, were you planning 
to make one of us do it?

335
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,830
There's no way!

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,390
Go! You wanna go to Antarctica, right?

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,810
Yeah! It's not fair! You are the 
one who came up with this plan!

354
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,000
No! Besides, it can't be me!

355
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,390
Why can't it be you?

356
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,530
Yeah!

357
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,280
Shirase-chan?

358
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,340
She never gives up, does she?

359
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,920
Who was that?

360
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,740
Why did you bow to them?

361
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,550
What is this, school? 
Are you an honor student?

362
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,610
I told you it couldn't be me!

363
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,420
Why not?

364
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,220
They know me!

365
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,930
So if they see me, they'll catch...

366
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,890
Ugh. There's three of them...

367
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,390
Run.

368
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,190
Run!

369
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,480
Hey, you!

370
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,570
Hinata-chan, you run fast!

371
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,610
Over short distances, sure!

372
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,570
Think we should split up for now?

373
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,060
Yeah.

374
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,010
Where should we meet up?

375
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,920
Coordinate with cell phones!

376
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,410
All right!

377
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,340
Secret Path of Memories

378
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,630
They're still chasing us!

379
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,300
They're part of the expedition team, 
so they've got tons of stamina!

380
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,470
Should we split up, too?

381
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,210
Sorry!

382
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,970
Okay!

383
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,410
What's so funny?

384
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,000
I was just thinking... this is pretty fun.

385
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,700
Fun?

386
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,170
Yeah. It's like... motion!

387
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,670
I feel like my youth is in motion!

388
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,960
<i>Yeah... this is what it is.</i>

389
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,430
<i>Like anything could happen.</i>

390
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,010
<i>Like I could make anything happen!</i>

391
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,600
<i>The scenery that surrounds me every 
day is changing at a dizzying rate.</i>

392
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,880
Drinking outside really is the best!

393
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
Isn't it great?

394
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,120
Let's go drinking over there today.

395
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,820
Bye-bye!

396
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,660
Cafe Room

397
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,660
You didn't have to exhaust 
yourselves running away.

398
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,940
It's not like we were trying to kill you.

399
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,770
Though <i>she</i> actually might.

400
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,410
Kanae.

401
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,580
But... Shirase-chan said...

402
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,780
Yeah, she said you'd have 
our heads if you caught us.

403
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,170
I never said that!

404
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,690
This is quite a plan you 
came up with, though...

405
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,970
In other words, get a male 
expedition member on your side

406
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,020
so he'll smuggle you on board, right?

407
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,430
You naughty girls.

408
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,310
Whose idea was this?

409
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,150
Yeah, that figures.

410
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,440
Look, Shirase-chan.

411
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,510
I've told you many times before: 
we can't take you with us.

412
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,910
It may be a civilian expedition, 
but there are strict requirements for—

413
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,190
I know that!

414
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,820
I know I'm being unreasonable!

415
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,720
But... I really want to go.

416
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,110
Because... my mother is waiting there.

417
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,520
Shirase-chan?

418
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,840
What is this?

419
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,140
It's just what it looks like.

420
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,590
You're having trouble with funding, right?

421
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,460
Let me become one of your sponsors!

422
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,660
If you take me along, 
you can have the money!

423
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,610
She really thought this through, huh?

424
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,430
Fine.

425
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,690
Come to Fremantle on December 1st.

426
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,970
Really?

427
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,370
Is that what you expected to hear?

428
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,750
You don't have to worry 
about us. We're going,

429
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,730
no matter what.

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,230
Takako! Takako!

431
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,610
Takako! Takako!

432
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,090
Takako! Takako!

433
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,830
Well, I do understand how she feels.

434
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,220
It's been three years.

435
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,370
Are we really okay for funding, though?

436
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,670
I told you before, didn't I?

437
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,660
It might be tough, but I have lots of ideas.

438
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,600
Shiraishi-san...

439
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,670
Yeah. And here's step one!

440
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,930
Your mother, huh?

441
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,460
Well, don't get too down.

442
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,190
It's not necessarily ove—

443
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,780
We're almost there if I'd had a little 
more money she would have taken it

444
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,270
so I just need a little more and 
she'll definitely accept it...

445
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,890
A glass-half-full type, huh?

446
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,120
I guess.

447
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,800
Well, you'd have to be, to get this done.

448
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,660
Yeah.

449
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,390
However!

450
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,480
I am introducing an emergency motion!

451
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,580
I request a dismissal of 
Kobuchizawa Shirase as group leader!

452
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,390
All in favor?

453
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:57,940
Me!

454
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,340
Majority rules!

455
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,540
Thus, you are hereby dismissed as leader!

456
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,470
Now, let's go to Antarctica!

457
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,170
Yeah!

458
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,470
Huh?!
