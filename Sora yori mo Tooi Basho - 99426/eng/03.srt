Thanks!

11
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,930
That's hot!

12
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,760
Why would you serve it hot?!

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,880
My grandma says it's only May, so...

Even if it's only May, it's still hot out!

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,590
I want cold tea.

And some sweets with it, too!

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,980
I request something of the pudding variety!

18
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,280
Don't you think this is a bit bizarre?

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,610
Bizarre?

Yeah! Don't you realize 
how embarrassed we were?

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,660
What was I supposed to do?

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,520
It was our only option.

Well? Told you, didn't I? I told you 
that my plan would work perfectly!

111
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,980
But...

112
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,550
Impossible, you said? Ridiculous, you said?

113
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,740
Was this... part of the plan?

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,330
Convince her?

183
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,080
Yes. Apparently the girl is refusing to go.

184
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,120
If you can convince her to go,

185
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,680
I'll recommend to the production 
company that you go as her companions.

186
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,740
What do you think?

187
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,010
In other words, if we can get her to go...

188
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,620
I see!

189
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,010
But Yuzuki-chan left, didn't she?

190
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,980
Actually, she has a job in Tokyo on Sunday,

191
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,390
so she'll be staying in 
a hotel until Saturday!

192
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,640
Friday, Saturday... two days?

193
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,530
Which means there's no time to waste!

194
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,190
Let's go!

195
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,870
It's after ten.

196
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,340
Then tomorrow morning, 
before we go to school. Five o'clock?

197
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,920
Wait, wait. Are we gonna film her waking up?

198
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,490
Six, then? Seven? When should we do it?!

199
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Calm down.

200
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,130
If she's that set against it,

201
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,000
she must have a pretty serious 
reason not to want to go.

202
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,590
I thought she just said 
she didn't like the cold.

203
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,770
She said that pretty bluntly.

204
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,360
That means she probably has a 
deeper reason not to want to go.

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,970
Hinata-chan, you're so mature!

206
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,160
So, what's the reason?

207
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,130
Well, I don't know that yet.

208
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,140
But asking about that should 
probably be our first task.

209
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,020
A reason, huh?

210
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,550
Uh-oh! See you later!

211
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,270
Sure!

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,710
See you tomorrow!

213
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,750
What's wrong?

214
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,860
Self-loathing.

215
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,300
I was just thinking, 
you're probably right, Hinata.

216
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,750
At the end of the day, I've mainly 
been prioritizing my own feelings.

217
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,880
I haven't been thinking about anyone else.

218
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,380
You're <i>just</i> realizing that?

219
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,390
Just kidding.

220
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,380
As they say, it's a thin line between 
self-assertion and selfishness.

221
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,900
Who says that?

222
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,970
Me!

223
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,610
Working today?

224
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,670
Nope!

225
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,720
Want to grab a bite, then?

226
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,860
Antarctica, huh?

227
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,190
Did you work that all out?

228
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,000
Well... We're not sure yet, but...

229
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,380
Sorry. Another time.

230
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,880
Here?

231
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,090
Room 305.

232
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,930
What should we do? T-T-Tail her?

233
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,300
What good would that do?

234
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,810
A coincidence. 
Just pretend it's a coincidence.

235
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,360
Huh? Were you staying here?

236
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,310
Where are you off to?

237
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,310
Um...

238
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,810
Math I

239
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,810
Studying?

240
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,500
Yeah. I need to catch up 
on the classes I miss.

241
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,600
This place has free refills, 
and it's open late.

242
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,620
You're so responsible...

243
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,770
It's about Antarctica, right?

244
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,870
I'm sorry, I haven't made any more progress.

245
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,240
Y-Yeah, we know that, but...

246
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,500
There's something else we wanted to ask you.

247
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,130
What is it?

248
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,590
Why don't you want to go?

249
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,010
Is it strange that I don't?

250
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,110
Well, c'mon! Antarctica has penguins!

251
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,260
Icebergs, too!

252
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,740
And you can see the aurora!

253
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,310
My mother got to you, didn't she?

254
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,230
Does she want you to convince me to go?

255
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,150
<i>Stare...</i>

256
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,650
Spineless!

258
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,370
But I still want to know the 
reason you don't want to go.

259
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,910
Why should I tell you?

260
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,160
Well, it's okay if you don't want to...

261
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,930
I doubt you would understand.

262
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,240
I don't have any friends.

263
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,190
Not just now.

264
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,190
I never have.

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,050
Not once.

266
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,940
Shiraishi Yuzu-chan
Congratulations on
your TV appearance!!

267
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,940
I've been a child actress 
since I was four years old.

268
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,840
But because I was so busy, I hardly 
had any time to play with friends.

269
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,340
Then it kept happening and happening.

270
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,790
I've never had a fight with friends.

271
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,830
My mom's the only one I fight with.

272
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,210
So once I got into high school,

273
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,800
I decided I had to make 
friends, no matter what.

274
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,540
I'd go to clubs, get a part-time job,

275
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,680
buy sweets with my friends after class,

276
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,970
do karaoke...

277
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,480
But...

278
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,620
Thanks, you guys!

279
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,060
Sure! Let's go hang out some time.

280
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,550
Really?

281
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,570
Sure thing.

282
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,750
Also, can we get a picture together?

283
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,220
Yuzuki-chan's a celebrity, 
so people want to see pictures.

284
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,000
Take one with me, too!

285
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,630
Sorry...

286
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,200
Oh. Bye, then.

287
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,790
First impressions are important, aren't they?

288
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,460
I need to start working hard 
to form them right now.

289
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,910
Proper relationships and groups...
You're basically establishing who you are.

290
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,780
Wh-What?

291
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,070
I just wanted to hug you suddenly!

292
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,020
I can't breathe!

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,790
I totally understand you!

294
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,390
I always hate new school terms and stuff, too!

295
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,110
You don't understand!

296
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,940
Yes, I do!

297
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,730
No, you don't!

298
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,820
Because you're all best friends, aren't you?

299
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,120
Best friends?

300
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,080
Aren't you?

301
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,840
We haven't even known each other a month.

302
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,830
We've never even hung out together.

303
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,050
We're just all trying 
to go to the same place.

304
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,240
For now, at least.

305
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,910
Right?

306
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,940
Yeah.

307
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,050
Yeah!

308
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,840
Sorry to keep you out so late.

309
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,560
I hope your mother understands.

310
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,710
Not at all. I feel a little better, 
having gotten to talk about it.

311
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,520
Well, bye.

312
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,810
Bye-bye!

313
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,450
So... where does that actually leave us?

314
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,460
What do you mean?

315
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,080
Have you forgotten? 
We came here to convince her!

316
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Oh! That's right!

317
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,970
Huh? But if Yuzuki-chan refuses,

318
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,340
Shirase-chan can go in her place...

319
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,420
If we convince her, we can go together...

320
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,010
Huh?

321
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,090
Wait, but if Yuzuki-chan refuses, 
Shirase-chan can go in her place...

322
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,150
I'm so confused!

323
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,350
It's not that hard!

324
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,470
If she refuses,

325
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,810
they'll get some other 
entertainer to go in her place.

326
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,690
I see!

327
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,960
Convincing her was our only chance.

328
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,200
But...

329
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,430
Well, I think this is okay.

330
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,420
Aina: Can't do that either?
Yuri-chan: How about next Sunday?

331
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,420
Sorry... I don't know just yet...

332
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,420
Sorry. Maybe next time.

333
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,500
<i>It's the first time anyone's done that to me.</i>

334
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,630
<i>Having friends... Is that what it feels like?</i>

335
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,930
Kimari-san!

336
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,760
Let's go to Antarctica!

337
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,770
What are you doing? They'll yell at you!

338
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,480
Come on, let's just go!

339
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,930
Come on, the wind is really strong!

340
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,730
Hurry up!

341
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,480
But I...

342
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,060
Hold out your hand!

343
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,370
What a strange dream.

344
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,390
Today

345
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,960
Good morning!

346
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,710
You guys...

347
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,820
I told you it was too early! 
She's still in her pajamas!

348
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,680
It was Shirase-chan who said it!

349
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,670
What was I supposed to do? 
We're going all the way to Tokyo.

350
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,600
Tokyo?

351
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,960
Yeah! We heard you had a job in Tokyo,

352
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,370
so I figured we could go together!

353
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,280
Sorry to jump on you like this!

354
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,660
It's all because she didn't
ask for your contact info.

355
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,640
Me?!

356
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,070
Do you have time?

357
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,540
Yeah.

358
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,330
Really?! Then, then...

359
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,630
We can go to the Tokyo... Polar...

360
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
Wh-What's wrong?

361
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,970
Kimari!

362
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,120
Kimari!

363
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,010
What did I do?

364
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,580
It must have been you!

365
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,250
But you're the one who said 
we should go together...

366
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,060
I'm saying I'll go if I can 
go with the three of them.

367
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,100
And I won't go without them.

368
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,610
Okay, Yuzuki-chan! Let's go!

369
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,770
Okay!

370
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,090
P-Penguins!

371
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,050
Aren't they nice and fluffy looking?

372
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,260
Yeah...

373
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,250
Hey!

374
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,090
Wow, it's long!

375
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,340
Hey, we can go inside this!

376
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,750
Really?

377
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,050
It's pretty cramped in here, huh?

378
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,930
I believe they use newer models of 
snowcats nowadays, of course...

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,160
Full speed ahead, and keep 'er steady!

380
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,940
I don't think it's a boat.

381
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,190
This bunk bed only has a top bunk!

382
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,160
It says they keep the rooms 
over twenty degrees Celsius!

383
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,200
Nice to hear it!

384
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,860
Because it'll be negative 
ten degrees outside!

385
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,770
I bet my nose would be running...

386
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,580
Come a little closer!

387
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,610
I bet the real one is a lot more beautiful!

388
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,400
Yes, I've heard it's very beautiful.

389
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,270
My mother said it brought her to tears.

390
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,410
Most people don't get to see 
the aurora, though, do they?

391
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,190
I've heard that.

392
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,670
Then if we really do get to see it,

393
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,780
we might be the only high school students 
in the world to see the aurora from Antarctica.

394
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,410
Really?

395
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,530
In that case...

396
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,970
I could just die right now!
