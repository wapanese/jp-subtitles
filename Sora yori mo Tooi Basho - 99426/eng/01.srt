00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,430
<i>I've always loved watching it spill out all at once.</i>

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,620
<i>Breaking free, liberated, rushing out.</i>

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,600
<i>The energy stored up during 
its stagnation bursts forth.</i>

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,460
<i>Everything springs into action!</i>

6
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,720
Tamaki Mari-san, it's already noon.

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,760
I... I had the scariest dream!

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,830
What was it?

9
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,230
I dreamed you put a wet towel on 
my face in an attempt to kill me, Mom.

10
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,410
That <i>does</i> sound scary...

11
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,980
I told you yesterday to tidy up your room.

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,480
Do not open
without permission!

13
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,480
Wait!

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,470
Ow...

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,860
Huh?

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,070
Things I want to do in high school
Keep a diary
Skip school just once
Go on a journey without a plan

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,560
"Things I want to do in high school."

18
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,050
"Keep a diary."

19

21

Get the most out of youth.

22
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,100
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,330
What?

24
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:27,160

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,330
So?

29
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,300
Well, I just realized, I'm in my second year 
of high school and I haven't done <i>anything</i>!

30
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,690
You didn't do anything in 
middle school either, Kimari.

31
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,710
Exactly!

33
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,630
I knew I had to start doing stuff 
when I got into high school!

43
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,150
I only have so much time, so I'm wondering,

44
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,030
where did all that determination go?

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,980
So, what are you gonna do?

46
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,480
I decided...

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,730
Get the most out of youth.

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,730

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,730
Tokyo?

52
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,470
Yeah. First I'll go to Tokyo, 
then I'll start my journey from there.

53
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,070
Drifting from place to place on a whim!

54
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,820
When?

55
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,660
Ouch!

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,070
Enjoy your trip.

57
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,360
Tomorrow?

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,300
Yeah. I'm g-gonna ditch school.

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,010
Well, that sounds fine.

60
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm skipping school, though! Playing hooky!

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah, and it's not that big a deal.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,380
Not that big a deal?

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,690
Hey, Kimari... have you never ditched before?

64
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,970
You mean you have, Megu-chan?

65
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,340
Sure I have. Everyone has.

66
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,710
Incredible!

67
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,100
Don't look at me like that.

68
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
So, ever gone on a journey without a plan?

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,120
I guess not.

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
Then... then... then...

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,010
I'm not going with you.

72
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,450
How'd you know that's what I meant?

73
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,920
It was obvious. 
That's just the way you think, Kimari.

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,900
But it's meaningless, unless you 
go by yourself, in my opinion.

75
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,970
I see...

76
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,260
Just go.

77
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,990
I'll help you.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,370
Okay!

79
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,580
Tamaki

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,580
I'm back!

81
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,250
So excited!

82
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,570
Tomorrow, I'll get changed in 
the bathroom at the station!

83
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,210
And then...

84
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,580
The beach, the beach!

85
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,840
Crap. They'll know I'm from Gunma...

86
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,510
What are you doing, Sis?

87
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,970
Nothing!

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,480
Heading out already?

89
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,270
What's the big bag for?

90
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,480
I had to borrow gym clothes from a friend.

91
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,630
Again?

92
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,950
See you later!

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,330
Don't call me.

94
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,160
<i>I had to!</i>

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,340
You don't have to worry. 
I already called the school.

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,180
<i>With my mimicry skills.</i>

97
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,430
For real?

98
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,610
<i>If you have to stay overnight, 
I'll back up whatever story you use.</i>

99
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,680
<i>Stop worrying and go.</i>

100
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,310
Sure!

101
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,190
<i>I'm heading out on a journey.</i>

102
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,890
<i>I'll change clothes in the bathroom.</i>

103
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,650
<i>I'll get on a train that goes 
the opposite direction from school.</i>

104
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,140
<i>While everyone goes to school like normal,</i>

105
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,570
<i>I alone will burst free.</i>

106
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,700
<i>I'll go on a journey without a plan.</i>

107
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,870
<i>To a place I've never seen before...</i>

108
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,220
No loose pants!
Lift them higher! 
Both your pants and your grades!

109
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,350
What are you doing here?

110
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,020
Well... I mean, it was raining.

111
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,250
And I started thinking, 
"you can't just skip school"...

112
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,920
Isn't there anywhere you wanted to go?

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,020
Sure, there is! Lots of places!

114
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,510
Kyoto, Okinawa, Hokkaido...

115
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,600
Then why didn't you go there?

116
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Well... you know...

117
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,200
A plane could crash.

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,930
A shinkansen could explode...

119
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,520
And a meteor could fall at any time.

120
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,620
I know that! I know!

121
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,020
Then why didn't you go?

122
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,010
You got scared?

123
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,310
You know. It's the thing I've always done...

124
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:47,070
Rin

125
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,980
When I try to join clubs, 
when I try to learn new things,

126
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,150
when I thought about taking the entrance 
exam for a really good school...

127
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,070
I always chicken out at the very last minute.

128
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,770
When I'm about to try something 
I've never done before,

129
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,570
I start thinking, 
"What if it doesn't go well?"

130
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,820
"I really don't want to fail."

131
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
"What if I end up regretting it?"

132
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,950
When the moment comes, every single time...

133
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,410
Rin

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,410
Hurry!

135
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,410
Want to eat

136
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,540
Well, I don't think that's 
necessarily a bad thing.

137
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,920
I hate it, though.

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,680
I'll be back by curfew

139
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,680
I made the usual

140
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,900
I really hate that part of me.

141
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,530
See you.

142
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,260
Sure.

143
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,540
Next time, want to hang out somewhere?

144
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,090
Sure!

145
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,640
Hey, you dropped this!

146
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,790
Yen

147
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,970
Are you kidding me?

148
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,450
How much is there?

149
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,220
I counted... it was exactly one million!

150
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,720
A million?!

151
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,460
Why did you keep it? Why didn't 
you take it to the police?

152
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,240
I freaked out!

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,560
Sure you did...

154
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,890
I'm serious! I seriously freaked out!

155
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,920
And I think... the person who dropped 
it was wearing a uniform for our school.

156
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,740
What year?

157
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,140
I'm not sure...

158
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,860
I only caught a glimpse of her from behind.

159
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,460
See her?

160
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't... think so.

161
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,780
Her hair was about as long as that 
girl's, and I think she was pretty.

162
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,500
Anything else?

163
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,470
She smelled good. Conditioner, maybe?

164
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,710
Not much to go on...

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,240
Well, it's okay.

166
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,970
I don't think there are many 
girls with hair that long.

167
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,340
I'm going to check the first-year classrooms.

168
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,850
Okay...

169
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,860
Ethics

170
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,860
I need to calm down...

171
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,360
That smell...

172
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,730
A million...

173
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,960
A million... yen.

174
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,950
A million...

175
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,440
Yen!

176
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,430
Open and
close doors

177
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,430
QUIETLY

178
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,430
What do you want?

179
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,940
Year 1 Class 1

180
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,640
What do you want?

181
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,450
Oh... actually...

182
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,050
Um...

183
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,580
That's...

184
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,250
Uh, Yesterday, I...

185
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,670
No, I didn't steal it! I just happened to—

186
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,670
Thank you.

187
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,300
Thank you!

188
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,820
Thank you!

189
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,730
Closed

190
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,730

A Place Further Than

Kobuchizawa Takako

192
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,680
My mother wrote this book.

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,530
She was a member of an 
Antarctic research expedition.

194
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,980
She went missing when 
I was in middle school, though...

195
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,960
I see.

196
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,980
They never found her,

197
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,110
and she didn't leave much behind for me,

198
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,090
so I'm going to go and find her.

199
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,550
To Antarctica? 
Can you even do that?

200
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,550
That's what everyone says.

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,480

and my neighbors...

205
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,680
"You really think they'll 
let a child do that?"

206
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,310
"Don't you realize how much that would cost?"

207
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,650
And that's what the million was for?

208
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,400
I've been working part-time jobs.

209
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,650
I'm going to go.

210
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,130
I'll go, then rub it in the faces 
of everyone who said I couldn't.

211
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,770
After I finished my entrance exams and 
got into high school, I made up my mind.

212
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,450
Antarctica, she said! Antarctica!

213
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,760
Don't you think that's amazing?

214
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,900
The furthest ends of the Earth!

215
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,860
That will be 566 yen.

216
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,520
Kobuchizawa Shirase?

217
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,270
Yeah! You know her, Megu-chan?

218
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,460
The girl in class 2 who they 
call "Antarctica," right?

219
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,600
Antarctica?

220
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,020

222
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,960
She's pretty famous, you know.

223
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,330
Ever since she got to high school,

224
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,090
she's talked about nothing 
but going to Antarctica.

225
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,470
That <i>is</i> what she said...

226
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,740
There's no way she's going, though.

227
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,050
But she has a million yen!

228
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,960
And she said she was totally going!

229
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,290
She can't, though.

230
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,210
Come on, it's Antarctica.

231
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,740
You'd need to be part of an expedition to go.

232
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,180
Then, why?

233
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,420
I dunno...

234
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,450
I mean, that's why people call her a weirdo.

235
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,000
She doesn't make any friends.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,140
She spends all her time after school 
working and saving up money.

237
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,850
Wanna hang out somewhere?

238
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,400
Oh... not today.

Oh, is it?

245
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,960
The Antarctic Express?

246
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,840
Where's our payment?

247
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,050
We were making sure no one stole it.

248
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,030
We hear you've got some money on you.

249
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,310
Could you lend us a little? Just a little...

250
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,320
E-Excuse me!

251
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,380
K-Kobuchizawa-san, the teacher's calling you.

252
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,330
They gotta ask some 
questions about the money.

253
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,830
Really?

254
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,870
Way to spoil the fun...

255
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,340
You were lying?

256
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,730
Don't scare me like that...

257
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,130
I thought the teacher really 
found out about it!

258
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,960
But I gave you a knowing look!

259
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,350
How was I supposed to know?

260
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,410
But why were you there? 
Just happened to be passing by?

261
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,940
Actually, I happened to see you, 
and I wanted to talk to you.

262
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,520
About what?

263
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,860
I want to encourage you!

264
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,090
I wanted to do something 
when I got into high school.

265
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,220
Something I'd never done. Something amazing!

266
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,200
But I never did anything,

267
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,980
and whenever I try, 
I end up getting scared and quit.

268
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,640
So... I think it's really amazing 
to work hard at something,

269
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,700
even when everyone discourages 
you and makes fun of you!

270
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,580
Just let people say what they want.

271
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,530
Wanting to show them up 
just fires me up even more.

272
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,280
I think it's for the best.

273
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,740
Isn't there any way I can help you?

274
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,180
Just say the word!

275
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,150
Will you go with me, then?

276
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,880
People have said that to me in the past.

277
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,810
But they all go away before long.

278
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,680
They decide it's impossible,

279
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,370
their friends get them to stop...

280
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,610
Or they get scared.

281
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,530
I think that's normal.

282
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,150
We're in high school, after all.

283
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,960
They have classes to get to, and friends.

284
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,060
I'm not like them! My feelings 
about this aren't that frivolous...

285
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,740
I'm checking out boats.

286
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,450
Come here this Saturday.

287
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,130
If you do, I'll believe you're serious.

Hiroshima...

296
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,290
Or they get scared.

297
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,720
I think that's normal.

298
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
There's no way she's going, though.

299
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,380
Will you go with me, then?

I know it's Saturday, 
but you can't sleep in forev—

304
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,150
<i>I'm going on a journey.</i>

305
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,230
<i>This time, I </i>am<i> going on a journey.</i>

306
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,990
<i>I'll get on the train that goes 
opposite the usual way,</i>

307
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,210
<i>so that I can see things 
I've never seen before...</i>

308
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,830
<i>I'm scared; it's true...</i>

309
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,310
<i>I want to call it off...</i>

310
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,100
<i>It might all turn out to be pointless...</i>

311
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:21,990
<i>But...</i>

312
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,290
I'm finally going on a journey!

313
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,050
I got a picture of Mt. Fuji!

314
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,770
Wow, it's so big!

318
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,640
breaking through ice...

319
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,280
14,000 kilometers from Japan.

324
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,690
How do you plan to get there?

325
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,450
You want to know?

326
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,450
<i>The corners of her mouth 
curled up in a smile.</i>

Okay!
