1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,100
What do you think?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,540
It's really warm!

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,980
Really feels like summer...

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,420
Make sure you get your fill of it!

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,990
You won't be touching any warm 
surfaces for a while, after this.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,450
Hey.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,740
What?

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,330
Let's do this in Antarctica, too.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,750
Well, shall we?

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,450
Ready to sail!

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,350
It's done, huh?

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,260
No.

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,760
We did it.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,760
<i>The boat left the land.</i>

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,770
<i>I don't know what this 
trip will mean in the end.</i>

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,660
<i>We'll be taking time off from 
school, missing tests...</i>

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,270
<i>It might even affect our entrance exams.</i>

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,780
<i>But as of now,</i>

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>we are no longer high school students 
who can never take a step forward.</i>

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,990
<i>We are not 17-year-olds and 16-year-olds 
who try but accomplish nothing.</i>

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,140
It's all ocean!

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,330
Of course it is.

23
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,000
The world really is big, isn't it?

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,040
<i>That's enough!</i>

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,970
Hey, guys, I'm taking a picture!

26
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,900
Look up here!

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,980
Okay, say cheese!

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:45,160
A Place Further Than the Universe

29
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,450

32
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,210
High school girls are conducting
intervews!!
^i     .
*Please explain what your job is.
One person is enough.

33
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,210
Ready to go?

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,980
I see! Thank you very much!

35
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,350
Yeah, yeah. Very cute.

36
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,170
We're not live, so you can do it again...

37
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,220
We rocked!

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,800
They said the waves were 
gonna get pretty rough...

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,540
We really need to be efficient with our time.

40
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,450
They wanted us to help out later, right?

41
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,560
Yes, that's right.

42
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,440
Why didn't you wake me?

43
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,740
I did.

44
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,380
Then you need to wake me harder!

45
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,580
Excuse us!

46
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
Wait! Wait! Thirty minutes more!

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,920
Fifteen, at least!

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,330
Okay. We'll wait outside.

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,440
Did she not have eyebrows?

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,730
It's not uncommon among women.

51
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,490
I'd actually say it's typical.

52
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,870
Is it really?

53
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,590
Ow!

54
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,830
As we go further south,

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,850
we'll be stopping at places in 
the ocean known as "stations"

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,100
to gather bacteria and seawater.

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,100
We have tons of equipment on 
board to help us with that!

58
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,650
This is a water sampler and a CTD monitor.

59
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,110
Wow! This is a water sampler 
and a CTD monitor, huh?

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,160
We'll be gathering rocks like these

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,620
and performing geological 
surveys in Antarctica.

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,750
We'll investigate the stratum 
several thousand meters down

63
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,750
The mic is too close!

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,070
to learn more about the 
conditions on primordial Earth.

65
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,880
She has normal eyebrows, right?

66
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,000
Would you just listen to her?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,780
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! 
We're late! We're late!

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,750
Which way was it, again?

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,950
This way!

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:53,180
High School Girls' room!!
You gotta KNOCK

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,580
Ow!

72
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,690
Sorry we're late!

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,310
Yeah, yeah, we've been waiting!

74
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,120
Hey, dessert!

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,690
You make that here, too?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,040
Well, with whatever we have, anyway.

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,450
Now, if you don't mind, start up on those.

78
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,450
Those?

79
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,220
This is why I wanted to bring a peeler!

80
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,910
Stupid Rin!

81
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,670
There are still so many more to go...

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,920
But this kind of thing is fun, don't you think?

83
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,670
You like grunt work, huh, Kimari?

84
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,300
Seems like it takes the four of 
you just to reach one horsepower.

85
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,320
Are we that slow?

86
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,070
It's clear you don't help 
out at home very often.

87
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,650
Still, don't rush yourselves.

88
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,200
We don't want you getting hurt.

89
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,200
She's fast!

90
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,370
I am a pro, after all.

91
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,410
Are you a cook somewhere?

92
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,290
I'm usually a lunch lady.

93
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,170
I'm constantly thinking 
up and preparing dishes

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,550
for picky eaters like you guys.

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,800
Anyway, work hard, 
so you can get up on deck soon.

96
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,300
Get up on deck?

97
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,240
<i>From 1100 hours to 1700 hours, training is 
permitted on-deck. Counterclockwise.</i>

98
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,810
What's that?

99
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,610
It means we're allowed to train topside.

100
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,290
In other words, we can go 
outside and get some exercise.

101
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,440
Exercise?

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,490
I'll take you up when you're done.

103
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,410
It's sort of a duty for expedition members.

104
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,930
Wow, the ocean.

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,820
W-We're going to run here?

106
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,510
Yep.

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,370
Hey, wait up!

108
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,240
If they announce clockwise, 
you'd go this way.

109
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,450
If they announce counterclockwise, 
you go that way.

110
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,890
The direction changes by day, so be careful.

111
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,430
Okay!

112
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,450
About how long do we have to run?

113
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,280
There's no particular rule.

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,280
But as we've told you over and over, 
stamina is crucial on an expedition.

115
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,510
You might be working all day 
in sub-zero conditions,

116
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,860
so you need strong bodies 
to meet the challenge.

117
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,080
Mom was always exercising, too...

118
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,480
If you run out of stamina and pass out,

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,180
not only will you not contribute anything,

120
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,150
you'll be an active drag 
on the people around you.

121
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,940
You don't want to get to 
Antarctica to be a drag, right?

122
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,560
See you!

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
She's fast!

124
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,520
Okay! We'll do our best, too!

125
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,300
Hey!

126
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,410
Kimari-san doesn't realize, does she?

127
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,310
She'll catch on soon enough.

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,100
I thought so...

129
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,240
Hey, are you okay?

130
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,840
Why... is it... so big?

131
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,060
You've walked around here 
countless times, haven't you?

132
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,490
But... everyone else... goes so fast...

133
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,490
Even she can run that fast...

134
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,030
She looks like a scientist,

135
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,610
but I guess she still has tons of stamina.

136
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,570
We're going.

137
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,110
W-Wait!

138
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,050
Eighteen!

139
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,990
By the time we get to Antarctica, 
we'll be Amazons!

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,820
It won't be that easy...

141
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,620
Okay, last one!

142
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,950
It itches!

143
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
My nose!

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,380
Yuzu, can you not lift your arms?

145
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,010
If you do anything, I will just kill you...

146
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,510
I will kill you ♥

147
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,010
You idiots! You idiots!

148
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,980
So this is a seawater bath...

149
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,320
It's pretty big, huh?

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,020
Definitely worth experiencing.

151
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,620
Would you get out already?

152
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,270
Seawater is more permeating than I expected.

153
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,370
My hair is so crusty...

154
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,450
I think that's why everyone cuts their hair.

155
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,520
And the men shave their heads...

156
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,440
Okay, maybe we should cut it!

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,530
I'll cut it!

158
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,230
The boat has barber facilities, right?

159
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,000
Not even if the fate of 
the world depended on it.

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
Ditto.

161
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,000
How come? I'm good!

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,300
I cut my own bangs all the time!

163
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,470
<i>At last, the mystery...</i>

164
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,620
<i>...is solved.</i>

165
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,220
<i>That's why...</i>

166
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,220
<i>...her hair looks like that.</i>

167
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,600
What? What?

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,010
<i>Provisions ready!</i>

169
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,250
It's time for dinner.

170
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,730
No way! Already?

171
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,230
Missed meal cards go here | Already eaten: Black

172
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,230
Samejima Yasumoto
Yumiko    Honami

173
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,020
I'm all sticky!

174
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,440
Because you didn't wash off 
properly in the shower.

175
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,980
But I didn't have time!

176
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,620
Hey, meat and potatoes!

177
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,990
Are these the ones we peeled?

178
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,040
Have we forgotten to do anything else?

179
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,950
Dinner, bath... laundry?

180
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,630
Don't we have to do that 
at a certain time, too?

181
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,370
It's because you two were 
playing around in the bath.

182
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,750
Take responsibility and go do it.

183
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,960
Wait, but what about our dinner?

184
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,720
But didn't we pick someone to do it 
because it seemed easy to forget?

185
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,440
Oh, that's right!

186
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,430
Yes.

187
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,190
As I recall, we did rock-paper-scissors...

188
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,730
Hey!

189
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,730
Laundry Room  Bath

190
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,730
Regarding use of fresh water
Fresh water baths permitted during ship-wide training
(Salt water baths are allowed, too!)
Please try to conserve water ♥

191
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,730
That'll do it.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
What do you mean, "that'll do it"?

193
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,100
You actually sat there 
and ate your whole meal!

194
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,150
I still made it in time, 
so what's the problem?

195
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Don't.

196
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,420
She must be tired.

197
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,100
They kept us busy a lot 
longer than I expected.

198
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,550
Yeah, true...

199
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,150
And it all starts again tomorrow.

200
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,610
You think we'll hold out?

201
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,240
We just have to do our best, right?

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,170
We don't have any other choice.

203
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,490
Feel sick...

204
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,250
I feel... sick.

205
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,440
When using the toilet,
turn this valve
counterclockwise
to flush.
After flushing,
please close
the valve.

206
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,940
Going to die.

207
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,940
The world is spinning.

208
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,220
Don't talk. If you talk...

209
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,220
How'd it go?

210
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,650
Don't ask.

211
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,580
You're really seasick, huh?

212
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,410
But we were totally fine before.

213
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,850
We took medicine for it...

214
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,530
Didn't that wear off?

215
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,730
It can wear off?

216
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,720
It's medicine. Of course 
it'll wear off eventually.

217
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,250
I see.

218
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,310
I've never been on a boat this long. 
I didn't even think...

219
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,810
Hinata, you idiot.

220
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,810
Why am I the idiot?

221
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,190
You need to take medicine 
and get a good night's rest.

222
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,700
Then have a proper meal.

223
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,090
I know you probably don't have an appetite,

224
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,310
and you're afraid that if you 
eat it'll just come back up.

225
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,830
But if you don't eat, 
you'll just keep losing stamina.

226
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,300
If it gets bad enough, we might 
have to give you an IV supplement.

227
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,820
I see.

228
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,680
If that happens, none of your 
training will mean anything.

229
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,210
Okay.

230
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,890
<i>Provisions ready!</i>

231
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,700
Remember what Kanae-san said?

232
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,070
If we don't want to be a drag in Antarctica,

233
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,810
we have to eat, whether we like it or not!

234
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,280
It all came up.

235
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,650
Yuzuki-chan, did it all come up for you, too?

236
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,460
Don't say it.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,930
Stop rocking!

238
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,310
Just stop for a little bit!

239
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,520
I think it is stopped.

240
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,300
No way!

241
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,910
They said they're collecting seawater.

242
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,160
And still...

243
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,800
Yumiko-san said we'd get 
used to it eventually.

244
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
But it's not happening.

245
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,810
Great Knot-Tying Competition
Winning team gets a steak dinner!!

246
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,810
Sizzle sizzle sizzle! Pictured: the steaks from three years ago
This time, it's meat! Meat!! Meat!!!
Meat is the great motivator!

247
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,810
If you're planning on winning, please bring your 
provided army -n-i-c-e- knife, please.
 The steaks are not pre-cut.

248
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,810
You were given an army 
knife for cutting steak

249
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,120
They've probably been on boats so often

250
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,140
their semicircular canals are busted.

251
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
<i>From 0800 hours to 1400 hours,</i>

252
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,980
<i>training is permitted on-deck. Clockwise.</i>

253
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,500
What'll we do?

254
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,080
Yeah, there's no way I can run...

255
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,040
But it's a little better outside, 
with the wind, at least...

256
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,550
I could probably manage it 
if not for the rocking...

257
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,940
I wanted to see the whales...

258
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,560
Whales? Can you see them?

259
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,940
They said earlier that they were in sight.

260
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,650
Can you see them?

261
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,380
Um... Tamaki-san, was it?

262
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,590
Yes.

263
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,570
There's one right now.

264
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,840
You see it?

265
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,020
She self-destructed just now.

266
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,340
Because she was focusing 
on a single point, right?

267
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,330
Lay off. Just thinking about 
it makes me want to puke.

268
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,890
There they are. Hey!

269
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,150
I looked in your room earlier,

270
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,100
and it looked like you weren't 
ready at all. Are you okay?

271
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,230
Ready?

272
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,730
53 degrees?

273
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,730
Though we set that record a long time ago.

274
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,420
The last time I came here, 
it felt to me like we rocked so far,

275
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,700
this desk was up there.

276
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,490
No way!

277
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,500
When you go to Antarctica, 
you must surpass these things...

278
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,270
The howling 40 degrees.

279
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,500
The maddening 50 degrees.

280
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,630
The screaming 60 degrees.

281
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,260
Wh-What do you mean?

282
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,230
It's about latitudes.

283
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,760
Earth is a water planet, remember?

284
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,450
It spins on its axis, and that 
creates wind and water currents.

285
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,500
But Earth has continents,

286
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,120
so those block the currents and weaken them.

287
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,200
But around this area of 
the southern hemisphere,

288
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,980
there's no land in the way,

289
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,550
so there's nothing to interrupt the current.

290
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,400
Mom said they were going to plow 
their way right through it.

291
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,120
How long will it take?

292
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,130
I don't know all the 
details, but pretty long.

293
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,010
Your insides will go woo, 
like on a roller coaster!

294
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,100
A roller coaster? I like those, but...

295
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,660
But do you want to go on one now?

296
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,440
Here it comes...

297
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,950
Though I like this kind of thing... 
the feeling, like I'm fighting.

298
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,450
I'm falling!

299
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,130
That was the biggest one yet, right?

300
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,990
I think that was about 15 degrees.

301
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,080
No way.

302
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,720
Here it comes, here it comes, 
here it comes, here it comes!

303
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,070
I floated.

304
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,060
My body floated.

305
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,460
You'd better stay in bed.

306
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,820
But the blood is rushing to my head...

307
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,970
Ouch...

308
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,710
You okay?

309
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,160
I'm dizzy.

310
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,290
No getting to sleep tonight, huh?

311
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,290
Yeah...

312
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,050
You think we'll really make it to Antarctica?

313
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Of course we will. 
We're on a boat going there.

314
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,420
I know that...

315
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,560
but we might not be able to 
do anything once we get there.

316
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,070
Everyone has so much stamina, 
and they can handle the boat...

317
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,200
It's almost like we're completely 
different organisms.

318
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,330
Then we have to become stronger, too!

319
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,750
You really think we can be like them?

320
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,170
We just have to do our best, right?

321
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,260
We don't have any other choice.

322
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,470
That's not true.

323
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,070
We always had a choice.

324
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,600
But we chose to be here.

325
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,860
Kimari-san?

326
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,980
We chose this ourselves!

327
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,110
Well said!

328
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,610
Where are you going?

329
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,120
The toilet.

330
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,070
I think I'm getting used to throwing up.

331
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,110
Same.

332
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,380
I'll eat anything! I'll puke anything!

333
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,340
That was an actual hill.

334
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,140
Yeah, when I get home I can tell them...

335
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,540
expedition ships are amazing.

336
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,350
Yeah, I'll tell them it was really fun!

337
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,400
You must be joking!

338
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm not!

339
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,740
I'm sure that when this trip 
is over, that's how we'll feel!

340
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,960
I'd like to go outside for a bit!

341
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,710
That sounds good!

342
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,710
I wanna see, too!

343
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,810
Let's go!

344
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,320
It's pitch black!

345
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,070
This is the ocean we're crossing, huh?

346
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,820
To a continent of ice protected 
by storms and raging waves!

347
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,080
We really did choose to go there, didn't we?

348
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,960
What's that? Rain?

349
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,460
It's salty! It's the waves!

350
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,590
You're right!

351
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,590
It's salty!

352
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,150
Feeling better?

353
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,350
Yeah, we're totally fine!

354
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,150
Because we saw the whales yesterday!

355
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,400
Sounds like you've gotten used to the boat.

356
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,530
Yes!

357
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,910
But...

358
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,790
Once we make landfall, 
you're gonna get landsick.

359
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,440
For real?

360
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,040
<i>Left ten degrees, five miles!</i>

361
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,960
Where are they?

362
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,110
<i>No clouds.</i>

363
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,900
<i>No birds.</i>

364
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,760
<i>The view is a single sheet of blue.</i>

365
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,520
<i>I strain my eyes, 
but the horizon is all I can see.</i>

366
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,700
<i>I know I was probably hearing 
the sounds of the boat,</i>

367
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,540
<i>but that overwhelming scenery seemed 
to render everything silent.</i>

368
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,190
<i>I was looking out on an infinite 
world reminiscent of outer space.</i>

369
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,640
No way...

370
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,340
Is that...

371
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,000
It is.

372
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,250
Those are...

373
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,140
<i>In that moment, we knew for sure.</i>

374
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,300
<i>It really lay ahead... Antarctica!</i>

375
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,840
We're back, aren't we?

376
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,010
Though it'll be a long time before 
we're even opening the front door.
