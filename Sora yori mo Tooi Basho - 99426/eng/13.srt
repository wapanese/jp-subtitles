00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,690
Watch Duty

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,690
Tamaki
Miyake

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,690
Himi

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,690
Good morning!

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,860
You're late.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,010
Being late for watch duty 
makes trouble for everyone.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,590
Yes ma'am!

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,860
Today's menu, if you would.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,370
Food Waste

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,370
"Leftover special."

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,000
That's too honest!

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,250
At times like these, 
we go with you-know-what!

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
Today's Menu

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
Antarctic Style Pork

15
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
Eat your dried sardines, too!

16
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
Pork-on-rice and pork soup sets available!!

17
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
Cleaning duty: Team B

18
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,960
That's it for the watch report.

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,510
Is there any other business to address?

20
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,120
Um, I was thinking the premade 
Calpis is too thin...

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,380
It's too strong, isn't it?

22
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,070
Poor man's Calpis.

23
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,030
Don't call me "poor."

24
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,420
Person on duty there?

25
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,740
Well, the person on duty 
yesterday made it, not me,

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,280
but I'll do what I can.

27
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,200
It's cold!

28
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,100
They did say it would be windy...

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,800
What are we supposed to do after this?

30
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,580
Clean the bathrooms!

31
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,970
The summer team leaves
in 3 days!

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,140
I told you I hate hijiki!

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,150
Just eat it.

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm told you've been a little 
anemic lately, Honami-san.

35
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,650
Meanie!

36
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,460
Those high school girls 
were so cute at the start.

37
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,590
They weren't doing anything then.

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,740
Want some tea?

39
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,600
After so much time in Antarctica, 
you'll never reintegrate into society.

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,870
Like that.

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,290
Chisou, ron.

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,900
Riisoku, jyunchansanshiki, dora dora...

43
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,830
Sorry... with uraura, that's a sanbai man.

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,850
I told you not to rely on the suji!

45
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,290
I think that's a different thing, actually...

46
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,910
Doesn't the sound of a vacuum cleaner 
just make you think of home?

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,200
Where have you been?

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,060
They invited me out, 
so I did some interviews.

49
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,680
Island Stroll

50
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,680
Grotto

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,910
Oh, the island stroll?

52
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,540
Yes.

53
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,440
They took Shirase-chan and I 
out for that yesterday.

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,190
Yeah!

55
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,190
Why didn't you tell me?!

56
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,620
Because you were on watch duty today!

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,110
Odd man out!

58
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,740
Shut up!

59
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,580
Ow!

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
Who cares about some island stroll?

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,530
I'm going out on the ice operation later!

62
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,330
That's right! I gotta hurry!

63
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,590
It's almost time for the meetup!

64
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,310
Hey!

65
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,000
We're all going on the ice operation.

66
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,880
Island Stroll

67
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,880
Grotto

68
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,030
Really?

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,940
The four of us will be heading out 
to join the ice operation. Over.

70
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,340
<i>Roger that. Be safe.</i>

71
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,190
Which should we take?

72
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,610
Hi!

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,430
I could just die!

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,790
Wow! Glaciers!

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,660
You're shaving from these big blocks of ice?

76
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,290
It's forbidden to remove 
things from Antarctica,

77
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,540
so it's the only souvenir 
we're allowed to take freely.

78
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,140
This ice is full of air that's 
tens of thousands of years old,

79
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,010
so as it melts, it pops.

80
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,760
Want to eat some?

81
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah!

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,970
So this is how thousand-year-old air tastes!

83
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,090
You can distinguish it?

84
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,820
When I grow up, I've gotta 
drink alcohol with this.

85
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,140
I bet you'd be a loud drunk, Kimari.

86
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,740
You think?

87
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,870
When this starts up, it really hits 
home that summer's almost over.

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,120
Really?

89
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,560
Soon, it'll be autumn, then winter...

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,620
The winter team!

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,460
What do you do during winter?

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,840
All kinds of things. 
We play games, drink booze...

93
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,840
Soumen

94
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,350
Of course, research and 
investigation is important,

95
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,800
but when we hit June, it's nighttime all day.

96
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,600
I see...

97
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,780
"Polar night," right?

98
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,710
During the day, there's a faint 
brightness around the horizon,

99
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,860
but that's the only change you see.

100
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,620
Otherwise, it just stays 
night for a long, long time.

101
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,870
Perpetual night, huh?

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,750
But that just makes the stars 
all the more more beautiful!

103
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,700
You can see the aurora, too!

104
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,750
The aurora...

105
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,390
That's right, we never saw it!

106
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,160
Because we only get a tiny bit of night.

107
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,860
We got a photo with penguins, 
ate shaved ice...

108
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,970
we haven't gotten the aurora 
or the Antarctic stars!

109
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,910
Because the sun doesn't 
go down, like I told you.

110
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,130
Help!

111
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,160
Help!

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,900
But I'm happy! But they stink! But I'm happy!

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,830
What's she doing?

114
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,860
But they stink! But I'm happy!

115
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,880
I need to get back to work.

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,900
You guys take it easy.

117
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,040
But they stink! But I'm happy!

118
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,200
This'll be your last day 
on the frozen sea, right?

119
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
But they stink!

120
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,450
That's right...

121
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,260
But I'm happy!

122
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,080
I told you to help me!

123
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,690
Sorry, I can't get within
five meters of them...

124
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,700
Do something!

125
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,370
Sorry, I can't!

126
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,340
We've really gotten used 
to it all, haven't we?

127
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,600
This scenery, too...

128
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,310
Hey, just hypothetically...

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,850
Hypothetically...

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,090
Well, no one else needs the rooms.

131
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,730
And we can keep sending 
video from here, right?

132
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,620
So there's no reason we <i>have </i>
to leave right now, is there?

133
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,740
You're going to hurt me!

134
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,340
I'm not, I'm not.

135
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,710
Liar!

136
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,400
What did you think? If we don't go 
back now, we're stuck here all year.

137
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,590
I know that. It'll be fine.

138
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,060
I bet that once it gets 
dark I could sleep forever.

139
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,280
What about school? By the time we get 
back, everyone will have graduated.

140
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,570
Well...

141
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,280
What about our families?

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
And Yuzu's drama?

143
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,540
Well, I do understand not 
wanting to go back...

144
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,060
You'll come back, then?

145
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,230
What? Sure...

146
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,450
For the winter stay. All four of us!

147
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,490
Fine.

148
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,370
You'd better mean it! 
You'd better not let me down!

149
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,870
Yeah, yeah...

150
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,620
I'm asking seriously.

151
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm answering seriously.

152
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,830
Okay, then!

153
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,260
But... what are we going to do?

154
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,720
Remember what the captain said?

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,890
If there was anything we wanted to do 
before we leave, we should tell her.

156
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,580
Before we leave, huh?

157
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,950
Are you sure that's all you want?

158
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,250
Yeah. Before we leave, we want 
to play with everyone here!

159
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,790
Hey! Let 'er rip!

160
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,250
You can do it!

161
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,170
Let's do this!

162
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,430
Captain! If I hit it out of the park, 
will you consider my offer?

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,930
Sure.

164
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm holding you to that!

165
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,840
He still hasn't given up?

166
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,150
Can he hit it?

167
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,200
I doubt it. Gin-chan is known as 
the "Antarctic 19-in-Pinstripes."

168
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,060
Her pitches are first-rate.

169
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,930
And...

170
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,870
No one can dodge them.

171
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,960
No way...

172
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,110
Don't worry.

173
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,850
Takako could still hit them.

174
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,760
<i>Takako...</i>

175
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,390
<i>You're watching, right?</i>

176
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,020
Hinata-san!

177
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,950
Lavatory | Bath
Washroom

178
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,950
What, now?

179
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,720
If you were gonna cut it, you should 
have done it when we arrived.

180
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,200
I just got the urge to cut it.

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,130
Should I do it?

182
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,790
Kimari-san, please stand back.

183
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,080
Aw...

184
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,420
Up to where?

185
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,050
Seriously?

186
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,070
Yeah!

187
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,050
Farewell, Summer Team!

188
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,200
You can't keep putting it off. 
She's really going, you know...

189
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,480
Farewell, Summer Team!

190
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,690
Challenge for Antarctica 
High School Girl Reporters

191
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,820
Remember us when you're home

192
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,450
There.

193
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,830
Is this flag handmade?

194
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,400
The guests of honor are here.

195
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
Come on, line up here!

196
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Okay!

197
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,650
Huh?

198
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,920
Well? Does it look good on me?

199
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,680
You really are your mother's daughter.

200
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,360
You look just like her when you smile.

201
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,470
What happened? Broken heart?

202
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,560
No.

203
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,750
But maybe, in a way...

204
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,750
In a way?

205
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,810
Use your imagination.

206
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,060
I don't get it!

207
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,960
Normally, we'd be changing 
places with the winter team,

208
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,070
but there's no one swapping in this time,

209
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,610
so it's just a farewell party 
for the departing summer team.

210
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,340
Well, Captain?

211
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,250
You've done an excellent job, everyone.

212
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,960
This morning, the weather is nice. 
It's an excellent morning for a departure.

213
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,490
In particular, I'd like to talk about

214
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,740
Japan's first high school-aged 
Antarctic research team members.

215
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,770
This was a major experiment.

216
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm sure they were all nervous.

217
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,750
We were all very, very nervous, too.

218
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,920
But they did an excellent 
job as expedition members.

219
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,410
The male team members' internal wishing

220
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,080
for them to stay has been 
so loud, it's audible.

221
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,850
But they are going home.

222
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,830
It's time to give up on them.

223
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,830
Lastly...

224
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Thank you for everything.

225
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,700
Even after you go home, I hope 
you'll occasionally think of us,

226
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,140
here in the darkness, far over the horizon, 
silently lasting through the winter.

227
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,240
Let's meet again here some day.

228
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,150
Now, as a representative of the summer team,

229
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,810
Kobuchizawa Shirase-san.

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,280
Yes ma'am.

231
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,470
Everyone.

232
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,050
Good morning.

233
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,960
As you all know,

234
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,550
my mother was a member of 
your Antarctic expedition.

235
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,510
She loved Antarctica, and left 
our house in her obsession.

236
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,170
When I looked at her,

237
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,780
to be honest, it was hard for me to have 
positive feelings about Antarctica.

238
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,190
I think wanting to change that 
feeling was the reason I came here.

239
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,870
A place further than the universe.

240
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,530
Mom... rather, my mother called it that.

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,320
It's a place that strips everything bare.

242
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,770
Time, life, hearts...

243
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,240
It's a place with nothing to 
protect you and nowhere to hide.

244
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,040
It's an environment that exposes 
everything we're embarrassed about,

245
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,070
and everything we want to hide,

246
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,870
and so naked and crying, we're forced to 
come face-to-face with who we really are.

247
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,170
We've overcome trial after trial together.

248
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,070
And from that, I think I now understand...

249
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,800
the reason my mother loved this place was 
not just this scenery, this sky, this wind,

250
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,090
but also the time she spent here, 
overcoming things with her team.

251
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,000
She loved this atmosphere,

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,840
where you have no choice but to 
overcome things with your team,

253
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,600
with nothing else to get in the way.

254
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,080
I love this place.

255
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,100
Good luck over the winter.

256
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,230
I'll be back again, I swear.

257
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,230
Are you crying?

258
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,510
Here.

259
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,220
You made these for us?

260
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,060
With leftovers, of course.

261
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,120
Um...

262
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,360
Wow, thanks...

263
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,360
Could you take this back to Yu-kun? 
He's waiting in Japan?

264
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,610
What?

265
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,470
Don't go!

266
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,990
You smell of alcohol...

267
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,130
Of course I do! I've been drinking!

268
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,490
Don't worry. Have this.

269
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,720
Shirase-san, thank her! Thank her!

270
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,620
Just go already!

271
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,130
The Follow Backs Won't Stop

272
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,130
So that's your signature, Yuzuki-chan?

273
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,500
Looks like an idol's.

274
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,260
How many of these did you sell?

275
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,640
Would you please cease your babbling?

276
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,680
Here.

277
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,030
Um...

278
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,390
Yes?

279
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm looking forward to your drama.

280
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,900
Though I won't get to see 
it until I get back...

281
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,640
Okay...

282
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,800
How'd it go?

283
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,660
There really are people 
looking forward to it...

284
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,890
Of course there are!

285
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,040
You'd better work hard!

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,770
Okay!

287
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,860
It's time to go!

288
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,890
Okay!

289
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,930
Take care.

290
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,430
Thank you!

291
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,550
Actually, I should be thanking you...

292
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,070
Do you remember what we talked 
about in the van that first day?

293
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,190
Talking with you then really 
gave me a lot of courage.

294
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,910
When I saw your faces, I realized I 
couldn't let our plans be canceled.

295
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,740
You were thinking they might?

296
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,780
Yes.

297
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,890
For adults, there's a moment 
when you shouldn't be honest.

298
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,210
Take care of the captain.

299
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,650
You heard her.

300
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,040
Well, listen to you.

301
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,570
Go on, get in!

302
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,050
Okay!

303
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,070
And take this.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,760
I think my mother would be mad if you 
didn't let her stay for the winter.

305
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,690
But...

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,940
I don't need it anymore.

307
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,850
Understood.

308
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,180
Let's go.

309
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,990
They're gone.

310
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,710
The average age here just jumped.

311
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,310
Ouch!

312
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,240
Well, we've got a lot of time ahead of us!

When we first came here, 
it seemed so far away...

316
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,560
Well, that's what a journey is.

317
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,450
It's not over yet.

318
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,170
There's still the 60 degrees, 
the 50 degrees, the 40 degrees...

319
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,540
Screaming!

320
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,660
I'll probably throw up again.

321
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,980
It's okay.

322
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,190
Barfing and barfing, 
thinking "I'm so sick, I'm gonna die..."

323
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,040
That's fine. That's part of the journey, too.

324
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,250
Do you think we've gotten a little stronger?

325
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,750
Or maybe we've gotten sloppier...

326
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,520
It's because everything is bigger here.

327
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,960
Is this what we're wearing?

328
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,650
It's the last one! 
We need to make it special!

329
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,090
Let's see... This will be my final 
catchy, witty, sensational report...

330
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,530
Maybe you should put down the script?

331
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,280
Okay, let's go!

332
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,660
Wait! It's the last one! 
I need a little more time!

333
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,550
The aurora!

334
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,050
You're right!

335
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,020
Oh, no! I can't get it to show up!

336
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,840
It's okay.

337
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,730
If that happens once in a while.

The real thing is ten thousand times more beautiful

342
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,720
I know.

343
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,580
That's it!

344
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,260
That's the South Star! I'm calling it!

345
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,910
I don't think it's that bright...

346
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,590
Hey.

347
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,240
Let's say goodbye here.

348
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,140
Kimari...

349
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,210
Does that mean we won't 
be together anymore?

350
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,670
The opposite. It means that even when 
we're not together, we can be together.

351
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,900
After all... we're still who we are.

352
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,590
Who's that a quote from? Hinata-san?

353
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,910
It's not bad, though.

354
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,310
Right?

355
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,890
We still have a lot we have to do, right?

356
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,640
Yeah. When we're done doing that, 
let's go on another journey.

357
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,010
The four of us.

358
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,590
The four of us, yes.

359
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, Shirase still has her million yen. 
I've got my savings, too...

360
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,040
That's gone now.

361
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,740
I left it there.

362
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,350
Treasure

363
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,370
In the place further than the universe.

364
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,860
<i>When you go on a journey, there are 
things you learn for the first time.</i>

365
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,360
<i>That this scenery is indispensable.</i>

366
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,370
<i>That people change, the world changes, 
even when you're not looking.</i>

367
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,870
<i>That there's no such 
thing as a "nothing" day.</i>

368
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,370
<i>That your house has its own smell.</i>

369
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,130
<i>If you want to learn those things, 
you've got to get moving.</i>

370
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,140
<i>Then just keep moving until you see 
something you've never seen before.</i>

371
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,880
Offerings

372
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,390
<i>No matter how far you go, 
the world is so big...</i>

373
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,550
<i>You'll definitely find something new.</i>

374
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,740
<i>It's a little scary, 
but I know you can do it.</i>

375
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,120
<i>Because...</i>

376
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,280
Off to the airport

377
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,280
Almost home

378
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm back!

379
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:19,620
Megu-chan

380
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,160
I'm back!

381
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,160
I'm homeâ€”

382
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,660
Oh, too bad.

383
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,670
Megu-chan

384
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,880
Right now, I'm in the Arctic

385
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,950
Why?

386
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,120
Why?

387
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,390
<i>People who feel the same way 
will find you right away.</i>

388
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,350
Why?!

389
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,020
We'll Go On Another Journey Someday
