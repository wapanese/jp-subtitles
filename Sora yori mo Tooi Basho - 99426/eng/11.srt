1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,770
No! I don't want to die!

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,650
Shut up!

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,810
Let go! This is why I 
didn't want to come here!

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,740
Kimari-san...

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,150
Shut up! If you want her to 
live, fork over the cash!

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,580
Help me! I have a turtle 
and a hamster who need me!

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,580
I'm sorry, I'm just a temp. You'll want 
to talk to the banking manager...

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,080
This is no time to be playing around.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,330
You're still laughing?!

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,590
She's right. It's not nice 
to keep laughing at her...

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,260
Yuzuki-chan. That's the kind 
of thing that hurts most...

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,600
Can you hear me?

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,540
There it is!

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,640
Kimari!

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,390
Rin! Mom!

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,160
What happened to your face?

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,520
We've gotta take a picture!

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,900
That's the first thing you have 
to say after all this time?

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,400
Sis, are you gonna do your New Year's 
Eve broadcast looking like that?

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,400
My stomach hurts!

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,360
We're working on it...

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,860
Next. Miyake-san?

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,410
Yes?

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,300
Some friends of yours heard about this 
relay test and came to talk to you.

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,490
Friends?

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,420
Of mine?

27
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,670
Miyake-san, it's been so long!

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,670
We haven't heard from you for 
so long, so we were worried.

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,550
What is it?

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,570
Did it go down?

31
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,030
Hinata?

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,980
Ouchies! My leg's cramped!

33
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,590
Shirase, sorry, you take over!

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,340
Hey! Hinata!

40
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,740
It's here.

41
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,030
That's all the extra stuff we needed

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,720
brought by DROMLAN from Japan 
on its way to the new station.

43
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,970
Which means we have everything we need now.

44
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,630
Of course, we won't be able 
to create an observatory

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,040
that can see the stars this year right away.

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,800
But a few years from now, if we try for it...

47
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,050
We should go, shouldn't we?

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,470
I think that's what everyone wants, at least.

49
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,890
Still... that's the place where Takako died.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,320
It's not safe at all.

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,830
What should we do?

52
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,820
New Year's

53
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,820
From Syowa Station

54
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,820
This is awful!

55
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,680
I bet Mom's spreading it all
over social media right now!

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,570
What's the big deal? It makes better 
advertising for the broadcast.

57
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,760
Hinata?

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh... do mine, too!

59
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,650
Oh? Your only New Year's 
card is to your manager?

60
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,710
None for your friends from earlier?

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,510
Well... they're New Year's cards,

62
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,310
but they won't reach anyone until 
the boat gets back to Japan anyway.

63
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,380
I'm gonna hit the can!

64
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,120
Ouch!

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,300
Stupid thing...

66
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,390
Is she annoyed?

67
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,040
Did it hurt that much?

68
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,330
She seems a bit stressed out.

69
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,680
Shirase-chan, you're going, too?

70
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,010
Piss off!

71
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,370
Piss off!

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,420
Piss off, damn it!

73
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,160
Stupid thing!

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,910
Piss off!

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,150
There you are!

76
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,610
The weather's cleared up,

77
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,200
so they said they'd bring us along for 
the sea ice and geological testing!

78
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,720
I'll prepare the camera, 
so think about your report!

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,310
Huh? Oh. Right.

80
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,660
Expedition! Expedition!

81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,320
Don't forget, you said you'd do the report!

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,660
Don't claim later that 
you don't want to do it!

83
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,090
Um... Hinata...

84
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,610
About before...

85
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,090
That was a test, so it won't cut the mustard.

86
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,020
No—

87
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,160
Hurry up! They're heading out soon!

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,840
Coming!

89
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,350
We did this together three years ago.

90
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,310
Takako-senpai just wanted to do everything.

91
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,760
She did?

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,010
Yeah, she went all over.

93
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,250
She was here, too, Shirase-chan!

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,610
Isn't that nice?

95
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,470
Yeah...

96
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,620
Take that!

97
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,960
What's that?

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,380
It's all ice up ahead, so we're 
digging a hole with steam.

99
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,390
After that, I think we went to Rundvågshetta.

100
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,550
Sounds like a powerful name!

101
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,140
It's a place with exposed rock.

102
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,070
If you ask Nobue-san, 
she might take you there.

103
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,680
Let's go!

104
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,190
<i>Sea Ice here! Nobue-san at geology? 
Do you read? Over!</i>

105
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,460
<i>Haven't heard from him since Christmas.</i>

106
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,470
<i>The garnet he gave me two years ago...</i>

107
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,990
Dry rocks and dry love...

108
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,470
No email. No nothing from Yu-kun.

109
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,620
<i>She's currently unable to talk. Over.</i>

110
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,600
It's cold!

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,380
Seriously. The difference in 
air temperature is extreme...

112
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,060
Please, stop it!

113
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,840
Look! It's amazing!

114
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,950
So cold!

115
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,480
Watch for animals

116
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,680
Antarctica really is amazing, huh?

117
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,440
It's neat to see it from this angle...

118
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,120
The sky is flowing by!

119
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,900
I wonder if we'll see an aurora?

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
At night, maybe.

121
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,630
But it won't become night

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,870
during the time we're here.

123
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,580
Hinata.

124
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,860
Is something bothering you?

125
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,390
Bothering me?

126
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,150
Well, my lips get so 
chapped with the dry air,

127
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,140
but my lip balm is frozen,
so it's hard to put on.

128
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,660
I know how you feel!

129
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,250
It really is hard! 
It's like your skin is peeling off.

130
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,510
Right?

131
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,650
So dry!

132
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,150
Be Careful Going Outside

133
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,440
<i>All crew outdoors, please seek
shelter in the main building</i>

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,160
<i>or a building with emergency rations.</i>

135
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,370
It's not getting better at all.

136
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,040
You should probably give up on it.

137
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,870
Where'd Shirase go, anyway?

138
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,550
Someone asked her earlier if 
she knew how to play Mahjong...

139
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,450
For real? Can she?

140
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,550
It sounded fun, so I looked 
over her shoulder, but...

141
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,530
Hey, how do you read the one that 
looks like a person next to a five?

142
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,350
"Go."

143
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,870
Hey, you've got some white ones 
mixed up in your reserves.

144
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,640
They're not reserves.

145
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,390
That bird is so cute!

146
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,140
"Get out!"

147
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,320
...she said.

148
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,620
That's rather cruel.

149
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,460
Right? I was only asking questions!

150
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,460
Shirase's always been testy!

Three Dora nets me 16,000 points.

Are you for real?

157
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,060
Hey, have you been playing with 
Takako since you were little?

158
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,270
Yes, once in a while...

159
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,860
Let's quit. We can't win.

160

Jantei

161
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,090
Not against the daughter of Gin and Takako...

162
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,370
Is Miyake-san here?

163
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,670
She's probably in the bath.

164
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,820
What's up?

165
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,430
We got an email from her 
friends addressed to the base.

166
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,690

Re: About the broadcast timetable

178
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,340
National Antarctic Research Center
(To Miyake Hinata) Hanyu Daisan High School Track Team

179
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,820
you quit the track team and
quit school so suddenly

180
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,150
We wish we'd said something to the older girls. 
We're sorry for leaving you all alone.

181
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,020
Shirase?

182
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,430
Are you...

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,070
Hinata-chan?

184
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,280
National Antarctic Research Center
(To Miyake Hinata)

185
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,750
You saw it?

186
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,500
Just a little.

187
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,540
But that was addressed to Hinata-san...

188
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,500
How could you do something like that?

189
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,500
But... but I was worried, so...

190
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,510
You seemed so mad about something, and...

191
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,260
you wouldn't say anything...

192
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,610
You were mad?

193
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,010
What, you saw it?

194
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,530
You should have said something!

195
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,980
I was worried.

196
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,270
I thought you were hiding something!

197
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,270
Something you weren't telling us!

198
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,030
We're sorry for leaving you all alone.

199
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,950
Let me tell you in advance, 
it's a totally gross story.

200
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,550
I don't want to talk about it, 
and I hate that you asked me.

201
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,710
Just tell us.

202
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,180
In short, it's about why 
I stopped going to club.

203
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,640
It's the competition, 
so the fastest people should go.

204
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,970
Your year and stuff doesn't matter!

205
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,040
But for the third-years, 
this will be their last competition...

206
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,790
Exactly! It would be more 
rude to go easy on them!

207
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,320
Two hundred meter, Miyake Hinata.

208
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,170
Yes!

209
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,880
Didn't you say something to that idiot?

210
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,070
O-Of course... we told
her to be more sensitive...

211
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,330
In that instant, nothing mattered to me.

212
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,250
But it does matter! 
They're the ones to blame.

213
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,620
Humans can be scary, huh?

214
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,020
After I quit, they kept spreading all 
kinds of rumors to lay the blame on me.

215
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,070
Is that why you quit school?

216
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,480
Hinata.

217
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,740
Sorry I'm a loser!

218
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,110
Then the ones who sent the email are...

219
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,610
Yeah. My old teammates.

220
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,200
They want to talk during the broadcast.

221
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,000
They said they were proud their 
friend went to Antarctica.

222
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,880
Though mainly, I was thinking 
"Oh, were we friends?"

223
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,570
Well?

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,960
What? Different from what you imagined?

225
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,010
It's almost otherworldly, huh?

226
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,680
Oh, uh, yeah!

227
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,440
What an unusual color!

228
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,050
We'll set up a tent and 
antenna down that way.

229
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,270
Okay!

230
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,750
Hey!

231
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,700
How long are you gonna 
drag this out? Forget it.

232
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,020
I don't like being treated this way.

233
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,930
But...

234
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,710
Look, why do you think I came to Antarctica?

235
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,210
Because there's nothing here!

236
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,210
I wanted to go to an empty place 
with no one to tie me down!

237
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,220
Look, isn't it amazing?

238
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,470
Glaciers! Strata! Water from melted snow!

239
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,360
Colors and shapes I've never seen before!

240
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,100
We're in a place isolated 
from everything we know,

241
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,980
a completely different world 
from where we've been before.

242
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,230
That's what I came here to enjoy!

243
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,830
But it doesn't mean anything
if you're all sad, right?

244
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,610
Got it. Then we'll forget it!

245
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,380
First, we've got camping to do!

246
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,240
It's not a game!

247
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,670
Shirase?

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,370
It does mean something.

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,040
It absolutely does mean something!

250
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,440
It's like a sci-fi movie, isn't it?

251
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,030
Want to drink the water? It's delicious.

252
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,180
We can drink it?

253
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,770
In a way, it's the cleanest 
water on the planet.

254
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,040
Hardly anyone's ever touched it,

255
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,940
and it doesn't get warm 
enough to breed bacteria.

256
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,580
I'm first!

257
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,190
No fair!

258
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,080
How is it?

259
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,490
Delicious!

260
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,000
I want to try, too!

261
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,950
You're right! It's delicious and cold!

262
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,500
It really hits the spot!

263
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,050
Want some, Shirase-chan?

264
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,330
Later.

265
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,840
We got through.

266
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,980
Talk.

267
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,720
Me?

268
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,180
U-Um... this is Kobuchizawa at Rundvågshetta.

269
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,130
Over.

270
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,350
<i>This is Syowa. We read you loud and clear.</i>

271
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,890
How is the scenery? Over.

272
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,130
<i>Um... It's like we're surrounded by cake.</i>

273
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,050
Cake?

274
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,360
Takako said the same thing.

275
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,300
The minute we got there,
"I want to eat chocolate cake!"

276
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,280
My mother said that?

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,400
It's the best natural water I've ever had!

278
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,390
Like this?

279
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,000
Perfect.

280
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,980
Kimari-san, you're good 
at the strangest things.

281
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,260
That's not strange, is it?

282
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,260
Can they see this on the satellites?

283
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,810
Yes. We use these so they can check 
our location on the satellites.

284
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,140
It will definitely show up.

285
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,030
It's not taking it now.

286
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,150
Yu-kun...

287
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,240
Yu-kun!

288
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,240
Um...

289
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,900
Don't let it bother you. 
She does this constantly.

290
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,610
We even put a plate here. 
Someone's watching, huh?

291
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,040
It's nothing personal, okay?

292
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,550
What bliss!

293
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,000
Especially since it's getting colder.

294
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,060
And now it's time for...

295
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,440
Ta-da!

296
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,320
Next time we get hot water 
going, let's make tamagoyaki!

297
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,440
You really like tamagoyaki, huh?

298
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,060
She did eat a lot of it for 
breakfast in Singapore!

299
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,300
Hinata.

300
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,710
I'm going to collect water. Come with me.

301
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,130
We don't have enough? 
Sorry I used it all earlier...

302
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,010
Kimari-san.

303
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,170
Wow, it's freezing when the wind blows.

304
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,270
I could just die right now!

305
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,360
I've been thinking about what 
I'd do in your position.

306
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,440
We're sorry for leaving you all alone.

307
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,590
If someone had treated me so awfully,

308
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,440
then called me up out of the blue, 
as though nothing happened,

309
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,250
wanting to apologize for the 
permanent damage they'd done...

310
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,880
Hey, look...

311
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,820
I couldn't be okay with it.

312
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,330
I couldn't smile.

313
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,070
You're not me, though.

314
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,550
I know, but...

315
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,580
I know, but...

316
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,340
Shirase.

317
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,330
Take off your gloves.

318
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,090
Hand them over.

319
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,590
Your hands are enough.

320
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,150
Shirase, you're so annoying, 
the way you keep talking and talking.

321
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,370
Thanks.

322
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,450
I'm sorry. I guess I'm still scared.

323
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,290
Hinata...

324
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm scared.

325
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,860
But we...

326
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,990
I said your hands were enough, remember?

327
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,680
Thanks for bringing me along.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,880
Tamagoyaki's ready!

329
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,540
Okay! We're on our way!

330
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,790
C'mon!

331
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,020
12/31
Choose Your Own New Year's Soba
Tempura
Mochi
Plain

332
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,780
You suck! They're not supposed
to be flat noodles!

333
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,030
They're thin enough!

334
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,920
Start from scratch.

335
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,030
Really?!

336
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,830
<i>Ready to roll in ten minutes.</i>

337
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,910
Understood!

338
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,240
My sun tan never recovered...

339
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,280
It's proof that you're 
enjoying Antarctica.

340
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,970
Hey.

341
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,780
Do you think I'll feel 
better if I forgive them?

342
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,820
You want to forgive them?

343
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,740
If it would make me feel better, I might.

344
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,120
But when I imagine them looking all relieved 
afterwords, it gets under my skin.

345
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,760
"Piss off"?

346
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,380
Yeah.

347
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm a pretty petty person, aren't I?

348
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,620
It's 9:00 AM here.

349
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,740
A six-hour difference from Japan...

350
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,030
Before we start, may I say one thing?

351
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,720
Shirase-chan?

352
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,800
I beg your pardon, but could 
you leave Miyake Hinata alone?

353
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,950
Shirase...

354
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,230
You might think Hinata has been holding a 
grudge against you since she quit school,

355
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,830
that she's been suffering badly.

356
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,880
Maybe you think she spends every day crying,

357
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,030
thinking about what happened to her.

358
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,850
But...

359
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,490
But...

360
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,090
But that's not true!

361
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,170
Hinata-chan is having a super, 
amazing fun time with us!

362
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,190
She's having a really fulfilling trip 
of the sort you can't get where you are!

363
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,860
Hey!

364
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,020
Hinata is already looking forward!

365
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,270
She's already walking!

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,510
She's taking her steps with us!

367
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,020
Shirase!

368
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,130
It's fine! It's friendship!

369
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,040
Unlike Hinata, I'm a real jerk, 
so I'll say it outright.

370
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,500
You can't live your lives in 
this halfway state forever!

371
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,370
You hurt someone and made them suffer!

372
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,260
Now you get to live with that!

373
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,140
That's what you get for hurting someone!

374
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,100
That's what you get for hurting my friend!

375
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,530
Shirase!

376
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,550
You think you can come crawling back now?

377
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,000
Piss off!

378
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,410
Let's get things ready.

379
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,220
Okay.

380
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,960
<i>The year is nearing its end.</i>

381
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,530
Will it be on TV?

382
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,640
Last year's video, yeah.

383
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,710
It's here!

384
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,730
Yu-kun! Yu-kun! Yu-kun!

385
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,290
Let's do it, too!

386
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,450
Casting away our worldly desires!

387
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,480
You mean...

388
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,600
...like this?

389
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,730
Let's bash the bad thoughts 
away, Hinata-chan!

390
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,980
What if we break it?

391
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,490
So what if you do? It's just a drum can.

392
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,370
Good point!

393
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,850
Okay, let's do the first one together!

394
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,500
One, two...

395
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,520
A Place Further
Than the Universe
