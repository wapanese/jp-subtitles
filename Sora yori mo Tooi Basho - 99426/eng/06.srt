1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,190
Here.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,120
Why did she have to glare at us like that?

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Just because we're going on a trip doesn't 
mean we've done something wrong.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,330
I think that's just her job.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,910
Yeah, yeah! It was crazy!

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,700
So? So? What happened?

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,670
A plane!

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,850
Is this the plane we're taking?

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,550
I think so.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,550
Will it really fly?

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,630
I always dreamed about being a plane!

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,430
Being a plane?

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,930
Yes, being a plane!

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:04,210
A Place Further Than the Universe

Dear Mom

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,870
Dear Mom
Dear Mom

20
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,920
What?

21
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,530
It means the plane has stabilized 
and you can walk around.

22
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,300
Yes!

23
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm so nervous...

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,880
I didn't realize this was your 
first time on a plane, Shirase!

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,880
I watched my mother fly 
out a number of times,

26
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,520
but I've never been on one myself.

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,990
I bet you've flown lots of 
times, right, Yuzu-chan?

28
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,020
For work, certainly...

29
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,770
How do I use this?

30
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,530
Same question! Same question!

31
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,480
It says "Games"...

32
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,780
Um, you press this...

33
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,450
Is this soba?

34
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,820
Can I trade my celery for your sweet egg?

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,040
No.

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,540
Green tea.

37
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,120
Right! Go right!

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,300
Hey, stay on your side!

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,060
Why? Why am I the only 
one who didn't get any?

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,770
Because you were asleep.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,190
Um, turn off this "data roaming" thing...

42
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,700
Wake her up.

43
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,200
Kimari-san!

44
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,170
I can't believe you slept through all that.

45
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,380
We're here?

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,020
Wow! So much English!

47
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,550
Of course there is.

48
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,280
Which way do we go?

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,050
We're taking the subway, 
so we'll follow the MRT signs.

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,110
What do you mean, you forgot 
to change your money?

51
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,280
And to change all your money...

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,320
we're leaving in two days, you know.

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,810
You need to tell me this stuff in advance!

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,550
It's hot...

55
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,940
It's summer!

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,850
Well, we're right by the equator, after all.

57
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,400
Last time I came, I could 
have just died right then.

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,090
Where's the merlion? The merlion!

59
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,830
It's not here, clearly.

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,330
What a strange building...

61
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,830
Shirase-san!

62
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,720
Discount please!

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,130
Please!

64
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,780
We can shop later!

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Darn it. It took us forever 
just to get to the hotel...

66
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
Did it?

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,930
Because you bought all that stuff!

68
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,650
We only have one day before we have 
to get on a plane to Fremantle.

69
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,940
We need to be efficient...

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,710
A double bed!

71
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,200
One, two!

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,690
First comes rock! Rock-paper-scissors!

73
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,210
Yes!

74
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,450
What's going on?

75
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,410
We're betting on who has to 
sleep next to you, Kimari.

76
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,510
Kimari-san, why don't you 
just start out on the floor?

77
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,600
You'll probably fall 
sooner or later anyway...

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,700
Why?

79
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,130
Because that's what you did during training!

80
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,630
So cold...

81
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,130
So warm...

82
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,980
I don't remember at all.

83
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,390
That's why it's a problem!

84
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,770
Hey, let's put our valuables 
in here before we head out!

85
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,770
Japanese yen, plane ticket, and...

86
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,020
Huh?

87
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,620
What's wrong?

88
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,280
N-Nothing!

89
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,030
We'll get ready in our rooms and 
meet in the lobby in 30 minutes.

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,140
I've seen that! It's a pool, right?

91
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,930
Yes, it is!

92
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,430
What's that?

93
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,430
There it is!

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,000
It's so...

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,780
It's not as disappointing as I expected.

96
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,210
Yeah! I'd heard it was more disappointing!

97
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,530
Were you hoping for disappointment?

98
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,620
Line up.

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
We gotta pose! We gotta pose!

100
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,750
Then...

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,900
What, exactly, is this?

102
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,560
Is this really oolong tea?

103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,680
That's what it says.

104
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,690
Miso ramen?

105
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,670
I told you, they won't have any.

106
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,190
But it's ramen!

107
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,570
Because of the miso.

108
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,200
It's so...

109
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,700
There must be some mistake...

110
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,800
Stuffed to bursting.

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,130
Shirase-san, your mouth's hanging open.

112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,140
Look what I bought!

113
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,890
Durian ice cream!

114
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,860
How do you even have room?

115
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,920
It's dessert!

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,270
Join me, Hinata-chan!

117
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,110
You want me to eat that?

118
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,810
Oh? Shirase-chan, then!

119
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,860
What?

120
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,570
Huh?

121
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,240
I warned you...

122
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,940
Hey, Yuzu?

123
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,510
Yes?

124
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,010
You took out your passport when 
we went through customs, right?

125
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,390
Well... yes.

126
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,450
You still have yours, right?

127
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,100
Of course. It's right here.

128
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,220
Of course it is.

129
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,360
Wow, cool!

130
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,960
Where's the pool?

131
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,700
It's over there, but you can't 
go in unless you're a guest.

132
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,330
What? Really?

133
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,050
It's just an ordinary pool.

134
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,500
Though it does have a nice view...

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,830
No way! You've been in it?

136
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,790
Once, for a shoot...

137
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,370
Hey, w-was it a sexy bikini pin-up?!

138
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,630
Are you making fun of me?

139
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,530
Was it?!

140
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,880
No!

141
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,850
It's a bit like the crossroads 
of the sea, isn't it?

142
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,870
Is it?

143
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,360
Then people leave here to 
go all over the world, huh?

144
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,380
Probably.

145
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,070
It's kind of amazing, isn't it?

146
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,310
What is?

147
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,500
In two days, we're leaving here.

148
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,120
But this view will remain the same, right?

149
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,550
Of course it will.

150
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,670
We'll go to Antarctica, 
and come back to Japan,

151
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,270
but boats will still come here every day,

152
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,890
and the city will be full of people...

153
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,830
Going to school, working their jobs, 
hanging out with their friends...

154
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,460
They'll all keep living their lives...

155
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,210
It's the same in Japan.

156
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,300
School's still being held.

157
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,420
They're probably having 
dinner right about now.

158
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,780
In places we've never seen, 
locations we've never been...

159
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,620
So many people are living 
so many kinds of lives.

160
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,090
Every day, without stopping.

161
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,920
That's amazing!

162
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,920
Even though it's common sense.

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,630
But I know what you're getting at.

164
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,960
Hinata-san?

165
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,510
What?

166
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,140
You're hiding something, aren't you?

167
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,020
You're <i>hiding something</i>, aren't you?

168
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,340
You can't find it anywhere?

169
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,430
Well... I'm sure it'll turn up.

170
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,670
It's so important, after all.

171
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,870
But then it would have come up 
after all this searching, right?

172
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,670
That's true...

173
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,670
Without a passport, not only 
can you not leave the country,

174
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,480
you can't go back to Japan, either.

175
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,120
Really?

176
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,430
Then, if it doesn't turn up...

177
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,360
Oh! Long ago, I did live in Japan!

178
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,610
Oh, the good old days!

179
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,990
...is how it'll be.

180
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,360
Why would I still work in a 
convenience store over here?

181
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,070
Our flight's in two days!

182
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,520
Don't worry, don't worry!

183
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,780
We'll work it out somehow. Somehow!

184
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,060
How?

185
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,960
Somehow!

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,200
I mean, there're lots of options...

187
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,250
<i>What</i> options?

188
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,550
Options... like...

189
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,500
Right back atcha!

190
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,370
Huh?

191
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,260
Anyway, let's look it up.

192
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,240
If you lose your passport,

193
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,510
you can get a new one printed at the embassy.

194
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,330
The shortest time is... half a day.

195
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,270
Then if we go tomorrow, 
we'll make it in time!

196
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,890
But the embassy takes 
Sundays and holidays off.

197
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,290
And tomorrow is...

198
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,320
Sunday.

199
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,010
What the heck?

200
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,620
We convenience store clerks

201
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,650
work 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year, without rest!

202
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,340
The government is stupid!

203
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,300
We'll just have to wait for a 
plane two or three days later.

204
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,710
We'll arrive later, but we'll 
make it before the boat leaves.

205
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,110
Good idea!

206
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,970
Tomorrow, let's stop by the airport counter.

207
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,310
Are we going... to change our arrival date?

208
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,760
It may be the only option.

209
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,340
Will that be okay?

210
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,600
I mean... the members of the expedition 
are awfully strict about rules.

211
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,960
They might say "maybe you shouldn't come."

212
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,210
It'll be okay.

213
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,740
Extenuating circumstances and all that...

214
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,890
Yes!

215
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,520
But...

216
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,550
Why don't we email Kanae-san about it?

217
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,190
You mean, to tell her we'll be late?

218
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,940
It seems like the best thing...

219
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,530
Hey... look, we depart in the 
morning in two days, right?

220
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,020
So we have a whole day to go.

221
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,850
Let's talk again tomorrow.

222
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,220
After all, it might still turn up.

223
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,600
That's right!

224
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,300
Please, turn up!

225
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,930
Merlion...

226
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,410
I will murder you.

227
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,170
Either way, you three should 
head for Australia in two days.

228
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,550
I think I can work this out on my own.

229
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,050
So if I make it in time, I'll come after you.

230
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,180
And if you don't make it in time?

231
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,810
I just go back to Japan, right?

232
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,680
I can pay my own fare.

233
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,720
I'll tell Kimari and the others myself.

234
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,070
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,570
It's because I didn't want 
to change flights, right?

236
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm well aware...

237
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,080
that when things don't go the way 
I plan, I tend to get very annoyed.

238
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,000
Hey, you don't have to apologize, Shirase.

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,260
I'm the one who lost my passport.

240
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,330
I'm the one who should apologize.

241
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,960
Sorry.

242
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,650
That's not what this is!

243
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,440
Sure it is.

244
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't want to be a drag on you guys.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,450
What if you're right, and you don't get 
to go to Antarctica because of this?

246
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,810
You'd never recover.

247
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,860
But...

248
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,650
I never said I wasn't going.

249
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,360
You three go first. I'll catch up.

250
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,410
Okay?

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,060
Now it's settled!

252
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,470
Let's all go together!

253
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,130
I just have to email Kanae-san 
and explain the situation...

254
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
I would like to take a shower!

255
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,220
Do you mind?

256
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,350
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,000
Shirase, I know you were 
trying to be considerate.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,110
I just really hate that kind of thing.

259
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,100
I know that's how relationships work, but...

260
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,710
when people try to be considerate of me...

261
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,870
it's disconcerting, I guess...

262
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,220
Like I can't tell how they 
really feel anymore...

263
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,830
That's why I couldn't handle high school,

264
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,350
and wanted to be alone as much as possible.

265
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,940
At the end of the day, 
when I'm with someone else,

266
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,620
things usually end up like this.

267
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,810
So, no need to worry.

268
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,180
The problem's all on me...

269
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,770
That's not true.

270
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,200
I have problems, too.

271
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,980
Ever since I came to high school, I've had 
this "keep away" aura running full blast.

272
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,410
I've never been good around people—

273
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,210
This is what I'm talking about.

274
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,840
I told you, I don't like people 
being considerate of me.

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm not.

276
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
Sure, you are.

277
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,370
Shirase, you want to go to Antarctica 
more than anyone, right?

278
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,200
Yeah...

279
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,490
You've wanted to go forever, right?

280
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,810
So what?

281
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,140
It's okay to make that your priority!

282
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,310
That's what would make me feel best.

283
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,610
Okay?

284
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,860
Good night.

285
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,070
My alarm clock!

286
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,130
She's here!

287
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,180
Hinata-chan, over here!

288
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,730
Why did you leave without me?

289
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,780
I thought you were sleeping in 
because you were under the weather!

290
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,440
Yuzuki-chan's asking if we can 
change our tickets right now!

291
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,490
Oh, you don't have to worry about that now.

292
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,570
We decided that you three 
would go without me.

293
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,740
We did?

294
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,210
That never happened.

295
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,810
Yes, it did! Later on.

296
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,530
Don't make things up.

297
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,460
Why are you so stubborn?

298
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,470
You're the one being stubborn!

299
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,720
We can't do it.

300
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,670
There's not another opening for 
these tickets for another month.

301
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,070
Really?

302
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,650
It's because we bought the cheapest tickets.

303
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,060
See? It can't be done.

304
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,790
So you three should go tomorrow.

305
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,730
I'll get my passport reprinted myself, and—

306
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,700
Shirase-chan?

307
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,480
Change! Late two days! Air!

308
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,580
No.

309
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,580
Shirase-san!

310
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,380
The mwillion yen...

311
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,540
Please change! Four person!

312
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,060
Wait! Why are you being so stubborn?

313
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,090
Shut up!

314
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,580
What's wrong with being stubborn?

315
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,050
That's how I've always lived my life!

316
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,190
I'm stubborn, people make fun of me, 
and I've had awful experiences.

317
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,060
But I remain stubborn...

318
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,650
because I'm right!

319
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,690
If you don't want me to be 
considerate, I'll say it outright.

320
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,980
I don't want to be the kind of idiot 
who doesn't worry about something

321
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,310
just because you say "don't worry about it!"

322
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,910
I don't want the kind of shallow 
relationship where I go without you

323
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,070
because you say "just go without me!"

324
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,890
I don't want to be the kind of 
coward who gives up without trying,

325
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,450
even though we said we'd all go together!

326
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,620
We're going, the four of us! 
All four of us! That's my priority!

327
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,520
What the heck...

328
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,720
What the heck?

329
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,990
What happened?

330
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,120
Dunno...

331
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,840
But it seems like a good thing.

332
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,400
Is this... business class?

333
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,570
You didn't have to go that far!

334
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,900
There weren't any other openings. 
I didn't have a choice.

335
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,340
Now I don't want you losing 
them, so hand them over.

336
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,910
That's one million yen!

337
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,290
Why are you acting so smug?

338
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm not acting smug.

339
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,220
Well... maybe I am.

340
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,300
What the heck?

341
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,960
You hate it when people act 
considerate of you, right?

342
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,780
So let's pretend I'm not.

343
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,650
Oh, come on...

344
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,560
Anyway, we're all going together now.

345
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,310
So tomorrow, we'll go to the embassy and...

346
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,730
Huh?

347
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,990
No way...

348
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,440
My shoelace came untied.

349
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,980
Hold this a minute.

350
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,820
It's dangerous to just carry it around.

351
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,340
Hainanese chicken rice! 
Hainanese chicken rice!

352
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,040
Shirase-chan, I brought Hainanese 
chicken rice and kaya toast!

353
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,890
R-Really?

354
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,020
Something wrong?

355
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,400
N-Nothing!

356
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,230
Oh! Oh! Looks delicious!

357
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,360
Shirase-san.

358
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
You're hiding something, aren't you?

359
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,360
You're <i>hiding something</i>, aren't you?

360
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,870
Now, let's get eating!

361
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,570
Shirase-chan and Hinata-chan's durian show!

362
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,920
For serious?

363
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,420
W-We really have to do it?

364
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,020
Be glad that's all we're making you do.

365
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,430
Yeah! Don't you realize how worried we were?

366
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,060
But we were able to cancel the tickets...

367
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,560
And we still get to fly out the same day.

368
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,810
It's neatly divided into four, but...

369
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,980
Why don't we play 
rock-paper-scissors to decide...

370
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,990
Let's eat!

371
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,710
Who the hell called this the king of fruits?!

372
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,380
But I might like it once I get used to it...

373
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,660
Are you serious?!
