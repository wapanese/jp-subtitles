00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,520
Antarctica, huh?

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,990
Antarctica, yeah...

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,990
It really is Antarctica!

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,360
Yeah...

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,000
High school girls!

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,750
Yes?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,750
Within 100 kg. You're clear.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,130
I ate so much while cutting down 
on my sweets, but it didn't change!

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,650
You should think about that, my dear.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,890
Is that really what we're taking there?

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,890
We can't go in the snow cat, I suppose?

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,490
Yuzuki-chan, you look like 
you could die right now.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,770
I certainly feel like it.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,140
Look!

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,820
It really is a big boat, isn't it?

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,820
Right?

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,160
Yeah.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,460
At least look first.

19
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:25,140

24
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,370
Hey, lie down there!

25
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,170
Okay!

26
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,270
It's so cold!

27
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,930
Or not?

28
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,120
December is summer here,

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,630
so on warm days, it might not even 
get below freezing during the day.

30
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,230
Really?

31
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,690
Hey, my hand's totally fine!

32
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Cold!

33
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,540
I'll give you a quick tour before the 
stuff arrives and things get crazy.

34
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,960
So this is Syowa Station?

35
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,760
That thing that looks like a stack 
of cubes is the control building.

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,130
If this were a house, it would be like 
the living room where everyone hangs out.

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,130
That's the generator building.

38
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,130
Those are the residence 
building and the warehouses.

39
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,940
That's the Lakeside Hotel.

40
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
Lakeside?

41
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,640
It's what we call the lodging 
house for the summer team.

42
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,780
Normally, the members who aren't staying 
for the winter would live there.

43
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,390
But because there hasn't been maintenance 
at the other building for three years,

44
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,110
and seeing as you're girls...

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,860
You get your own rooms!

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,320
We get to use all this?

47
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,750
The air is very dry, so be 
prepared for lots of static.

48
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,870
But the floors are heated, 
and if you open the blinds...

49
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,290
At last, I don't have to worry about the 
things Kimari-san rambles in her sleep.

50
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,260
Do I really talk that much?

51
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,850
Yes, you do!

52
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,170
And you do it with your eyes open...

53
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,550
Emergency.

54
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,200
What is it?

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
The jar genie won't come out of the toilet.

56
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,080
He probably won't go through the ticket gate.

57
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,090
Like that.

58
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,220
What's the jar genie?

59
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,650
How should I know?!

60
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,510
Well, let's move on to 
the control building...

61
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,120
Or that was my plan, but I bet the 
stuff is about to start arriving.

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,590
Let's go back to the heliport.

63
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,540
Okay!

64
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,040
I'll have to replace this...

65
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,330
Ow.

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,590
Time for some cleaning up!

67
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,870
Okay, let's take a break 
until the next one arrives!

68
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,650
You okay?

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,570
Yes.

70
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,430
I worked part-time at a moving company.

71
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,490
Okay, then rest for ten minutes and then 
help me with the loading over there.

72
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,870
Oh? I got an email...

73
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,970
It might have arrived when 
we were in the base earlier.

74
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,120
We get a cell phone signal 
near the control building.

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,870
Shiraishi Tamiko

76
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,770
Wow, so we can use our smartphones, 
even in Antarctica?

77
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,610
Penguins!

78
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,920
Keep your voice down!

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,130
Yuzu! The camera!

80
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,290
R-Right!

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,990
Just stay within five meters, okay?

82
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,560
Got it!

83
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,720
Pen...guin...

84
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,970
Hold it!

85
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,840
Okay, I'm filming! Yuzu, grab 
the mike and do a report!

86
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,310
Hinata-chan, emergency!

87
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,980
What?

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,980
It's coming toward us!

89
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,480
It's coming... coming...

90
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,870
Wait, wait, wait! Stay within five meters!

91
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,020
Wait, wait!

92
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,490
No!

93
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,600
Never a dull moment, huh?

94
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,300
Something wrong?

95
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,500
Oh, no...

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,860
Is it really okay to drop 
dirty snow in there?

97
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,830
They said it would get 
filtered, so it's fine.

98
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,650
Don't take that off. You'll get sunburn.

99
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,910
But it's hard to breathe!

100
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,120
But it's just been one 
job after another, huh?

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,420
No one's been here for three years, 
so we'll probably be this busy for a while.

102
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,470
I see...

103
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,090
You don't like it?

104
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,220
Keeping busy is the best way 
to speed the clock's hands!

105
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,440
Another made-up saying?

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,060
I thought that one up when I was 
working at the convenience store.

107
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,220
I think I prefer to keep busy.

108
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,810
I'm exhausted!

109
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,920
I agree.

110
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,730
I think I like keeping busy, too.

111
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,770
What?

112
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,900
Well... we've been traveling 
together for so long, haven't we?

113
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,990
Yeah! We have!

114
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,120
We talked about a lot of things 
and had fun together, didn't we?

115
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,620
What's with you right now?

116
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,910
A drama?

117
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,910
I had an audition before we set out.

118
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,350
It's a morning drama. I'll be playing 
the best friend of the protagonist.

119
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,670
No way! And you got the part?

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,340
Shiraishi Tamiko
It's decided! Well done!
You passed the audition for the morning drama! 
Congratulations! Great job!
Love, Mom

121
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,340
That's amazing!

122
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,170
It is great!

123
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,680
But when the drama starts shooting, 
I'll have a lot less time.

124
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,220
We won't be able to hang out 
together like this anymore!

125
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,920
You don't like that?

126
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Well, even without the drama, 
we'd be living separately again anyway.

127
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,280
B-But...

128
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,070
It's okay. We're all best friends already.

129
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,840
Best friends?

130
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
Are we best friends?

131
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,830
Don't cry.

132
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,280
But didn't you say before...

133
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,740
that you'd only just met?

134
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,500
Well, at the time, that was the case.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,410
So when did you decide you were best friends?

136
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,630
Did it happen while I was in Hokkaido?

137
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,790
Well...

138
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,900
It did, didn't it?

139
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,640
Don't cry!

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,140
The three of you, without me...

141
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,390
Wait, wait, wait!

142
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,460
Without ever telling me...

143
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,650
Don't go outside!

144
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,280
Anyway, there's nothing we've 
done without telling you!

145
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,780
Really?

146
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,020
You really don't trust anyone, do you?

147
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,130
Actually, there is one 
thing we haven't told you!

148
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,350
But we are still friends. All of us!

149
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,320
Since when?

150
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,350
I don't know. No time in particular...

151
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,800
That's what being friends is, though!

152
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,060
But you never told me you 
wanted to be friends.

153
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,830
Let's have another productive day tomorrow!

154
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,280
Yeah!

155
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,130
When did we become friends, huh?

156
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,890
You think she was waiting this whole time 
for someone to say, "Let's be friends"?

157
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,650
We could just say it.

158
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,000
Hell no.

159
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,390
"You're obviously just saying 
that because I made you!"

160
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,080
We don't have to do it.

161
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,030
How's Kimari doing?

162
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,050
I dunno. She said she could handle it...

163
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,280
But she's so bold about some things 
and so timid about others...

164
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,850
Helmets good?

165
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,040
Helmets good!

166
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,900
Lunch Menu!
Christmas Antarctica Special

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Chin straps good?

168
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
Chin straps good!

169
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,410
Health good?

170
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,690
Health good!

171
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,710
Feet good?

172
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,910
Feet good!

173
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,620
Let's have another productive day!

174
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,740
Let's do it!

175
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,670
Be safe!

176
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,780
Be safe!

177
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,110
They said we'd get to work indoors...

178
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,840
But it's colder in here than it is outside!

179
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
My nose is getting red!

180
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,000
They're conserving energy, remember?

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,670
We need to keep the indoor work short.

182
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,800
This is all of it, right?

183
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,450
Yes, thank you.

184
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,490
Next, take this.

185
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,220
A chicken?

186
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,150
Yeah, because it's Christmas.

187
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,010
I want you to find somewhere 
warm to defrost it.

188
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,120
I had a few I set defrosting yesterday, 
but it doesn't look like it'll be enough.

189
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,350
Somewhere warm...

190
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,310
I have an idea!

191
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,780
Go for it!

192
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,010
And you two can stay here and help me.

193
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,900
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,900
That'd be the best place!

195
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,660
That seems unspeakably dangerous.

196
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,410
What about here, in the sun?

197
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,360
It never sets here, after all!

198
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,580
I don't know...

199
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,480
They're both birds.

200
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,410
I don't think that matters to them.

201
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,900
There are penguins here, too.

202
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,280
Do they eat chicken, too?!

203
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,460
How should I know?!

204
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,700
There, that should do it.

205
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Defrosting

206
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Touch and
you die

207
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,340
Yeah!

208
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,970
But how are things going 
with the other thing?

209
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,470
Oh, just perfect!

210
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,480
Okay, today's pick-me-up is done!

211
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,630
That's quite extravagant.

212
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,900
Well, it is Christmas...

213
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,960
Is Christmas that important?

214
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,400
Do you know the most important 
parts of life on the station?

215
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,380
No...

216
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,400
Food and events.

217
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,920
We'll be living a spartan life in a 
limited space for a long time, after all.

218
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Is that right?

219
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,750
It's time for your pick-me-up.

220
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,250
Christmas cake!

221
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,470
Merry Christmas!

222
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,510
Merry Christmas!

223
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,440
You don't like Christmas?

224
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,510
It's not that I don't like it...

225
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,010
But it's like a birthday, isn't it?

226
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,060
So?

227
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,270
It's not fair, is it?

228
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,430
Everybody has a birthday, yet there are 
people whose birthdays get celebrated,

229
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,270
and people whose birthdays don't.

230
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,430
Isn't that your song?

231
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,630
You want to get the 
external shots in advance?

232
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,890
Yeah.

233
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,510
Since they said we might not be able 
to go outside if the wind picks up.

234
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,540
Um...

235
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,050
About that thing I mentioned before...

236
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,710
What happened?

237
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,770
I've decided to do the drama.

238
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,150
Really?

239
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,800
Yes. I gave it a lot of thought,

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,780
and apparently some people here 
may be looking forward to it.

241
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,460
Yeah, that's right!

242
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,410
Yeah, yeah!

243
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,270
So, could I ask a favor of you all?

244
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,460
Could you fill this out?

245
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,080
What's this?

246
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,090
Friendship Contract

247
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,100
This way, even after our adventure is over,

248
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,090
and we're not around each other 
as often, I know we'll be fine.

249
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,100
Oh, come on...

250
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,660
This won't mean anything.

251
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,150
I've been all alone before, so I know.

252
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,550
Even if you do this...

253
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
Kimari-san?

254
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,260
Sorry. I'm sorry.

255
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,610
You don't know, do you?

256
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,970
You can't know, can you?

257
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,710
Don't leave a scrap behind!

258
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,790
If you don't clean your plate, 
you'll be denied bathroom privileges!

259
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,790
Let's dig in!

260
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,650
Cheers!

261
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,260
Still partially frozen.

262
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah, partially frozen.

263
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,020
It says "partially frozen
rice bowl" on the menu!

264
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,520
That's one way to put it.

265
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,150
Yuzuki-chan, want seconds?

266
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,790
No...

267
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,990
Kimari-san!

268
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,000
Um... after dinner, I was 
hoping to talk to you.

269
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,000
Sorry, I have something 
I have to take care of.

270
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,510
I see...

271
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,280
What should we do?

272
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,350
I don't know if I know what to say to her.

273
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,850
Then, should we lay off?

274
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,180
I didn't say that...

275
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,530
Yuzu.

276
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,730
Don't worry. She's not mad, or anything.

277
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,410
But Kimari-san cried.

278
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,230
I think she felt hurt.

279
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,540
It's all on you.

280
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,610
Don't ditch me!

281
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,370
Have I done something strange?

282
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,360
Well... I wouldn't say "strange."

283
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,470
If I were in your position, 
I'd probably feel the same way.

284
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,830
It's just...

285
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,380
Merry Christmas!

286
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,410
Friendship isn't about lots of words.

287
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,830
I hear that a lot...

288
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,100
What is it about, then?

289
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
Give me a break...

290
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,850
It's about... feelings?

291
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,250
Feelings?

292
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,340
For instance, let's say you 
tell Kimari you like her.

293
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,130
Kimari doesn't believe you, so she wants 
you to write it down on a piece of paper.

294
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,890
You'd hate that, right? 
You'd feel like she didn't trust you.

295
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,950
Well...

296
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,230
Seconds, please!

297
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,040
That's probably why she was crying.

298
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,530
Yuzu, Kimari already sees you as a friend.

299
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,930
But what makes us friends?

300
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,170
How do you become friends?

301
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,470
Well...

302
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,970
There's probably no real way to define it.

303
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,470
It's not like a parental 
or spousal relationship.

304
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,110
It's more vague than that.

305
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,200
No one's to blame if it fades.

306
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,190
Oh, no...

307
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,520
That's the case for me, at least.

308
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,670
But that's what lets it feel unrestrained.

309
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,490
That's what lets us be together.

310
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,360
Merry Christmas.

311
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,500
We're back.

312
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
4. Antarctic Magic Show
5. Christmas Stories Two High School Girls
6. Golden Oldies Old Man Choir
7. Wrap! Wrap! Burp!

313
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,500
Are there good children here, too?

314
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,170
Are there good children here, too?

315
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,510
Why even bother with the performance?

316
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,870
That's why I didn't want to do this!

317
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,730
Why did you make us do it?

318
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,720
Forget it. Come on, let's go.

319
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,270
Kimari told us to, remember?

320
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,620
What does it mean?

321
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,240
I really don't think I understand...

322
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,570
Got it!
I'm on my way!

323
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,570
I'm sorry

324
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,570
Yes?

325
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,080
M-Merry Christmas!

326
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,230
What are you doing?!

327
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,210
It's Christmas, so...

328
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,540
That hurt!

329
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,240
Are you okay?

330
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
Could we talk for a minute?

331
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Got it!
I'm on my way!

332
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm sorry

333
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,230
It's hard to settle down when 
it stays dusk like this, huh?

334
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,490
It's like the day never ends.

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,290
You're angry, aren't you?

336
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,850
You didn't write back.

337
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,360
Because you didn't have 
anything to apologize for.

338
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,090
What's that?

339
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,740
Megu-chan has been my best 
friend since kindergarten.

340
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,140
Right before I headed out, she said 
she wanted to break things off...

341
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,410
Arrived in Singapore!

342
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,440
But I still think of her as a friend, so...

343
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,490
She doesn't respond often, does she?

344
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,250
Arrived in Australia!

345
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,250
I see.

346
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,800
But somehow, I can tell...

347
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,700
When I'm watching the screen,

348
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,100
and it pops up with the 
little "message read" sign.

349
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,260
Message Read

350
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,810
She writes something back,

351
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,610
sometimes right away, 
sometimes after a while,

352
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,110
sometimes half a day...

353
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,270
Each time I see it, I can tell.

354
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,960
"Ah, I bet she's at school right now."

355
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,130
"I bet she's in bed."

356
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,390
"I bet she's not sure whether 
or not she should respond."

357
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,780
Send

358
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,130
I can tell just how she's feeling.

359
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,120
Is that weird?

360
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,870
I think that's what friends are for me.

361
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,280
It's totally vague, I know, 
but that's what it is for me.

362
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,140
I'm sorry. I guess that 
doesn't solve anything...

363
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,790
Merry Christmas!

364
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,850
And...

365
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,060
Happy birthday!

366
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,660
Yuzuki-chan, it's was your 
birthday before, right?

367
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,150
But we spent so long being 
seasick at the time...

368
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,030
We're sorry.

369
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,390
Kimari suggested that we should 
celebrate it in Antarctica.

370
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,490
We had Yumiko-san set the ingredients aside.

371
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,290
Well, just fill in the parts we 
messed up with your imagination.

372
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,290
Yuzuki-chan...

373
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Happy birthday.

374
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,990
Happy birthday!

375
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,800
Go on, blow them out.

376
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,730
Again?

377
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,050
This is just like the first 
time we met you, huh?

378
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm not crying!

379
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,030
Blow them out before they melt.

380
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,440
Yuzuki-chan.

381
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,810
No!

382
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,740
Because...

383
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,930
it's the first time...

384
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,070
friends have celebrated my birthday...

385
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,180
Go on, Yuzuki-chan.

386
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,960
Hey!

387
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,170
Oh, dear...

388
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,220
I messed up my first time!

389
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,610
Time for a pick-me-up!

390
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,910
Right!

391
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,450
Sorry

392
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,870
Got it!
I'm on my way!

393
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,870
I'm sorry

394
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,120
Good morn

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,630
Thank you

396
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,390
But when the question gets put to 
you, it's hard to express it, huh?

397
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,330
You mean, what friends are?

398
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:27,930
Yeah.

399
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,670
Wow, after you burn it, 
there's so little left.

400
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,040
But they say when they take back a whole 
year's worth of garbage it'll be like a mountain.

401
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,150
I'm Sorry
Thanks

402
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,110
Thanks
Right?

403
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,990
I get it!

404
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,530
Thanks

405
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,890
I think friendship is this one little word!

406
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,870
Right?

407
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,030
What's with that quote?

408
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,430
But it's better than your quotes, Hinata.

409
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,380
I know!

410
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:04,010
Thanks
Right?

411
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,010
Right

412
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,010
Right

413
