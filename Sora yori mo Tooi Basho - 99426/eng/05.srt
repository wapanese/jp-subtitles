Tamaki Mari-san and Kobuchizawa 
Shirase-san will be embarking

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,700
on a trip to Antarctica next month.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,480
Please come forward.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,480
Um...

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,830
It's still a little hard to 
believe this is happening,

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,520
but I'll do my best where I'm going!

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,790
I'm going.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,600
You shouldn't have waited so long.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,390
But...

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,060
I get it, I get it.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,890
<i>It made me happy.</i>

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,090
You're very smart, Megumi-chan.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,700
<i>I felt like I had become a big sister.</i>

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,330
Mari-chan.

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,410
We can play together tomorrow, too.

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,100
This is the new Antarctic Icebreaker ship,

20
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,000
modified from the <i>Shirase II</i>,

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,810
the Shichishinya <i>Penguin Manju</i>!

22
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,770
Its basic performance hasn't changed,

23
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,990
but there have been some 
internal modifications,

24
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,920
and as you can see, it's had 
a big external makeover!

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,720
"Let's go inside!"

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
...is what I'd like to tell you!

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,830
But the truth is, we won't get to 
board it until we reach Australia.

28
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,310
So, let's make the jump 
to Australia right now!

29
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,530
One, two...

30
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,450
Jump!

31
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,670
Okay! That's a wrap!

32
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,520
What a total pro!

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,010
You're amazing!

34
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,540
You don't have to make fun of me.

35
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,760
We're not! We're not!

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,050
We genuinely respect you.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,010
By comparison, our next report's 
not until we reach Australia,

38
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,440
but look at her freaking out already.

39
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,170
I-I'm here in Autsralia. Wait! I mean...

40
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,360
I have to jump first...

41
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,400
then land.

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,450
Wait, no!

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,570
Land, then jump?

44
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,670
Land?

45
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,680
Land means...

46
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,660
Shirase-san, calm down.

47
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,690
What am I gonna do?! 
I can't land in Australia!

48
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,300
They can work it out in editing.

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,210
For now, just do your vocal warm-ups.

50
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,930
Have you been doing your warm-ups?

51
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,830
She sells seashells on the sea floor.

52
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,050
Not quite right, but close enough.

53
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,230
Why would a person sell seashells?

54
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,550
Please don't try to dissect it.

55
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,890
What happened to her?

56
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,150
She spoke just fine at morning assembly...

57
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,400
Because there's no one she 
sees as an enemy here.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,870
When someone she's hostile 
to is around, it's like

59
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,390
the "screw you!" switch gets flipped "on."

60
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,190
Ah, I see.

61
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,610
You! You're talking about me, aren't you?

62
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,090
We're really getting on this thing, huh?

63
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,570
Yeah.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,830
Have you finished packing?

65
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,560
Not yet. There's a lot to 
think about, isn't there?

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,590
Is there?

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,780
Including our body weight, 
we're allowed 100 kilograms all together.

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,490
It should be more than enough.

69
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,210
Yeah, but we're staying 
for three months, right?

70
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,410
Yeah! That's over 90 changes of clothes!

71
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,550
Do laundry occasionally.

72
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,760
Oh, right!

73
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,940
Although it's a journey, once we arrive, 
we'll just be living life like normal.

74
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,150
And there'll be lots of work to do, 
so they say it'll pass quickly...

75
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,650
But when you start thinking and 
packing things into the boxes,

76
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,650
it does end up being quite a lot...

77
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,280
Is it that much?

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,180
Hey, have you not even gotten started?

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,540
But it just needs to be less than 
100 kilograms, including body weight, right?

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,660
For me, that's 50, 52, 53...

81
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,400
I can take upwards of 
58 kilograms of luggage!

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,920
That's easy, no problem!

83
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Underestimating your weight 
is a serious crime.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,370
Fifty-eight kilograms? 
That means you weigh 42 kilograms?

85
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,550
Please leave my arm flab alone...

86
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,680
This might be harder than I thought...

87
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,040
Mari-chan, how many times do I have to 
tell you to carry up your own laundry?

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,070
Mari-chan...

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,290
What's all this?

90
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,410
I don't think you'll need cooking supplies.

91
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,820
You think? It's diamond-coated! 
Nothing sticks to that!

92
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,600
And this?

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
An inner tube!

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,500

I know, but still...

109
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,560
That should do it, I think.

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,580
So little!

111
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,960
You should consult with Shirase-san, too.

112
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
There might be some specific 
things you'll need.

113
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,930
But do you really think this'll be enough?

114
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,320
I'll be gone for over three months.

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,470

116
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,700

Because it's an adult thing.

120
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,710
You need to be responsible.

121
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,940
Responsible, huh?

122
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,110

Oh, what's up?

126
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,420
It's...

127
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Ta-da!

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,420
What's that?

129
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,720
Look! It's your game! 
The one I thought I'd lost!

130
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,700
Wow, I'd totally forgotten about that.

131
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,800
You don't actually have to test it, you know.

132
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,410
But I haven't seen it in so long!

133
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,310
After three years, it might not even work.

134
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,260
Wow, this takes me back!

135
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,760
You sure loved this thing, huh?

136
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,600
Yeah!

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,600
After all, it's the only 
game I ever beat you at.

138
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,980
Is it?

139
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,360
You couldn't beat me at all,

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,450
so you said you'd lend it to 
me as long as I wanted it.

141
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,430
And then...

142
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,320
You lost it?

143
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,320
Eventually, yeah...

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,610
But I did beat it before then!

145
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,120
Yay!

146
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,120
I lose~

147
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,190
I win!

148
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,140
So, how'd things go in Tokyo?

149
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,710
Pretty well, for the most part.

150
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,190
Did Antarctica manage to 
get through her report?

151
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,840
Antarctica? Oh, Shirase-chan?

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,300
Shirase-chan doesn't have 
to report for a while yet.

153
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,300
She's pretty weird, huh?

154
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,820
Seriously!

155
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,730
She swings between super-confident 
and super-timid.

156
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,500
I was talking to Hinata-chan about that...

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,390
Is that the girl from your job?

158
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,190
Yeah.

159
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,850
But Yuzuki-chan did the 
report perfectly, so...

160
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,450
Is that the girl from Hokkaido?

161
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,070
Yeah.

162
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,920
Well, don't push yourself too hard.

163
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,580
If you fail, you'll just 
regret it all the more.

164
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,830
Sure!

165
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,290
Good point...

166
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,510
Oh.

167
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,200

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,130
Thanks.

183
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,690
Does your snot freeze in Antarctica?

184
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,380
I wanna have some shaved ice.

185
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,750
Is it true there's a UFO 
buried in the ice there?

186
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,970
Feels like I'm changing 
schools or something, huh?

187
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,020
Goodbye, pudding shakes!

188
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,060
I won't be seeing you for a while...

189
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,650
What kind of reception did you expect?

190
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,880
I just didn't think they'd 
make such a big deal over it!

191
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,470
When Shirase-chan said she 
was going to Antarctica,

192
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,660
everyone just made fun of her.

193
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,760
Because they didn't think 
she'd make it, I guess.

194
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,110
Besides, some people still make fun of her.

195
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,420
Oh, that's right!

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,760
I won't be able to come here 
for three months, either.

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,510
Feeling lonely?

198
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,970
No...

199
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,890
I just wasn't sure how I'd feel...

200
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,580
You know, maybe it's best 
not to show off so much.

201
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,030
A lot of people think you're 
getting full of yourself.

202
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,050
I'm not showing off anything. 
I'm leaving tomorrow.

203
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,350
Well, that's true...

204
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,080
It's just, they're saying 
some awful things about you.

205
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Really?

206
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,930
Out of jealousy, I guess.

207
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,050
That you shoplifted from convenience 
stores to raise money.

208
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,090
That you were messing around with 
boys in Kabukicho and stuff.

209
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,590
Wait, what?

210
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,590
Girls'
Strawberry Tea

211
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,090
I'm telling you, people think 
you're full of yourself.

212
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,770
But I'm not!

213
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,860
You know...

214
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,830
What?

215
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,370
Are you sure you should just 
leave with this unresolved?

216
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,100
Once you're back, 
it's only going to get worse...

217
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,110
Kimari.

218
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,610
Would this be Megu-chan, by chance?

219
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,770
Yeah!

220
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,580
That's right, you guys haven't met yet...

221
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,070
I'm Miyake Hinata, Kimari's co-worker!

222
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,840
What's up?

223
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,780
Hello.

224
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,920
I'd better go.

225
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,860
Wait!

226
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,370
What?

227
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,500
That stuff you said before...

228
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,750
Who's saying that?!

229
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,080
I don't know, I just heard it...

230
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,610
I'll search out the culprit!

231
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,460
Shirase-chan...

232
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,880
Remember, we're heading out tomorrow.

233
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,640
I can't just sit back while someone 
spreads those ridiculous rumors!

234
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,370
Starting a fight now won't help anybody.

235
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,430
You've ignored all the 
nasty rumors so far, right?

236
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,440
Just let it go.

237
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,070
This isn't the same thing!

238
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,470
These are bald-faced lies!

239
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,690
To claim we've been messing 
around with boys in Shinjuku...

240
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,540
We did go to Shinjuku, though.

241
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,700
But we weren't messing around!

242
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,660
Can you prove that, though?

243
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,660
Still, it's just wrong!

244
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,180
Megu-chan, what do you think?

245
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,290
Me?

246
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,880
Sometimes, people are just mean.

247
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't fight mean with mean.

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,790
Hold your head high.

249
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,010
Is that a quote?

250
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,500
You bet!

251
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,310
Besides, you're not alone right now.

252
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,430
What do you mean?

253
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,140
I mean you have people to vent with!

254
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,140
Cheers!

255
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Rest Station

256
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Udon   Soba

257
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,910
That hits the spot!

258
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,470
I see!

259
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,850
This must be what it feels to grab 
a drink on the way back from work.

260
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,660
I suppose it might.

261
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,520
Okay, let's have one more!

262
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,530
It's payday, so the old man'll cover it.

263
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,800
Still, it's extremely exasperating.

264
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,650
You sure hate to let things go, don't you?

265
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,620
Well, the people spreading the 
rumors are the ones in the wrong.

266
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,210
Why should I yield to them?

267
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,810
I get it, I get it.

268
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,780
Calm down.

269
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,960
I just want to scream at the top of my lungs!

270
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,090
Scream, then!

271
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,630
Next to a temple? Not a great idea...

272
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,770
Then let's go to karaoke!

273
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,640
If we do it within the hour, 
we're probably good.

274
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,850
I've never been to karaoke.

275
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,530
No way!

276
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,570
Then let's do it!

277
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,700
No, no way!

278
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,810
How can you all do something so embarrassing?

279
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,060
It's okay to get it all out.

280
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,710
It's our going-away party!

281
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,580
Right?

282
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,150
I suppose...

283
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,630
You're invited, too, Megu-chan!

284
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,470
But...

285
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,570
You're <i>invited</i>.

286
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,950
Karaoke Parlor
Tanuki-Neko

287
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,950
Let's raise the roof!

288
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,380
Kobuchizawa Shirase!

289
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,130
No.

290
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,940
Oh, come on!

291
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,300
Then... Takahashi Megu-chan!

292
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,460
My friend, Megu-chan!

293
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,880
Let's raise the roof!

294
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,470
Kobuchizawa Shirase!

295
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,770
Kobuchizawa Shirase!

296
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,210
Kobuchizawa Shirase!

297
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,980
Kobuchizawa Shirase!

298
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,490
The Madness of Shirase

299
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,190
I'm so glad I wasn't there.

300
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,120
I'm so refreshed!

301
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
Are you?

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,430
Yeah, tonight's been the best!

303
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,270
I never thought I'd get to do this 
stuff the night before I left.

304
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,230
I mean, I haven't gotten 
to hang out with you much

305
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,920
since I decided to go to Antarctica.

306
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,290
Though I guess that was a relief to you...

307
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,010
I wouldn't say that...

308
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,020
Well, maybe it was.

309
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,520
Right?

310
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,020
But it wasn't like that for me at all.

311
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,710
I've been thinking this whole time...

312
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,230
About how I want to go far away,

313
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,870
about how I hate being where I am,

314
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,280
about how I hate myself.

315
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,530
I never knew why I felt that way.

316
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,930
It was probably because of you, Megu-chan.

317
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,620
I'm always uncertain, 
needing you to fuss over me.

318
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,130
Always clinging to you, 
asking what I should do...

319
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,500
Are you?

320
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,250
Yeah, and I always hated that.

321
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,430
I think I wanted to change it.

322
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,300
So I wouldn't just be clinging to you; 
I wouldn't be worthless.

323
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,500
I'd be someone you could 
play video games with.

324
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,390
So I'm gonna do my best out there.

325
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,520
Okay, see you later.

326
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,150
I'm home!

327
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,450
Wow, what's all this? Amazing!

328
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,830
You're late!

329
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,950
A special treat.

330
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,580
That's it!

331
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,330
But wait, there's more!

332
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,340
Yes! Egg Paradise!

333
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,840
Come and eat?

334
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,230
Oh...

335
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,330
Okay!

336
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,040
See you later.

337
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,870
See you later. See you later. 
See you later. See you later.

338
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm in

339
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm out

340
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,360
See you later.

341
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,810
You're heading out?

342
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,040
Yeah.

343
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,180
Make sure you get breakfast in Tokyo, okay?

344
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,820
Yeah.

345
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,460
Sis!

346
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,360
Rin...

347
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,230
Why didn't you wake me up?

348
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,450
Well, it was so early...

349
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,950
I'm worried!

350
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,160
Don't worry. I'll keep myself safe.

351
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,740
See you later!

352
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,730
Megu-chan?

353
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,930
Sorry to bother you right before you set out.

354
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,390
What's up?

355
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,730
I came to break up.

356
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm saying, we're not friends anymore.

357
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,390
What? What do you mean?

358
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,180
You still haven't realized it?

359
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,300
Where do you think the rumor about you and 
Antarctica going to Shinjuku came from?

360
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you tell anyone about it?

361
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,210
No...

362
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,980
The first time you met Antarctica,

363
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,420
how did those older girls 
know she had a million yen?

364
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,720
How did your mother know you were going 
to Antarctica before you told her?

365
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,600
How?

366
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,770
Because I told them, of course!

367
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,690
I thought you'd finally catch 
on and get mad at me...

368
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,070
eventually...

369
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,990
Why?

370
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,030
But you and Antarctica and the others 
are such morons you didn't catch on!

371
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,950
Why?!

372
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,960
I don't know!

373
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,590
I don't know why I got so 
mad when you first told me

374
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,390
you were going to Antarctica!

375
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,230
You always consulted with me 
before you did anything...

376
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,720
No way... Wait a minute...

377
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,490
I know I've put you through a lot.

378
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,230
I apologize.

379
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,630
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,190
Yesterday, when you were 
talking, I finally realized.

381
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,990
You weren't the one hanging on, I was.

382
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,920
Having you rely on me, consult with 
me... me getting exasperated with you,

383
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,540
pretending to mother you, 
acting so smart around you...

384
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,500
Because if I didn't have that, 
I didn't have anything.

385
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Civilian Icebreaker Ship Leaves 
Port for First Time in Three Years

386
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,240
And because I wasn't anything, 
I didn't want you to have anything.

387
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,310
You're not the one who was worthless.

388
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,140
I am!

389
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,560
I'm the one who needs to go 
somewhere that isn't here!

390
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,300
So long.

391
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,330
Megu-chan!

392
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,560
Come with me.

393
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,090
Where?

394
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,340
To Antarctica!

395
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,290
Don't be stupid.

396
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,260
I'm finally taking my first step

397
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,660
into a world without you.

398
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,150
New Message

399
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,150
To: Mom

400
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,860
<i>We're taking our first step.</i>

401
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,060
<i>To a world without any of the 
things we usually rely on.</i>

402
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,870
<i>To a world where we don't know 
what lies around the corner.</i>

403
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,380
<i>Where we don't even know which way home is.</i>

404
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,690
<i>To a world where we don't 
know where we'll be tomorrow.</i>

405
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,880
<i>Where we can't even imagine where 
we'll be headed the next day.</i>

406
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,100
Yet we're taking that step.

407
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,350
Breakup rejected.

408
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,660
<i>Water collects into stagnant pools.</i>

409
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,140
<i>I've always loved watching 
it spill out all at once.</i>

410
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,990
<i>Breaking free, liberated, rushing out.</i>

411
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,350
<i>The energy stored up during 
its stagnation bursts forth.</i>

412
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,500
<i>Everything springs into action!</i>

413
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,010
<i>Everything springs into action!</i>
