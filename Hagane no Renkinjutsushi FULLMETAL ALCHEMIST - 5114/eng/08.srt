00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:06,381
<i>Alchemy is the science of understanding,
</i><i>decomposing, and reconstructing matter.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,343
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,194
<i>Alchemists have a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

8
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>The first branch
</i><i>of the National Central Library</i>

9
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,795
<i>which held Marcoh's research materials
</i><i>had been lost to fire.</i>

10
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,591
<i>With the aid of Sheska
</i><i>who had been a librarian,</i>

11
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,927
<i>Ed and Al were still able to obtain
</i><i>the research materials. However...</i>

12
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,140
The ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone
are live humans!

13
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,018
<i>In search of further truth,</i>

14
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,522
<i>Ed and Al sneak into the dilapidated
</i><i>Fifth Laboratory.</i>

15
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,082
You move pretty well
for as big as you are.

16
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,376
It wouldn't be worth
fighting you otherwise.

17
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,543
Who are you?

18
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:54,174
I'm Number 66.
At least that's what my work name is.

19
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,595
I'm going to take you apart,
nice and neat.

20
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,891
Just relax, and scream!

21
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,361
What is this?

22
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,322
Is it possible that this is
for transmuting a Philosopher's Stone?

23
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,491
That is correct.

24
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,576
I don't know who you are, kid,

25
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,538
but if you can tell that just by looking
at the transmutation circle.

26
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,833
Who are you, pops?

27
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,962
I am the one charged
with guarding this place.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,716
I'll go by the name "Number 48" for now.

29
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,762
And by the way, I'm not your pop.

30
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:45,642
I have orders to dispose of any outsiders
that come in here.

31
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,603
- Don't think ill of me, kid.
- I could say the same.

32
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,234
Don't go thinking ill of me,
once you're defeated by a "kid."

33
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,903
You're an alchemist, are you?

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,699
Let's have a look at what you've got.

35
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,037
Your prosthetic arm just saved your life.

36
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,375
However, my trusty sword
will pierce even steel!

37
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,345
Hey, hey, hey!

38
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,641
Let me guess, pops,
you're hollow on the inside, aren't you?

39
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,310
I'm impressed that you realized that.

40
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,563
I spar against someone like you
all the time, you see.

41
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:36,151
Oh, so there are those like me
on the outside too, are there?

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,321
Well, that's annoying.

43
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,490
Imagine,
there's some other idiot out there

44
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,951
who came up with the idea
of bonding a soul to a suit of armor!

45
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,498
Let me introduce myself once again.

46
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,125
"48" is my condemned prisoner number.

47
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,546
In life, or should I say,
back when I had a living body,

48
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,674
I was known as Slicer, the mass murderer.

49
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,552
So you are a condemned prisoner.

50
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,264
Tell me,
they use condemned prisoners in this place

51
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,391
as ingredients to make
Philosopher's Stones, right?

52
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,769
That is difficult for me to answer.

53
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,606
They just recognized my skills,
gave me this body,

54
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,108
and made me the watchdog of this place.

55
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:22,322
Which means, you have a seal that serves
as the medium between soul and armor.

56
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes, that is correct.

57
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:32,624
This bloodseal.
If you destroy this, you win.

58
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,878
It's very kind of you
to show me your weak spot.

59
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:41,341
I'm the type that seeks out
a little tension during a fight, you see.

60
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,177
As long as you're being kind,
you think you might let me go?

61
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,055
I figure I might as well ask.

62
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,182
There's no way a mass murderer
would do nothing

63
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,353
and let his prey escape
when it's right in front of him.

64
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,773
Now, here I come!

65
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,861
Like I said,
Elicia is going to turn three!

66
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,863
EAST CITY, EASTERN COMMAND CENTER

67
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,824
<i>Lt. Colonel Hughes, I'm at work right now.</i>

68
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,827
<i>Isn't that a coincidence? I'm at work too.</i>

69
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,329
Oh, she's just the cutest thing too!

70
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,709
<i>All right, just stop calling me
</i><i>to brag about your daughter!</i>

71
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,669
<i>And on a military line too!</i>

72
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,214
It's not just my daughter!
I'm proud of my wife too.

73
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:28,972
All right, all right, I'll listen to you
brag about your cute, cute...

74
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
Scar.

75
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,271
We've found multiple unidentified bodies,

76
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,482
but all of them are so decomposed,
it's difficult to identify them.

77
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,528
<i>There haven't been any sightings of him
</i><i>in the eastern area,</i>

78
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,699
<i>so at present, many here regard him
</i><i>as being dead.</i>

79
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,950
<i>From the sound of it,</i>

80
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,454
<i>I'll be able to lift the escort
</i><i>from the Elric brothers before long.</i>

81
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,123
Is Major Armstrong
still serving as their escort?

82
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,710
No, the major's men
have apparently taken over.

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,714
We've been had!

84
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,674
I thought it was awfully quiet in here!

85
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,969
We're gonna be chewed out
by Major Armstrong

86
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,262
for dereliction of duty!

87
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,767
Those little brats! Put yourselves
in your escorts' shoes, will you?

88
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,936
- Let's go!
- Huh? Where?

89
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,356
Isn't it obvious? To the Fifth Laboratory!

90
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,075
<i>What is this?
</i><i>My shoulder feels out of sorts.</i>

91
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,498
This automail is less prone to rusting,

92
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,000
but the tradeoff is that
its strength isn't as great,

93
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,377
so don't try anything too crazy.

94
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,963
<i>I have to settle this quickly...</i>

95
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,297
Or I'm in trouble!

96
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,244
- You're just like a monkey, huh?
- Hey, what was that?

97
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,001
I'm so glad! It's been so long
since I've had any worthy prey!

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:26,089
But given your wound and your exhaustion,
the end of the battle is within sight.

99
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,885
Right about now, my companion
is finishing off your partner.

100
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,930
Is this companion of yours strong?

101
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,933
Yes, he's strong.

102
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,144
He's still weaker than I am though.

103
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,695
In that case,
I've got nothing to worry about.

104
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,823
I've been fighting him
for a long time now,

105
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,616
and I've never beaten him!

106
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,078
No!

107
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,583
Damn.

108
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,252
Sit still for a moment
and let me cut you up,

109
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,546
you big behemoth!

110
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,058
Your body...

111
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,311
There's a bit of a story behind this.

112
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:28,568
I know, let me tell you a story.
You've probably already heard it.

113
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,363
It's a story about an old codger
named Barry.

114
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>Once upon a time, here in Central,</i>

115
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,371
<i>there was an old codger named Barry
</i><i>who enjoyed cooking.</i>

116
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,292
<i>Barry loved to cut meat apart.</i>

117
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,585
<i>But one day,</i>

118
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,588
<i>after he was no longer content
</i><i>with just beef or pork,</i>

119
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,217
<i>Barry started going out into town,
</i><i>night after night,</i>

120
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,468
<i>and began cutting people apart.</i>

121
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:02,644
<i>In time, Barry was caught, but by then,
</i><i>23 people had fallen prey to him.</i>

122
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,648
<i>This man, who had plunged
</i><i>the populace of Central</i>

123
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,818
<i>into the very depths of terror,
</i><i>was naturally sent to the gallows.</i>

124
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,195
<i>And all was well that ended well.</i>

125
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,242
At least, that's the story circulating
out in the world.

126
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,744
However, there's another part to it.

127
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,664
Barry isn't actually dead.

128
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,500
He is alive, and charged
with guarding a certain place.

129
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,294
However, his body has been taken from him.

130
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:35,009
Yes! He is the very person
you see before you!

131
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,888
That infamous mass murderer!
Barry the Chopper! I'm him!

132
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,266
Sorry, never heard of you.

133
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,146
I'm from a rural town in the east, so...

134
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,647
Even if you don't know about me,

135
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,150
when you see this body, there should be
some sort of reaction, right?

136
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,609
Something more like, "Yaah!"

137
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,821
Or "What happened to your body?"
or something.

138
00:10:54,904 --> 00:11:00,034
- Yaah! What happened to your body?
- That hurts.

139
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,205
I get it. You were executed too.
You had me startled there.

140
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,001
- I'm not a criminal!
- Then, how come?

141
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,753
It's kind of a long story.

142
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:15,508
When I lost my body,
my brother transmuted my soul for me.

143
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,886
Your brother?

144
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,973
- I see, your brother, huh?
- What's so funny?

145
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,894
Are you sure this brother and you
are really siblings?

146
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,479
Well, our personalities
are different, but...

147
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,690
No, no, no, that's not what I mean.

148
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,902
Are you sure you're not
a suit-of-armor puppet,

149
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,695
created by your so-called brother?

150
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,407
Were you ever really a person, originally?

151
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,618
Of course I was!

152
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,164
I am, without a doubt,
the person named Alphonse Elric!

153
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,124
How can you believe that?

154
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,835
Well, because of the memories I have,
ever since I was born.

155
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,212
What if those are also made-up?

156
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,383
But Winry and Grandma know me.

157
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,636
Well, they're, you know, in on it.

158
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,308
Yeah, that's right.
You were never alive to begin with.

159
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,854
- Then, what about you?
- That's simple.

160
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,774
Don't move! This area is off-limi--

161
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:19,155
There, you see?
I love to chop up live people.

162
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,241
I enjoy killing so much, I can't stand it.

163
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,078
I kill, therefore, I am!

164
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,831
That proves I am who I am,
and that's good enough for me!

165
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:39,258
Oh, your brother is that good, is he?
Then I'll have to hurry up and defeat you.

166
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,475
- Al! Now!
- What?

167
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,398
That was dirty.

168
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,608
There's no such thing as dirty in a fight!

169
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:06,619
What's the matter?
You still haven't destroyed my bloodseal.

170
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,163
Hurry up and destroy it--

171
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,708
There's something I need to ask you about.

172
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,167
The Philosopher's Stone?

173
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,878
Why don't you tell me everything
you know about it?

174
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:16,963
I can't.

175
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,008
Hey, now, beaten dogs
don't get to show me up.

176
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,302
I haven't been beaten yet.

177
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,142
Impossible!

178
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,779
I forgot to mention,
this mass murderer Slicer

179
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,365
was actually a pair of brothers.

180
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,453
An independent head and body?
That reeks of foul play!

181
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,704
Who was it who said

182
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,582
that there's no such thing
as dirty in a fight?

183
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,669
Now, let's begin the second round,
short stuff.

184
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,463
Don't call me short!

185
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,674
I'm not giving you any time to transmute!

186
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,928
<i>Damn, I'm losing too much blood.
</i><i>I'm starting to feel dizzy.</i>

187
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,770
<i>This is bad...</i>

188
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,521
<i>This is bad...</i>

189
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>Gonna die... gonna die... gonna die...!</i>

190
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,489
Now to finish you!

191
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,667
You reminded me of someone I can't stand.

192
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,170
Now I've gone and done
the same thing he did, haven't I?

193
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,091
- Now you've done it, you little brat!
- That's just gross!

194
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,720
- My brother...
- I hate to say it, but we've lost.

195
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,848
You're not going to tell me
you're actually three brothers, are you?

196
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,058
No, no.

197
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,647
Kid, hurry up and destroy us.

198
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,066
Don't ask me to become a murderer.

199
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,151
With bodies like these,
are we even people?

200
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,324
If I don't consider you to be people,

201
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,702
then that would mean I don't consider
my brother to be a person.

202
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,706
Come on, come on.
What's the matter, armor puppet?

203
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,877
- I am not an armor puppet!
- You just think you're not!

204
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:24,757
Was there ever a real you?
Were you ever really alive?

205
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:29,887
There is a way for you to prove
that you're not an armor puppet.

206
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:34,767
You've got a bloodseal too, right?
Go ahead and break it yourself.

207
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,769
If you die, then you were real!

208
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,647
If you're still up and moving around,
you're an armor puppet!

209
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,192
There's no way
I could do something like that!

210
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,780
Then I'll do it for you!

211
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,452
My brother is human.
You guys are also human.

212
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,830
That's why I don't want to kill you.

213
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,377
Brother?

214
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,381
We two, as brothers, have been
stealing, destroying, and killing

215
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,717
for as long as we can remember.

216
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,428
And now, to be treated as humans
for the first time,

217
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,222
after taking the forms we have...

218
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,057
It's hilarious!

219
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,395
Kid, as a parting gift,
I will tell you everything.

220
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,938
The ones who made
the Philosopher's Stone,

221
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,192
and ordered us to protect this place...

222
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,910
That was a close one.

223
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:40,458
No, 48, we can't have you
speaking out of turn.

224
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,542
Oh, my.

225
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,794
What is the Fullmetal pipsqueak
doing here?

226
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:48,299
Such a trying boy.
How did you find out about this place?

227
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,430
Brother! Brother! Brother!

228
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,061
Pipe down, you halfwit!

229
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,731
You were just about to kill
one of our precious sacrifices.

230
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,899
Do you understand?

231
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,945
How were you going to account for this
if it messed up the plan?

232
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:31,592
Who are you people? What plan?
What do you mean, sacrifice?

233
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,429
Oh, my, the pipsqueak is raring to go.

234
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,684
You shut up with that pipsqueak talk!

235
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,645
A pipsqueak is a pipsqueak,
right, pipsqueak?

236
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:49,110
I don't like fighting.
It's painful when you get hurt, you know.

237
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,406
You're the one who picked this fight,
and I accept--

238
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,323
POP

239
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,785
Looks like you have a malfunction.

240
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,287
Wha--?

241
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,038
Lucky me!

242
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,085
You're fortunate your arm broke.

243
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,879
You're getting off
without being hurt too badly.

244
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,924
Listen to me, boy.

245
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:16,012
Don't forget that you're being allowed
to live.

246
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:23,603
We can't have this boy showing up again.
Let's burn this place down.

247
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,985
<i>There's something I've been meaning
</i><i>to say to you for a while,</i>

248
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,779
<i>but I've been too afraid to mention it.</i>

249
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:39,201
<i>What was Brother about to say to me?
</i><i>What was he so afraid to tell me?</i>

250
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,579
<i>What was he so afraid to say?</i>

251
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,206
<i>Are you sure you're not
</i><i>a suit-of-armor puppet,</i>

252
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,499
<i>created by your so-called brother?</i>

253
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,753
<i>Were you ever really a person, originally?</i>

254
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:56,010
What's the matter, my little armor puppet?

255
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,929
Shut up! I'm not...

256
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,349
Go ahead and admit it. You'll feel better.

257
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,314
You've left yourself wide open,
you big behemoth!

258
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,901
Don't move!

259
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,445
Surrender yourself, nice and easy!

260
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,990
This is starting to get more complicated.

261
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,255
Sergeant, take cover!

262
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,387
What are you doing? Get out of there!

263
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,848
- But Brother is still inside!
- What?

264
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,893
You know what this means.

265
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,021
Time to hightail it outta here!
Hey, you!

266
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,190
- You'd better hurry away from here too!
- Hold it!

267
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,109
Brother! Brother!

268
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,528
Take cover!
You'll end up getting caught in it too!

269
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,612
But...!

270
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,871
- Hey there, I brought you some baggage.
- Brother?

271
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,961
His life isn't in any danger,
but he's lost a lot of blood

272
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,088
so you should hurry
and get him to a hospital.

273
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,049
Also, you should keep
a closer watch on him

274
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,218
to make sure
they don't do anything too crazy.

275
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,596
- He is a precious resource after all.
- Who are you?

276
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,515
Lieutenant Ross! Quickly!

277
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,394
- Sergeant, give me a hand!
- He's covered in blood, isn't he?

278
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:34,066
- Talk later! Hurry and get out of--
- He's gone.

279
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,452
- Let us out!
- It's an earthquake!

280
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,329
- Are you trying to kill us?
- Hey, shut up! Take it easy!

281
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,750
What a nice sound.

282
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:57,465
That's the sound of a building crumbling,
using explosives.

283
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,008
As close as it is,

284
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,595
I'd say it's the Fifth Laboratory,
right next door.

285
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,514
What a nice sound.

286
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,268
A truly great sound, that reverberates
down to the core of my body.

287
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,061
No talking to yourself, Kimblee!

288
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,189
Oh, excuse me.

289
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,649
I was just recalling
the Ishvalan War of Extermination,

290
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,360
and I couldn't help but feel happy.

291
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,165
<i>Are you sure you're not
</i><i>a suit-of-armor puppet,</i>

292
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>created by your so-called brother?</i>

293
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:14,184
So, in Central, the senior staff
in control of State Alchemists

294
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,313
are shorthanded, thanks to Scar.

295
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,776
Rumor has it that Colonel Mustang's
promotion to Central is not far off.

296
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,323
<i>- Central, huh? Not bad.
- Watch yourself.</i>

297
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,242
<i>When you encroach on senior staff
</i><i>as young as you are,</i>

298
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,328
<i>you're going to make more enemies.</i>

299
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,079
I've been prepared for that
from the start.

300
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,958
Just a word of warning from one
who's gone before you in Central.

301
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:43,005
<i>Find as many people who understand you
</i><i>and support you as you can.</i>

302
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,966
<i>Which means, hurry up and find a wife!</i>

303
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,343
Shut up!

304
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,555
What? He just hung up on me!

305
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,017
Colonel Hughes, please don't make
so many personal calls, okay?

306
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,644
Sorry.
