1
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,349
What's the matter?

2
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,768
The guys outside say
they want to negotiate.

3
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,314
Just one man. He's coming to you.

4
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,024
Don't shoot, all right?

5
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,196
Hands above your head.
Any false moves, and we will shoot!

6
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,119
It's all right.

7
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,041
Let him through. He's a man we can trust.

8
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,022
Lieutenant!

9
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,158
Is there any way
that I can see my husband?

10
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>You can't!</i>

11
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>There's no telling
</i><i>what will befall you if you go.</i>

12
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,875
We can't completely rule out
the possibility

13
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,211
of military forces being in the hands
of the anti-Bradley faction.

14
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>Please, be patient
</i><i>just a little while longer.</i>

15
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,718
Yes. Yes, you're right.

16
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,564
You say you don't accept the truth?

17
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,982
Yeah, that's right!

18
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:15,487
And you! You might think you've won
because you've got all your sacrifices

19
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,365
but we aren't going to be so easily used.

20
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,284
Your words are futile.

21
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,496
Can you stand? We're getting out of here.

22
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,957
No, you can't get away.

23
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,630
You are already inside my belly.

24
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,304
What is this?

25
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,850
Is the good gentleman, or Father,
or whoever it is, in there?

26
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,440
Right about now,
Mustang is with our father.

27
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,985
I can't vouch
for his physical integrity, though.

28
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,285
- May!
- Beansprout girl!

29
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,663
You there, with the eyes all over you.
You're immortal, aren't you?

30
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,126
You're not denying it?

31
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,547
Alphonse, I will be taking that one.

32
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,176
Just a minute.
He's too much for you alone.

33
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,970
No, I have my alkahestry.

34
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,638
Sure, even if our alchemy is bound,

35
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,349
you can still use alkahestry, but...

36
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,730
I will leave the smaller Homunculus
to the two of you!

37
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,613
You make it sound so simple.

38
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,789
<i>They forced the colonel's gate open?</i>

39
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,958
If you can use such a strong-arm move,

40
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,002
why haven't you done it before now?

41
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,587
Fullmetal...

42
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,132
when I was caught up
in the transmutation, he said,

43
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,637
"I didn't want to have to resort to this,
but there is no choice."

44
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,057
So it carries some sort of high risk.

45
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,308
Probably.

46
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,603
Let's give it a shot.

47
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,194
All right! We can use our alchemy!

48
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,907
He ran? Up to now, he's always
deflected us with his black shadows.

49
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,618
We might be able to take him now!

50
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:35,502
You've messed up my home yet again.
What am I to do with you?

51
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,633
Immortality will be mine!

52
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:56,273
You are someone I do not need here.
Away with you.

53
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,577
No, young lady!
He doesn't have to move to--

54
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:19,921
May!

55
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,679
What in the world is going on?

56
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,683
There's still no contact
with the command center.

57
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,979
Reporting in!
The city is infested with Ishvalans.

58
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,939
Several MP squads have been--

59
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,858
Why, you--

60
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:46,406
Excuse me! There's no time to explain.

61
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,250
No! No!

62
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,711
Help me! Help me! Help me!

63
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,715
Excuse us, ma'am.
We won't harm you, so please tell us...

64
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,676
This house is right here, correct?

65
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,064
Whoa, it's getting darker
right before our eyes.

66
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,066
I wonder if the others
are doing all right.

67
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,901
This is the place, right?

68
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,320
Yeah, no doubt about it.

69
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,366
All right.

70
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,618
Now then,

71
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,913
it's up to you, Scar.

72
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,675
It's nice to face death
directly like this, isn't it?

73
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,430
The only thing I feel is a pure sensation,

74
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,933
telling me to "fight to the death."

75
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,147
Rank, personal history, birth,

76
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,026
race, sex, name...

77
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,989
I don't need any of it.

78
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,825
To just fight
without being bound to anyone,

79
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,537
or on behalf of someone...

80
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,208
it feels so good.

81
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,963
I've finally arrived.

82
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,106
What's wrong? Is that the best you've got?

83
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,190
It's not good enough!

84
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,027
Entirely not good enough.

85
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,530
Let me see you try to destroy me,

86
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,408
human with no name!

87
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,917
Unbelievable.

88
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,713
That's the look on your face, isn't it?

89
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,424
Yes, that I would use something like this?

90
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:59,057
Up until a little while ago,
I wouldn't have imagined it either.

91
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,525
I considered for a long time
what I could do.

92
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,112
And this is what I came up with.

93
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,908
The reconstruction transmutation circle

94
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,244
that I got from my brother's research!

95
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:26,000
You miserable humans
never give up the struggle.

96
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:35,927
May!

97
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,975
Damn! Al, go help May!

98
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,476
What about Pride?

99
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,063
Let me handle him.
I can take him by myself!

100
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,067
All right.

101
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,331
Young lady!

102
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,669
You keep still, Hohenheim.

103
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,928
Alphonse!

104
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,901
What's the matter? What's the matter?

105
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,944
Your attacks are pretty lackluster,
aren't they?!

106
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:40,366
Please do not misunderstand.
Until you have fulfilled your purpose...

107
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,744
You have to keep me alive, huh?

108
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,997
Then all I have to do is defeat you all
before that happens!

109
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,417
Defeat us? Please, do try.

110
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,960
You are short,

111
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,880
so you've always fought those
who were bigger than you.

112
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,342
Put another way,
you have little experience

113
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,885
fighting those who are smaller than you.

114
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,101
Dad! I apologize if I hit you!

115
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,698
Why, you...

116
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,701
You're right, I've fought nothing
but opponents bigger than me.

117
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,662
Which is why...

118
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,126
...I know the attack patterns
a runt will have!

119
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,132
Sensei!

120
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,136
His no-motion transmutations
are a real problem.

121
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,226
It's just about time.

122
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,338
We are done playing around.

123
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,717
Time to get to work for me, my sacrifices.

124
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,062
Ah, it's completely dark.

125
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,355
Hurry...

126
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,569
Hurry and get us to the center
of the transmutation circle.

127
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,321
Hurry! We won't make it in here!

128
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,323
Stop acting up!

129
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,119
Take me to the center! Do it now!

130
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,204
We'll be swallowed up!

131
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,415
Hurry!

132
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,477
The time has come!

133
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:29,077
Have you ever thought
of this planet as a life form?

134
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:36,376
Or perhaps I should say a system,
rather than a life form.

135
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,378
<i>A system that can retain</i>

136
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,382
<i>a vast amount of information
</i><i>about the universe,</i>

137
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,886
<i>incomparable to the amount
</i><i>of information a single human has.</i>

138
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:53,393
<i>Once one opens that gateway,
</i><i>how much power would they gain?</i>

139
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,562
Have you ever thought about that?

140
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,651
Right here, right now,
using you sacrifices,

141
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,403
I am going to open that gateway!

142
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,662
That's where the center is, huh?

143
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,372
Greed!

144
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,876
The center of the world is mine!

145
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,046
I am going to lay hold on the world!

146
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,424
He got him.

147
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
I thought you might be coming,

148
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,772
my son, Greed.

149
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,777
You are the avarice
that was born of me, after all.

150
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:51,367
Anything I want, you will want,
as we are the same.

151
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,665
Ed!

152
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,074
The center of the world

153
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,327
is here!

154
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,837
Damn it!

155
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,113
What?

156
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,249
What is this?

157
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,165
Yes, fight each other, gateways!

158
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,667
Repel each other!

159
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,843
What magnificent energy!
It's all I can do just to contain it.

160
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:22,476
With this power, I will open up
the gateway of this planet!

161
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,303
What is this?

162
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,449
Winry...

163
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,079
What is this?

164
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,249
Ms. Pinako, what is this?

165
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,712
Hohenheim, when you come back,

166
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,798
I'm gonna slug you.

167
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:23,305
Ed... Ed...

168
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,822
God!

169
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,327
Respond to the cry of my soul!

170
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,913
Come to me!

171
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:56,774
Yes, come to me! I will continue
to be bound by you no longer!

172
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:05,783
I shall drag you down to the earth,
and make you a part of me!
