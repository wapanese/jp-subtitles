00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:06,381
<i>Alchemy is the science of understanding,
</i><i>decomposing, and reconstructing matter.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:17,643
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,194
<i>Alchemists have a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

8
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,292
<i>Ed and the others encounter a man
</i><i>named Marcoh</i>

9
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>who possesses a Philosopher's Stone,
</i><i>albeit an incomplete one.</i>

10
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>Moved by Ed's zeal,</i>

11
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:16,011
<i>Marcoh reveals the hidden location
</i><i>of his research materials.</i>

12
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>After finishing repairs to his automail,</i>

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,896
<i>Ed stands before the first branch
</i><i>of the National Central Library</i>

14
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,107
<i>where Marcoh's research materials are.</i>

15
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,947
Dr. Marcoh's research materials!

16
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,202
It was so much trouble,
I just burned the whole building down.

17
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:45,624
- What did you do in Central?
- I was just explaining that to you.

18
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,211
The Fullmetal boy found out
about Marcoh's materials.

19
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,090
With that taken care of,

20
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,343
I came back to see how things are going
in East City.

21
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,470
Is he here?

22
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,848
- Gluttony?
- I smell him. I smell him.

23
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:07,562
The Ishvalan cloaked in the scent of blood
is nearby.

24
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:12,984
- Can I eat him?
- Right down to the last strand of hair.

25
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,733
There haven't been any reports
of Scar sightings

26
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,360
since the incident
with the Elric brothers.

27
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,739
Maybe he's no longer in East City.

28
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,158
I need for him to be here.

29
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,245
If I can solve a case that was too much
for Central to handle,

30
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,289
it means my stock will go up.

31
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:15,338
I'll make use of everything I can
until I assume the office of Fuhrer,

32
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,217
and take full command of military affairs.

33
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,095
You may want to be more discreet
about such improper declarations.

34
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,767
Yeah, I will make every effort
to be more careful.

35
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,934
Excuse me, sir.

36
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,646
We've just received news
of an explosion on Marl River.

37
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,606
What?

38
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,069
Was it a gas explosion?

39
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,490
I don't know.
It's been so restless lately, after all.

40
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,664
I don't think there can be any mistake
that this is what Scar was wearing.

41
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,293
- Have you found a body?
- No, but we're still searching.

42
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,798
Either way, he can't be doing well
after losing this much blood.

43
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,593
But until we can confirm he's dead,
don't get careless

44
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,094
- Lieutenant Havoc...
- Yes, sir?

45
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,848
Have your detail proceed
to remove the debris.

46
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,683
Day and night, no breaks.

47
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,977
<i>Pull his body out of there,
</i><i>no matter what.</i>

48
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,814
Please, cut us some slack, sir.

49
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>- Are you trying to work us to death?
</i><i>- Shut up!</i>

50
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,819
After all, until I see his body
with my own eyes,

51
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,114
- I can't relax on any dates.
- You don't say.

52
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,869
- Looks like he got away from us.
- I didn't get to eat him.

53
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,373
Okay, okay. Next time, all right?

54
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,416
But, after all that's been done to him,

55
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,127
Scar won't be taking any action
for awhile.

56
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,005
I'm going back to Central again.

57
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,634
I have to report to Father
about Scar and all.

58
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,724
It burned up completely, huh?

59
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,851
Major Armstrong!

60
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,314
Oh, if it isn't 2nd Lieutenant Ross
and Sergeant Brosh.

61
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,399
What's the matter?

62
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,860
You've been ordered to report
to the Command Center.

63
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,489
We will be taking over for you
in escorting Edward Elric.

64
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,909
- Very well.
- What is this?

65
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,453
Here I think I can get away
from the stuffy old guy,

66
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,414
and now we've got another escort?

67
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,917
As far as the library incident,

68
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,046
there is someone who was well acquainted
with the materials at the first branch.

69
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,926
- She was no longer working there though.
- Doesn't sound very hopeful.

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,762
Do you need something?

71
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:32,976
Oh, forgive me for asking,
but why do you wear the suit of armor?

72
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,770
It's just what he does!

73
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,149
What he does?
Lieutenant, what is it that he does?

74
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,525
Who are these boys?

75
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:46,489
- Ah, Al, isn't the view here pretty?
- It sure is, Brother.

76
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,206
What is with this mountain of books?

77
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,127
Is there really someone living here?

78
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,715
Miss Sheska? Are you here?
Miss Sheska?

79
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,342
Somebody!

80
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,054
Help!

81
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,810
Brother, there's someone...
There's someone buried under here!

82
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,563
Dig! Dig! Dig this place up!

83
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,565
Hang in there!

84
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,654
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

85
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,948
I accidentally knocked over
a mountain of books.

86
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:33,370
I thought I was going to die under there.
Thank you very much!

87
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,164
- Are you Sheska?
- Yes.

88
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,540
The one from the first branch?

89
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,417
FLINCH

90
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,296
The first branch.
Oh, how sweet the sound of it!

91
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,215
I've always loved books,
ever since I was born.

92
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:50,220
So when I wound up securing a job there,
it felt like I had gone to heaven.

93
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,474
But I forgot that I was at work,
and all I ever did was read books.

94
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,643
- Get to work!
- So I got fired.

95
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,894
I have to work,

96
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,940
because I want to move my sickly mother
into a better hospital, but...

97
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,486
I really am a klutz at everything
except for reading books,

98
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,406
so no matter where I go,
I can't get a job.

99
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,410
Yes, I'm a good-for-nothing person!
I'm the scum of society!

100
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,497
- There's something we'd like to ask you.
- Yes?

101
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,666
Do you remember seeing
any research notes

102
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,085
- belonging to someone named Tim Marcoh?
- "Tim Marcoh"

103
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,504
Tim Marcoh... Tim Marcoh...

104
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,132
- Yes, I remember.
- Really?

105
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,675
They were handwritten, and moreover,

106
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,052
they had been shoved into a bookcase
in the wrong section,

107
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,595
so I remember them well.

108
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,141
So they really were there!

109
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,894
Which means, sure enough,
they've been burned up.

110
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,147
Did you want to read those research notes?

111
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,568
- Yeah, but they burned up.
- Sorry to have bothered you.

112
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,571
I remember everything that was in them.

113
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,203
Well, I mean, I remember the content
of any book I read.

114
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,165
It will take some time, but do you want me
to duplicate them for you?

115
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:05,420
- Thank you, bookworm!
- Worm... you say?

116
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,716
Here is a reproduction
of Mr. Tim Marcoh's research notes.

117
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,261
Sorry, there was quite
a large amount of it

118
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,096
so it took five whole days.

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,225
There sure are some amazing people
in this world, huh, Brother?

120
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,605
- This really is Dr. Marcoh's?
- Yes, no doubt about it.

121
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,108
"1,000 Type Menus for Today,
by Tim Marcoh."

122
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,113
"Add a dash of water
to one tablespoon of sugar..."

123
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,908
This really is a thousand daily recipes.

124
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,994
Hey, what part of this did you think
were important documents?

125
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,707
Don't ask me. I just copied it down
the way I remember it.

126
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,043
Apparently, this was all just
a big wild goose chase.

127
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,754
You're absolutely sure
this is what Dr. Marcoh wrote,

128
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,798
word-for-word, right?

129
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,346
- Yes, absolutely sure.
- You are incredible! Thanks.

130
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,642
All right! Let's take these back
to the central library.

131
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,228
They'll have a collection
of related books there.

132
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,687
Yeah.

133
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,191
Whoops, your fee, your fee...

134
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,401
Lieutenant Ross, here.

135
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,363
This is my registration code
and silver pocket watch ID.

136
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,533
Withdraw this amount
out of my annual research funding,

137
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,118
and give it to Sheska for me.

138
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:23,957
Yes, sir. I can go to the prefectural
State Alchemist office, right?

139
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,375
That's right.

140
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,628
Sheska, really, thanks a lot! Bye.

141
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,883
From his research funding...

142
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,803
What kind of sum of money is this?

143
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,057
<i>What is with that boy
</i><i>throwing that kind of money around?</i>

144
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,190
Are these cookbooks
really research notes about alchemy?

145
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,653
Alchemy can be a dangerous art if misused.

146
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,700
To prevent that,
alchemic research is encrypted.

147
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,202
<i>It may look like an ordinary cookbook
</i><i>to the average person,</i>

148
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,955
<i>but the actual content can only be
</i><i>understood by whoever wrote it.</i>

149
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,584
These are advanced alchemic notes.

150
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,419
If only the writer can understand them,

151
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,088
how are you going to be able
to decipher them?

152
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,509
With knowledge and insight.
The rest is intensive, arduous work.

153
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,095
Wow, that's mind-boggling.

154
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,973
Al! There's a section on squab in here!

155
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,225
Pigeons? You don't suppose that means...

156
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,855
Yeah, it might refer to the Green Lion,
the philosopher's month.

157
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
Did you bring over Flamel's Codex,

158
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,693
or Lambspring's Concerning
the Philosopher's Stone?

159
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,196
- Of course!
- All right. Look here.

160
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,074
- And here too, right?
- You're right.

161
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,493
- And maybe here too.
- Yeah.

162
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,996
All right, let's get to this!

163
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,132
Why is this code so damn hard
to figure out?

164
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,511
Brother, maybe we ought to ask
Dr. Marcoh about this directly.

165
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,891
- No! If we ask him, we admit defeat.
- Is that what the issue is here?

166
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,436
Sheska...

167
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,690
Thanks to you, Edward,

168
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,110
I was able to move my mother
into a better hospital.

169
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,822
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it, don't mention it.

170
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,699
Have you made any progress deciphering it?

171
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,120
Have you found a job yet?

172
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,916
Still, thanks to you,

173
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,336
I've come to believe that even
a good-for-nothing person like me

174
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,963
can be of help to someone.

175
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:39,175
- Thank you very much.
- You're not a good-for-nothing person.

176
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,136
I think that being able to try
your hardest to be something

177
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,222
is a talent all by itself.

178
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,434
And besides, your memory is incredible.
I think you should have faith in yourself.

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,561
Thanks.

180
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,360
- Yo!
- Lt. Colonel Hughes!

181
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,696
I heard from Major Armstrong
that you were here.

182
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,739
What gives?

183
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,534
I told you, whenever you get to Central,
give me a holler.

184
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,578
Oh, we just had something urgent come up.

185
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,955
Well, I've been busy too
and haven't been--

186
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,207
They're speaking casually
with Colonel Hughes there.

187
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,835
Who are these boys?

188
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,546
Lately, we've had a lot of cases
and whatnot.

189
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,716
The Tucker Chimera case
hasn't even been settled yet.

190
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,928
Oh, sorry, I guess that brings up
some unpleasant memories, huh?

191
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,848
But you know,

192
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,767
as if it wasn't bad enough,
the first branch had to burn down,

193
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,228
right when things are hectic.

194
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,896
The first branch?

195
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,192
Yeah, our case records and stuff
were being stored in the stacks there,

196
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,361
so it's impeding our duties.
Something awful.

197
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,197
What?

198
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:51,789
What do you say, Lt. Colonel?
She is looking for a place to work.

199
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,125
And I have indeed read
the military's criminal records,

200
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,334
and remember them.

201
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,712
All righty!
We'll get you processed right now.

202
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,838
My office pays well!

203
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,384
Huh? You mean...
Thank you very much.

204
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,180
I'll have faith in myself, and do my best.
Really, thanks so much.

205
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,515
Come on, come on, right to work!

206
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,394
Who is this guy, a kidnapper?

207
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,610
Being able to try your hardest
to be something

208
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,696
is a talent all by itself, huh?

209
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,574
Nicely said, little brother.

210
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,576
Whenever I look at a certain someone,

211
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,287
that's what I think,
deep down in my heart.

212
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:39,545
Okay, well, that certain someone
will continue to try his hardest.

213
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,492
It's closing time.

214
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,495
It's ten whole days today.

215
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,498
I'm impressed they persevered
until closing.

216
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,541
The hell with it!

217
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,093
A little quarrel between brothers?

218
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,179
You can't get desperate
just because you can't crack this.

219
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,722
We did crack it.

220
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,725
We did crack the code.

221
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,145
Really? That's good, isn't it?

222
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,147
There's nothing good about it, damn it!

223
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,360
This is the devil's research,
which shouldn't be pursued.

224
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,279
Curse you, Dr. Marcoh.

225
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,199
What exactly is it?

226
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,704
The ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone
are live humans!

227
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,666
What's worse,
in order to manufacture one Stone,

228
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,252
it requires multiple sacrifices.

229
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,173
How could the military carry out
such an inhuman practice?

230
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,175
This is unpardonable.

231
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,431
Would you mind not speaking to anyone
about this?

232
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,017
- But...
- Please!

233
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,312
Just pretend that you never heard this.

234
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,277
<i>What's this?</i>

235
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,697
The Elric brothers are holed up
in their rooms again tonight.

236
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,033
Yes.
They haven't even eaten all that much.

237
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,912
Their fatigue must have caught up
with them.

238
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,331
Lately, they seem to have devoted
all their energy to this.

239
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,042
After working so hard
to decipher the material,

240
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,293
and have it be that...

241
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,796
It disturbs me too just thinking about it.

242
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,425
- What?
- Nothing at all!

243
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,179
Most suspicious!

244
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,688
- Brother, go get something to eat.
- Don't want anything.

245
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,318
What a pain, huh?

246
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,407
You know, it's kind of like,

247
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,745
just when we think it's within reach,
it slips away from us.

248
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,373
When it's finally in our grasp,

249
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,251
we get kicked down
by whatever we've caught.

250
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:30,258
God must really hate people
who commit taboos.

251
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,013
I wonder if we'll be like this
the rest of our lives.

252
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:45,022
There's something I've been meaning
to say to you for a while,

253
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,610
but I've been too afraid to mention it.

254
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,778
What?

255
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,035
Elric brothers, I know you're in there!
It is I! Open up!

256
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,206
- What do we do?
- Ignore him, ignore him.

257
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,667
I heard, Edward Elric!

258
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,337
Such a tragedy!

259
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,214
To think that such a terrible secret

260
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,174
was being concealed
by the Philosopher's Stone!

261
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,302
We're sorry.

262
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,971
When someone as stuffy as he is
closes in on you...

263
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,932
Imagine, the military conducting
something like that!

264
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,727
The truth can be a cruel thing at times!

265
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,438
The truth?

266
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:30,985
- What is it, Brother?
- Do you remember what Dr. Marcoh said?

267
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:35,990
Knowing you, you'll be able to find
the truth within the truth.

268
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,951
The truth within the truth...

269
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,371
It's the same
as with alchemy research notes.

270
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,292
What you see on the surface
is only a portion of the truth.

271
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,419
There's still more.

272
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,503
There's still...

273
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,301
Currently, there are four alchemy
laboratories within Central

274
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,470
which have connections to the government.

275
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,974
From among those,
Marcoh worked at the Third Laboratory.

276
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,352
That one is the most suspect.

277
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,939
We went around to all of the laboratories
in the city,

278
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,317
but they weren't doing
any remarkable research--

279
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,487
Here. What is this building?

280
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,238
It was the building
for the Fifth Laboratory,

281
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,574
but it's not currently in use.

282
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,661
There's a risk of it collapsing,
so it has been declared off-limits.

283
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,706
- It's here.
- Eh? What makes you so sure?

284
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,459
- There's a prison next door to it.
- What about it?

285
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,170
What were the ingredients
for a Philosopher's Stone?

286
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,048
Let's see, live humans--

287
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,719
They'd have condemned criminals
in a prison.

288
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,681
Officially, they could say
they were executed...

289
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,308
You don't mean,
the prisoners were the ingredients?

290
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:48,646
Don't make that face.
I don't want to think about it either.

291
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,524
And if prisons from other jurisdictions
were involved...

292
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,068
I wonder if the government is involved.

293
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,362
I kind of get the feeling
that we've stuck our noses

294
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,780
into something terrible here.

295
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,742
You see? This is why we told you
to pretend you never heard anything!

296
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,290
This could become
a highly political issue.

297
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,167
I shall look into this.

298
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,546
In the meantime, 2nd Lieutenant,
Sergeant, speak of this to no one.

299
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,630
Yes, sir!

300
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,550
And you Elric brothers, behave yourselves.

301
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,262
Look here, you two!

302
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,597
You were just thinking
of sneaking into this building

303
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,808
and looking around inside, weren't you?

304
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,602
- No, we weren't. No, we weren't!
- No, we weren't. No, we weren't!

305
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,479
Yeah, sure we weren't.

306
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:40,197
A guard posted at an unused building, huh?

307
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,324
That's suspicious.

308
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,620
- How do we get in?
- We could make our own entrance.

309
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,749
They'd notice the light
from the transmutic reaction.

310
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,542
In that case...

311
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,085
Ups-a-daisy.

312
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,104
It's locked up tight here too?

313
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,781
- Al, wait here.
- Will you be all right by yourself?

314
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:27,620
All right or not, with your huge size
you can't get through here, right?

315
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,621
DEJECTED

316
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,623
I didn't get this big because I wanted to.

317
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,963
- 66...
- What, 48?

318
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,174
After all this time, we've got guests.

319
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,930
Some daredevil dumbasses, huh?

320
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,099
Damn it,
it's even tighter in here than I thought.

321
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,603
I couldn't have gotten through here
if I were regular-sized.

322
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,104
Luckily, my body is smaller.

323
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:59,485
I just said I was small!

324
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,659
There are lights on.

325
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,204
"Not currently in use" my foot.

326
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,706
Bingo.

327
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,917
Brother sure is taking a long time.
