00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,629
<i>Alchemy is the science
</i><i>of understanding, decomposing,</i>

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,340
<i>and reconstructing matter.</i>

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,343
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,054
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:17,643
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:22,606
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,236
<i>Alchemists have a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

9
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,457
<i>In order to gain knowledge
</i><i>about transmuting living things,</i>

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,462
<i>Ed and Al visit the home of Shou Tucker,
</i><i>the Sewing-Life Alchemist.</i>

11
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>His daughter Nina
</i><i>and dog Alexander were also there.</i>

12
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,012
<i>In order for Tucker to pass
</i><i>his State Alchemist assessment,</i>

13
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,808
<i>he transmuted a Chimera
</i><i>using Nina and Alexander.</i>

14
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,020
<i>Nina could never be changed back.</i>

15
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:30,025
<i>Ed became stricken with grief
</i><i>at his own powerlessness.</i>

16
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,533
Mom! Mom!

17
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,746
- What is it, Ed?
- A present.

18
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,831
I transmuted it.

19
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,835
You did, Ed?
You're your father's son, all right.

20
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,089
Thanks.
You really are amazing, Ed,

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,674
to be able to create something
as neat as this.

22
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,259
But...

23
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,224
You couldn't make Mommy right, could you?

24
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,519
Big Brother.

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,730
Let's play.

26
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,573
Are you all right, Brother?
You were having a nightmare.

27
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,176
What's the matter, you two?
What are you up so early for?

28
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,679
So...

29
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,765
What's going to become
of Tucker and Nina?

30
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:50,105
Mr. Tucker was scheduled to be stripped
of his certification and go to trial.

31
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,608
- But both of them are dead.
- Dead?

32
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,530
You'll find this out eventually anyhow,
so I'll just tell you now.

33
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,491
- They've been killed.
- How?

34
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,493
- By who?
- We don't know.

35
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,996
I was just headed over
to the scene myself.

36
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,248
- We're coming too.
- No.

37
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,500
Why not?

38
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,503
It's best you don't see this.

39
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,217
He's still one step ahead of us, huh?

40
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,928
We have to catch up quickly.
The way things are going...

41
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,641
You sound as though
you were expecting this to happen.

42
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,726
What's going on?

43
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,192
God has given us a trial.

44
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,530
Wicked heathens have been spreading
false rumors to disrupt our faith

45
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,532
and the military is planning
to oppress us.

46
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,785
But we must not give in!

47
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,246
Now is the time to rise up
with weapon in hand!

48
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,791
In the name of the great god Leto!

49
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,044
Yeah! We have the god Leto on our side!

50
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
Down with the heathens!

51
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,717
Hey, don't be fooled!
Those are just lies he's telling us!

52
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,638
Silence!
You guys are pawns of the heathens!

53
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,642
Humans are so hopelessly foolish.

54
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,656
<i>- Don't you think so, Gluttony?
</i><i>- Fools, fools.</i>

55
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,283
Yeah, that's the truth.

56
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,703
- Well, well, if it isn't the Father.
- Father.

57
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:32,249
Sorry to have to put you
to all this trouble.

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,292
Once this is over,
I'll be heading right back

59
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,087
to the city that I'm in charge of.

60
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,507
The Fullmetal boy interfered
with our work here,

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,509
but we ended up making good use of it.

62
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,011
It looks like we'll finish
ahead of schedule.

63
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>You manipulated a little information,</i>

64
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,018
<i>and I whipped up the believers,
</i><i>and that's all it took to get this.</i>

65
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,021
<i>Humans are such simpletons.</i>

66
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,816
Bloodshed leads to more bloodshed,

67
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,278
hatred leads to more hatred,
and all the energy that swells up

68
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,699
takes root in the land,
carving out a crest of blood.

69
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,244
No matter how many times they repeat it,
they never learn.

70
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,747
Humans are foolish, miserable creatures.

71
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,001
Which is why they play right
into our hands, don't they?

72
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,214
- Are lots of people gonna die again?
- Yes, they will.

73
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,801
- Can I eat all the ones who are dead?
- No, you can't.

74
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,513
By the way, Envy, how long
are you planning to look like that?

75
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:33,059
- It's grossing me out.
- I'm just in the moment.

76
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,895
But as long as I'm going
to transform anyway,

77
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,982
something young and cute
would be better, huh?

78
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,448
A monster!
What's going on here? The Father.

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,452
- Where has the real Father Cornello gone?
- What do we do?

80
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,913
He called me a monster.
That was rude, huh?

81
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,374
Can I eat him?

82
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,798
Come to think of it, I hear
Shou Tucker in East City has been killed.

83
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:10,138
- Tucker? Who cares about that small fry?
- But it was him who killed him.

84
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,602
Speaking of East City,
isn't the Flame Colonel there?

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,105
Yeah, and apparently, the Fullmetal
pipsqueak is staying there too.

86
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,273
Fullmetal?

87
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,944
I'm incensed that he interfered
with our work,

88
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,946
but we can't very well let him die either.

89
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,448
He's an important sacrifice and all.

90
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,201
That was yummy.

91
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,703
All right. We'll deal with it somehow.

92
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,582
So, what was his name again?

93
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,294
Scar? The scarred man?

94
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,672
Yeah, we don't know anything
about who he is,

95
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,215
so that's what we're calling him.

96
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,801
Our target is not only unidentified,
but elusive.

97
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,681
The only information we have about him
is the large scar on his forehead.

98
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,852
I've heard the stories about him.
So that's who you're pursuing?

99
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,188
By order of the military police
command center.

100
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,941
And here my work at the court-martial
office is piling up too.

101
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,359
My head hurts.

102
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,612
He has killed five people in Central,
all State Alchemists.

103
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,199
Nationwide, there have been ten
who have fallen prey to him.

104
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,744
Five days ago, old man Grand was done in.

105
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,829
Brig. General Grand?

106
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,499
He's the top figure on weapon
transmutation and hand-to-hand combat.

107
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,835
That just tells you
how dangerous this guy is.

108
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,464
Increase your escort and lie low
for a while. Nobody will blame you.

109
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,551
I'm also asking you
to do this as a close friend.

110
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,638
The only ones of any note
around here are you and Tucker, right?

111
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,848
Oh, no.

112
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:42,605
I've been thinking for a long time,
what is the alchemy that we believe in?

113
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:48,069
"Alchemy is knowing the laws
and flow that exists within matter,

114
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,114
its decomposition, and reconstruction.

115
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,535
The world also follows laws
and has a flow, and everything circulates.

116
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,040
The death of people is a part
of that flow. Accept the flow."

117
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,127
That's what Teacher
would always say to us.

118
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,299
I thought I understood it.
But I didn't understand.

119
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,801
<i>That's why we transmuted Mom.</i>

120
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,804
And now, I'm thinking again,
isn't there something we can do

121
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,057
about something we can't do
anything about?

122
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm such an idiot.
I haven't grown at all since then.

123
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,862
I thought the rain might wash away
some of this gloom from me.

124
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:36,117
But right now, every drop
hitting my face is depressing.

125
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,412
And since I don't have a body,

126
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,373
I can't even feel the rain
hitting my skin.

127
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,376
That's something I miss. It pains me.

128
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,006
I really want to get my body back again
soon and be human again.

129
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,426
Even if it means going
against the flow of the world

130
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,303
and it's something we can't do
anything about.

131
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,934
You are the Fullmetal Alchemist
Edward Elric, right?

132
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,314
Brother!

133
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,950
What the hell?

134
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,127
<i>Who is this guy?
</i><i>This is bad. This is bad.</i>

135
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,256
<i>I have to get away.
</i><i>This is bad. This is bad.</i>

136
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,841
Al, run!

137
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,767
You're not getting away.

138
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,816
Brother!

139
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,952
Al, grab on!

140
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:16,009
Damn it, what's this about?
Making enemies is something I've never...

141
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,969
really avoided, but...

142
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,346
there's no reason for anyone
to try to kill me!

143
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,277
Who are you?
Why are you coming after us?

144
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,532
If there are "creators" like you,
then there must also be "destroyers".

145
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,744
You're saying we have to fight, then?

146
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,043
You're gutsy.

147
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,461
But still...

148
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,717
you're too slow.

149
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,223
Al!

150
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,566
<i>- There's nothing inside?
- You bastard!</i>

151
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,403
Too slow.

152
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,574
Damn.

153
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,701
Automail?

154
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,246
I see, so that's why bodily destruction
didn't injure you.

155
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,582
You are an unusual one.

156
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,755
- Brother, don't. You should run away.
- You dumb ass!

157
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,174
How can I run away and leave you behind?

158
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,176
You press your hands together
to make a ring

159
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,136
and then perform transmutation,
is that it?

160
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,262
In that case...

161
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,018
I will start by destroying
this abhorrent right arm of yours.

162
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,271
Brother!

163
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,032
Now you won't be able to use your alchemy.

164
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,372
I will give you a moment to pray to God.

165
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,583
Brother, run! Brother!

166
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,505
Unfortunately, I don't have any god
I'd like to pray to.

167
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,259
Am I the only one you're after?

168
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,221
Are you planning to kill
my brother Al too?

169
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,765
If he interferes, I will eliminate him.

170
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:33,438
However, Fullmetal Alchemist, you are
the only one who is receiving judgment.

171
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,772
Oh, yeah?

172
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,944
Then promise me
you won't harm my brother!

173
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,863
Brother.

174
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,865
I will keep that promise.

175
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,367
What are you talking about, Brother?

176
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,621
What are you doing? Run. Get up and run!

177
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:57,253
Stop. Stop. Stop! Why, you--!

178
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,384
That's far enough.
You sure have been on a royal tear, Scar.

179
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,848
I'm taking you into custody
for being the culprit

180
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,600
behind a string
of State Alchemist killings.

181
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,228
Alchemists are those who change things

182
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,230
from their natural form
into something grotesque.

183
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,360
That is to say, they profane God,
the Creator of all things.

184
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,613
As an agent of God,
I am he who hands down his judgment.

185
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,824
If you interfere,
I will eliminate you as well.

186
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,826
This should be interesting.

187
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,206
- You guys stay out of this.
- Colonel Mustang.

188
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,459
Mustang, the Flame Alchemist.

189
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,171
To think that you would voluntarily
come forward to receive judgment,

190
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,173
what an auspicious day this is.

191
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:46,135
You know my name
and would still challenge me to battle?

192
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,813
What a fool you are!
What did you do that for all of a sudden?

193
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,982
Colonel, you're useless on rainy days
so please stay back.

194
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,109
USELESS

195
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,695
Oh, right. He can't make sparks
when it's this soggy, huh?

196
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,449
It is fortunate that you
cannot create flames, State Alchemist.

197
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,578
For I will destroy all who interfere
with my mission right here and now!

198
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,789
Just try it!

199
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,583
A newcomer?

200
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:22,588
To be able to avoid my blow is not bad.
Not bad at all.

201
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:29,095
You said you would destroy us all, right?
Then you can start by defeating me!

202
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,850
The Strong Arm Alchemist,
Alex Louis Armstrong!

203
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,354
It's just one after the next.
Could this be the guidance of God?

204
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,273
You won't back down, then?

205
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,109
To show my respect for your courage,
allow me to demonstrate

206
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,528
the artistic alchemy
that has been passed down

207
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,614
among the Armstrong family
for generations!

208
00:15:55,246 --> 00:16:00,042
- Who is he?
- The criminal who murdered Mr. Tucker.

209
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,963
He's the one?

210
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,383
Easy, Major! Please don't go destroying
the city so much!

211
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,718
What are you talking about?

212
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,138
Destruction and creation
are two sides of the same coin!

213
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,475
Destroy to create!
Such is the law of the universe!

214
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,978
- Why did he strip down?
- His logic is crazy.

215
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,025
If you were an alchemist like me,
you wouldn't think it so crazy.

216
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,985
Isn't that right, Scar?

217
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,948
- He's an alchemist too?
- That's it.

218
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,159
The transmutation process of alchemy

219
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,370
are the three stages of "comprehension",
"decomposition", and "reconstruction".

220
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,998
He just stops
at the "decomposition" stage.

221
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,335
If he's an alchemist too,
doesn't that mean

222
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,588
he's also turned his back
on whatever the "ways of God" are?

223
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,802
What's more, why is he only going
after those with state certification?

224
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,145
<i>He carries himself unusually well
</i><i>for his size</i>

225
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>and has superhuman destructive force.</i>

226
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,943
<i>Then there's his alchemy.
</i><i>He does pose trouble, to be sure.</i>

227
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,530
I have you cornered!

228
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,324
<i>But there's a moment
</i><i>where he takes too wide a swing!</i>

229
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,700
<i>There it is!</i>

230
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>He's backing up?</i>

231
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,794
- Did you get him?
- He's too fast.

232
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,420
I just grazed him with one shot.

233
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,926
Brown skin and red eyes.

234
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,929
He's an Ishvalan?

235
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,395
- I'm surrounded.
- Don't move. You can't slip out of--

236
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,948
- That bastard. He went into the sewers.
- Don't go after him.

237
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,908
I'm not going after anyone that dangerous.

238
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:01,289
Sorry. And after you bought us
enough time to surround him too.

239
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,125
No, far from buying time for you,

240
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,586
it was all I could do
to keep from getting killed.

241
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,504
Oh, is it over?

242
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,965
Lt. Colonel Hughes,
where have you been up to now?

243
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,969
- Back taking shelter.
- You could back us up or something!

244
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,931
Lay off!
Don't go dragging a normal person like me

245
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,058
into this freak show
with you bunch of pseudo-humans!

246
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,935
Don't just stand around.
We've got things to do!

247
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,478
Deploy troops throughout the city!

248
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,647
- Circulate his description!
- Yes, sir.

249
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,773
Alphonse...

250
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,859
Alphonse!

251
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,280
Al, hey, are you all right?

252
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,284
So that's Elric's younger brother, is it?

253
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,536
Looks like there's a long story
behind that, huh?

254
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,913
Al. Alphonse!

255
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,376
Why didn't you run away
when I told you to? You stupid brother!

256
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,212
Well, I couldn't just run away
and leave you here, Al.

257
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,839
Which is why you're stupid!

258
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:58,220
But why? If I had run away,
you could have been killed, you know!

259
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,389
And maybe I wouldn't have been killed!

260
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,434
Intentionally choosing to die is something
only someone stupid would do!

261
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,312
Hey, go easy on saying
your older brother is stupid!

262
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,938
I'll say it as much as I like!

263
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,859
Live on, live on, and survive.

264
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
Once you do
some more research into alchemy,

265
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,072
you could find a way
to get our bodies back,

266
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,200
as well as a way to save kids like Nina.

267
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,995
I won't ever allow you to do anything

268
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,538
to abandon those possibilities
and choose death.

269
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,587
And now my arm has come off, hasn't it?
Brother, you stupid jerk!

270
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,843
We're falling apart, huh?

271
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,013
Saying we look terrible
doesn't begin to cover it.

272
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,185
- But we're still alive.
- We're still alive.

273
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,524
Good grief, this is an extra special
freak show, huh?

274
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,403
- Sorry.
- Okay, I won't tell anyone upstairs.

275
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,656
If this got out, it would cause
all sorts of trouble, right?

276
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,118
Yeah, the older brother aside,

277
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,037
we couldn't explain away
the younger brother's body.

278
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,541
I have to admit, though,

279
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,794
you've got a real tough customer
coming after you.

280
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,797
The Ishvalan?

281
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,640
<i>The Ishvalans were a race
</i><i>of people to the east</i>

282
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,268
<i>who believed that Ishvala is the one,
</i><i>absolute Creator.</i>

283
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,061
<i>Even after they were annexed
</i><i>into the country,</i>

284
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,273
<i>there were conflicts
</i><i>with a portion of them,</i>

285
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,066
<i>but 13 years ago, there was an incident</i>

286
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:40,990
<i>where a military officer
</i><i>accidentally shot an Ishvalan child dead,</i>

287
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,409
<i>and it developed into a civil war.</i>

288
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,331
<i>One uprising led to another,</i>

289
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,418
<i>and before long, the rebellion
</i><i>had spread to the whole eastern sector.</i>

290
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,504
<i>After seven years of back-and-forth,</i>

291
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,883
<i>the order that came down
</i><i>from the military command...</i>

292
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,135
<i>was to exterminate Ishval.</i>

293
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,307
<i>Many State Alchemists
</i><i>were brought in to act as human weapons.</i>

294
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,108
<i>The State Alchemists
</i><i>produced striking results.</i>

295
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,486
Which is why that man,

296
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:24,074
an Ishvalan survivor,
has justification in taking revenge.

297
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,451
That's nonsense.

298
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,662
There's no justification
for dragging people

299
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,790
who had nothing to do with that
into his revenge.

300
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,708
He's just dressing up
his ugly lust for revenge

301
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,961
by calling himself an agent of God
and acting all arrogant.

302
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,382
Still, the fact is,
he's coming at us with fangs bared.

303
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,468
And we can't let ourselves
be killed either.

304
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,346
The next time we meet,
there'll be no more talk.

305
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,598
- We crush him.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:54,605
Ed, Al, what are you going to do now?

307
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,192
We're going to start walking again.

308
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,111
We can't stand still, you know.
Not as long as we're still alive.

309
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,197
Brother.

310
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,368
First thing we have to do to fix your body
is to get my arm back to normal.

311
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,786
I'm the only one who knows

312
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,914
how to bond your soul
to the armor after all.

313
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,165
Yep.

314
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,167
We've got little choice.

315
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,419
<i>It's been a long time. Let's go back...</i>

316
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,922
<i>and pay a visit to our mechanic.</i>
