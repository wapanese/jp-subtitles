1
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,386
- It's true.
- This does look just like her.

2
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,438
My little one is cute, isn't she?

3
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,775
- Definitely not her!
- I know!

4
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,445
For that matter,
we don't have time to be playing along

5
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,238
with such an insignificant joke!

6
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,950
Really...

7
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,994
- Where could she be?
- Where could she be?

8
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,887
<i>East City! East City!</i>

9
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,024
- New intel on Scar.
- Is he still on the lam?

10
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,151
He never gives up.

11
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,115
Oh, my, I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,035
Not at all. I'm sorry I wasn't watching
where I was going.

13
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:45,707
Such unusual clothing.
Are you from another country?

14
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,128
- I'm from Xing.
- Oh, my. Are you here sightseeing?

15
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,298
There isn't much to look at
here in East City.

16
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:57,135
No, I'm just here transferring trains.

17
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,929
I'm heading north from here.

18
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,847
<i>The train bound for North City.</i>

19
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,016
- Oh, no!
<i>- Departing from Platform.</i>

20
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,102
- Thank you, ma'am.
<i>- All passengers, please hurry aboard.</i>

21
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
Take care, okay?

22
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,824
What an unusual kitty-cat.

23
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,142
- Where did he go?
- I know I heard footsteps.

24
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,939
Over there!

25
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,751
<i>He was together with a middle-aged man
</i><i>who had black hair, right?</i>

26
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,670
Yes, that was the report we got.

27
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,136
This was yesterday.

28
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,851
West, huh?

29
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,812
There were several people wounded
to various degrees here.

30
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,566
Scar must be getting desperate.

31
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,318
I have to say though,

32
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,112
he's being too conspicuous.

33
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,746
Well then, let's get to work.

34
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,735
Well, no matter. It's none of my business.

35
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,757
It looks like a funeral.

36
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,011
Yes, so it would seem.

37
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,097
Such an awful thing.

38
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,807
When you get to be my age,

39
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,311
all you do is wonder
when you're going to end up like that.

40
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,524
Whatever do you mean, ma'am?
You still look quite young to me.

41
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,242
General Grumman, sir?

42
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:13,123
We were to meet up in front
of General Hughes' grave, right?

43
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,130
For you to use your last-ditch measure,
I figured it had to be something serious.

44
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,675
Just to be safe, I put on this disguise.

45
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,470
Wow, I see why you're famous
for being eccentric, General Grumman.

46
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,847
I wasn't expecting such a disguise.

47
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,644
Eccentric?
I shall take that as a compliment.

48
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,855
So, what do you need?

49
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,858
Alkahestry...

50
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,653
We might be able to find out something
about it from the Central Library.

51
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,821
Yeah.

52
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,407
As long as we can't locate
that bean sprout girl,

53
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,743
we have no choice
but to look into it ourselves.

54
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,287
I hope we can find
even a small clue about it.

55
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,627
I see. The Central senior staff
have all gone dark, huh?

56
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,632
You've lost too much
for the information you gained.

57
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,218
<i>With the men that you can trust
</i><i>stripped away from you,</i>

58
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,637
<i>you won't get anywhere.</i>

59
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,766
Yes, sir. I don't know what to say.

60
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,602
Even Raven, huh?

61
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:23,735
It wasn't too long ago that I came
to Central, and Raven asked me

62
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:29,157
<i>if would I be interested in an utterly
</i><i>immortal corps of soldiers.</i>

63
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,617
An immortal corps?

64
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,329
<i>I wonder if he meant Homunculi.</i>

65
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,000
Immortality is nonsense.
I told him so, and turned him down.

66
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,086
And then, immediately afterward,

67
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,506
I was shunted off
to the Eastern Command Center.

68
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,342
You were demoted?

69
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,470
As a result, I've ended up stuck
having to clean up

70
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,223
all of the upsetting messes
in the Eastern Area.

71
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,395
Speaking of upsetting, do you remember
the insurrection in Liore?

72
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>The incident where the false priest
</i><i>of Leto's schemes</i>

73
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,652
<i>were uncovered by the Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

74
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,113
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

75
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,535
Liore fell into all-out chaos,

76
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,497
but at the beginning stages,
the Eastern forces acted quickly

77
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,166
and kept the uprising under control.

78
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:26,756
However, the Central forces came in,
and the Eastern forces were dismissed.

79
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,175
- Weren't they?
- Yes.

80
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:36,683
<i>The peace in Liore quickly disintegrated
</i><i>after the Central forces moved in.</i>

81
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,188
What are those folks
in Central cooking up?

82
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,857
Mercy's sake!

83
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,486
Can't they keep things peaceful and quiet
until after I retire?

84
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,113
There you go again with the jokes.

85
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,034
General Grumman, someone like you

86
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,161
isn't the least bit satisfied
being the chief

87
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,537
of some provincial territory, are you?

88
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,833
Not when you are in command
of the Eastern forces,

89
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,502
hardy soldiers who are veterans of Ishval.

90
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,051
I figured you'd come crying to me

91
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,763
<i>when you used the note
</i><i>with my top-secret contact number on it,</i>

92
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:19,309
but you've called me here
to get me stirred up?

93
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,981
My word, as a result of things in Central
getting interesting,

94
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,901
the embers of my ambition
which had almost gone out,

95
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,278
I have started to flare back up again.

96
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,282
If you get too fired up,
your makeup will run, ma'am.

97
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,117
Oh, good gracious!

98
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,623
Do you have any free time later, sir?

99
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,875
If you like, we could have some tea
somewhere.

100
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,295
Oh, I'm sorry.
I do appreciate the invitation.

101
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,228
It's no use.

102
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,482
Why is there such minimal description
about alkahestry?

103
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,279
We may as well just go over to Xing
and learn the real thing.

104
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,492
On the other hand,
crossing the desert with this automail...

105
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,714
I've found you, Edward Elric.

106
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,010
Major! What are you doing?

107
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,721
Keep quiet inside the library.

108
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,645
I understand you're after a Xingese girl
who has a black and white cat.

109
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,481
Yeah. But how do you know that?

110
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,734
Colonel Mustang told me.

111
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,196
I am running errands
for the colonel today.

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,741
Word is that the girl is headed north.

113
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,872
According to eyewitnesses,
she is headed from East City to the north.

114
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,666
North, huh? All right!

115
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,793
Knowing that much, I can act!

116
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,630
Major, thank you.
Thank the colonel for me too.

117
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,674
Hold on, hold on. Don't be hasty.

118
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,053
Take this with you.

119
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,639
What is it?

120
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,310
A letter of introduction.
It may not be of much use though.

121
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,312
First, see her.

122
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,315
See her? See who?

123
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>Farther north
</i><i>from the Northern Command Center</i>

124
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,491
<i>is a general, nicknamed
</i><i>the Northern Wall of Briggs,</i>

125
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,121
<i>who defends our border with Drachma.</i>

126
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,387
Hurry.

127
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,891
Scar, you can't get away!

128
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,086
Where did they go?

129
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:41,928
Report this to the command center!
That train is bound for West City!

130
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,388
Damn!

131
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,978
I can't find very many details
about alkahestry at all.

132
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,899
<i>That May girl's long-range alchemy
</i><i>was pretty incredible.</i>

133
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,361
I sure wish we could use it.

134
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,615
I should have asked her more about it
when we were at Dr. Knocs' place.

135
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,453
Ling said it was a specialized technique
for the medical field.

136
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:18,339
Are you the Fullmetal Alchemist's brother,
the one in the large suit of armor?

137
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,550
- Yes, I am.
- Amazing!

138
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,807
Thanks. I mean, you should keep quiet
inside the library.

139
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,058
Oh, sorry.

140
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:34,772
- What is that you're studying?
- Alkahestry.

141
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,317
- Alkahestry?
- It's alchemy from the country of Xing.

142
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:42,238
Oh, yeah? The country of Xing?

143
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,699
But you Elric brothers
are masterful enough

144
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,869
to earn your state certifications
here in Amestris,

145
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,456
which is a major alchemic power, right?

146
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,835
So why are you looking into
the minor alchemy of a foreign country?

147
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:03,342
<i>I can't tell him that I'm looking
</i><i>for a way to get my body back,</i>

148
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,553
<i>or to fight back against the Homunculi.</i>

149
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,513
Well...

150
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,934
They say that alkahestry is tailored
toward medical uses.

151
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,395
I'm researching whether or not
there are any new possibilities

152
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,232
of using it as a technique
to save people's lives.

153
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,277
Wow! Just what I'd expect
of the Elric brothers I've heard about.

154
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,365
Al! Alphonse!
Get everything ready! We're leaving!

155
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:30,161
Brother, keep it down inside the library.
And where are we going?

156
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,289
I'll fill you in while we walk.
In any case, we're taking off.

157
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,210
Get our stuff at the hotel together.

158
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,294
Who's the kid?

159
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,133
If you're Mr. Armor's brother,
does that mean you're Edward?

160
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,177
- The State Alchemist?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,139
Wow! You're a teeny alchemist,
just like everyone says!

162
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:56,854
Hey, you say that one more time,

163
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:03,277
and you'll go flying
out as far as Neptune!

164
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,072
Wow, you snap when people call you small,
just like everyone says.

165
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:14,163
- Step away from Master Selim.
- No, don't shoot him.

166
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:19,293
- By any chance, are you Selim Bradley?
- The F端hrer's son?

167
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,921
Yes, I am.

168
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:34,308
How did this happen?
We're supposed to be heading north.

169
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,729
- Don't look at me.
- Sorry about that.

170
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,524
He has been in awe of you
for so long, Edward.

171
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:47,113
- In awe of me?
- Selim, do you like alchemy?

172
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,782
Yes, my dream is to learn alchemy

173
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,995
and become a State Alchemist,
just like Edward.

174
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,291
- In awe of me?
- And then, I want to help out my father.

175
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,301
Do you like your father?
F端hrer King Bradley?

176
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,052
Of course I do.

177
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:15,349
- What kind of man is your father?
- He's a fine man.

178
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,728
He endures a demanding job
that would make a normal man shriek,

179
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,190
and thinks and acts only
for the nation's people every day.

180
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,984
You don't say.

181
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,945
The F端hrer does seem to be busy every day.

182
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,824
That's true.

183
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,621
He still means to stay on active duty
and work himself ragged.

184
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,625
As old as he is,
he ought to take it easier.

185
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,795
He's been devoted to work since way back.

186
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,384
He could handle his job,
but he never understood women.

187
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,388
He was such a rude man,
I even slapped him.

188
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,935
It must have been fate,
because we started seeing each other

189
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,478
and our first date was something else.

190
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,483
Oh, dear, listen to me going on about him.

191
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,162
- Father!
- My...

192
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,834
- Welcome home!
- Sure, Selim.

193
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,836
What is the matter?

194
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,425
I had some free time for a change,
so I came to see your faces.

195
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,555
And then, I heard that
the Fullmetal Alchemist was here.

196
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,724
- Hi there.
- Long time no see.

197
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,770
We just saw each other at the Central
Command Center, didn't we?

198
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:53,281
- Oh, so you ran into them at the library.
- Yes.

199
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,997
You're thinking
that he doesn't look like me?

200
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,377
- No, it's not that.
- I have no blood relation to him.

201
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,172
We were unable to have any children.

202
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,675
So, we're raising a relative's son
as a foster child.

203
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,972
He really has grown up
to be a kind, devoted son.

204
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,432
Cut it out, Father.

205
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,477
- You're embarrassing me.
- It's the truth though.

206
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,110
Something on your mind?

207
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,909
No, it's just that we never see you,
except at the command center

208
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,120
so, I mean, you know?

209
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,206
There's what you might call
an "image gap."

210
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,000
I see.

211
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:50,338
I, too, have a family. Me too.

212
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,092
It may be a little different
from your family though.

213
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,024
Father, are you leaving already?

214
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,736
Yes, it's about time I got back
to my duties.

215
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,412
Please, make yourself at home,
State Alchemist.

216
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,089
Let's go.

217
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,105
- Please, come visit again sometime, okay?
- Yeah, see you later.

218
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:02,868
Neither the wife nor the son know
that the F端hrer is a Homunculus.

219
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,378
Anyway, north! We're going north!

220
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,296
We'll catch that bean sprout girl,

221
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,216
and get the secrets of alkahestry
out of her.

222
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,435
We'll arrive there in the morning.
Get some sleep.

223
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,582
I see. So he managed
to succeed in escaping?

224
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,923
- This is a map of the West Area, right?
- Yes.

225
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:05,306
He was last spotted... here.

226
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,475
West City is here.

227
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,313
Scar and Marcoh disappeared
somewhere in between.

228
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,820
You slow down considerably
around curves, right?

229
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,616
Is it possible that they jumped off?

230
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,327
There's no reason why they couldn't have,
but it's very dangerous.

231
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,746
You don't say.

232
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:35,085
Now then, after they jumped off,
which way would they have fled?

233
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,756
North, or south?

234
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,164
Won't this be the first time
we've ever gone up north?

235
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,290
Yeah, it is.

236
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,460
I wonder if we'll see any snow.

237
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:45,007
Snow, huh? It never really piled up
when we were in Resembool, did it?
