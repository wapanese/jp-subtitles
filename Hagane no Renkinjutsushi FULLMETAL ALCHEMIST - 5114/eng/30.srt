1
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,973
So you ended up
becoming a soldier after all.

2
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,353
Sure enough, you're not ready
for "flame alchemy" yet.

3
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,106
Still, sir?

4
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,774
Up to now,

5
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,320
you have only taught me
the fundamentals of alchemy.

6
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,988
Of course.

7
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,741
It's a waste to even teach
the fundamentals to someone

8
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,286
who lowers himself
to becoming a dog of the military.

9
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,541
Is not alchemy for the people?

10
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,340
Master, now that the country
is threatened from all sides,

11
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,093
there is a pressing need
to strengthen the military.

12
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,096
- Alchemy in defense of the people is--
- I'm tired of hearing that excuse!

13
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,981
I find it difficult to abide this.

14
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,694
Master, how can someone as great as you
suffocate in such poverty?

15
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,738
Please, get your state certification.

16
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,531
Once you do,
you could further your research, and--

17
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,410
I completed my research long, long ago.

18
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,620
What?

19
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,582
The greatest, most powerful alchemy,

20
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,336
depending on how it is used,

21
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,089
it could bring about disaster.

22
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,633
I have perfected it,
and now, I am convinced.

23
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,180
As long as an alchemist lives,

24
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,059
he is a creature
that must pursue the truth.

25
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,939
Once an alchemist stops thinking, he dies.

26
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,026
I died a long time ago--

27
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,194
Master!

28
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,950
Master! Master Hawkeye!

29
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,203
Look after... my daughter...

30
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,163
My daughter...

31
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,458
has all of... my research...

32
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,556
Thank you for everything
that you've done for him.

33
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,017
Don't worry about it.
As his pupil, it was a matter of course.

34
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,856
If anything comes up,
feel free to call on me in the military.

35
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:58,405
Are you going to scorn me
for becoming a soldier too?

36
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,909
Sure, someday, I might die like trash
by the side of the road.

37
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,955
Even so, if I can be one
of this country's building blocks,

38
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,959
and defend the people with these hands,
I believe I'll be happy.

39
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,255
Man, I've revealed such
a naive dream of mine.

40
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,718
Not at all.
I think it's a wonderful dream.

41
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,016
Is it okay for me to believe in a future
where we will live happily?

42
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,687
<i>Should I let you carry out
</i><i>my father's dreams?</i>

43
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,327
Hayate, bad!

44
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,163
Sorry about that.

45
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,624
Nah, it happens a lot.

46
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,377
I heard you'd been assigned to the Führer.

47
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,630
Yes.

48
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,677
Looks like you had
a pretty hard time of it.

49
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,055
I didn't shoot anyone.

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,640
I didn't have to shoot them.

51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,687
Or rather, I couldn't shoot them.

52
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,108
I'm hopeless, huh?

53
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,278
I've got no resolve,
so I'm always putting everyone else out.

54
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,323
Did something happen?

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,620
It turns out Scar is the one
who killed Winry's parents.

56
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,666
At that moment,

57
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,211
deep down in my heart,
I felt it was wrong.

58
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,422
Suddenly, the gun
looked like something scary.

59
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,674
Before I knew it...

60
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,265
I think she hated Scar enough
to want to kill him.

61
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,725
Afterward, she bawled
like I've never seen her bawl before.

62
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,188
I really am hopeless.

63
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,483
I didn't understand her one bit.

64
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,195
It's because you came back alive
that you're worried about this.

65
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,949
But then, you have to go on living.

66
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,867
For the sake of those important
to you as well.

67
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,829
Protect her.

68
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,374
You love Winry, don't you?

69
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,631
No, she's just a childhood friend!

70
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,133
She's like family!

71
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,219
I... It's only natural
that I'd protect her--

72
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,263
I apologize.

73
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,224
This turned out
to be a heavy burden for you.

74
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:41,318
Lieutenant, have you ever thought of it
as a heavy burden?

75
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,612
I don't have the right

76
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,615
to call it light or heavy anymore.

77
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,453
I've taken the lives
of many people in the past.

78
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,330
Also...

79
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,374
I'm the one
who chose to go down this path.

80
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
Ishval?

81
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,633
Is it okay if I ask you about Ishval?

82
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:15,018
Tell me what you people did in Ishval.

83
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,191
<i>Ishval is a harsh land,
</i><i>full of rocks and sand.</i>

84
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,651
<i>The land being what it is,</i>

85
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:27,030
<i>it's no surprise that such a strong people
</i><i>and a religion with such strict tenets</i>

86
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,449
<i>would be born there.</i>

87
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,408
<i>However,</i>

88
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:36,039
<i>a number of people were discontented
</i><i>over their annexation by Amestris.</i>

89
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,125
<i>As a result...</i>

90
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,465
<i>With that one bullet fired,</i>

91
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,344
<i>their discontent became anger
</i><i>and spread throughout all of Ishval.</i>

92
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,688
<i>In time, the uprising became a civil war
</i><i>and it went on for seven long years.</i>

93
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,777
<i>And then, a one-page document
</i><i>determined everything.</i>

94
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,073
<i>Führer's Order #3066.</i>

95
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,576
<i>The piece of paper that declared the start
</i><i>of the Ishvalan War of Extermination.</i>

96
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,786
<i>Just that one sheet of paper.</i>

97
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,347
It was hell.

98
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,144
<i>The air was filled with the smells
</i><i>of decay and gunpowder,</i>

99
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,147
<i>and the sand was heavily soaked
</i><i>with the blood that had been shed.</i>

100
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,406
<i>Ordinary soldiers
</i><i>would fire rounds indiscriminately,</i>

101
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,452
<i>and one of them might happen
</i><i>to take the life of someone.</i>

102
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,620
<i>But for snipers, it was different.</i>

103
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,457
<i>When we pulled the trigger,
</i><i>someone was sure to die.</i>

104
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,628
<i>The only ones for whom the link
</i><i>between cause and effect was so evident</i>

105
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,213
<i>were snipers...</i>

106
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,800
<i>and State Alchemists.</i>

107
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:18,850
My name is Iron Blood Alchemist,
Basque Grand!

108
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,934
Iron and blood!

109
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,353
In other words, weapon and soldier!

110
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:27,484
If I do not take the lead in battle,
who else will?

111
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,233
Why, those Ishvalan punks!

112
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,569
How dare they? Damn them!

113
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,991
Roy! Roy Mustang!

114
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,622
You're here too, are you?

115
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,124
Long time no see.

116
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,669
But then, you've got a different look
about you.

117
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,007
I could say the same for you.

118
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,676
You've got the eyes of a killer.

119
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,803
Yeah.

120
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,392
Back at the military academy,

121
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
we all talked about the future
of this country, huh?

122
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,481
Yeah. And what a beautiful future it was.

123
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,483
Captain, you have a letter.

124
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,527
Oh, thanks!

125
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,822
What?

126
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,199
It's my beautiful future!

127
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,034
Her name is Gracia.

128
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,873
She's waiting in Central for me
to come home.

129
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,332
All by herself, all this time...

130
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,253
What if another man puts the moves on her?

131
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,256
Nah, Gracia wouldn't disregard
a fine man like me

132
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,383
to have an affair with someone else.

133
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,718
No, but then again...

134
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,138
Hughes, a little word of warning.

135
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,182
This often happens in movies and novels...

136
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,768
A guy on the battlefield
who brings up stories of his woman

137
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,812
immediately dies.

138
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,147
Look, you...

139
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,195
Now I can live until tomorrow.

140
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,410
This letter is enough
to let me dream about tomorrow.

141
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,371
Here on this battlefield, where
we don't know when things will end...

142
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,542
It's true, I see no way out of this war.

143
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,921
No matter how much military force
the country throws this way,

144
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,632
the desert just sucks it up like water.

145
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,637
After trying so hard to gain control,
what's left?

146
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,388
All in all, it's just the sand, right?

147
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,140
Yeah.

148
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,310
This is more than comprehensive
for bringing an uprising under control.

149
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,817
Long time no see, Major Mustang.

150
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,987
Do you remember me?

151
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,948
<i>How can this be?</i>

152
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,952
<i>She has developed the eyes of a killer.</i>

153
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,087
Please tell me something, Major.

154
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,508
Why are soldiers killing citizens,
when they should be protecting them?

155
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,762
Why is alchemy meant
to bring about good fortune,

156
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,140
being used to kill people?

157
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,894
Because that is the job
of a State Alchemist.

158
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:54,816
Why are soldiers killing citizens
when they should be protecting them?

159
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,444
Because that is the duty
placed upon soldiers.

160
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,196
Am I wrong?

161
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,075
Are you saying we should accept
this devastation as part of the job?

162
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,953
Well, now, let's say...

163
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,124
Miss, you seem reluctant to be here.

164
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,043
That's the face you're making.

165
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:18,715
Can you tell me for certain
that when you defeat an enemy,

166
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,884
there isn't the slightest moment
where you say, "I got him! Great!"

167
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,971
take pride in your own skills,
and feel a sense of accomplishment?

168
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,723
Miss Sniper?

169
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,975
Don't say another word!

170
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,518
For my part,

171
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,146
I can't understand you people.

172
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,024
The battlefield is, after all,
a place where you kill the enemy.

173
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,529
Did you put on your uniforms
without being ready for that?

174
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,284
Don't avert your eyes from death.
Look forward.

175
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,748
Look directly at the people
you are killing.

176
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,541
And then don't forget them.

177
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,669
The enemy
isn't going to forget you, either.

178
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,133
Whoops, it's time.

179
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,178
I have to get to work.

180
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,971
I have to go too.

181
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,389
See you, Roy.

182
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,391
Hughes.

183
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,893
Why do you fight?

184
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:19,484
It's simple. I don't want to die.
That's all there is to it.

185
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,861
The reasons are always something simple.

186
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,914
<i>Well, then what is the reason
</i><i>for this war?</i>

187
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,917
<i>Reason?</i>

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,128
There is one. A terrible reason.

189
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,999
Are you saying you used our blood
to make a Philosopher's Stone?

190
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,794
What became of the Stone?

191
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,505
<i>Major Solf J. Kimblee,</i>

192
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,591
<i>the Crimson Alchemist, had it.</i>

193
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,847
The man with long, black hair tied back
and cold eyes?

194
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,475
<i>Brother...</i>

195
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,937
And then?

196
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,483
The tide of the battle
turned over that single Stone.

197
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,738
Oh, I love that sound.

198
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:52,535
It resonates deep within my body.
I truly love that sound.

199
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,662
It makes my spinal cord
dance with sorrow,

200
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,873
and my eardrums quiver with glee.

201
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,333
It is a joy I can feel

202
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,713
here as always, side-by-side with death.

203
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,259
What fulfilling work this is!

204
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,393
I love this sound!

205
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,397
How wonderful the Philosopher's Stone is!

206
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,655
It was only a matter of time
before they were exterminated.

207
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:35,828
<i>It was then that the High Priest
</i><i>of Ishvala, Logue Lowe,</i>

208
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:40,625
<i>stood before the Führer
</i><i>on behalf of his brethren.</i>

209
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,045
Ho... you want me to accept your life,

210
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,507
to spare the remaining tens
of thousands of Ishvalans?

211
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,676
- Indeed, I am--
- Don't flatter yourself.

212
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,888
Are you saying that your life

213
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:58,142
and the lives of the remaining
tens of thousands are of equal value?

214
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,061
Let's not get carried away, human.

215
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,774
A single person's life
is only worth that one person,

216
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,944
nothing more and nothing less.

217
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,696
I will not accept this exchange,
nor will I stop the extermination.

218
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,156
Why, you...! You're inhuman!

219
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,699
You will suffer the hammer of God!

220
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,826
God?

221
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,870
This is intriguing.

222
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,163
Even under these circumstances,

223
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,958
the hammer of God
has not befallen me yet, has it?

224
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,960
How many more...

225
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,713
how many thousands more Ishvalans
must I kill before it falls?

226
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,632
Why, you!

227
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,511
God is, after all, nothing more
than something created by people,

228
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,472
by human hands.

229
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,225
If you wish to lower the hammer on me,

230
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,018
then don't rely on God,

231
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,980
do it yourself, human!

232
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,406
In time, the war was over,

233
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,617
<i>and we ended up returning to our homes.</i>

234
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,372
Ultimately, we foot soldiers
were as good as garbage, huh?

235
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
Yeah.

236
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,752
The power of one person
does not amount to much.

237
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,590
As such, I will do all I can,

238
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,341
however little that may be,

239
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,969
to protect those who are dear to me,

240
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,889
those below me
will protect those below them.

241
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,935
We tiny humans should be able
to do that much, at least.

242
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,789
After all you went through in Ishval,

243
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,334
you still ended up choosing this path.

244
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,210
Yes, sir.

245
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:53,215
If the ways of this world are based
on equivalent exchange, as alchemy says,

246
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,511
then in order to allow for a new
generation to enjoy good fortune,

247
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,096
then the price that we must pay

248
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,725
is to carry the bodies of the dead
across a river of blood.

249
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,649
I'm going to appoint you
to be my assistant.

250
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,859
I would like to have you watch my back.

251
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,488
You understand, don't you?

252
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,823
That by leaving my back to you,

253
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,910
you can shoot me from behind at any time.

254
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,247
If I ever step off the path, shoot me.

255
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,124
You are entitled to do so.

256
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,585
Will you follow me?

257
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,588
As you wish, sir.

258
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,216
Into hell, if you so desire.

259
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,807
But even if the colonel
becomes top soldier,

260
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,519
it won't change the fact that this country
is a military state, will it?

261
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,604
Yeah, well, you have to take the Assembly,

262
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,107
which is now more or less
a puppet of the military,

263
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,025
and move it back to a democratic system,

264
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,527
like it should be.

265
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,906
Until you wring out the corruption
from the military-state era,

266
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,866
the country can't be renewed.

267
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,784
Corruption?

268
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,789
For example, the war criminals
of the Ishvalan War of Extermination

269
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,791
could be brought to trial.

270
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,711
Yes.

271
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,379
The hero of the civil war

272
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,590
would just be a mass murderer
in a peaceful world.

273
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,468
And the colonel is aiming for the top,
knowing all this?

274
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,721
That's a path to suicide, isn't it?

275
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,850
The Homunculi were the ones
pulling the strings behind the scenes

276
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,852
during the civil war.

277
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,855
Even if the Homunculi
were the cause of it,

278
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,565
we're the ones who carried it out.

279
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,027
You must not turn away from death.

280
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,780
You must not forget the people
you've killed.

281
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:45,327
The reason being... they certainly won't
forget us for killing them.

282
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,663
But...

283
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,667
Before you start worrying about us,

284
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,794
you have something else to do, right?

285
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,131
You and Alphonse have to get back
to your original bodies.

286
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:02,261
There must be many people
who are waiting for that day to come.

287
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,477
<i>Al and I will get our bodies
</i><i>back together for sure.</i>

288
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,439
Dr. Knocs, sorry to have intruded.

289
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,692
Mr. Armor?

290
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:21,155
Thank you for all the help you've been.

291
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,450
My name isn't Armor. It's Alphonse Elric.

292
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,118
Elric?

293
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,788
You remember Edward Elric, right?

294
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,790
The little alchemist,

295
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,292
I'm his younger brother.

296
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,128
It's a long story, but my body
was taken away from me.

297
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,254
HIM

298
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,716
<i>If you're his brother,
</i><i>then I'll bet you're just like him.</i>

299
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,926
That's pretty rude!

300
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,346
Obviously, I'm far taller than Brother is!

301
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,016
My face isn't harsh like his,
and I'm a better fighter than him.

302
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,019
But I'm not short-tempered.
I'm a gentleman.

303
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,898
Oh, Alphonse!

304
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,652
I sure do hope you get your body
back soon.

305
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,405
Right.

306
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,666
Dr. Marcoh, time to eat.

307
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,004
Huh? It sure is quiet.

308
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:46,175
Are you thinking about Ishval again,
and crying to yourself?
