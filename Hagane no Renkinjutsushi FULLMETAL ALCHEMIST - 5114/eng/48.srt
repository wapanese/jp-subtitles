1
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,318
Geez, because of you,
I'm dying again and again.

2
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,951
Look out!

3
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,504
Young lord!

4
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,549
Exchange greetings later.
Let's pour it on.

5
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,634
Right!

6
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,554
Let me eat you already--

7
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,939
You're overwhelming him!

8
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,691
You're quite the stud,

9
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:33,403
having a fine woman like her hidden away.

10
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,031
Thanks a lot!

11
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:44,456
As dark as it is here,
how do you know where I am?

12
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,406
<i>The ruler of our land of Xing
</i><i>has control over the dragon's pulse,</i>

13
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>or chi, by which he governs the kingdom.</i>

14
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:29,793
Those of us who serve our ruler
are also able to read the flow of chi!

15
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,755
Moreover, our role being what it is,
we can see well at night.

16
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,341
That voice...

17
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,847
Long time no see, kid.

18
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,144
It's old man Fu, all right. But how?

19
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,396
How did you know where we were?

20
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,900
We'd snuck into Central for a while
to see what was going on.

21
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:59,156
When we detected several large chi
moving toward here, we followed them.

22
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,535
There are two huge chi clashing
with each other right nearby.

23
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,829
That would probably be Greed and Gluttony.

24
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,585
Greed, the one who swallowed up
the Young Lord.

25
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,507
And then, there's another huge chi
out there in the forest.

26
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,470
My companion is fighting a Homunculus
right now, named Pride.

27
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,637
Hmm...

28
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:28,477
And finally, there's one more,
in the nearby settlement.

29
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,396
There's something unparalleled
about that one.

30
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,774
That's probably Ed's old man.

31
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,941
Him?

32
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,404
Your father is not human?

33
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,866
For now, we can leave him alone.

34
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,911
First, we have to do something
about these Homunculi.

35
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,956
Don't worry about Gluttony.
Let Lan Fan take care of him.

36
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,709
Let her take care of him?

37
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,632
She's only had her automail
for six months, hasn't she?

38
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,175
That's crazy, old-timer!

39
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,469
If we don't go help her,
she'll be in hot water.

40
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,279
Don't worry, hand-to-hand combat
is not our only weapon.

41
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,574
Give us some warning before you use those.

42
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,035
What was that? An explosion?

43
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,537
- What was that?
- From inside the forest?

44
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,039
- Aren't the lights back on yet?
- Hey, bring a lamp over here.

45
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,710
Geez...

46
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,714
Well, if that's the case,
I guess we can relax.

47
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,637
Old man Fu,
what else do you have besides bombs?

48
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,722
Hmm? All sorts of things.

49
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,934
Tear-gas bombs, flash bombs, flares.

50
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,107
The lights in the slums
have started to come back on.

51
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,859
Those snaky things
are going to start appearing again.

52
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,362
If we don't do something fast,
Heinkel will be in deep trouble!

53
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,613
Yeah.

54
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,743
Old man Fu, would you take me
to where Pride is?

55
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,621
There's something I'd like you
to help me out with.

56
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,131
As you wish.

57
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,632
Ed.

58
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,385
You watch yourself.

59
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,598
Remember, Pride,
the guy Heinkel is fighting, is...

60
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,210
Die already, would you?

61
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,150
You were right, Roy.

62
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,822
Selim Bradley is not,
strictly speaking, human.

63
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,076
These are old photos.

64
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,495
Twenty years ago...

65
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,623
This one is from 50 years ago.

66
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,127
In each age, he's with the government.

67
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,801
I checked into the town that the F端hrer
is supposed to be from too.

68
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,347
While there are records of him
being born and raised there,

69
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,518
there isn't a single person
who has ever seen the Bradley family.

70
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,854
The mansion at the address listed
was a dummy

71
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,898
and it goes without saying
that there are no relatives.

72
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,154
Thank you, Madam Christmas.

73
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,532
It must have been tough
to investigate all of this.

74
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,242
Yeah.

75
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,913
But the moment I found out
that Selim wasn't human,

76
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,125
all my fatigue just disappeared.

77
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,213
I have to wonder why
this has never gotten out before.

78
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,175
Because he is the son
of the man called King,

79
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,469
the top man in our military state.

80
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,765
They can fabricate anything they want to.

81
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,323
- You, bastard!
- Hey!

82
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,201
Who's there? Is someone there?

83
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,246
It's a monster!

84
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, no! That child!

85
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,310
It's a monster!

86
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,274
Damn.

87
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,280
All I need is this much light
to make shadows.

88
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,451
Goodbye, Mr. Chimera.

89
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,500
That was a close one, pops.

90
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:49,714
Imagine, this little kid
being a Homunculus.

91
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,884
You had me fooled, Selim Bradley.

92
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,305
Outward appearances are only symbolic.

93
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:03,144
Isn't that right, my little alchemist?

94
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,867
Where is he? Where is Roy Mustang?

95
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,244
He's still inside.

96
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,496
It's been a long time,
for being his usual bar.

97
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,166
That woman in there, Madam Christmas,

98
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,669
her real name is Chris Mustang.

99
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,004
She's his foster mother.

100
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,172
Damn it!

101
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,935
Ah, my poor chateau.

102
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,480
Forgive me. I'll buy you another one.

103
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,069
Well, then, okay.

104
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,780
I have to go underground
for a while, anyhow.

105
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,782
Are the girls in the bar all right?

106
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,492
Don't you worry.

107
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,078
By now, they're under the skies
of a foreign land,

108
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:06,541
enjoying themselves,
and have long since forgotten about you.

109
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,377
Never mind them.

110
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,171
You should be thinking

111
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,132
about what's going to happen tomorrow
in this country.

112
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,559
If the next time we meet,
you're inside a body bag,

113
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,396
branded as a rebel,
you'll have to answer to me.

114
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,649
Thank you, Madam.
I will make sure to repay you.

115
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,986
You'll remember me
when you've made it big.

116
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,198
In that case, I'll really look forward
to the next time we meet, Roy.

117
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,164
I wish she'd stop treating me
like a little boy already.

118
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,171
Now, then, I guess I should start moving.

119
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,320
You're late, Colonel.
We almost left without you.

120
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:22,325
Your wry comments sound
so reassuring to me now.

121
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,787
- Did you make sure you weren't followed?
- Yes, sir.

122
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,915
If anything were to happen,
this little guy would react.

123
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,417
Okay.

124
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,045
We'll be counting on you.

125
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,966
What are the Bradley family's activities?

126
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,387
I've got the schedule for all
three of them for the next three days.

127
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,889
The F端hrer went to the training grounds
in the east.

128
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,850
Selim went along with him.

129
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,560
Regarding that,

130
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,689
the train that the F端hrer was riding in
plunged to the bottom of a ravine.

131
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,817
You don't say.

132
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,112
Old man Grumman
takes some drastic measures, huh?

133
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,699
The watch level will be elevated now.

134
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,451
It might make what we're doing
more difficult.

135
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,245
What about our mission?

136
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,958
Will the Eastern forces be coming
into Central, as planned?

137
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,173
The F端hrer is missing.

138
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,721
Is this a once-in-a-lifetime chance,
or are we walking into a trap?

139
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,100
Even if it is a trap,
we've got no choice but to move forward.

140
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,108
Your orders?

141
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,867
Right now, we're holding a one-way ticket
to the battlefield.

142
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,371
Win or lose,
there's no turning back from this.

143
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,626
The reason being that once
this primary mission is over,

144
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,547
we still have the great task of rebuilding
this nation, with me as its F端hrer,

145
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,216
waiting ahead for us.

146
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,597
Which means that you've only got
one order to obey.

147
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,099
Don't die.

148
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:11,976
That is all.

149
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,103
Yes, sir!

150
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,329
<i>Why? Why can't I cut through him?</i>

151
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,899
Looks like keeping my northern automail
was the right decision.

152
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,236
This carbon fiber is proving quite useful.

153
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,363
<i>Carbon reinforcement?</i>

154
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,492
<i>He's copying Greed, is he?</i>

155
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,495
<i>In that case...</i>

156
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,887
What's the matter?

157
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,764
Is that all you've got?

158
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,186
Sure enough, I'll have to...

159
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,613
Al!

160
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:54,370
Using your brother to fight you
should give me the advantage.

161
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,998
Old man Fu!

162
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,674
A flash bomb!

163
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,677
Oh, no!

164
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,181
I've had enough of those guys.

165
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,934
What?

166
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,403
Lan Fan, what's wrong?

167
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,409
Lan Fan!

168
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,456
- Mr. Gorilla!
- Right!

169
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,131
Al!

170
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,593
Mr. Gorilla,
take Al and get away from here.

171
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,178
You're sure he's not still possessed?

172
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,806
The parts that get cut off
from the Homunculus' main body

173
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,974
disperse and disappear.

174
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,022
Now that Al's insides are cut off
from the main shadow body,

175
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,815
Pride is no longer in there.

176
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,609
You won't get away!

177
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,777
Here's another one!

178
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,532
Say, what was that light before?

179
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,294
- It hurts, it hurts!
- You've really done it now.

180
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,217
You're a real mess, aren't you?

181
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,137
Well, it's because that girl and Greed
were acting funny.

182
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,683
They knew where I was,
even when it was so dark.

183
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,017
They what?

184
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,109
<i>Perhaps she is the warrior from Xing
</i><i>that Wrath mentioned,</i>

185
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,152
<i>the one who could sense
</i><i>the presence of Homunculi.</i>

186
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>So you've turned yourself over
</i><i>to the Xingese prince,</i>

187
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,409
<i>and he's using that ability, then?</i>

188
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,495
<i>Miserable Greed.</i>

189
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,422
Gluttony, how many times
have you been killed?

190
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,507
I don't know.

191
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,259
I've been killed a lot though.

192
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,013
I've been beaten up pretty badly myself.

193
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,560
The way things are headed,
we could be wiped out by them.

194
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,522
Then, we could have Father fix us--

195
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,322
No.

196
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,574
No, Pride.

197
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,550
No! Don't eat me.

198
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,555
It hurts. Help me, Lust.

199
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,162
He devoured his own kind.

200
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,126
Ah, this is more convenient.

201
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,962
I can detect your scents quite well now.

202
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,967
I could do without the feeling of hunger
that comes with it though.

203
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,515
That scent.

204
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,521
Are you nearby, Hohenheim?

205
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,496
Mustang appears to be using

206
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,915
his former subordinates
and is sneaking around somewhere.

207
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,044
If the explosion of the train
that was carrying the F端hrer

208
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,172
and the many Ishvalans
that are coming into Central

209
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,217
turns out to be tied to him...

210
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,929
And with this timing, of all things...

211
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:54,230
You are all more familiar
with the way he thinks than I am.

212
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,941
What will be his next move?

213
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,950
If it were me,

214
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,703
I would first take Mrs. Bradley
into my custody.

215
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,709
You mean as a hostage?
That would be futile.

216
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,132
He's going to take a useless hostage,

217
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,052
and brand himself a traitor?

218
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,722
Humans are absolutely impossible.

219
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,372
Hey! What are you doing?

220
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,711
Roy Mustang?

221
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,064
I'm terribly sorry for this,
at such a late hour, ma'am.

222
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:25,404
Lieutenant Hawkeye?
Why are you doing this?

223
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,990
Please forgive this abrupt offense.

224
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,409
If you would be good enough
to come quietly with me,

225
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,245
I have no intention
of bringing any harm to you.

226
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,340
Please, come with me.
