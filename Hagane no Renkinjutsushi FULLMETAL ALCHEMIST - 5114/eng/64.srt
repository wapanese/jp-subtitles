1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:10,052
- Which room is Colonel Roy Mustang in?
- Let's see...

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,429
May I ask your name?

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,098
My name is Knocs.
I'm a private-practice doctor.

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,351
If you relay that to him,
he'll know who I am.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,028
- Hey, young lady.
- It has been a long time.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,241
Who is this gentleman?

7
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:37,746
Oh, it's kind of a long story.
You might say he's my big gun.

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,501
Well? Is he letting it get him down?

9
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,673
The crops that will be planted
in the Ishvalan region

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,926
- will primarily be double-cropped.
- Okay, that's a mistake.

11
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,387
It's not double-cropping,
it's dual-cropping.

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,557
There's no way you're going
to earn their trust like this.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,434
- I know!
- Okay, okay.

14
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,895
So what two crops are they raising?

15
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,815
- Wheat and cotton.
- Correct.

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,693
- See? You are getting this, aren't you?
- Give me some credit.

17
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,529
I've been looking into this
since before it all started.

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,740
He said he was going
to solve this Ishvalan problem

19
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,911
- before he became F端hrer.
- Solve it?

20
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,998
For that matter,
become F端hrer, in the first place?

21
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,834
That voice... Is that you, Dr. Knocs?

22
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:29,589
Hey, what can I say,
you're doing all right, huh?

23
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:34,177
Yeah, these guys are pests.
They won't give me any rest.

24
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,807
- No, not that, I meant your eyes.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,227
Apparently, this is the punishment

26
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,563
that truth gives
to those who dream of the future.

27
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,315
Are you okay?

28
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:53,989
Well, who can say?
But I can't just stop dead in my track.

29
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,076
So, F端hrer?
Or before you get to that, Ishval?

30
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,371
The Ishvalan War of Extermination.

31
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,082
That's where this all started.

32
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:10,255
Yeah. Both for you, and for me.

33
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,508
- Now it's time to come to terms with it.
- Come to terms?

34
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,053
First, I'm going to open
the closed-off Ishvalan areas.

35
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,430
Then, I'm going to return
the Ishvalans living in the slums

36
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,934
back to their holy land.
There's still a lot to be done.

37
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,479
It was because of Scar
and the other Ishvalans

38
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,148
that we were able to make it
through all of this.

39
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,275
We have to return the favor
for all that they've done.

40
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,029
Colonel, I brought the materials
you requested.

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,533
This won't blot out our sins, but we would
like to start with whatever we can do.

42
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,373
Good grief, all of you.

43
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:49,044
Hey, Marcoh, looks like they'll save us
the trouble of asking.

44
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,338
Marcoh? Doctor Marcoh?

45
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,012
Colonel Mustang...

46
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,517
I have a Philosopher's Stone here.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,603
Might we not be able to return
your eyesight with this?

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
Yeah.

49
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:18,657
This Stone was one
that I once created using Ishvalan lives.

50
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,329
I think it would be presumptuous
of me to ask,

51
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,916
but if it were to aid
in the reestablishment of Ishval...

52
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:37,426
No, I am not able to hear their voices

53
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,929
so this will be a request from me,
personally.

54
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,683
I would like to heal you with this Stone.
For the sake of Ishval!

55
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:53,024
They might be upset over this,
Fullmetal, too.

56
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,697
But I will use it anyhow.

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,951
I will devote all my efforts,
on that basis.

58
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,080
Before I do, however...

59
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,624
...there is someone who needs
that Stone more than I do.

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,295
I will go after he does.

61
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,223
<i>Yes, in your hearts for 80 years,
</i><i>your Havoc General Store!</i>

62
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,185
<i>Hey, Breda. What's up?</i>

63
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,940
<i>What? To Central? Now?</i>

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,235
<i>I'll find out when I get there?
</i><i>All right, you...</i>

65
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,825
How are your injuries, Scar?

66
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,828
- Why did you save me?
- At first, I did it

67
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,039
because it would let me get
your alkahestry,

68
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,999
but then the circumstances changed.

69
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:55,879
Mustang told me to let him have Miles
to help with his Ishvalan policies.

70
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,257
So I thought I'd take you with me.

71
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,678
Not as Scar, of course,
but as an Ishvalan.

72
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,473
What do you say?

73
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,226
Will you work with me to reestablish
the teachings of Ishvala?

74
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,648
We cannot allow our historic religion
and culture to die out.

75
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,942
The death of a culture
is the death of a people.

76
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,946
By your hand,
rescue our people from death.

77
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,618
<i>A reason why I was kept alive.</i>

78
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:31,456
<i>Are you telling me to live on
</i><i>and keep looking, Brother?</i>

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,003
All right. I will work with you.

80
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,965
You may take this body of mine
with you wherever you go.

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,469
All right. Miles, you handle it from here.

82
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,305
- Make sure everything goes smoothly.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,142
<i>Mustang, once you find out
</i><i>that Scar is still alive,</i>

84
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,812
<i>I'll bet your knuckles will turn white.</i>

85
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,858
Scar, what is your real name?

86
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:09,244
I've died twice now.
I'm someone not of this world.

87
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,791
I don't need a name.
Call me whatever you like.

88
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,001
Okay.

89
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,754
I'll see you later, Ishvalan.

90
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,645
Are you okay?

91
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,859
I didn't think my muscles
had atrophied so much.

92
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,027
Want me to carry you?

93
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,531
No, that's okay. I'll walk on my own legs.

94
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,163
I'll come back at my own pace.
Brother, you go on ahead.

95
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,292
No. We left home together,
and we're gonna return home together.

96
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,633
Okay then, let's go home together.

97
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,177
Yeah.

98
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,144
- Brother, your leg...
- Yeah.

99
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,272
I haven't maintained it for a while, so...

100
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,321
- Thanks.
- Huh? What for?

101
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,241
- Nothing.
- What's with you? You're acting weird.

102
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,122
Come to think of it, I wonder if Ling and
the others have made it back to Xing yet.

103
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,544
It's been two months already.
They've probably made it by now.

104
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,256
I hope May is okay.

105
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,261
Don't worry about it. Leave her to him.

106
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,145
- May.
- Al.

107
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,731
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's nothing.

108
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,567
Hey, princess of the Chang family!

109
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,821
Ling Yao!

110
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,282
Hey now, don't make that scary face at me.

111
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,830
You've been a fool, too,
getting mixed up in the troubles

112
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,624
of a foreign country like this.
You didn't even end up

113
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,668
with a Philosopher's Stone, huh?

114
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,423
The Yaos will be the next emperor, then.

115
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,305
But don't worry.

116
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,976
The Yao family will take it upon ourselves
to protect your family.

117
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,773
I even accepted the Homunculus Greed.

118
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,111
I will accept those of the Chang family
and all the other families, as well.

119
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,744
What kind of face is that?

120
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:00,248
Don't worry, the people of Xing
always keep their word, right?

121
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,169
Accepting everyone is too greedy,
Ling Yao!

122
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,591
Ah, maybe he rubbed off on me.

123
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,849
- Now then, let's go home.
- You're leaving?

124
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,853
Yeah. I want to bury Fu as soon as I can.

125
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:24,856
See you later.

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah! Later!

127
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,618
- A lot has happened, huh?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,788
Especially for you, Alphonse.

129
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,541
You seem to have become quite fond
of May Chang,

130
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,420
- the princess of Xing.
- She really is a nice girl, huh?

131
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,299
But never mind me, Brother,
are you sure about Winry?

132
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,739
Den, it's me.

133
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,375
Do we have visitors?

134
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,762
<i>Den, you're tickling me!</i>

135
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,398
Welcome home, dummies!

136
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,984
- Yeah!
- We're home!

137
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,741
TWO YEARS LATER

138
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,703
I'm not very good at this.

139
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,001
I guess that won't work.

140
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:50,144
- Oh, well.
- Brother, aren't you done fixing it yet?

141
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,398
I'm worn out from making
all those courtesy calls.

142
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,859
Winry is such a slave driver about that.

143
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,778
I mean, after all--

144
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,907
Winry says that once the apple pie
is done baking, we'll have a snack.

145
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,744
- Oh, okay.
- Wow.

146
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,373
- You can see especially far today, huh?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,336
- It's so vast.
- Yeah.

148
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,508
Brother, I've been thinking
about something for a long time.

149
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,013
I've probably been thinking
the same thing.

150
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,770
How are things going with work?

151
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:38,526
Oh, well, the problems keep piling up,
and it's made me an old man overnight.

152
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,863
Although, Mustang is working hard
in the East,

153
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,575
and Armstrong
is working hard in the North,

154
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,662
so this old man can manage
to keep himself in the F端hrer's seat.

155
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,832
I am glad for that.

156
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,043
You are not going to leave it
to younger men?

157
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,798
Not quite yet. I won't trust this
to those whippersnappers.

158
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:06,179
Oh, my. That sounds like something
the late Bradley would say.

159
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,390
He was devoted to his work, as well.

160
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,102
Oh, no, I'm about as...

161
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,940
...frivolous as they come.

162
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,281
Oh, Selim, what's the matter?

163
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,118
The little bird is hurt. Help him.

164
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, my, how terrible.
Have Gramps call a veterinarian.

165
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,503
Can they fix him? Can they fix the bird?

166
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,965
It'll be fine. Now, off you go.

167
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,930
- He's grown up to be such a kind boy.
- Yes.

168
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:54,060
When I made up my mind to raise him,
everyone else was against it,

169
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,730
but he's been growing up well,
without any worries.

170
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,441
We're going to watch over him
for a little while longer.

171
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,658
If the boy starts showing anything
out of the ordinary...

172
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,538
You understand what will happen.

173
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,791
I'll see that he doesn't show anything.

174
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,885
<i>Homunculi and humans...</i>

175
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:32,098
<i>Will we ever truly be able
</i><i>to relate to each other?</i>

176
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:38,896
<i>New possibilities are exciting,
</i><i>no matter how old you get.</i>

177
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,780
Isn't Edward bummed out
about his left leg?

178
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,200
He's all right. He said he was okay

179
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,328
with leaving his leg as automail,
as an admonishment to himself.

180
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,834
Besides, he says that Winry
would get all melancholy without it.

181
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,087
Oh, now he's just carrying on!

182
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,385
I sure am glad you're back to normal.

183
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,597
I'm sure he's thrilled, too.

184
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,354
We were afforded a lot of happiness,
a lot of happiness,

185
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,441
in a lot of places by a lot of people...

186
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,195
Including Mr. Hughes.

187
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,199
And so, now, we feel it's our turn
to return the favor.

188
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,285
Is that equivalent exchange,
like the alchemists say?

189
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,165
No, by taking ten, and giving ten,
it all ends up the same.

190
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:44,587
So we take ten, put something of ourselves
on top of it, and return 11.

191
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,091
It's not much,
but it's a new principle we've hit upon.

192
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,679
Now we have to go and prove it.

193
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,183
There's something you want to do, then?

194
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,022
There was a girl we were unable to save.

195
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,693
We will never be able to forget that girl.

196
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,490
<i>Welcome!</i>

197
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,243
- Mr. Gerso, Mr. Zampano.
- Hey.

198
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,037
- There's plenty. Dig in.
- Okay.

199
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,081
Excuse me, could you bring some milk,

200
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,124
- and a sandwich?
- Sure.

201
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,632
- So you're done paying all your regards?
- Yes.

202
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,634
- So then, it's just about time.
- Right?

203
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,387
We're going to Xing.

204
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:40,184
I plan to study alkahestry
in full swing from May.

205
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,229
<i>And not just Xing. I'd like to travel
</i><i>around all the eastern countries,</i>

206
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,774
<i>and study all sorts of things.</i>

207
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,069
I want to see many different sites,
learn many different things,

208
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,988
and meet many different people.

209
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:59,453
- So then, you're really coming along?
- Of course we are!

210
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,872
If we tag along with you,
good things will follow.

211
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:06,877
That's what our animal instincts
are whispering to us!

212
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,842
Alphonse...

213
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,053
We're going to find a way
to get our original bodies back.

214
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,639
You're the one who told us not to give up.

215
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,267
To act for ourselves,
and not leave it to others.

216
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,441
Your brother isn't going to Xing?

217
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:33,195
<i>I'm going East, and Brother is going
</i><i>to obtain more knowledge.</i>

218
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,073
<i>And then, by bringing the knowledge
</i><i>of East and West together,</i>

219
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,744
<i>we may be able to keep the tragedy of Nina
</i><i>from ever happening again.</i>

220
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:45,916
However... Brother and I
are doing more than just that.

221
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:52,798
<i>We want to see just how big the world is.</i>

222
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,718
- Remember to oil it every day.
- Yeah.

223
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,679
Be sure to check
that the screws are tight, too.

224
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,349
Be sure to wipe off the water
when you get out of the tub.

225
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,020
- Right.
- Hey, are you listening?

226
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,647
- Yeah.
- Geez.

227
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,278
Here it comes.

228
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:23,663
Good grief, you're going to break it
and have to come back again like that.

229
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,124
Yeah, yeah, I know.

230
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,043
Whenever you need maintenance,

231
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,921
- be sure to call for an appointment.
- Sure.

232
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,636
Appointment?

233
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,686
What?

234
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,189
Winry...

235
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,610
What? Come out and say it.

236
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,368
Equivalent exchange!

237
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,123
I'll give you half of my life,
if you give me half of yours!

238
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,971
Why do alchemists have to be like this?

239
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,182
The principle of equivalent
exchange is all nonsense, isn't it?

240
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,561
- What did you say?
- It really is nonsense.

241
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,646
Never mind half, I'll give you all of it.

242
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:44,243
Okay, not all of it!
Ninety percent... No, 80 percent.

243
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,705
Seventy... no, that won't work. Okay, 85.

244
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,458
Yeah! I'd be willing
to give you that much.

245
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,045
What? Ed!

246
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,506
Sorry!

247
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,759
Ed!

248
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,929
You really are amazing!

249
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:08,642
You turn equivalent exchange
on its ear so easily!

250
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,977
What do you mean?

251
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,896
- Are you making fun of me?
- No, I'm not!

252
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:21,363
You've cheered me up. Thanks. I'm off.

253
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,411
Come back soon.

254
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:46,806
Well, well, Edward is off on a trip, too?

255
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:51,685
- They ought to just settle down a while.
- They're better off this way.

256
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,440
Men that sit around doing nothing
are no fun.

257
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,946
<i>There's no point to lessons
</i><i>that don't bring with them pain.</i>

258
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:08,244
<i>People can't gain anything
</i><i>without sacrificing something, after all.</i>

259
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:14,834
<i>But once you've successfully
</i><i>endured that pain,</i>

260
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:20,339
<i>you gain a heart that is stout enough
</i><i>not to be overcome by anything.</i>

261
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,968
<i>Yeah, a heart made fullmetal.</i>
