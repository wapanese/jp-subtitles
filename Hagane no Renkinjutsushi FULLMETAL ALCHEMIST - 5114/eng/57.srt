1
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,942
The Fuhrer has returned?

2
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,196
Word is that he destroyed
a Briggs tank at the main gate.

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,575
Take that, lousy Briggs mountain monkeys.

4
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,243
Let's round up the remaining soldiers.

5
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,287
We're going to retake
the Operations Center!

6
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,707
<i>The Fuhrer is at the main gate?</i>

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,382
Ho, this is the first time
I've seen him for myself.

8
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,058
This is the man who took
my granddaughter's arm, is it?

9
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,859
Oh, yeah? So you sacrifice
the general population,

10
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,862
so that you top officials
can gain immortality

11
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,198
and unite the whole world, huh?

12
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:42,204
And Fuhrer Bradley is also aware of this?

13
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,457
He was created to be
this country's leader to that end.

14
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,670
Why would we hesitate?
We were creating a world without war!

15
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,507
But to do so,
it would have to perish first?

16
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,721
No, not perish, be reborn.

17
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,600
What you alchemists
would call reconstruction.

18
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,937
We would not be giving death
to the general population.

19
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,107
They will live on forever, inside us!

20
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,693
And together, we will bring
the world together as one!

21
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,530
All is one and one is all!

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,325
We, the chosen ones of Amestris,
will act as one to bring everything--

23
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,291
There you have it. What will you do now?

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,294
These guys are only in this
for themselves.

25
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,171
Will you leave them to it?

26
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,590
You men, follow me.

27
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,592
Do so and I will put in
a good word for you.

28
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,345
W.C

29
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:50,564
I am a soldier so I must obey
the orders of my superiors.

30
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,901
However, to be honest,
I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

31
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,530
You still can't make up your mind
after everything that's happened?

32
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,658
Following a superior
that you have no faith in

33
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,785
is not what I'd call loyalty.

34
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,328
It's merely self-deception.

35
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,750
Believe in yourselves.

36
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,420
You just have to choose to live,

37
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,381
so as not to bring shame
on your own soul, right?

38
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,229
I have a family in the city.

39
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,690
Me too.

40
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,150
As do I.

41
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,795
Brigadier General, sir...

42
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,755
this is our answer.

43
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,597
Operations, what's the situation?

44
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,307
Not very favorable.

45
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,310
The Central soldiers are getting
their second wind all over.

46
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,978
Where are you right now, ma'am?

47
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,897
<i>In the Fuhrer's office.</i>

48
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,941
Any survivors?

49
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,528
We can't contact any of our allies
near the office.

50
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,156
<i>There's a good chance that
</i><i>it has been surrounded by Central troops.</i>

51
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,785
Understood. If things get too
dangerous there, get yourselves out.

52
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,621
Leave me here.

53
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,999
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,380
Well, once again,
this place is full of the enemy.

55
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,341
It's only a matter of time
before the Central troops regroup

56
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,343
and start setting foot in here.

57
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,970
Which will mean...

58
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,438
When we get down far enough,

59
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,941
I'll dig an escape tunnel
like I did on the way here.

60
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,026
Escape?

61
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,031
Care to come with us?
You could use a chance to regroup, right?

62
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,723
- We're close.
- You think so too, huh?

63
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,309
Can you guys sense his presence?

64
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,019
I'm getting a bad feeling.

65
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,898
I guess you could say
my uglier old wounds are aching.

66
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,883
Well, well, to think that I would have
a gallery watching.

67
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,885
You're going to make me nervous.

68
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,352
- Who are you?
- Who, me?

69
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,231
The man who created King Bradley...

70
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,528
I guess you could say.

71
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,863
The Fuhrer?

72
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,704
Which would mean, you're on their side.

73
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,960
Oh, it's you. I thought you were
at the radio station

74
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,504
but you've come all the way
down here for me.

75
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,341
Thanks, that will save me
some trouble, Mustang.

76
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,223
You guys, take them on for a bit.

77
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,687
Who are these guys?

78
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,438
Mannequin soldiers?

79
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,359
No, they move decidedly differently
than those things!

80
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,613
These are the men that might
have become King Bradley.

81
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,161
<i>Men who were brought together
</i><i>as soon as they were born</i>

82
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,165
<i>and given specialized education
</i><i>and training</i>

83
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,835
<i>for the sole purpose
</i><i>of becoming the Fuhrer.</i>

84
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,674
<i>And on the 12th trial,
</i><i>King Bradley came into being.</i>

85
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,386
<i>Then these men are the leftovers.</i>

86
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,055
But then,

87
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,810
they have received a great deal
of combat training.

88
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,318
They're not as strong as King Bradley

89
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,778
but they are strong.

90
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,014
Damn.

91
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,849
Miserable rebels.

92
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,270
Whoops, I passed out.

93
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,609
- Captain.
- Oh, right.

94
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,113
If I pull it out,
I'll just bleed to death.

95
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,120
Bradley.

96
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,465
Watch it, old man!

97
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,051
I didn't do it on purp--
I mean, I didn't mean it!

98
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,639
Why, you--

99
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,239
I do feel more comfortable
with a weapon like this.

100
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,127
<i>You move well
</i><i>for someone even older than I am.</i>

101
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,670
<i>However...</i>

102
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,713
<i>this is the end for you!</i>

103
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,221
Old man.

104
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,399
The Xingese prince, huh?

105
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,651
<i>Damn it, Ling!</i>

106
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,653
Don't go popping up on your own!

107
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:59,033
It's just like the time
with that girl who lost her arm.

108
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,120
Once again, you risk your life

109
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,123
for something
you are unable to leave behind.

110
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,711
Young Lord, cast aside this old man,
no longer able to fight.

111
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,298
Don't be absurd!
Are you telling me to be like what he is?

112
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,718
A king is to be for the people,

113
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,262
and there is no king without his people!

114
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,308
He is about to forsake
the people of his own nation.

115
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,937
That is not what I've set out to be!

116
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:32,525
A man worthy to be the king?

117
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,778
You must overcome--

118
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,739
Don't talk. You just rest.

119
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,046
Yes, you're right. Rest.

120
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,923
I will go to my rest now.

121
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,679
Harden yourself, Greed!
Protect the Young Lord's body!

122
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,601
<i>Young Lord...</i>

123
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,853
<i>become the king.</i>

124
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,193
This old man now goes to his eternal rest!

125
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,281
You stupid fool!

126
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,662
I'm taking you to hell with me!

127
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,164
Bradley!

128
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,809
<i>Even with my life on the line,
</i><i>I cannot even lay a scratch on him?</i>

129
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,817
<i>Young Lord, forgive my shame.</i>

130
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,408
Even if you do have godlike eyes,

131
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:08,913
there's no way you can dodge
an attack you can't see coming!

132
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,543
Old man,

133
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:19,674
I'll accompany you down to hell!

134
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:26,055
Oh, you have my gratitude.

135
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,001
Grandfather!

136
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,805
Sheesh. You get us stuck in a ditch
then run into a lamppost.

137
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,932
You're just a lousy driver, fuzzy-lip.

138
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:15,063
Shut up! Just be grateful
that piece-of-junk car made it this far!

139
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,066
We've come this far, let's not fight!

140
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,736
Just hurry up and find us
a way underground.

141
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
Is that...?

142
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,871
Could that be Colonel Mustang?

143
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,623
I sure hope he's doing all right.

144
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,042
Brother.

145
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,003
Let's hurry.

146
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,099
I know they're supposed to be superhuman,

147
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,018
but come on!

148
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,098
You've left your back wide open, Colonel.

149
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,143
I'm letting my subordinate cover it.
It happens.

150
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,607
<i>The gateway of truth.</i>

151
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,611
When an alchemist commits
the taboo of human transmutation,

152
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:50,825
they end up opening the gateway of truth.

153
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,286
They also pay the corresponding toll.

154
00:15:54,704 --> 00:16:01,127
You mean, the way the Elric brothers
sacrificed their bodies?

155
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,211
And you?

156
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,758
Part of my insides were taken away.

157
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,472
But after going through all that,
what I learned was, in fact,

158
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,435
that human transmutation could not
be successfully performed.

159
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,277
Oh, my, I suppose this topic
might not be of interest to soldiers, huh?

160
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,737
Not at all.

161
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,949
The people who open the gateway of truth

162
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,785
are the ones they refer to as sacrifices.

163
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,789
That could be a clue as to what
the enemy is planning.

164
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,210
There was someone you wanted
to be reunited with so badly

165
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,795
that you would open the gateway of truth

166
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,382
and sacrifice a portion
of your own bodies?

167
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,096
And you?

168
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,100
Is there someone whom you would pay
any price to see one more time?

169
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,730
That is indeed a topic of no interest
to soldiers.

170
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,399
It is pointless to have attachments
to those who are dead.

171
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,735
All we can do is fight
to keep them from dying.

172
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,322
I suppose that's true.

173
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,740
However...

174
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,826
I do understand
what you're saying somewhat.

175
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,373
Edward Elric.

176
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,958
When I first met him,

177
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,378
I intimidated him into telling me
everything that he knew,

178
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,838
but he did not say a word about them

179
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,592
holding a childhood friend of his hostage.

180
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,928
All he said was...

181
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:34,887
You'll have to guess.

182
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,597
"You'll have to guess."

183
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,142
The look in his eye
was not that of a soldier,

184
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:45,815
nor was it that of an alchemist,
a so-called Dog of the Military.

185
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,693
If I had to describe it,

186
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,529
it was the look of someone trying
not to lose anything else

187
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,698
that was dear to him, no matter what.

188
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,994
The eyes of a difficult child?

189
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,333
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't moved
when I looked into his eyes.

190
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,921
However, I'm not sure
if his naivete of thought

191
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,425
is going to find us a way
out of this fight,

192
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,343
or if it will work against us.

193
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,851
That will do.
Now then, shall we get started?

194
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,902
No. 16, No. 17, No. 21,

195
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:37,283
No. 23, No. 26, come here.

196
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,495
What?

197
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,836
Here goes!

198
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,558
What have you done?

199
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,270
Oh, this is just the first stage.

200
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,065
Do you know
how many alchemy laboratories there are

201
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,568
under direct prefectural control
here in Central?

202
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,323
There are four of them
currently in use within the city.

203
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,491
No.

204
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,289
The Fifth Laboratory... five of them.

205
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,294
<i>A five-cornered transmutation circle.</i>

206
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,673
Don't tell me
that curved underground passageway

207
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,009
connected the laboratories
together in a circle.

208
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,401
What the...?

209
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,906
What's the matter, Mr. Heinkel?

210
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,554
Izumi.

211
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,516
Yeah, it looks like this is our cue.

212
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,021
I'm going to dig us a hole
to escape out of through this wall.

213
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,440
Stand back a bit.

214
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,858
Well then, this is where we part ways.

215
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,698
We must remain here and keep fighting.

216
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,160
From here on is probably where the heart
of the enemy will be.

217
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,997
We aren't about to pass up
our chance to storm them.

218
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,791
You guys...

219
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,924
You've been a tremendous help.

220
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,262
Thank you, Izumi Curtis.

221
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,389
Thank you, General Armstrong--

222
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,296
What?

223
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,812
Alphonse!

224
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,023
Izumi!

225
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,860
Izumi!

226
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,329
Fullmetal.

227
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,342
Why, you--
