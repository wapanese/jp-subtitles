1
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,776
Brother, we're almost at Dublith.

2
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,946
Were you having a dream?

3
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,490
Yeah. It was a dream about him.

4
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,250
- We're finally here, huh?
- Yeah.

5
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,462
It'd be nice if Teacher wasn't home, huh?

6
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,755
Yeah.

7
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,435
- Hi, there...
- Long time no see.

8
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,813
How good of you to come. You've grown.

9
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,482
He's squashing me...

10
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:33,862
Well, it's me, Alphonse.
Please excuse us for being away so long.

11
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,908
You've really grown.

12
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,371
This is the first time I've had my head
patted since I became armor.

13
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:48,460
Izumi, the Elric half-pints are here.
Can you get up?

14
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,546
I'm fine. I'm doing a little better today.

15
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,341
She's lying down
because she's not doing so well.

16
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,010
I guess she hasn't gotten any better.

17
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,358
Stupid pupil of mine!

18
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,069
I hear you've stooped
to becoming a dog of the military!

19
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,661
Ah, Teacher, you see, it's like...

20
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,165
Al? You sure have grown bigger.

21
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,295
Teacher, you seem to be doing well--

22
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,884
You haven't been training enough!

23
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,388
I thought you weren't feeling very well.

24
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,891
What are you talking about?
Now that you're here, I'm...

25
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,897
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

26
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:55,360
Aren't you the concerned one, dear?

27
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,284
I don't know much
about the Philosopher's Stone.

28
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm not interested in it.

29
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,746
I see.

30
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,123
You met that one alchemist
in Central before,

31
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,667
who was pretty knowledgeable
about the Stone, right?

32
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,628
Who was this person?

33
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,382
As I recall, his name was...

34
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,092
Hohenheim.

35
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,771
What's the matter?

36
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,689
Then he's alive.

37
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,776
Someone you know?

38
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,277
He's our father.

39
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,863
The one you said ran out on you?

40
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,406
That jerk!

41
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:49,206
It's because of him that Mom is dead!
It's because of him!

42
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,589
Goodness, what are you doing up so early?

43
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,843
Al said he had to go potty.

44
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,970
You took care of Al, didn't you?

45
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,139
Thanks, Ed.

46
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,583
Hey, where's Dad?

47
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,172
He left.

48
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,507
When is he coming back?

49
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,305
Coochie-coochie-coochie!

50
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,060
He'll be back really soon.

51
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,063
Now hurry up and eat.

52
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,693
<i>Mom...</i>

53
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,946
<i>Mom...</i>

54
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,950
<i>Mom...</i>

55
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,332
<i>Mom!</i>

56
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,473
Did Dad say anything about the Stone?

57
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,977
Something about his long-held
desire about to come true.

58
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,812
He was happy when he said it.

59
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,110
Let's eat!

60
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,820
Right!

61
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,410
Aren't you eating, Al?

62
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,164
No. I had a lot to eat on the train.

63
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,752
Hey, Al, remember how we witnessed
that child being born in Rush Valley?

64
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:03,715
Yeah, yeah!
Teacher, we helped to deliver a baby!

65
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,719
You dummy, you call what we did "helping"?

66
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,057
The whole family helped
and the mother gave everything she had.

67
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,477
Everyone is blessed
when a person is born, right?

68
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,440
That's right.
That's how you received your lives.

69
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,484
Take pride in your own lives.

70
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,954
- Brother...
- Yeah?

71
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,331
Teacher hasn't changed, has she?

72
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,501
Nope. She hasn't changed a bit
since way back when.

73
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,263
- Keep it tight!
- Bring some more!

74
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,433
It's collapsing!

75
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,608
The levee is giving!
Run for higher ground.

76
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,111
Brother, look.

77
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,866
Hey! It's too dangerous!

78
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,061
That should hold for a while.

79
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,064
Who are you?

80
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,277
Just a housewife that was passing by.

81
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,200
Take us on as your pupils, old lady!

82
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,042
Please, old lady?

83
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,503
I'm a little hard of hearing,
so I didn't catch that.

84
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,756
Could you say that again?

85
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,383
We take that back!

86
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,469
Please take us on as pupils, miss!

87
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,763
- No!
- Why not?

88
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,556
I'm not the type that takes on pupils.

89
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,849
Besides, I'm in the middle of a trip!

90
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,019
- Please!
- Take us on!

91
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,563
You're such pests!

92
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,232
Those two don't have any parents.

93
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,616
I'm such a pushover.

94
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,251
The two of you have to survive
by yourselves.

95
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,755
That's your provisional training.

96
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,174
If you do well,
we'll move on to the main training.

97
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,427
During your provisional training,
the use of alchemy is forbidden!

98
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:01,309
"One is all, all is one."
Find the answer to that within one month.

99
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,980
If you don't find the answer,
I'm sending you back to Resembool!

100
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,734
Bye.

101
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,574
What is this?

102
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,665
I'm hungry.

103
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,501
I want to sleep in a bed.

104
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,511
How is this alchemy training?

105
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,018
I'm so hungry...

106
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,858
I wonder if they're all right.

107
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,611
They say there's no better knowledge
than experience.

108
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,575
This is the best way to drive home
the essentials of alchemy.

109
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,035
If they don't learn anything from this,

110
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,581
it means they only have so much talent,

111
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,457
and I'll have them give up
on being my pupils.

112
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,464
It's their lives that I'm worried about.

113
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,175
When I was doing my training,

114
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,053
I was hauled off to Briggs Mountain
in winter for a whole month.

115
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,849
Don't go comparing yourself
to normal people.

116
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,851
That island has an abundance
of things to eat.

117
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,228
<i>They're not going to die.</i>

118
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,608
We got one!

119
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,111
So how do we eat this?

120
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,240
- Stick it.
- Stick it?

121
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,835
No way. You do it, brother.

122
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,670
I only specialize in catching them.

123
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,007
You always make me do the dirty work!

124
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,096
Wait!

125
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,732
Fox cubs...

126
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,113
Let's give up on meat, and try fish.

127
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,453
So how are we supposed to catch fish?

128
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,498
We don't have any rods, line, or hook.

129
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,969
No food, no fire. No nothing.

130
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,679
Don't say that.

131
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,174
Aw, man!

132
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,635
What are you doing, brother--

133
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,604
Brother?

134
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,821
Sour!

135
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,246
Oh, I'm alive.

136
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,916
I'm alive because I ate the ants.

137
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,425
<i>I'm alive because I eat life.</i>

138
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,928
I'm alive...

139
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,767
- We're not going to die.
- No!

140
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,110
Sorry about this.

141
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,868
Brother, just a little more.

142
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,251
We did it!

143
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,691
Tomorrow will be one month, huh?

144
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:07,323
Say, brother, have you found the answer
to "One is all, all is one"?

145
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,619
I've been thinking about it all this time,

146
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,163
but I only have a vague idea about it.

147
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,791
I'm not sure about this,

148
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,546
but remember when I was weak
from hunger and ate those ants?

149
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,966
- You did?
- Yeah, I ate them.

150
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,717
They were sour as hell too.

151
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:32,014
But then, I thought,
if I hadn't eaten them and died,

152
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,267
I'd be eaten by the ants, or the foxes.

153
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,936
I'd go back to the earth and become grass.

154
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,896
The rabbits would eat that.

155
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,359
- The food chain, right?
- Yeah. And it's not just that.

156
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,780
Long ago, this whole island may
have been at the bottom of the sea.

157
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,076
In tens of thousands of years,
it might be the peak of a mountain.

158
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,745
All things are connected?

159
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:59,083
Everything is in the middle
of a great, unseen flow.

160
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,754
I don't know if you'd call it
the universe or the world, or whatever.

161
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:10,011
Looking at it as this huge thing,
Al, you and I are like ants.

162
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,264
One small part within the flow.

163
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,100
Nothing more
than one fraction of the whole.

164
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,562
But putting all the small "ones" together

165
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:24,859
allows the "all" to exist...

166
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,780
Today's the day.

167
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,034
Let's hear your answer
to "One is all, all is one."

168
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,036
"All" is the world!

169
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,537
"One" is me!

170
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,544
Very well, let's move on
to the main training.

171
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,464
All right!

172
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,595
The basis of the transmutation array
is the power of the circle.

173
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,681
The circle denotes
the circulation of power

174
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,059
and by drawing
a structural matrix over it,

175
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,853
it becomes possible to invoke that power.

176
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,737
This is also the circulation of power.

177
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,572
GULP

178
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,199
It's best to experience it for yourself.

179
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:24,126
Now then, keep reviewing
until lunch is ready.

180
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:30,007
Let's see, the circle
denotes the circulation of power,

181
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,677
and by drawing
a structural matrix over it,

182
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,471
it becomes possible to invoke that power.

183
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,309
But, Teacher, you just put your palms
together to transmute, right?

184
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,064
Do you not have to draw a matrix?

185
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,069
I suppose I myself am like a matrix.

186
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,988
How do you do that?

187
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,995
Maybe you become able to do that
when you arrive at the truth.

188
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,752
Teacher, you've seen the truth too.

189
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,349
So, what is it you wanted to ask me about?

190
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,435
Well...

191
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,035
Sure enough, you can transmute
without a structural matrix.

192
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,497
On top of that,
Alphonse is an empty suit of armor.

193
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,000
One of your legs and one
of your arms are automail.

194
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,460
Teacher, how did you--?

195
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,503
I could tell that much from just sparring!

196
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,507
You saw it, didn't you?

197
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,429
- You saw it!
- Yes!

198
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,060
Both master and apprentice
are beyond hope.

199
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,490
Teacher, since you saw it...

200
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,866
The two of us just couldn't seem
to have children, you see.

201
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,580
When we were finally able to have one,
I ended up becoming ill.

202
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,504
Our child was unable
to be born into this world alive.

203
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,256
Which is why...

204
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,508
I committed the taboo.

205
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,346
As a result, different parts
were taken away from my insides.

206
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,349
I really am a complete idiot.

207
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,691
I should have told you sooner, huh?

208
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,611
It must have been painful for you.

209
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,409
No! I did it to myself, after all.

210
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,911
I wouldn't say it's been painful
or anything like that.

211
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,788
On the contrary, I'm looking forward

212
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,625
to what I'm going to eat, and so on,
once I get my body back!

213
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,171
- Right, brother?
- Yeah!

214
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,881
That's right!

215
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,841
You imbecile.

216
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,139
You don't have to act so strong.

217
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,613
Forgive us...

218
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,616
- We're sorry...
- Forgive us...

219
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,077
- We're sorry...
- Forgive us...

220
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,247
- We're sorry...
- Forgive us...

221
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,712
<i>The flow of this world</i>

222
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,757
<i>follows laws so great,
</i><i>we can't even imagine them.</i>

223
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,512
Learn that flow, decompose it,
and reconstruct it.

224
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,514
That's what alchemy is.

225
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,518
It's also what living is.

226
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,939
The basis of alchemy,
decomposition and reconstruction

227
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,233
is just like the food chain, huh?

228
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,486
When you eat a rabbit,
you break down its flesh

229
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,030
and restructure it as a part of your body.

230
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,198
For that matter,

231
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,535
the rabbit has restructured
the grass it eats into part of its body.

232
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:12,540
Alchemy is life itself.
