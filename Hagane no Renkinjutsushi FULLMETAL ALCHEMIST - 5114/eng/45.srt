1
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,226
- Dear!
- Stay back.

2
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,981
Well, what's the meaning of this, Wrath?

3
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,983
It won't go away!

4
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:53,238
My head is pounding over this!

5
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,453
Why are you, King Bradley,
showing up in there?

6
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,666
What did you do to my stuff?

7
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,171
Your Avarice, huh?

8
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,965
You're a fool
who never gets rid of anything,

9
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,717
and craves even the past.

10
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,179
Damn it!

11
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,851
Sir!

12
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,479
Ma'am, are you and Master Selim
all right?

13
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,731
Yes.

14
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,735
I'm terribly sorry. The security patrol
was helpless against him.

15
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,656
Oh, don't worry about it.
He had quite formidable skill.

16
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,782
Yes, sir.

17
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,423
Father, go into retirement.

18
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,843
Olivier!

19
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,679
Here you come home
after being away for so long,

20
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,515
and what do you say to me out of the blue?

21
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,351
To transfer responsibility
over the family to me,

22
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,478
and spend the remainder of your years
at your leisure.

23
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,357
I was going to have Alex be my successor.

24
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,402
That pantywaist?

25
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,779
Why don't you leave everything to me

26
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,116
and take a long vacation
in some foreign land?

27
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,202
Alex would only drag
the Armstrong family name

28
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,829
through the mud.

29
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,628
Sister! You've returned home, have you?

30
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,882
- Oh, Alex, you're just in time.
- Yes, sir?

31
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,884
Fight Olivier.

32
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,807
Whoever wins gets to head the family.
Is that acceptable, Olivier?

33
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,893
Yes. I could ask for nothing more.

34
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:33,565
Olivier told me to retire
and go somewhere else, you see.

35
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:39,529
What? What insolence
to show to Father, sister!

36
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,948
Very well!

37
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,042
I will employ my whole body, soul,
and muscles to face you.

38
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,048
You've got some nerve, Alex.
I will show you just how callow you are!

39
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,010
Well then, let's be off.

40
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,136
- All right.
- All right.

41
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,393
Where shall we go on our vacation?

42
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:16,024
What about Xing, dear?
I've heard that they have delicious food.

43
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,569
Then let's go there.
Is that all right with you, Catherine?

44
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,029
Yes, Father.

45
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,372
No! No!

46
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,167
- Wait!
- No take backs!

47
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,796
- Are you trying to kill me?
- You're just now figuring that out?

48
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,924
Good luck, brother.

49
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,929
What sort of souvenirs
shall we get for those two?

50
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,349
How about elephants?
They are huge and strong.

51
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,726
If they're getting elephants,
I want one too.

52
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,487
No!

53
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,911
That settles that.

54
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:21,089
The entire Armstrong family is now mine.

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,803
Sister, I heard that recently,
you have become quite chummy

56
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,764
with the military senior staff.

57
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,434
The senior staff is--
I make my judgments with my own eyes.

58
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,062
And having seen for yourself,
have you sent Father and the others away

59
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,149
so that they cannot be taken as hostages?

60
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,864
Get out, loser! This mansion is now mine.

61
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,099
Young lady, where are you going?

62
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,104
This is the farthest town east.
There's nothing but desert ahead.

63
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,233
I was about to go back to my home country.

64
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,527
- Home country?
- Yes. Xing.

65
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,822
- Across the desert?
- Yes.

66
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,451
- A girl crossing the desert by herself?
- Yes.

67
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,372
Hey, everyone!

68
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,667
All of you chip in.
Food, or anything else you've got.

69
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,795
- There's no need to...
- Don't worry about it.

70
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,048
Why don't you spend the night,
and leave tomorrow?

71
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,258
Come over to our place
and have a bath first.

72
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,635
Are you hungry?

73
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,390
Steve, you've got a lot of rooms, right?
Put her up.

74
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,060
Yeah, sure.
My oldest daughter's room is available.

75
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,063
You mean Emmy,
who went off to college in Central?

76
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,524
She turned out pretty good
for being your daughter.

77
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,025
Didn't she?

78
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,404
We'll have to get something
for the little kitty too.

79
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,867
- Oh, my, she's hungry, isn't she?
- She thinks you're her food.

80
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,247
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
That isn't true, is it, little kitty?

81
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,125
There, she says you look tasty.

82
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,967
Nice folks, huh?
You're going to just leave them behind?

83
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,095
Well, that might be for the best too.

84
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,975
Then again, if you go home carrying
a half-dead Homunculus like me,

85
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,227
I don't think it's going to do you
any good.

86
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,273
But if you go to Central,

87
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,943
you'll be able to learn the true method
of gaining immortality.

88
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,571
You might be able to save
these folks as well.

89
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,576
Oh, well, with you going back
to your home country,

90
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,327
they aren't any business of yours,
are they?

91
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,548
Everyone, thank you all for your kindness!

92
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,341
Where are you going?

93
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,596
There's something I've left undone,
so I'm going back to Central!

94
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,685
<i>Fool! Once you get to Central,
</i><i>you're all mine.</i>

95
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:26,149
<i>If only I had a Philosopher's Stone,
</i><i>I could transform again.</i>

96
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,776
<i>If only I had a Stone...</i>

97
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,296
- Where are we?
- A hideout that I've used before.

98
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,257
This is where your brother is, right?

99
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:56,304
Yeah. I know him like the back of my hand.
Al is definitely here.

100
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:02,769
Hey, there's no one here, is there?
You can't bank on this older brother.

101
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,147
We busted our tails fleeing from the north
and this is what we get?

102
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,961
Ling? I mean, Greed?

103
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,715
I'm hungry.

104
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,385
It's Ling.

105
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,565
I feel like myself again.
Thanks, that was good.

106
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,317
Same old overeating dumbass as ever.

107
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,655
- Our emergency rations are all gone.
- Are those guys your pals?

108
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,615
- Mr. Gorill...
- It's Darius!

109
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,242
I'm Heinkel.

110
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,327
We're former military,
but as circumstances would have it,

111
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,872
we're working with the kid here.

112
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,624
- Who is this guy?
- Let's see...

113
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,085
I'm not sure how to explain it to you.

114
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,629
- I'm a Homunculus.
- Hom--

115
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,049
- Hey, now, don't spill it so easily!
- Seriously?

116
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:19,721
It would take too long to lay it all out.
And what are you doing here anyway?

117
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,601
Greed went his separate way
from the Homunculus gang.

118
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:29,105
I took advantage of his agitation
and gained control of my body back.

119
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:34,152
I was looking for someplace near Central
where I could hide, and ended up here.

120
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,571
What's wrong?

121
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,991
This is bad. Greed is coming back.

122
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,745
Hey! Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

123
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,080
Don't let him overcome you!
Keep your wits about you!

124
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,833
Listen to me! Ed...

125
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,837
That "Father" guy
that lives beneath Central

126
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,883
will open the doorway on "That Day,"
which is to come.

127
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,472
In my layman's opinion,
if you two brothers jump into it then,

128
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,141
you might be able to get
your original bodies back.

129
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,396
No, wait. That might be true, but...

130
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,025
in order to open the doorway,
a toll is required.

131
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,655
<i>For what reason is he opening the doorway?</i>

132
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,990
This "Day" which is to come...

133
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,743
Is there a set day
on which he's going to open the doorway?

134
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,664
- Well, I--
- Ling? Hey!

135
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,960
Damn it. Don't come back yet.

136
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,295
The message...

137
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:40,635
- Did you give Lan Fan the message?
- Message?

138
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,808
Al gave it to her. Lan Fan is all right.

139
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,227
We don't know where she is
right now though.

140
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,272
- Okay. Thank goodness.
- Ling?

141
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:58,528
Sorry. That's all for me.

142
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:10,665
Damn, lousy Xingese prince.
He talks far too much.

143
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,376
- Is that you, Greed?
- Yeah, that's right.

144
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:21,050
Give it up, you can't kill me with that.
Sorry to bother you.

145
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,096
Hey! You're gonna just let us skate?

146
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,435
Skate, nothing.
He told you earlier, right?

147
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,104
That I have washed my hands
of the Homunculi?

148
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:37,233
My memories got all jumbled up
and I attacked Bradley.

149
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,695
If I go back, there's no telling
what they'd do to me.

150
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,990
So I've gone and flown the coop,
and will live however I want to.

151
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,159
By myself.

152
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
You want to pal up with us?

153
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,751
If you've got nowhere to go, come with us.

154
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:08,264
Pal up? Pal up with you? That's rich.

155
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,226
Up yours! Everything in the world is mine!

156
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,024
Then again, if you wanted to work for me,
I wouldn't mind palling around with you.

157
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,610
Bye now.

158
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:37,085
<i>Pal up? Even with all these souls
</i><i>I have inside me....</i>

159
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,254
<i>I'm all alone, aren't I?</i>

160
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,840
In that case, you should pal up
with Ed and the others.

161
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,429
If you don't like that idea,
give me my body back.

162
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll become the emperor of Xing
and fill that emptiness.

163
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,729
- The king of the whole land, huh?
- That's a big deal, right?

164
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,107
What a brat. That's still small potatoes.

165
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,610
If I'm going to be anything,

166
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,323
how about becoming the king
of the whole world?

167
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,867
The world?

168
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,911
Hey, Ling, wait up!

169
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,916
What? You're such a pest.
Remember, I'm Greed.

170
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,459
I don't care who you are anymore.

171
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,962
It's too much of a hassle,
so I'll just call you Greeling.

172
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,382
- Hey, who are you calling Gree--
- I'll work for you, Greeling.

173
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,846
I said, I would be one of your men.

174
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,851
Which means that the Chimera fellows
that are with me now work for you too.

175
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,187
Hey, kid!
You can't go deciding that for us!

176
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,231
Don't get carried away,
you little beansprout!

177
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,900
Pipsqueak! Pee-wee!

178
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,321
Now that I think about it,

179
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,575
the moment I decided to become
a dog of the military,

180
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,493
I lost all pride
and everything else with it.

181
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,872
So wagging my tail
is no big deal to me anymore.

182
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,624
Besides, I can't very well let
any information slip away

183
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,502
or pass up this chance just because
I'm caught up in my emotions, right?

184
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,547
Not this one chance in a million.

185
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,757
<i>How foolish.</i>

186
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,677
Are you going to give yourself
over to your passion

187
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,762
and lose this precious information?

188
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,604
What a hoot!
To work for me is to become an outcast.

189
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,273
- Make sure you won't regret it later.
- Give me a break.

190
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,109
When it comes to having regrets,
I've got the inside track!

191
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,986
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

192
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,948
That settles it then.
So that means you're my men as well.

193
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,242
Whatever, suit yourself.

194
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,745
I don't care who I follow
as long as I get fed.

195
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,206
What kind of Chimeras are you?

196
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,624
- I'm part gorilla.
- I'm part lion.

197
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,668
Hey, that's pretty cool, huh?

198
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,920
<i>I've still got her piercings.</i>

199
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,715
<i>It doesn't look like I'll be seeing
</i><i>Winry or Al for a while.</i>

200
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,384
<i>"The day which is to come," huh?</i>

201
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,056
<i>I can't wait.</i>

202
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,563
I've told you time and again,
please don't come here!

203
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,233
When Mrs. Izumi gets back,
I will contact you.

204
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,320
I can't get any work done
with you coming here all the time.

205
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,117
Yes, Curtis Butcher Shop.

206
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,870
Ah, thank you for calling.
About your order...

207
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,455
We'll be back.

208
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,375
Come by as a customer once in a while,
if you wouldn't mind!

209
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,544
MEAT DAY

210
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:29,382
Sorry, some military folks
were just here. Yeah.

211
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,594
You have a message from Alphonse
and a man named Hohenheim.

212
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,014
Yeah, got it.

213
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,182
SUBURBS OF NORTH CITY

214
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,893
The Promised Day, huh?

215
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,063
I see. That's a pretty big deal.

216
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,693
Briggs Mountain.

217
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,948
BRIGGS MOUNTAIN

218
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,203
<i>Contact headquarters at once!</i>

219
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,164
This is Point P! We're under attack!

220
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,709
<i>- Who is it? Drachma?
- We don't know!</i>

221
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,003
<i>- What are the enemy's numbers?
- Just one!</i>

222
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,297
<i>Just one? Who is it?</i>

223
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>Hey, I asked you who it was!</i>

224
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,803
<i>Point P! Who is it?</i>

225
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,431
A housewife!

226
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,599
FORT BRIGGS

227
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,435
It's the same as those incidents
20 years ago.

228
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,230
An attack on a Mountain Guard
by a mysterious woman?

229
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,190
To be wiped out by a single woman...

230
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,861
Once General Armstrong gets back,
she's going to kill us.

231
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,449
- Major Miles.
- Good work.

232
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,533
PRISON CELL

233
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,329
An Ishvalan with dark glasses
and notches shaved into his hair

234
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,664
and a great big soldier with a mohawk.

235
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,541
Just like they told me.

236
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,794
I've been waiting for you two to show up.

237
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,631
Who are you?

238
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,468
I told you, I'm just a housewife
who is passing through.

239
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,928
I've brought a message from Al.

240
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,474
Can we talk someplace privately?

241
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,558
OUTSKIRTS OF NORTH CITY

242
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,769
Yes, sir. A message from Alphonse Elric.

243
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,521
It concerns "The Promised Day."

244
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,190
EAST CITY, GRUMMAN RESIDENCE

245
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,901
"The Promised Day."
Your timing is perfect.

246
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,112
This is starting to get interesting.

247
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,367
EASTERN COMMAND CENTER,
RIFLE RANGE

248
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,371
Hey, Rebecca!

249
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,499
I see your aim is as fine as always.
And so is your tushy.

250
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,920
Lt. General Grumman, what are you doing?

251
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,090
You can't go leaving yourself vulnerable
on the battlefield.

252
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,094
Incidentally, you and Lieutenant Hawkeye
are friends, right?

253
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,973
CENTRAL

254
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,770
- Hey, Riza!
- Long time no see, Rebecca.

255
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,941
<i>There has been a change of plans
</i><i>for the joint exercises</i>

256
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,651
<i>between the Northern and Eastern forces.</i>

257
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:58,364
You know, because of that exchange of fire
between Drachma and Briggs.

258
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,409
They're going to change locations
and hold them in the east.

259
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,994
I heard so from the Fuhrer.

260
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,416
First, Colonel Mustang,
and now the FÃ¼hrer.

261
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:12,169
You have to set me up
with a nice guy from Central too.

262
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,964
Okay. Here's a nice guy.

263
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,135
Hayate, your master
is a cold-blooded skinflint!

264
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,265
Just you watch though.

265
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,268
I'll catch me a nice guy,
resign, and stay at home.

266
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,729
Yeah, yeah. Good luck with that.

267
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,316
Be sure to give my regards
to Lieutenant Havoc.

268
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,777
- Roger that.
- See you later.

269
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,789
"Be sure to give my regards
to Lieutenant Havoc," huh?

270
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,294
Once my condition stabilizes,

271
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,629
I'm thinking of transferring
to a hospital in the east.

272
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,090
Oh, yeah? We'll sure miss you.

273
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,719
In that case,
I wish I had brought you a proper gift.

274
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,972
These are for you. One per day, okay?

275
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,808
Thank you. I just barely ran out.

276
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,228
- All right, I'll come see you later.
- Thanks.

277
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,192
- Rebecca was concerned about you too.
- Sure, sure.

278
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,154
When the colonel comes by,
tell him I said hi.

279
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,739
Okey-dokey.

280
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,159
You heard her, Colonel.

281
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,289
There's no need for you to hide.

282
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,292
Both of us are being watched.

283
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,379
Any private, unwarranted contact
will draw suspicion.

284
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,970
Yum. Colonel, care to have one as well?

285
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:49,266
- No, I'm...
- Oh, come on. Just one.

286
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:05,449
<i>"After the new year, in the spring,
</i><i>on the Promised Day,</i>

287
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,203
<i>the north and east will make their move."</i>
