1
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,719
Colonel.

2
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:40,392
There is no need for you to perform
human transmutation.

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,187
You'll do it, won't you, Mustang?

4
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,284
Well?

5
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,838
All right.

6
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,425
Oh, you're going to do it?

7
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,844
All right, Lieutenant.

8
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,097
I will not perform human transmutation.

9
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,812
You're going to forsake her?
How cold of you.

10
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,648
Forsake?

11
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,483
As someone who treats
these men as sacrificial pawns,

12
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,109
you're the last person
I want to hear that from.

13
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,656
They are happy to serve
as sacrificial pawns.

14
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,702
I fed these men, who were
abandoned by their parents,

15
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,496
and would have died
if I had done nothing.

16
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,499
I gave them a first-rate education.

17
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,502
I gave them a reason to exist.

18
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,880
These men are grateful to me.

19
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,925
Which is why you let yourself
be caught off-balance.

20
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,095
What do you--?

21
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,849
He vanished?

22
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:19,741
Yeah, we're grateful. After all,
I was able to nab you like this.

23
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:20,992
Let me go!

24
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:26,123
Let everyone loose, right now!
Or else...

25
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,962
I'm the only doctor who can
use alchemy here right now!

26
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:37,467
If you kill me, you'll never save
the woman! Do you understand?

27
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,847
Heh, don't give me
that third-rate line, Doctor.

28
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,527
A Philosopher's Stone!

29
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,782
Out of my way!

30
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,332
Lieutenant! Stay with me!

31
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,877
Lieutenant, open your eyes!

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,755
Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

33
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,051
Are you all right?

34
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,768
If I can just get that...

35
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,646
Don't you die!
Lieutenant, stay with me!

36
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,949
This comes first!
Let me take care of this!

37
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,002
Lieutenant!

38
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,213
I've stopped the bleeding for now,

39
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,673
but you have to get her
to a proper doctor.

40
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,467
Thanks, I owe you one.

41
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,769
Colonel, I'm sorry...

42
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,687
Don't speak. Just rest.

43
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,441
I'm so glad...

44
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,945
...you understood the look I gave you.

45
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,740
It's because we've been
together for so long.

46
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:28,245
Besides, you were glaring at me
with that look that said,

47
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,956
"Perform human transmutation,
and I'll shoot you."

48
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,587
That's the last one, huh?

49
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,007
Thanks for your help, everyone.

50
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,969
Hey, no problem.

51
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,679
Oh, right! The Philosopher's Stone!

52
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,067
King Bradley...

53
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,033
His wounds aren't regenerating.

54
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,454
Long time no see, Mustang.

55
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,542
Long time no see, sir.

56
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,003
It would be difficult for me to say

57
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,463
that you're looking as good as ever.

58
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,467
Bradley! Take this!

59
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,935
Knowing you, I thought that when
someone dear to you fell before your eyes,

60
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,648
you wouldn't hesitate to turn
to human transmutation.

61
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,777
I might have done so, a little while ago.

62
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,989
However, right now,
I have people who will stop me

63
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,241
and show me the right path to take.

64
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:39,542
Here I thought you were pathetic
creatures who would never learn,

65
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,003
but there are those like you

66
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,464
who can change
in a short period of time.

67
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,509
The thing about you humans is,

68
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,263
it infuriates me when you don't act
the way I think you will.

69
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,647
What's wrong?

70
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,442
He's under us... He's right under us.

71
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,155
Why, you... I won't let you interfere
with the good gentleman.

72
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,242
Give it up, old-timer.
I'm not letting you--

73
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,831
Gerso!

74
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,542
Shake it off!

75
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,087
Run!

76
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,886
This is bad!

77
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,891
Something's coming. Something terrible.

78
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,758
Sorry, but look after the lieutenant.

79
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,230
Colonel!

80
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,197
Well done, Bradley.

81
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,200
That's the boy I brought up--

82
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,599
Colonel Mustang, you are the fifth.

83
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,477
The last one.

84
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,617
Not again.
What's with all this racket today?

85
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,958
Ah, the eclipse has begun, huh?

86
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,469
I didn't want to have to resort to this
but there is no choice.

87
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,846
We are out of time.

88
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,644
We're going to force you to open
the gateway, Colonel Mustang.

89
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,229
I won't perform human transmutation.

90
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,524
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

91
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,986
An alchemist who has knowledge
of human transmutation

92
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,196
has been assimilated by Pride.

93
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,243
He has the constructional formula.

94
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,289
He is pinned. Move back, Wrath.

95
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,098
Well now, I wonder what
you'll have taken from you.

96
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,561
- Colonel!
- No! You'll get caught in it!

97
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,901
Colonel!

98
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,711
The human transmutation is complete.

99
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,924
That old guy with the glasses?

100
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,342
Where is the colonel?

101
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:02,805
Relax. Right about now,
Mustang is with our father.

102
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:08,019
I can't vouch for
his physical integrity though.

103
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,484
Now, you see what sort of shape I'm in.

104
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,739
Who will take down
the Fuhrer of Amestris

105
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,700
and claim fame for themselves?

106
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,202
A Chimera?

107
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,912
The outsider?

108
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,206
Mustang's dog?

109
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,707
Or perhaps...

110
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,918
you'll all come at me at once?

111
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,963
What is this?

112
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,549
I don't feel like we can win
against this broken-down old man.

113
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,719
Right under us...

114
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,930
Beneath that hole...

115
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,683
As soon as May said
he was right below us,

116
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,060
the old guy in the glasses said

117
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,021
that he wouldn't let us interfere
with the good gentleman.

118
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,316
Apparently, he didn't want us
to go down there.

119
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,777
Ho, so that's where the center is?

120
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,070
That's right.

121
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,281
There is an incredible mass
of chi right below us.

122
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,783
In that case...

123
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,364
Colonel!

124
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,411
Here is the fifth, Father.

125
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,997
- Hmm, that makes all five...
- Are you okay, Colonel? Colonel?

126
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,458
- ...or so I would say.
- Wake up, Colonel!

127
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,377
But Alphonse Elric has not arrived.

128
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,840
Are you okay, Colonel?

129
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,508
Fullmetal?

130
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,554
Where are we?

131
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,228
The ringleader's hideout. Colonel,
what in the world happened to you?

132
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:18,941
I was flung into a white space,
before a large gateway.

133
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,276
Gateway?

134
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,987
You don't mean
something was taken from you?

135
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,281
But your arms and legs are there!

136
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,201
Fullmetal,

137
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,954
I'm surprised that you can tell
my condition in all this darkness.

138
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,664
What are you talking--?

139
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,586
It's pitch-black. I can't see anything.

140
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,717
The lights...

141
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,511
Where are the lights?

142
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,435
Don't tell me...

143
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,024
You can't see, then?

144
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,442
That is good.

145
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,571
Your abilities are quite honestly
the most problematic

146
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,991
among all
of the State Alchemists right now.

147
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,414
Now wallow there in your grief.

148
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:21,504
Colonel, you performed
human transmutation.

149
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,880
Fullmetal,

150
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,551
do you think I would do such a thing?

151
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,724
We forcibly had him open the gateway.

152
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,437
It all worked out in the end.

153
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,274
Now, the combat abilities of
the most irksome Colonel Mustang

154
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,360
have been reduced to as good as nothing.

155
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,863
The truth is cruel.

156
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,450
For those who tempted fate,
and sought their mother's warmth

157
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,202
by bringing the dead back to life,

158
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:58,374
one lost the leg upon which he stood,
as well as his only family.

159
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,919
The other had his entire body taken away

160
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,921
to be replaced with one
that feels no warmth.

161
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,924
One who sought her child
was given a body

162
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,344
that could never again have children.

163
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,806
And then, the one who looked forward
to the future of his nation

164
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,808
had his eyesight taken from him.

165
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,979
Now, he can no longer see his future.

166
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,650
It gives humans proper despair,
so that they do not become boastful.

167
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:29,447
Such is the very thing
that you humans call your god...

168
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,159
Truth.

169
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,453
I don't buy it!

170
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,420
I'd get it if he did it on his own,
like we did.

171
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,299
But to force someone who doesn't
want to do human transmutation

172
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,594
to be caught in the middle of this,
and have his eyesight taken...

173
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,930
Is that what you call proper?

174
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,433
I don't accept any truth
that's so unreasonable.

175
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,903
You're planning to interfere with Fate?

176
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,471
What is your real name?

177
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,558
I have no name.

178
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,354
I cast it aside.

179
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:52,071
What a coincidence.
I don't know my real name either.

180
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,283
It might be interesting

181
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,493
if we fellow nameless ones
killed each other.

182
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,565
May!

183
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,984
There he is!

184
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,904
For her to put a hole
in my home like that...

185
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,740
That little girl...

186
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,325
His outer appearance may have changed

187
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:42,663
but his presence is that
of the immortal ringleader.

188
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,499
Oh, Alphonse! What's happened to you?

189
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,918
I don't know. He won't wake up.

190
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:48,836
Oh, no!

191
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,090
Alphonse! Alphonse!

192
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,342
Please, wake up!

193
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,344
Alphonse!

194
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,484
My body...

195
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,948
That's my body.

196
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,128
I've been waiting a long time.

197
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,552
Welcome home.

198
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:58,364
What thin arms you have.
Nothing but skin and bones.

199
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,243
It's all you can do just
to stand up, isn't it?

200
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,994
I can't...

201
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,163
I can't...

202
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,084
I can't fight in a body like this!

203
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,545
Everyone else is fighting, though!

204
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,799
You don't want to become one with me?

205
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,926
It's not that at all!

206
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,595
For a long, long, long time,

207
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,390
I've thought about getting
my original body back.

208
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,475
And yet...

209
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,980
I can't right now.

210
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,691
That body isn't going to cut it.

211
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,569
That body isn't going to cut it.

212
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,947
You want to go back there?

213
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,451
You want to go back there, in that body?

214
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,875
If you do, I won't stop you.

215
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,494
I'm sorry! I'll be back!

216
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,455
Just hang in there a little while longer.

217
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,373
I swear, I'll be back!

218
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,293
Absolutely! I promise.

219
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,008
Al!

220
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,636
Al! Are you all right?

221
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,763
- Alphonse!
- Al!

222
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,601
Teacher, Brother, May!

223
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,436
Then this is...

224
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,568
<i>He left behind the body he's been
</i><i>searching for all these years,</i>

225
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,195
<i>so that he could help his friends.</i>

226
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:08,494
<i>My noble soul.
</i><i>As your vessel, I am proud of you.</i>

227
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,122
<i>But with your return,</i>

228
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:16,377
<i>the world just might become filled
</i><i>with despair.</i>

229
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,962
Alphonse.

230
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,926
That makes all five.
