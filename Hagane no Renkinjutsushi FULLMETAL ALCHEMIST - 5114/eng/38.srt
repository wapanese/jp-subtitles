1
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>I will always be watching you
</i><i>from the shadows.</i>

2
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:50,550
- Yes?
<i>- This is your neighborhood florist.</i>

3
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,596
What do you want, Colonel?

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,681
<i>Sorry.</i>

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,809
I got drunk,
and bought a great deal of flowers.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,563
<i>I'd be grateful if you'd take
</i><i>some of them from me.</i>

7
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,233
What's wrong?

8
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:12,197
-<i> Has something happened?
- No, it's nothing.</i>

9
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,200
Are you sure?

10
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,829
Yes, it's nothing, really.

11
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,834
I'll pass on the flowers.
I don't have any vases here.

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,839
Thank you for taking the time
to call me though. Bye.

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,478
How is his timing always so spot-on?

14
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,743
<i>Someone matching Scar's description
</i><i>was seen on a nearby mountain road.</i>

15
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,995
<i>He was probably headed here.</i>

16
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,332
- An abandoned mine?
- That's right.

17
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,378
Nowadays, Baschool is a ghost town.

18
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,257
- It's a perfect place to hide.
- That will be problematic.

19
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,134
Which is why we're splitting up to search.

20
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,763
All squads, if you spot Scar,
contact us here at once.

21
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,265
Yes, sir!

22
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,023
- We will accompany the Elric brothers.
- Yeah, yeah.

23
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,278
- Could they be our watchers?
- Probably.

24
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:07,205
<i>- Now then...
</i><i>- How do we slip away from these guys?</i>

25
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,585
- I just saw someone!
- What?

26
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,171
- This way! This way!
- Hey, hold on!

27
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:18,884
Hey, wait up!

28
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,098
- They're gone?
- Where did they go?

29
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:29,561
- They went inside that room, didn't they?
- Damn, they're scampering away from us!

30
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:36,067
Looks like we managed
to give them the slip.

31
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,071
But this place is...

32
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,243
Too big!

33
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,957
Where could Scar and that girl be?

34
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,462
Unless they come to us,
finding them will be quite--

35
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,339
Alphonse...!

36
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,341
Alphonse!

37
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,551
- Hey...
- It can't be...

38
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,637
Alphonse!

39
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,848
She really did come to us.

40
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,768
What are you doing here?

41
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,938
May! Thank goodness!
We really did manage to find you!

42
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,734
You mean, Al, you were pursuing me?

43
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,362
I wanted to see you again.

44
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,076
Oh, Al...

45
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,289
I wanted to see you,
and learn more about alkahestry.

46
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,959
What do I do? What do I do?

47
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,628
- Am I dreaming?
- Hey now, little girl!

48
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,130
Al is after me!

49
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,924
I've missed you!
You're not getting away again!

50
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,801
Now tell us about your alkahestry,
right now!

51
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,096
Both brothers are after me,
to steal my love!

52
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,848
No, Edward, you are not my type.

53
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,434
Stop playing dumb!

54
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,521
- Hey, Al!
- Sorry, sorry.

55
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:02,237
- Yow, I bumped my head.
- Alphonse, who is this woman?

56
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,532
How mean, Al! You've already got me!

57
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,410
Oh, she's just a friend from childhood.

58
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:13,039
And why am I making excuses,
like I was two-timing someone?

59
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,668
May, you shouldn't go so far
on ahead by yourself.

60
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,421
The Elric brothers?!

61
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,426
- Who are you?
- It's me! It's me, Marcoh!

62
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,263
- Eh? Dr. Marcoh?
- What happened to your face?

63
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,891
What about you?
What are you doing here?

64
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,688
- The Elric brothers!
- Who are you?

65
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,898
You can't tell me you've forgotten me!

66
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,569
Not me, Yoki,
the great colliery proprietor of Youswell!

67
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,364
We've forgotten. Or I should say,
we never knew you.

68
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,492
How mean! After what you did to me!

69
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,830
1914
"YOUSWELL"

70
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,334
<i>The coal mining town of Youswell.</i>

71
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>I, Yoki, was both military governor
</i><i>and operator of the coal mine.</i>

72
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,469
<i>Thanks to me,
</i><i>the people of the town lived in happiness.</i>

73
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,683
"Would you pay your back taxes already?"

74
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,813
"We can't pay since you've been
skimming from our salaries!"

75
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,195
<i>That's when the greatest criminal
</i><i>of all time,</i>

76
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,990
<i>the State Alchemist, Edward Elric,
</i><i>suddenly appeared.</i>

77
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,079
"A silver pocket watch?"
"A State Alchemist!!"

78
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,709
"Gold bars!!"

79
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,964
"I want you to sell me the title
to the mine in exchange for this."

80
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>However, it was an ingenious trap!</i>

81
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,603
"What is this, alchemist?"

82
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,609
"All the gold bars you gave me
have turned into stones!"

83
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,449
<i>They had set this up together
</i><i>behind the scenes.</i>

84
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,916
<i>And so, having had the mine
</i><i>defrauded from me,</i>

85
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,295
<i>I was treated cruelly
</i><i>by the ungrateful townspeople,</i>

86
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,133
<i>and branded persona non grata
</i><i>by the military.</i>

87
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,014
<i>Planning my comeback,
</i><i>I expanded my ventures all over.</i>

88
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,642
<i>But they all failed.</i>

89
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,938
<i>My fallback investments...</i>

90
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,318
<i>...also all failed.</i>

91
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,865
<i>As a last resort,</i>

92
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:56,161
<i>I went to seek a goodwill loan
</i><i>from a millionaire family.</i>

93
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,365
<i>If it weren't for them...
</i><i>If it weren't for those Elric brothers...</i>

94
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,994
<i>That's when I swore an oath.
</i><i>Yes, I would take my revenge</i>

95
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,371
<i>against the ones who had done this to me!</i>

96
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>A vengeance far worse than death!</i>

97
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,630
<i>I won't be outdone
</i><i>by a thieving hussy like you!</i>

98
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:54,052
Who are you calling a thieving hussy?

99
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,554
I told you, there's nothing between us.

100
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,474
That's right. So don't get upset.

101
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,018
Can we hurry up and get to the alkahestry?

102
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,396
- You guys listen to me!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

103
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,107
It must have been hard for you, pops.

104
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,401
- I know how you feel.
- Don't go brushing me off!

105
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,989
Miss Winry is gone?

106
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,202
- For crying out loud, what are you doing?
- Sorry about that.

107
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,914
I will look for her.
Two members from Charlie Squad,

108
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
- come with me.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,880
- Major Miles...
- I know. Scar, right?

110
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,007
The moment we spot him, we'll contact you.

111
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,982
<i>No luck here either.
</i><i>There's not much to speak of.</i>

112
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,487
You're Scar, right?

113
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,658
Mr. Kimblee is waiting for you.
You're coming with us.

114
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,620
You've got pretty sharp noses.

115
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,291
But do you really think
just the two of you can take me?

116
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,795
Well, if we were just ordinary humans,
there'd be no way.

117
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,355
If we were just ordinary humans...

118
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,691
Chimeras, huh?

119
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,985
This should be good!

120
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,867
I've learned a lot since then.

121
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,162
Starting with how to create
a Philosopher's Stone,

122
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,208
as well as the history of this country,

123
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,961
and that there's something odd
about alchemy.

124
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,632
That's why, seeking the possibilities
of Xingese alkahestry,

125
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,928
- we came looking for this girl.
- Impressive.

126
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,307
Actually, there is someone
who realized this sooner.

127
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,435
These are the research notes
he left behind.

128
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:13,483
We suspect that there are clues
to sorting it out in these pages.

129
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,861
Then, once we're able to decipher
what's written in there...

130
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,155
Yes, perhaps.

131
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,951
However,
we will need Scar's help to do it.

132
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,162
Why do we need him?

133
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,167
What was that sound?

134
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,172
It came from where Scar is!
Is it the military?

135
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:41,803
Winry, Dr. Marcoh and you guys, hide here.
Al and I will go see what's going on.

136
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,890
Scar...

137
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,817
<i>He's fast for his size.</i>

138
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,996
We know that unless you touch our bodies,
you can't perform your destruction!

139
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,708
We'll just stick with attacking you
from a distance!

140
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,557
We've also studied how you have a habit

141
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,184
of destroying the ground underfoot
when the situation turns on you.

142
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,605
We're gonna beat you senseless
before turning you over to Mr. Kimblee.

143
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,445
We got here in the nick of time again.

144
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,490
- The Elric brothers?
- That voice...

145
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,869
Brother, these are the flunkies

146
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,580
- Kimblee brought with him from Central.
- What?

147
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,374
I see.

148
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,628
You just stay there quietly and watch.
We're just about to round up Scar--

149
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,634
- Strange monsters!
- What are you doing? We're on your side!

150
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,138
I don't know anything
about any inhuman allies!

151
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,225
I'm so scared! They're pretending to be
our allies, but they're out to eat us!

152
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,229
That tubby one behind him has
a huge mouth! He's gonna swallow me whole!

153
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,649
You little brats! Sit still!

154
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,868
<i>This guy is even faster than Scar!</i>

155
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,043
- Brother?
- What's so funny?

156
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,846
They're so light! They're so light!
My arm and leg almost feel like feathers!

157
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,682
How magnificent
this cold-weather automail is!

158
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,685
Why, you... Mess with me, will you?

159
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,355
Huh? My punches are also lighter?

160
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,777
You won't get out of my saliva
that easily!

161
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,862
This is drool? How vile!

162
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,991
- Take this!
- If this is saliva...

163
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,122
If you break it down,
it's mostly water, isn't it?

164
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,669
- It's so cold!
- Take this!

165
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,675
- What are you doing, Brother?
- Stop! My skin is gonna peel off!

166
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,805
"Wet Hands Freezing To Cold Metal
When Touched Attack!"

167
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,519
Stay out of this, Fullmetal Alchemist!
You're supposed to be on our side!

168
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,896
You shut up, pig! I don't know anyone

169
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,150
that looks anything like you!
Any way you look at it, you're the enemy!

170
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,778
If you're really on our side, prove it!

171
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,282
All right. I'm about to transform back,
so watch closely!

172
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,122
- I've been waiting for this!
- Zampano!

173
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,959
You're a fool to put away your weapon
in front of your enemy!

174
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,545
Damn it. Let go of me, you...!

175
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,298
Okay, okay. Lights out for a little while.

176
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,767
He's back in action.
Stay caught already, would you?

177
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,437
It's time to answer
for what you've done, Scar.

178
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,732
Anyone who gets in my way
will be eliminated.

179
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,162
<i>For him to come straight at me
</i><i>without even thinking...</i>

180
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,874
Your steel right arm... is mine!

181
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,465
Aw, too bad! It's not steel anymore!

182
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,556
Come quietly!

183
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,979
Stop!

184
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,537
You dumbass! Why did you come here?

185
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,544
- Stay back.
- Major Miles.

186
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,215
What are these things?

187
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:35,304
Those folks in Central appear to be doing
some ungodly experiments.

188
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,182
- Tie them up to that column.
- Yes, sir!

189
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,685
Now then, Scar,

190
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,980
I hate to come down on one
of my own people,

191
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,984
but I can't allow you to go around
doing whatever you please.

192
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,402
Your own people?

193
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,073
Elric brothers, we'll take it from here.

194
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,660
- Winry!
- You idiot! Stay away from him!

195
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,289
It's all right. Let me go.

196
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:05,668
- How is it all right?
- Miss, stay away from him!

197
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,795
Please, let me talk to him.

198
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,717
I want to speak to him, face to face.

199
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,108
Why did you kill my mom and dad?

200
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,780
Anything I say would only be an excuse.

201
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,744
The fact remains,
I killed the Rockbell doctors.

202
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,177
What was that?

203
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,887
It came from the building
that reported in!

204
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,399
This is bad.
Our appointed hour has passed.

205
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:17,865
And you know our queen. I'll bet
she really has sealed the hole up.

206
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,575
There's nothing we can do about it.

207
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,161
We groped our way back
without the lanterns after all.

208
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:27,291
They were adamant that if the lights
were on, the monster would come.

209
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,977
- Welcome back.
- Thank goodness.

210
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,938
Get these two to the medical room, quick.

211
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,316
- Sorry.
- Nothing to apologize for.

212
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,778
I thought you were told
to block up this hole after hours.

213
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,864
Yes, sir, but...

214
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,035
Look, it hasn't been hours yet.

215
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,043
At least not on this watch.
General Armstrong gave it to me.

216
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,304
General!

217
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,310
- Was the advance party safe?
- Only two of them survived, sir.

218
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,314
I see.

219
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,820
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm looking at the mountains.

220
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,035
Winter here sure is nice.
Nothing but black and white.

221
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,749
- I like how everything's very clear-cut.
- Are you sure about that, sir?

222
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,838
If you look up, there's also blue.

223
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,343
Just like a person's heart.

224
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,848
Thanks for showing us a little mercy, sir.

225
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,353
Why, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

226
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,657
Something's coming.

227
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,544
Long time no see.
Forgive me for being so abrupt,

228
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:41,675
but there's something you need
to give an account for, isn't there?

229
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,438
- Keep back!
- Everyone, stay back!

230
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,824
Damn it!

231
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,160
- Fullmetal Alchemist?
- Kimblee!

232
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,163
Why, you! How come
you didn't keep an eye on Winry?

233
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,543
Mr. Kimblee, up on the roof!
