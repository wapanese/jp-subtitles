1
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,469
Fullmetal!

2
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,682
He's gone.

3
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,475
What did you do?

4
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,402
He's just been carried off to the place

5
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,280
where you will also go, in time.

6
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,332
<i>What is this?</i>

7
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>It feels like... Oh, right!</i>

8
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,965
<i>Like it did when we opened
</i><i>the gateway of truth!</i>

9
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,226
Damn it. Why, you--

10
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,082
You...

11
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,584
You dumbass! Never mind us!

12
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:36,091
It is our job to protect the Young Lord.

13
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,305
This much weight is too much
for your automail to support.

14
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,307
You look after the old man!

15
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,521
It's too late for him.

16
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,027
Briggs soldiers, give me a hand!

17
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,739
Right!

18
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,784
Bradley! Take this!

19
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,590
Fu!

20
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,093
Fu!

21
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,603
Someone get a doctor!

22
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,938
Is there a doctor around
who can use alchemy?

23
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,483
I have a Philosopher's Stone right here!

24
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
Use as much of it as you want!

25
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,448
Somebody, please!

26
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,826
This is Amestris,
a major alchemic power, right?

27
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,913
Is there nobody?

28
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,459
Why?

29
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,674
Why?

30
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,180
Young Lord!

31
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,353
You monster.

32
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,734
Why?

33
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,446
I've obtained immortality

34
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,949
and yet I can't save
a single one of my subjects?

35
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,078
Damn it!

36
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,998
Captain!

37
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,000
Captain, stay with us!

38
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,670
- Captain!
- Captain!

39
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,921
Captain!

40
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,047
Fire!

41
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,353
Thanks to you,
Bradley received a lethal blow.

42
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,357
You saw that Fu's death was not in vain,

43
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,110
and yet I can't do a thing for you.

44
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,664
- Give me some ammo!
- That's the last of it!

45
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,128
Damn, I'm out over here too!

46
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,216
- All of you, fire back with your rifles!
- Yes, sir!

47
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,229
Ling Yao.

48
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,776
Greed... whichever.

49
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,448
If you feel indebted,
would you do a favor for me?

50
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:52,245
We are to keep this gate from opening

51
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,456
until we receive orders from our queen.

52
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,461
Please defend it for me.

53
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,427
With your power, you can do that, right?

54
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,808
No, you're the only one who can do it,
if you would.

55
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,043
Greed.

56
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:47,092
I want your power. Let me have it.

57
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,181
Sure. There's still a little time
before my engagement.

58
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,146
- Lan Fan, you protect the men here.
- Yes, sir!

59
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,567
You'll do it?

60
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,821
Yeah, I promise.

61
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,534
And people from Xing...

62
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,456
always keep their word.

63
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,505
Fire! Fire!

64
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,769
Who is that guy?

65
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,898
Listen up, you guys!

66
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,984
Anyone who doesn't want to get hurt,

67
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,154
anyone with a family
or a lover, keep back!

68
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,701
Also, women!
I'm not the sort who fights women!

69
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,678
Impossible.

70
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,447
Fire!

71
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,596
Amazing. Is that Ling Yao?

72
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,932
Or is it the Homunculus?

73
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,324
It's a good thing for us he's on our side.

74
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,245
Captain! Captain!

75
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,796
Captain, please stay with us.

76
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,092
- He's fighting for our side?
- Yes, sir.

77
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,680
Now I can cash it in in peace.

78
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,558
What are you talking about, Captain?

79
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,061
General Armstrong is about to win!
Just a little bit longer!

80
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:32,233
Captain, we need you to do even more
than you already have here in Central!

81
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:42,493
The sooty air of Central
doesn't agree with me.

82
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,204
Farewell, comrades.

83
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,251
I'm going on ahead...

84
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:58,718
to someplace even higher
than the summit of Briggs.

85
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,140
Captain Buccaneer!

86
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,688
What was that light earlier?

87
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,857
There have been no reports.

88
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,611
What's going on
at the military command center?

89
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,656
Are there any updates from Radio Capital?

90
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,574
No, nothing.

91
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,118
What about other stations?

92
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,580
They're just informing us
to stay in our homes.

93
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,003
<i>Mama!</i>

94
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,131
The radio said
we weren't allowed to go out,

95
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,802
so let's forget about going over
to Tabitha's, okay, Elicia?

96
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,350
We can still watch it from here.
It's about to start.

97
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,144
You can watch the eclipse
together with Mama, okay?

98
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,070
Izumi!

99
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,574
Where are you? Izumi!

100
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,745
Alex, do you know what's going on?

101
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:13,001
Hmm, the Elric brothers
once told me about this.

102
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,211
They said that when they performed
human transmutation,

103
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,840
they were dragged
into the gateway of truth by black hands.

104
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,970
What is the gateway of truth?

105
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,849
I do not know.

106
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,434
What?

107
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,394
Have you gotten through?

108
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,564
Sir, headquarters is safe.

109
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,318
Good. So do they have any information
concerning Ms. Izumi?

110
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,615
- No, sir.
- I see.

111
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,076
Anything else?

112
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,456
Captain Buccaneer,
along with several of his men,

113
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,499
were engaged by King Bradley...

114
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,878
while defending the main gate...

115
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,381
and were killed.

116
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,887
The captain was working together
with those from Xing,

117
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,598
inflicted a mortal wound on Bradley,

118
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,893
and pushed him over into the moat.

119
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,770
Impossible!

120
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,314
Impossible, impossible, impossible!

121
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,568
King Bradley cannot be killed that easily.

122
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,986
He is a superhuman--

123
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,867
What about the main gate?

124
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,119
They're still defending it.

125
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,247
The Homunculus named Greed
has come over to our side,

126
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,167
and has mowed down
the Central troops at the main gate.

127
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,919
A Homunculus?

128
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,712
Impossible.

129
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,341
A Homunculus would not turn
against the good gentleman.

130
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,761
They said that Captain Buccaneer died
with a smile on his face.

131
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,350
I see.

132
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,271
If he died with a smile,
then we can't let ourselves weep over him.

133
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,273
- Let's keep going!
- Yes, ma'am!

134
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,985
Mr. Sig, let's go.

135
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,281
- We have to go find your wife as well.
- Yeah.

136
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,598
Oh, Teacher.

137
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,229
- Ed?
- Are you all right?

138
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,648
Yeah, more or less.

139
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,234
Teacher, what are you doing here?

140
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,153
That's what I'd like to know.

141
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,239
So where are we?

142
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,659
I don't know.
I just suddenly got whooshed here.

143
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,830
Al!

144
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,626
- Al, snap out of it.
- Al too? Could it be...?

145
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,546
- What's wrong with you, Al? Hey!
- That the sacrifices are being gathered?

146
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,886
One, two, three...

147
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:16,684
Four of you? That's one short.

148
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:23,316
Could the last one be being made now?

149
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,904
What is that monster?

150
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,988
Hohenheim!

151
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,620
Edward... And he caught Alphonse too.

152
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,580
Oh, as well as Ms. Izumi.

153
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,542
You'll have to excuse my sorry appearance.

154
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,961
What in the world...?

155
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,963
There's nothing to it.

156
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,925
Mind yourself.

157
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:54,639
I will drain the Philosopher's Stone
from inside you later at my leisure.

158
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,017
Hohenheim, what is that black thing?

159
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:04,899
A copy of me.
The one the Homunculi called "Father."

160
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,108
Wha--?

161
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,696
You're telling me
this is that bearded bastard?

162
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,365
That's right.

163
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,284
I destroyed the leather bag
he was in, but...

164
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:20,581
You keep your mouth closed, Hohenheim.

165
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:25,962
Now, greetings, my sacrifices.

166
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,342
Welcome to my castle.

167
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,807
Al, wake up. This doesn't look good.

168
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,600
Al?

169
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,354
Hey, Al. Alphonse!

170
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,111
My word, the people up there
are so unreliable.

171
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,782
To think that they can't even get
five sacrifices ready for this day.

172
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,623
But then, they only managed
to assemble those who took the bait

173
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,001
of something small like immortality.

174
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,962
I suppose it's no surprise
they didn't get the job done.

175
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,345
Why, you--!

176
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,766
Wha--?

177
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,155
All right, good, hold him there.

178
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,744
Now then, Mustang, we are out of time.

179
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,456
I would appreciate it if you would proceed
to cooperate with us.

180
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,791
Could you perform
a little human transmutation

181
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,419
and open the gateway for me?

182
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,545
What?

183
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,381
It doesn't matter who.

184
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:57,803
A parent you've lost, a lover, a friend...

185
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,975
The one you were so close to.
What was his name? Hughes?

186
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,356
He will do too. I will get things set up
for you over here.

187
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,735
I'm one of the sacrifices?

188
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:18,741
Yes. Those who have opened
the gateway can become sacrifices.

189
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,869
That's why the Elric brothers were chosen?

190
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,913
Yes, it is.

191
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,958
They told me that human transmutation
could not be done.

192
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,295
What kind of fool would perform it
knowing it would fail?

193
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,381
Yes, you're right.

194
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:37,468
You see, all you have to do
is open the gateway and return.

195
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,805
No way!
I won't perform human transmutation

196
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,515
nor will I open the gateway!

197
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,190
I told you, we are out of time.

198
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,449
Lieutenant!

199
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,743
Lieutenant. Lieutenant!

200
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:07,998
Now, why don't you try opening
the gateway, Mustang?

201
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,000
Why, you--

202
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,714
Lieutenant, can you hear me?
Answer me!

203
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:19,552
Now, perform human transmutation
and become the fifth.

204
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:27,017
Come on, if you don't hurry,
the woman will lose her life.

205
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,107
Ah, I know. Would you like
to transmute her after she dies?

206
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,192
That would be okay too.

207
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,279
I won't die.

208
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:46,412
You see, I am under orders not to die.

209
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,874
If people could obtain
an immortal body like that,

210
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,960
it wouldn't be very sporting.

211
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,756
Mustang, what will it be?

212
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,426
Your precious woman is about to die.

213
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,096
If you do nothing,
she will soon bleed to death.

214
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,018
However, I am a doctor
that can use alchemy

215
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,980
and I even have a Philosopher's Stone.

216
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:18,527
Which is to say,
I would be able to save this woman's life

217
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,489
with all certainty.

218
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,994
But if she dies
before you make up your mind,

219
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,831
then there will be nothing that I can do.

220
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,584
Oh?

221
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:42,259
She sure has grown quiet. Has she died?

222
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,137
Colonel...

223
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,602
there is no need for you
to perform human transmutation.

224
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,397
You'll do it, won't you, Mustang?

225
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,536
Well?

226
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,048
All right.
