1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:07,341
Don't you want freedom and rights,
Hohenheim?

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,053
Do you intend to live out your life
as a slave,

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,847
without obtaining the rights of man?

4
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:19,811
In that case, you're no different
than being inside a stuffy flask.

5
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,909
Why?!

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,537
All right! Clobber him, Ed!

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,123
<i>Why, when I have acquired God...</i>

8
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,084
<i>...can a mere human...</i>

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,835
<i>...alchemist...</i>

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>...bare-handedly...</i>

11
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,933
He did it!

12
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,270
-He did it!
-We won!

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,710
Get hold of yourself, would you?

14
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,086
What are you letting yourself
get knocked around for?

15
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,629
Sorry.

16
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,632
Stone...!

17
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,095
Philosopher's Stone!

18
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,562
Give me your Philosopher's Stone!

19
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,815
This is bad!

20
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,400
Greed!

21
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,403
You dumbass! Let me go!
You'll be dragged in!

22
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:56,783
No way! I need to have you within me
if I'm going to be emperor!

23
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,912
That's impossible!
I was originally born of dear old Dad.

24
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,456
The power pulling me that way

25
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,667
is greater than that of Ling Yao's body,
and there's nothing I can do!

26
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,004
Don't give up, Greed! Tough it out!

27
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,507
Yikes!

28
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,675
My body!

29
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,555
Damn it all!

30
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,021
Being the emperor of Xing is quite a bit
lower than being king of the world,

31
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,023
but I guess it's not too bad.

32
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,776
Let's fight together, partner.

33
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,403
That's more like it--

34
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,450
What are you...?

35
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,786
This is where we say goodbye.

36
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,164
There's no need for you to be
sucked in by dear old Dad, too.

37
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,751
Hold on a second, Greed!

38
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,212
You just said we would
fight together, didn't you?!

39
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,299
Sucker-punching me like this is just...

40
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:59,971
I thought your creed was to never
tell a lie! To end it like this...

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,934
And you fell for it hook, line and sinker,
you little pissant!

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,399
That was my first and last lie ever.

43
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:16,321
Lan Fan has a Philosopher's Stone.
Take it and go home, kid.

44
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,989
Wait...

45
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,950
Wait...

46
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,453
Wait, Greed!

47
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,414
Get over here, Lan Fan!

48
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,251
Later.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,547
Greed!

50
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,425
Greed!

51
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,926
Why, you...!

52
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,345
Greed!

53
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,435
I managed to separate myself
from that annoying kid!

54
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,861
Greed! Why do you turn on your father?!

55
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,364
Call it a delayed rebellious phase,
Daddy, sir.

56
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,286
With the carbonizing ability you gave me,

57
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,789
I'll transform us into the weakest,
most fragile carbon there is!

58
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,916
Crafty devil!

59
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,839
Away with you, fool!

60
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,968
Greed!

61
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,308
Ah, damn... this is it, huh?

62
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,861
What are you looking at me
like that for, pissant?

63
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,156
Friends are connected by their souls!

64
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,450
There's no way you can forget it!

65
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,329
You want to pal up with us?

66
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,873
If you've got nowhere to go, come with us.

67
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:56,546
<i>Sheesh, both Ling and the little runt
</i><i>took a pretty cocky attitude with me.</i>

68
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,802
<i>Enough...</i>

69
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,306
<i>Yeah, that's enough.</i>

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>I don't need anything more.</i>

71
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,817
<i>See you later, my soul... friends.</i>

72
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,219
Guys...

73
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,519
My Stone... My Philosopher's Stone.

74
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,903
What...? What is this?

75
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,870
Go back to wherever you were born,
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus!

76
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,339
Why?!

77
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,843
I wanted to know everything
about this world!

78
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,346
Without being bound by anything!

79
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,350
Free, in the vast world!

80
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,061
I...!

81
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,575
Why?

82
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,244
Why wouldn't you become mine?

83
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,372
God! What is it you didn't like about me?!

84
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,667
It's because you didn't
believe in yourself.

85
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,883
You stole your power from others,
and despite being born of a person,

86
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,886
all you ever did was cling
to what you called God.

87
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,014
You yourself haven't grown.

88
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,059
Did you think that by detaching
yourself from your seven desires,

89
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,519
you would be able to surpass humans?

90
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,021
Don't make me laugh!

91
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,733
I wanted to be the perfect being!

92
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,945
I wanted to know everything in the world!

93
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,780
What's wrong with wanting that?

94
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,782
What's wrong with desiring that?

95
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,159
What's wrong with wishing for that?

96
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:41,252
What? What are you? What is your name?

97
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,089
Who do you think you are?

98
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,761
I am what you call the world.

99
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,056
Or perhaps the universe, or perhaps God,

100
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,728
or perhaps truth, or perhaps all,
or perhaps one,

101
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,524
and I am also you.

102
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,943
What gives you proper despair,

103
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,696
so that you do not become boastful,
is truth.

104
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:13,618
It gives humans proper despair,
so that they do not become boastful.

105
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,329
It is truth!

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,670
And so, I will give you despair as well!

107
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,055
No! I don't want to go back!

108
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,437
Stop! I can't bear to go on
being bound in there!

109
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,112
No! No! No!

110
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,115
Despair to those who become boastful.

111
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,617
What should I have done?

112
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,370
This is the outcome you desired.

113
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,290
What should I have done?

114
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:11,092
You must have seen the answer.

115
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,189
What? What happened? Did we win?

116
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,523
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,986
However, Alphonse has not
returned from the other side.

118
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,907
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,161
It's not your fault. It was Al's decision.

120
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,247
Ed! I've got the toll!

121
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,209
Use it. It's a Philosopher's Stone.

122
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,294
Get Al back with it.

123
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,590
I can't.

124
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,219
I promised Al that we wouldn't
use a Philosopher's Stone

125
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,930
to get our bodies back.

126
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,776
<i>There must be a way.
</i><i>There has to be! Think.</i>

127
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,613
<i>Think it through.
</i><i>Keep the thoughts coming!</i>

128
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,532
Edward...

129
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,704
Use my life, and bring Alphonse back.

130
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,500
There's exactly one person's
worth remaining.

131
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,421
You dumbass, there's no way
I could do something like that!

132
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,175
It is our own fault, as brothers,
that we lost our bodies!

133
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,139
I am adamant that I will not
use human lives to get Al back!

134
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,100
And why should you need
to put your life on the line?

135
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,603
Because I'm his father.

136
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,981
This isn't about need, or reason.

137
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,986
You are dear to me.
I want you to be happy.

138
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,489
By neglecting you, I do bear
some responsibility

139
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,868
for your bodies ending up
the way they are.

140
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,497
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
I've lived long enough.

142
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:12,505
At least let me act like a father
at the end.

143
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,598
Don't be ridiculous, you rotten father!

144
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,433
Don't ever say anything like that again!

145
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,518
I'll lay you out!

146
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,662
I'm sorry, Edward.

147
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:53,755
<i>Think! Think! You're the youngest
</i><i>State Alchemist in history, right?</i>

148
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,465
<i>You've seen the truth,</i>

149
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,927
<i>so you can transmute
</i><i>without transmutation circles!</i>

150
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,929
<i>There has to be a way!</i>

151
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,972
<i>There must be!</i>

152
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,398
There must be many people who
are waiting for the day to come

153
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,067
when you get your bodies back.

154
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,529
If the possibility is there,
you should move forward!

155
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:25,745
<i>That's right. Don't give up.
</i><i>There has to be something. Something...</i>

156
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,497
<i>Something...</i>

157
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,932
Al...

158
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,435
Al... Al...

159
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,440
<i>May is weeping that much over Al?</i>

160
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,948
<i>Zampano, Mr. Gorilla,
</i><i>the guys from Briggs,</i>

161
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,825
<i>the major,</i>

162
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,327
<i>Ling, Lan Fan,</i>

163
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,579
<i>Teacher,</i>

164
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,831
<i>our old man.</i>

165
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,842
May, stand back a bit.

166
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,746
That's...

167
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,126
...a human transmutation circle!

168
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,503
I'll be right back.

169
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,467
This is the Fullmetal Alchemist's
final transmutation.

170
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,226
-Ed!
-Ed!

171
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,479
Edward Elric!

172
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,496
You're here to bring your brother back,
are you?

173
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,416
But how are you going to pull
a whole person out of here?

174
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,338
What price will you pay?
Will you offer your body?

175
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,093
I've got your price right here.
This huge thing.

176
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,267
This is my gateway of truth.

177
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:58,022
Which means it's up to me
how I use it. Am I wrong?

178
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,612
Is that what it's come to?

179
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,868
Are you sure about this?
If you lose your gateway,

180
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,372
you'll never be able to use alchemy again.

181
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,040
You're right.

182
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:22,255
It's true, beyond this gateway
lies everything about alchemy.

183
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,299
However, I've been manipulated
because of it.

184
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,094
After having been shown
the so-called truth,

185
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,432
I was convinced that I could
solve everything with alchemy.

186
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:37,311
But I was wrong. That was just arrogance.

187
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,022
You would lower yourself to
become just a normal person,

188
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,816
unable to use alchemy?

189
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,904
"Lower myself," nothing. I've been
just a person from the start.

190
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,032
An insignificant human
who couldn't save a little girl

191
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,326
who had been made into a Chimera.

192
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,330
You're sure you'll be okay without it?

193
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,790
<i>-Ed!
</i><i>-Fullmetal!</i>

194
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,375
<i>-Edward!
</i><i>-Ed!</i>

195
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,710
<i>Edward Elric!</i>

196
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,253
<i>-Ed!
</i><i>-Mr. Edward!</i>

197
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,838
<i>Ed!</i>

198
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,298
<i>Ed...</i>

199
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,593
Even without alchemy, I still have them.

200
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,096
That is the right answer, alchemist.

201
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,349
You have beaten me.

202
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,978
Take it with you. All of it!

203
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,234
The back door is over there,

204
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,862
Edward Elric.

205
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,668
That was a crazy thing to do.

206
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,172
You too, Brother.

207
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,263
Now, let's go home. Together.

208
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,533
Oh, he's coming around.

209
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,535
Are you all right, Alphonse?

210
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:20,623
Mr. Zampano, Mr. Darius, all of you...

211
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,668
Dad...

212
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,295
Welcome back.

213
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,551
I'm home.

214
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,929
It's so warm.

215
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,932
Al...

216
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,809
Alphonse!

217
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,935
May!

218
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,938
I was... I was...

219
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,944
Oh, right, sorry. That was
a hard thing to put you through.

220
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,030
Thanks, May.

221
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,412
<i>Listeners of Radio Capital,</i>

222
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,457
<i>today, a force led by General Armstrong
</i><i>and Colonel Mustang</i>

223
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,961
<i>took control of the Central
</i><i>Command Center and the Assembly.</i>

224
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,504
<i>This was done to put a halt</i>

225
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,965
<i>to the actions of the military's
</i><i>senior staff.</i>

226
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,301
<i>They were undertaking
</i><i>a large-scale alchemic experiment,</i>

227
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,220
<i>which would have sacrificed
</i><i>the majority of the nation's population.</i>

228
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,724
<i>Two of the masterminds behind
</i><i>this nefarious experiment,</i>

229
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,852
<i>who took advantage of
</i><i>His Excellency the Fuhrer's absence,</i>

230
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,605
<i>General Cremin and General Edison,
</i><i>have been arrested,</i>

231
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,609
and the forces led by the two generals
have been disarmed.

232
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,987
<i>His Excellency, Fuhrer King Bradley</i>

233
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,701
<i>and his dear son Selim lost their
</i><i>precious lives amid the turmoil.</i>

234
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,415
<i>Colonel Mustang announced that he
</i><i>would carry on the Fuhrer's wishes</i>

235
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,375
<i>by maintaining the nation's security</i>

236
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,504
<i>and conferring with all those
</i><i>taking policy measures hereafter.</i>

237
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,514
You are the one who gave me blood, right?

238
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,435
Don't you want freedom and rights,

239
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,812
Hohenheim?

240
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,815
Okay then, what do you find happiness in?

241
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,028
Well, I don't want to ask too much,

242
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:18,574
but I think I would be happy
if I could leave this flask.

243
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:27,708
You're right, Dwarf in the Flask,
Homunculus.

244
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,879
You were born of my blood.

245
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,633
I...

246
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,722
Mr. Hohenheim...

247
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,935
Your sons have both been
admitted to the hospital.

248
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,230
Ah, thanks. I'm grateful.

249
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,483
No, I am the one who is grateful.

250
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:01,033
Without those two boys,
Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric,

251
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,120
this nation would be no more.

252
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,996
Thank you very much.

253
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,630
Thanks.

254
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,218
I'm home, Trisha.

255
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,560
Edward called me "father."

256
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,314
Though he did say "rotten" before it.

257
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,821
I always thought that living
so much longer than others

258
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,991
was a hard thing to bear.

259
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,119
But after coming across you and our sons,

260
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,332
I've sincerely come to feel
happy to be alive.

261
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,752
It has been a fulfilling life.

262
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,840
Yes, it has been enough.

263
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,594
Thank you, Trisha.

264
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,309
Ah, but still...

265
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,104
Sure enough, I don't want to die.

266
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:59,026
There really is no help for me, huh?

267
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,744
Hohenheim!

268
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,164
Oh, you came back, did you?

269
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,755
You imbecile.

270
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,009
What a happy look on your face
to die with.
