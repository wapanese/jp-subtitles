1
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,771
Exposure?

2
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,773
Yes, what we call chilblains.

3
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:50,360
You were this close to getting frostbite.

4
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,447
If you walk around
out in a snowstorm for a long time,

5
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,491
the flesh that is in contact
with your automail will get frostbitten.

6
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,745
Also, if you don't switch out
your lubricant, you won't move as well.

7
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,373
That Buccaneer guy's
automail is different?

8
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,169
It's no use, Doc! This head is stuck
so tight, I can't get it out.

9
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,920
My head!

10
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:15,177
Up here, your automail has
to be flexible and lightweight,

11
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,138
as well as being resistant to the cold.

12
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,141
After some trial and error,
we came up with this automail,

13
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,936
a combination of duralumin,
carbon fiber, nickel, copper, and so on.

14
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:32,110
Usually, you'd think it's just iron.
No wonder I couldn't destroy it.

15
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:36,323
Hey, Doc, you're not planning
on telling him everything, are you?

16
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:41,328
Oh, why not?
This is an esteemed State Alchemist.

17
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,579
For real?

18
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,582
He's got the silver pocketwatch.

19
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,753
<i>This kid is the equivalent of a major?</i>

20
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,465
If you're planning on staying
in the north long,

21
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,927
change your automail
to a cold-weather regional model.

22
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,762
Do you have your own mechanic?

23
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,348
She's in Rush Valley.

24
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,225
She let her customer come up north

25
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,602
without explaining this,
or providing you with a replacement?

26
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,898
No, I didn't tell her
I was coming up north.

27
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,527
If you want to stay alive,
have her provide you with a replacement,

28
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,903
even if she has to come here.

29
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,908
- Okay.
- That will be 100 cens for the coffee.

30
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,786
<i>That was downright dirty.</i>

31
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,080
It's not even as good
as the Eastern Command Center's.

32
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,165
It's your own fault
for letting your guard down.

33
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:32,462
So, what are you doing here,
with your normal automail,

34
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,297
unaccompanied, and bypassing
the command center?

35
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,884
I even brought a letter
from Major Armstrong,

36
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,678
asking for your help!

37
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,638
That lady general wouldn't
even listen to me,

38
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,892
and said she would yank out my antenna--

39
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,394
You called, little red runt?

40
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,230
- Little red...
- What is it?

41
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,150
If you've got a problem with me,
speak up!

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,401
My hair!

43
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,910
This looks lame.

44
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,046
So then, I've heard that you two are close
to my brother Alex.

45
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,048
Is he doing all right?

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,386
- Yeah.
- He's just as muscle-bound as ever.

47
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,555
He's as healthy as can be!

48
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,976
No matter, never mind him.

49
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,480
Tell me why you would bypass
the command center to meet me.

50
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,108
Tell me everything, including the reason
why your armor is empty.

51
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,739
That's something
we'd prefer not to have others hear about.

52
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,574
There's nothing to be anxious about.

53
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
The folks here have all sorts of things
to hide.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,789
Having things we'd prefer not
to have others hear about isn't unusual.

55
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:53,293
But if this gets out,
it could get me court-martialed.

56
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,670
I've done some things like that myself.

57
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,924
Brother, a moment?

58
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,384
I think we have to tell her,
or else she won't tolerate us.

59
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,137
But Winry is a hostage.

60
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,558
All right, let's do this so as not
to mention the Führer or Homunculi.

61
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,686
What are you talking about?
Get on with it!

62
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,690
Okay, let's go with us being
on a journey to get back our bodies.

63
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,786
I see. So that's why
you're looking for this girl

64
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,913
with the black-and-white cat, is it?

65
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,916
Understood.

66
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,292
So will you work with us?

67
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,379
I understand
that you are a couple of butterfingers,

68
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,339
who don't think about anything too deeply,

69
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,967
and spread trouble around
with your careless actions!

70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,844
I don't want anyone like that
inside my citadel.

71
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,845
Honest to goodness,

72
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,975
how can the folks in Central
let these two run around loose?

73
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,101
Get out of here, this instant!

74
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,234
Or so I'd like to say,
but I'm interested in alkahestry.

75
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,405
You two are acquaintances
of this alkahestry girl, right?

76
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,365
Yeah, I guess.

77
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,868
It's a technique not found
in this country, I want it.

78
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,413
<i>You can never have too many techniques,</i>

79
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,875
<i>especially here in this land,
</i><i>where we adjoin the great Drachma.</i>

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,713
Depending on how it's used,
alkahestry could be a fine weapon.

81
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,381
Wait, just a minute, please!

82
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,884
Alkahestry is an art specialized
for the medical field. For you to--

83
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:30,098
Silence! You're just dogs,
yapping within the country's interior!

84
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,267
Don't forget that your peace
and security is protected

85
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,313
by those of us
who are here on the borders.

86
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,732
I am the one who draws
the national border in the north.

87
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,444
I will take any technique I can,
if it will help me.

88
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,824
Let me take care of finding
the alkahestry girl.

89
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,659
You two stay inside the fort.

90
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,997
- Also, Major Miles...
- Yes, sir!

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,624
Put them to work.

92
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,586
"If man will not work, he shall not eat."

93
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,589
You have a point.

94
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,594
Those two have had quite
a hard life.

95
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,180
They seem moderately acquainted
with scenes of carnage,

96
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,142
but I can tell that on the inside,
they are still soft.

97
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,894
And another thing...

98
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,606
I can tell that they have a secret
that they can't tell us.

99
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,284
Say, what kind of work
are you going to give us?

100
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,332
When she said the folks here
have all sorts of things to hide,

101
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,541
do you have something too?

102
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,340
It's no fair if you guys ask all
the questions, and never answer any.

103
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,678
You really want to know?

104
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,643
- Red eyes!
- You're Ishvalan?

105
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,894
But how?

106
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,397
We were told that all the soldiers
who came from Ishval were purged

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,650
before the War of Extermination.

108
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,404
I do indeed have Ishvalan blood flowing
through my veins.

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,614
However, my grandmother and my father,
not to mention his wife,

110
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,117
are all of a different race.

111
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,161
The color of my eyes and skin

112
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,247
must be because
my grandfather's blood runs strong.

113
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,087
Amestrisian,
your people really did a number

114
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,505
on my ancestral land of Ishval.

115
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,975
It's you Ishvalans
who burned down our countryside,

116
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,770
and killed the parents of one
of our childhood friends.

117
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,771
Whoa, Brother!

118
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,492
Sorry.

119
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,746
That's just the first time anyone
has ever given a comeback like that.

120
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,665
You were testing me?

121
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,375
That was rude of me.

122
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,255
After the civil war,
I've often been looked upon with pity.

123
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,591
To be honest, I've gotten fed up with it.

124
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,800
But you're different.

125
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:20,060
Well, I've had an Ishvalan try to kill me,
nearly kidnap me and reconcile with me.

126
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,812
So I've had a pretty rich relationship.

127
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:29,569
Besides, people should get beyond race,
and talk to each other as equals.

128
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,208
Major Miles, were you on active duty
during the War of Extermination?

129
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,501
Yeah.

130
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,379
I've been General Armstrong's
adjutant since those days.

131
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,592
The War of Extermination started right
after I was posted here,

132
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:57,138
and many of my relatives, including
my grandfather, were killed in the east.

133
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,559
I was barely outside of the military's
purge terms, so I was spared.

134
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,395
Didn't you hold any grudge
against the military?

135
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,898
You really do ask whatever you like,
don't you?

136
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,736
I can't stand being so ignorant.

137
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,655
If I've offended you, I apologize.

138
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,575
An "ignorant" State Alchemist, huh?

139
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,582
I resented what the military did.

140
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:29,546
Meanwhile, I had doubts as to why
the general kept me on as her adjutant.

141
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,091
By having me,
someone with Ishvalan blood around,

142
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,970
it could have caused discord
among the soldiers here.

143
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,848
So why didn't she get rid of me?

144
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,475
I once came right out
at the general about it.

145
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,606
Briggs here is a land that must not fall,
no matter what happens.

146
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,735
Each of us, down to the last soldier,
must move with strength,

147
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,114
and yet with flexibility, executing
my will as leader in all things,

148
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,492
as one stalwart force.

149
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,371
In short, we have no time
for discrimination.

150
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,209
With the blood of the various peoples
that flows within you,

151
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,544
and their various sets of values,

152
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,047
you are able to see this country
from various different angles.

153
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,926
I was born and raised in Amestris,
and in order for me to be a leader,

154
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,304
I need people like you.

155
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,725
Now shut up and follow me, Miles!

156
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,729
Her words were perfectly rational,
and without deception.

157
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,358
When I asked her, "Even so,
if the Ishvalan blood within me

158
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,945
is unable to forgive what the
military has done, what then?"

159
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,239
What do you think the general said?

160
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,199
Very well. Come at me.

161
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,745
As a representative of the armed forces,
I will accept any challenges at any time.

162
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,289
- That's what she said.
- Wow, what a hellcat.

163
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,250
Did she say it because she had her troops
lined up behind her?

164
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,752
No, she was serious.

165
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,087
I'll kill you one-on-one!

166
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,006
That was the look in her eye.

167
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,264
Do you know what the law is here?

168
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,767
Survival of the fittest?

169
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,480
That's right. Those without power die,
while those with power survive.

170
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,776
That truth never changes,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

171
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,527
It truly is simple.

172
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,363
Be you buck private or top boss,

173
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,449
regardless of race, ethnicity, and sex,
it make no difference.

174
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,790
That was survival of the fittest, as well.

175
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,125
Your luck is strong, so you survived.

176
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:38,549
The icicle scrapers are slacking off.
That's your job now.

177
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,511
I'll tell one of my men to show you inside
once you're done.

178
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,850
Damn, I can't reach.

179
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,477
Huh? It can't be...

180
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,941
- Warrant Officer Falman!
- The Elric brothers!

181
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,609
What are you doing here?

182
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,986
What about you?

183
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,363
I thought you were
at the Northern Command Center.

184
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,867
Yeah, but the Northern Command Center
bumped me up here.

185
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,370
- They made you a 2nd lieutenant!
- Yeah.

186
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,331
Really? Congratulations on the promotion--

187
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,750
So, why are you knocking down icicles?

188
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,337
If you're doing such bottom-rung work,
that means...

189
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,383
...you're off your career track.

190
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,844
Don't say that!

191
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,390
This is the development level.

192
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,934
Wow! What is this?

193
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,437
It was General Armstrong's idea.

194
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,856
They gather the country's
latest technologies

195
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,400
and develop them into weapons.

196
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,362
- Including combat automail?
- Yeah, over here now.

197
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,999
This is Briggs' lowest level.

198
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,503
Sure is warm, not at all like up above.

199
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,548
All the fort's lifelines come
through here.

200
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,550
Even if the fort's upper levels
are attacked,

201
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,261
it's no big deal down here in the heart.

202
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,973
Hey, move it, you're in the way!

203
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,351
- Stop staggering around!
- Sorry.

204
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,230
- Hey, Bobby, over here!
- This pipe here!

205
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,945
This is...

206
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,116
- ...coming from underground.
- What?

207
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,537
It sounds like someone's digging
through the rock...

208
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,792
Don't tell me those Drachma goons
are digging a tunnel under the fort!

209
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,460
It's close!

210
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,004
What a bother...

211
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,841
Ah, what a bother...

212
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,261
It's such a bother, it's killing me.

213
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,390
But dying would be a bother.

214
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,743
Solf J. Kimblee?

215
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,788
He was seriously wounded
on a cargo train headed here,

216
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,707
and was admitted into a hospital
at the base of the mountain.

217
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,794
The full cooperation of the Briggs branch
is requested.

218
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,589
Wasn't the Crimson Alchemist supposed
to be serving time?

219
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,844
Apparently, he was released.
Führer's orders.

220
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,345
I don't like this.

221
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,932
What is it?

222
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,184
We have an intruder from under the ground!

223
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,310
What?

224
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,703
A Homunculus!

225
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,669
<i>Damn, they know
</i><i>that we've come here to find a way</i>

226
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,212
<i>to fight back against the Homunculi?</i>

227
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,268
Don't fall asleep!

228
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,856
What?

229
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,819
Oh, you know, your "Father" in Central
told you about us, right?

230
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:31,240
Yeah, we're just here looking for a way
to get our old bodies back.

231
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,243
Who are you?

232
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:43,503
Dig the hole. What a bother.
Ah, what a bother.

233
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,671
You don't think this guy...?

234
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:50,259
Yes, he might not have heard about us
from Father or the Führer.

235
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:59,268
- So you really are a spy from Drachma!
- You misunderstand!

236
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,854
Then why are you speaking
with the intruder like you know him?

237
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,773
We don't know him!

238
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,942
- Your lies won't fool me!
- This is in my way.

239
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,861
I'm not lying, I tell you! We were just...

240
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,539
This place is big.

241
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,833
Where is this?

242
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,712
Do I not have to dig anymore?

243
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,172
Fire!

244
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,095
The guns have no effect!

245
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,767
Where am I?

246
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,983
This is bad!

247
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,277
He's going up to the development level!
After him!

248
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,444
Contact the development level!

249
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,572
- We're going after him too!
- Investigate the hole he came out of!

250
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,781
There might be others coming through!

251
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,600
He's huge!

252
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,980
It's warm...

253
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:26,981
Don't move!

254
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,074
- Extinguish it.
- Yes, sir!

255
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,462
I know I hit it.

256
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,589
Boss, it's no use!

257
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,967
- Firearms won't work against him!
- What?

258
00:18:56,052 --> 00:19:00,056
All noncombatants, withdraw immediately.
Shut off the alarm too.

259
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,434
Don't let the folks in Drachma
know about this disturbance.

260
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,228
Boss, I brought these!

261
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,481
Have the trial runs been completed?

262
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,816
We don't need them.

263
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,235
These are the development team's
prize babies.

264
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,656
- Remove the fuses from the shells.
- Yes, ma'am.

265
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,209
First round loading complete.

266
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,960
Fire!

267
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,047
Direct hit!

268
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,057
Ouch.

269
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,649
Pain is also a bother.

270
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,445
Don't just sit there, load the next round!

271
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,450
Fire!

272
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,173
Ouch.

273
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,177
Right, back to work.

274
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,098
Dig the hole.

275
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,997
It won't work, General! No matter how
many times you kill him, he won't die!

276
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,790
It won't die?

277
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,502
What do you mean?
How would you know something like that?

278
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,505
Well...

279
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,467
I don't appreciate you acting dim!

280
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,344
Answer as many of my questions as you can!

281
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,264
How do you know about that thing?

282
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,184
- Are you a spy from Drachma?
- No!

283
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,645
- Then is that thing a spy?
- Probably not!

284
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,274
- Does that thing know you?
- Probably not!

285
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,151
What is that thing?

286
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,988
I can't answer that!

287
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,283
- Whose orders is that thing acting on?
- I can't answer that!

288
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,786
Why can't you answer?

289
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,289
You'll have to guess.

290
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:39,256
Last question. Are you on our side here?

291
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,801
I wouldn't want
to see anyone here get killed.

292
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,554
Tell me what that thing is made of.

293
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:51,393
His body's structure and compositional
elements are probably the same as a human.

294
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,395
The same as a human, huh?

295
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,527
Buccaneer, bring me some tank fuel!
We're going to douse it!

296
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,821
- Yes, sir!
- I told you, that won't work, General!

297
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,198
Even if you set him ablaze,
he won't go down that easily!

298
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,284
I learned from that last attack
that we can't kill it.

299
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,412
In which case, we'll just have
to shut down its functions.

300
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,540
We're going to hit it with something
even stronger than fire.

301
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,214
Let me show you the Briggs way.
