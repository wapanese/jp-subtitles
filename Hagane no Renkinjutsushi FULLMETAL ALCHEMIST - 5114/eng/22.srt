1
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>Scar has once again appeared in Central.</i>

2
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,641
<i>Working together with Ling,</i>

3
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,103
<i>Ed and Al intentionally
</i><i>draw Scar's attention</i>

4
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,439
<i>in order to lure out the Homunculi.</i>

5
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,068
<i>The strategy pays off,</i>

6
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,405
<i>and the Homunculi Gluttony
</i><i>and Wrath appear.</i>

7
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>However...</i>

8
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,745
Lan Fan!

9
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,297
You parried with your kunai knife,
did you?

10
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,051
- Can I eat her?
- Do it quickly.

11
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,645
Lan Fan! Stay with me!

12
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,362
Do you think that you can escape
from my eye?

13
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,286
I see you're no stranger to fighting.

14
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:49,294
<i>He's always swinging around to my left,
</i><i>into my blind spot.</i>

15
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,508
- Gluttony!
- Right!

16
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:08,897
Now then, no one will see us in here.
How about answering some of my questions?

17
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:15,278
Who are you people?
How do you know what's inside Gluttony?

18
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,534
Are you still looking for a way
to escape, even now?

19
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,454
You could probably get away on your own,

20
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,290
if you abandoned the girl,
who is now excess baggage.

21
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,292
"Excess baggage"?

22
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:35,424
You're the highest-ranked person
in all the land, right?

23
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,050
FÃ¼hrer King Bradley, wasn't it?

24
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,556
A king is to be for the people.
There is no king without his people!

25
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,811
"King Bradley"!
You will never be a true king!

26
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,731
Naive fool.

27
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,525
There are no true kings in this world!

28
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,740
You rely too heavily on your eyesight!

29
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,203
<i>Judging by the wind currents,
</i><i>the exit is...</i>

30
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,499
What's the matter?

31
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,004
This eye still works!

32
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,972
Winry...

33
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,600
We'll be right back,

34
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,186
so you be a good girl,
and hold things down here for us.

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,370
Winry...

36
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,793
We're here.

37
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>I guess maybe I projected Dad
</i><i>back onto Mr. Hughes.</i>

38
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,455
Come by and visit
every once in a while, okay?

39
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,671
He gets quite lonesome, after all.

40
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,924
Mrs. Gracia...

41
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,660
I hear the Elric brothers
are wreaking havoc.

42
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,120
Huh? Again?

43
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,540
The MPs have been running around
all over the place.

44
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,836
Another fight? Good grief.

45
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,590
They're taking on that one guy
who only targets State Alchemists.

46
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:26,595
- Haven't they caught him yet?
- What is the military waiting for?

47
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,311
Oh, no, why are they overlapping?

48
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,786
A dead end!

49
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,121
Damn it!

50
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,345
Nice one, Brother!

51
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,846
Never mind,
we're getting out of here, quick!

52
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,349
- Permission to fire?
- Not yet!

53
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,935
Damn, why not?

54
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,736
The signal flare from Ling
hasn't been sent up yet.

55
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:30,492
Brother is starting to get tired.
I guess I'll have to buy some time.

56
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,454
Scar, why are you so prejudiced
against alchemists,

57
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,999
saying they've gone against God,
when you use alchemy too?

58
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,419
I thought I told you why in East City.

59
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,381
Where there are creators, like you,
there must also be destroyers.

60
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,674
You're just--

61
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:53,223
you're just using the name of God
to justify your killing!

62
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,227
You also killed Shou Tucker and Nina,

63
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,272
claiming to be an agent of God,
didn't you?

64
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:06,194
Oh, so you saw that Chimera too, did you?

65
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,698
The art that created that tragic creature,

66
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,951
is it the same alchemy that you idolize?

67
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,707
<i>It was your hand that put your brother
</i><i>into that irredeemable body.</i>

68
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,876
It was vanity in the art
of creating something

69
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,715
that brought about that Chimera,
was it not?

70
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:32,137
Even so, why did you have to kill her?
Why did you take her life?

71
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,432
You knew, didn't you,

72
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,018
that the Chimera could never
be returned to normal?

73
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,066
That as it was, it would have been treated
like a laboratory specimen,

74
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,029
and not have been treated as a human
for the rest of its life?

75
00:08:55,118 --> 00:09:00,832
<i>He's right. Back then, we had an inkling
</i><i>somewhere in our minds</i>

76
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,084
<i>that Nina might be sent off
</i><i>to a laboratory.</i>

77
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,088
<i>We put off dealing with the problem
</i><i>because we couldn't do anything about it.</i>

78
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,591
<i>So we did nothing.</i>

79
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,593
<i>Nothing.</i>

80
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,070
It's true, we alchemists
have committed some mistakes.

81
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:35,075
But even so, it doesn't mean
we can accept what you're doing!

82
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,750
Do you remember
an Amestrisian doctor named Rockbell?

83
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,840
Even after the order to exterminate
uprising Ishval came out,

84
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,926
they continued to help the Ishvalans.

85
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,347
- Wait, Brother!
- Don't you remember

86
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,351
the doctor couple that saved you,
and that you killed?

87
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,522
Brother!

88
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,653
What are you talking about?

89
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,322
Winry...

90
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,705
This is the man who killed Mom and Dad?

91
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:30,004
You're kidding.
They were killed by someone they helped?

92
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,511
Why?

93
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,640
What did my mom and dad ever do?

94
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,060
They never did anything

95
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,895
that they deserved
to be killed for, did they?

96
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,651
Give them back!

97
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,405
Give me back my mom and dad!

98
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,169
Hold on, Winry.

99
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,671
Don't. You can't.

100
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,214
Winry!

101
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,841
Don't do it!

102
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>I understand the animosity that you feel.</i>

103
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,851
<i>But vengeance will only cultivate
</i><i>more vengeance.</i>

104
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,984
<i>You must abide this.</i>

105
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,991
You are the doctors' daughter?

106
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,997
You have a right to shoot me.

107
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,547
Brother...

108
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,673
Brother!

109
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,136
Brother, the armed forces are almost here!

110
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,308
- Leave that research alone!
- Wait, I'm almost there.

111
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,312
- What are those tattoos?
- Oh, these?

112
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,817
The basis of alchemy is understanding,
decomposition, and reconstruction.

113
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,072
My right arm decomposes,
and the left arm reconstructs.

114
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,869
Having studied eastern alkahestry,
I arranged them in my own way.

115
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,579
Moreover, I've learned something.

116
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,083
The alchemy of this land is quite unusual.

117
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,294
None of that matters now!
Never mind that, the armed forces are--

118
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,545
Hey...

119
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,468
Why are you stopping me? We must
get away from here as soon as we can!

120
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,428
Please, try to remain calm.

121
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:46,140
Your brother's research
might just save Ishval.

122
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,225
What?

123
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,604
Did you hear about the State Alchemists?

124
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,440
Word is that they are coming in
as weapons,

125
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,651
and overrunning Ishval
with their terrible force.

126
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,113
Even though we are their
fellow Amestrisian citizens.

127
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,991
I knew about that,

128
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,868
but what does it have to do
with my brother?

129
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,206
Your brother will be able to oppose
the State Alchemists.

130
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,126
And with great power beyond even theirs,

131
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,255
he may be able to find a way
to annihilate the military!

132
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,259
Fight power with greater power...

133
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,095
Retaliate against them with alchemy!

134
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,388
Pay them back in blood!

135
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,645
Behold, Brother, this is the alchemy
you devote yourself to.

136
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,149
You may wish that it is for the sake
of others, and for happiness...

137
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,154
...but no one else sees it
that way, do they?

138
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,908
Run!

139
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>So this is alchemy?</i>

140
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,623
<i>This is what is going to save Ishval?</i>

141
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:53,434
<i>This, which does nothing but destroy
</i><i>and slaughter, over and over?</i>

142
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,774
No!

143
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,281
Father! Mother!

144
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,160
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, no trouble.

145
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,288
We're lucky that everyone
was getting ready to flee.

146
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,207
I made it.

147
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,584
It took so long because I was compiling
the important things.

148
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,669
The important things?

149
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,589
- Here, you hold on to this.
- What is it?

150
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,177
My research notes.
This is all I was able to bring.

151
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,471
- Take it and get away from here.
- Hold on a minute.

152
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,684
If anything happens to me,
all of my research will be lost.

153
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,186
You can take it
and run away yourself, right?

154
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,857
You are a superb warrior monk,
who has gone through rigorous training.

155
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,903
You have a higher chance
of surviving than I do.

156
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,906
Look.

157
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,659
I can't stop my legs from shaking.

158
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,412
I'm a pathetic older brother.

159
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,788
Brother...

160
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,545
An armed forces soldier?

161
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,304
Transmutation circles!
He's a State Alchemist!

162
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,068
Get down!

163
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,301
Stay with me. Don't you die.

164
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,060
Damn, I can't stop the bleeding.

165
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,564
His arm, where is my brother's arm?

166
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,069
Dad...

167
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,071
Mom...

168
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,075
Everyone... somebody!

169
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,171
Live! You must not die!

170
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,011
I'll fight! I'll show them Ishval's pride!

171
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,013
Then that's all the more reason
for you to run away!

172
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,141
Right! We didn't treat you
just to let you die!

173
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,602
Doctor, you and your wife
are the ones who should go!

174
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,230
You're a patient.
Don't worry over us unnecessarily.

175
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,482
<i>Brother...</i>

176
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,109
Get down!

177
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,697
<i>That's crazy. You protected me?</i>

178
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,701
<i>Brother...</i>

179
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,121
Anyone who can get away
on their own, start running!

180
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,207
He's coming to!

181
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,670
Don't move. You'll open your wounds.

182
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,464
Honey, come here! Honey!

183
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,176
You still need bed rest.

184
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,889
Somebody! Get that cart!
Take him with you!

185
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,560
<i>Brother?</i>

186
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,315
<i>Ah, thank goodness. Brother, you made it--</i>

187
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,819
What...

188
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,364
What is this?!

189
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,867
- Sedatives!
- There aren't any more!

190
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,369
We used them all up on the last boy!

191
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,211
State Alchemists...

192
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,131
Amestrisians...

193
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,592
You will pay...

194
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,848
You're going to... you're going to...

195
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,850
Dr. Rockbell!

196
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,053
Shoot me.

197
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,765
Don't shoot, Winry! Put the gun down!

198
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,434
You shouldn't be holding
that thing, Winry!

199
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,353
Shoot me!

200
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,147
But if you shoot, in that moment,

201
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,857
I will consider you my enemy!

202
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,025
Scar!

203
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,528
Why, you!
You just try to lay a hand on Winry!

204
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,948
Will you kill me? That will also do!

205
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,284
Until one of us perishes,
this chain of hatred will not cease!

206
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,537
But don't you forget!

207
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,791
It was the Amestrisians who first pulled
the trigger in the civil war!

208
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,043
It was you!

209
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,133
No! Don't shoot him!

210
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,593
Quickly put the gun down,
and get away from here!

211
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,595
Winry!

212
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,599
If you cannot shoot,
then leave this place at once!

213
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,852
You're in the way!

214
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,733
Don't shoot!

215
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,746
Get down!

216
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,250
Brother...

217
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,641
Brother, you dummy! What are you doing?

218
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,271
Are you trying to get both of you killed?
Hurry up and take Winry someplace safe!

219
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,449
Winry, let go of the gun.

220
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,826
I couldn't shoot him.

221
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,162
Don't shoot. I'm begging you.

222
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,667
But he's the one who killed Mom and Dad.

223
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,170
He tried to kill you and Al too, Ed.

224
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,673
And yet, why couldn't I?

225
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,431
You delivered that baby in Rush Valley,
saving mother and child.

226
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,936
You gave me the arm and leg
that allow me to stand up.

227
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,194
Your hands are not hands that kill others.

228
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,697
They're hands that give life to others.

229
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,575
That's why.
