1
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,721
<i>In search of the secrets
</i><i>of the Philosopher's Stone,</i>

2
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,557
<i>Ed and Al break into the Fifth Laboratory</i>

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>where they encounter people
</i><i>who have had their souls bonded to armor.</i>

4
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>In the midst of their fight,
</i><i>Al begins to have suspicions</i>

5
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>that he might be a counterfeit soul,
</i><i>created by Ed,</i>

6
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:59,953
<i>because of what Number 66 says to him.</i>

7
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,627
I see you're able to sit up now, huh?

8
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,757
- How is the Fifth Laboratory?
- Well, you see...

9
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,218
It was blown up by somebody,
and there's nothing left of it.

10
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,763
Damn it! Everything's been wiped out?

11
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,141
That hurt!

12
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,727
Damn.

13
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,606
I was so close
to getting hold of the truth, too.

14
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,817
This is no time for me
to be in the hospital!

15
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,946
- Fullmetal Alchemist, sir!
- Fullmetal Alchemist, sir!

16
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,115
- We apologize in advance for this!
- We apologize in advance for this!

17
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,501
That was a selfish thing to do!

18
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,420
You could have lost your life in there
if you hadn't been so lucky!

19
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,175
Don't try to do everything
just by yourselves,

20
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,676
turn to those who are around you!

21
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,850
You can put more trust in adults,
you know.

22
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,731
- That is all!
- That is all!

23
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,817
- Please forgive the abusive words
- Please forgive the abusive words

24
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,902
- and conduct unbecoming our rank!
- and conduct unbecoming our rank!

25
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,866
Nah. I'm sorry.

26
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,788
What about censuring me for slapping you?

27
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,748
I wouldn't do anything like that.

28
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,543
Why are you so anxious?

29
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,922
State Alchemists have the military rank
equivalent to major, and all.

30
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:39,261
It's not as though I got
my state certification because of that.

31
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,763
And you don't have to speak
so politely to me, either.

32
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,684
- Oh, really?
- Huh, guess we were worried for nothing.

33
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,060
You sure adjusted fast.

34
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,355
Come to think of it, where's Al?

35
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,152
I gave Alphonse a little lecture earlier,
with my fist.

36
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,075
There's still one more event remaining
where I'm gonna get royally chewed out.

37
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>Yes, Rockbell Prosthetic Limb Outfitter.</i>

38
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,214
Ed? It's pretty unusual for you to call.

39
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,677
Listen, I hate to ask,

40
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,722
but could you come out to Central
on a service call for me?

41
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,350
<i>- Service call?
- Yeah, it's my right arm.</i>

42
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,438
<i>I can move the fingers,
</i><i>but I can't lift the arm at all.</i>

43
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,237
- <i>No dice after all, huh?
- Huh?</i>

44
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,907
<i>Nothing, just talking to myself.</i>

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,534
<i>Did you do anything to it
</i><i>before it stopped working?</i>

46
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,580
I was in an all-out fight.

47
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:53,668
Again?
How can you use my automail for that?

48
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,969
Hello? Winry, ma'am?

49
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,097
<i>Guess I've got no choice, huh?
</i><i>Where in Central?</i>

50
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,644
You sure seem nice today--

51
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,023
I mean, nothing...

52
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,652
Sorry. Thanks for doing this. Bye now.

53
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,115
- Calling your girlfriend?
- Who are you calling my girlfriend?

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,372
- Aw, how dull. Back when I was your age--
- Huh?

55
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,875
What are you doing over there?

56
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,628
Hey, Al!

57
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,381
- Brother.
- Why don't you come to the room?

58
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,891
It's nothing. You go on ahead.

59
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,101
Okay.

60
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,289
Bye-bye!

61
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,338
Are you sure you're not
a suit-of-armor puppet,

62
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,090
created by your so-called brother?

63
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,895
My bottom hurts.
I'm surprised Ed and Al can ride these.

64
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,568
He said there would be a familiar marker
standing at the west exit,

65
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,486
and I would know it right away.

66
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,450
Major Armstrong!

67
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,829
Oh, Miss Winry!

68
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,207
Where are those dumb Elric brothers?

69
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,127
As it happens...

70
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,802
Ed is in the hospital?

71
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,557
That was fast.

72
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,727
Now, you're going to charge me
for express service, right?

73
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,566
Well, I didn't service your automail.

74
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,695
So it broke, and you got yourself
this seriously injured, right?

75
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,202
It's not your fault, Winry.

76
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,956
I caused this by using it
in a reckless way.

77
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,959
Your maintenance was as flawless
as it always is.

78
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,088
<i>He hasn't noticed that I forgot
</i><i>to put in that screw?</i>

79
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,840
Besides, you could say
that because my arm broke,

80
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,842
I got out of it without getting hurt.

81
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,971
Don't worry about it, okay? Okay?

82
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,098
<i>You mean, it turned out all right?</i>

83
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,811
Well then, let's get right
to discussing this service call.

84
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,438
I will be including a rush order fee.

85
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,735
You left your milk.

86
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,489
I hate milk.

87
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,576
You're going to be a beansprout forever
because you keep saying that!

88
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,205
Shut up! If I hate it, I hate it!

89
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,625
You're being inconsiderate, Edward Elric!

90
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,294
Every child drinks it.

91
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,506
If you don't drink your milk,
you won't be popular with the girls.

92
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,258
Al?

93
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,768
Al has been acting weird lately.

94
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,272
Weird how?

95
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,276
It's like there's something bothering him.

96
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,084
<i>Are you sure you're not
</i><i>a suit-of-armor puppet,</i>

97
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,794
<i>created by your so-called brother?</i>

98
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,297
<i>Go ahead and admit it. You'll feel better.</i>

99
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,432
All right, maintenance complete!

100
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:23,897
Oh, you did it!
It's finally fixed. Thank you.

101
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,482
You're welcome.

102
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,986
Yo, Ed! I'm told you invited a girl
into your hospital room,

103
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,196
and you were getting frisky?

104
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:39,704
- She's just my automail mechanic!
- You've seduced your mechanic, have you?

105
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,457
I say one thing,
and you completely turn it around!

106
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:48,463
- Maes Hughes. Pleased to meet you.
- Winry Rockbell.

107
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,508
Are you sure you should be skipping work?

108
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,717
Not to worry.

109
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,762
<i>I gave Sheska some overtime.</i>

110
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,639
You're such a demon.

111
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,018
By the way, I hear you guys aren't going
to be under guard for much longer.

112
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,729
- Really?
- Under guard?

113
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:09,484
Hold on, how much trouble
have you gotten yourself into?

114
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,987
Well, you see...

115
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,492
It's not a big deal!

116
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,504
Right. You two brothers won't talk to me
when I ask anyhow.

117
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,383
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

118
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,428
I have to go find a place to stay tonight.

119
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,390
What?
In that case, come stay over at my place.

120
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,226
- But--
- Don't worry!

121
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,145
My wife and daughter will be delighted.

122
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,021
- No, I--
- All right, let's do it!

123
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,900
- Hold on--
- Come on, come on, let's go!

124
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,862
Hang on!

125
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,371
Congratulations, Elicia!

126
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,837
Mr. Hughes, what is this?

127
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,342
I'm so glad you asked.
Today is Elicia's birthday. That it is.

128
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,094
That it is!

129
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,808
- How old are you now, Elicia?
- Tw--

130
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,477
Three!

131
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,982
How cute!

132
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,655
I've always been with them
ever since we were little,

133
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,199
so they're like brothers to me.

134
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,493
You must always be worried about them,
the way they are.

135
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,995
That's the truth.

136
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,080
On the rare occasion
that they do come back,

137
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,166
his arm will be all busted.

138
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,757
Now that I get called out here,
Ed has been seriously injured,

139
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,009
and Al is upset about something or other.

140
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:05,183
But they won't ever tell me what happened.

141
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,268
It's the same as when they left Resembool.

142
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,773
There wasn't any need to discuss it.

143
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,525
They figured that knowing you, Winry,

144
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,779
you would understand
without them saying anything.

145
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,619
But there are some things
that don't get across

146
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,162
unless you say them out loud.

147
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,958
What am I going to do with you?

148
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,004
Men are creatures that let their actions
speak louder than words.

149
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,923
When they're in pain,

150
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,759
they don't want to burden anyone else,
if they can help it.

151
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,846
They don't want to make others worry,
that's why they don't say anything.

152
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,104
Even so, when those brothers
do give in and cry for help,

153
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,107
that's when you make sure
to be receptive to them.

154
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,943
Isn't that good enough?

155
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,657
Elicia, let's play.

156
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,368
- I want down!
- Okay, there you go.

157
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:11,082
No way, Elicia is gonna play with me!

158
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,877
- Your daughter is quite popular.
- No, with me.

159
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,257
Hey, you kids!
You try anything funny with my daughter,

160
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,092
and you'll pay for it!

161
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,635
Your actions are speaking too loudly!

162
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,475
<i>Are you sure?</i>

163
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,979
You're welcome to stay with us
for as long as you're here.

164
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,898
I couldn't be so presumptuous.

165
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,820
She's gotten completely attached to you.

166
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,199
Looking at you like this,
it's just like you're sisters.

167
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:49,620
Sissy, be safe out there.
Come back soon, okay?

168
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,623
I guess that settles
where you're staying tonight.

169
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm so glad I found a little sister.

170
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,307
You're here again today,
are you, you bastard?

171
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,395
Brother, you have a living body,

172
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,065
so you have to drink it.

173
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,778
If I hate it, I hate it.

174
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,113
It may not look like it,
but I have grown some.

175
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,532
And yet everyone calls me shorty, short.

176
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,118
I wish I were like you, Al.

177
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,289
Your body as big as it is...

178
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,086
I didn't get this body because I want it!

179
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,717
Sorry. You're right.

180
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,428
It's my fault you ended up like this, too,
isn't it?

181
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,972
That's why I want to get you back
in your original body.

182
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,725
Can you guarantee that you'll ever really
get my original body back?

183
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,439
- I'll get you back. Believe me!
- Believe you?

184
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,692
What am I supposed to believe,
when I'm in this hollow body?

185
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:06,114
I mean, when you boil it down,
memories are just a bunch of information.

186
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,200
It should also be possible
to artificially construct them!

187
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,160
What are you talking about?

188
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,620
Brother, you told me before

189
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,997
that there was something you were
too afraid to talk to me about, right?

190
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,170
Was it, by any chance,
that my soul and my memories,

191
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,966
are both really counterfeits
that you just invented?

192
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,720
And that Winry, you and Granny...

193
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,516
are all trying to fool me, aren't you?

194
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,935
How about it, Brother?

195
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,942
Did you have that pent up all this time?

196
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,949
Is that everything you wanted to say?

197
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,206
Okay.

198
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,135
Ed...

199
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,470
Ed!

200
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,266
Al, you...

201
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,268
Idiot!

202
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,772
Where did that suddenly come from?

203
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,199
- Winry?
- Al, you dummy!

204
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,326
You have no idea how Ed feels!

205
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,121
You know what Ed was so afraid
to talk to you about?

206
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:42,126
Whether or not you resent him
for what happened!

207
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,007
It's all... my fault.

208
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:54,514
He can no longer eat or sleep
or feel pain.

209
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,517
I'm sure he must resent me for that.

210
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,978
Al is not the sort of boy
who would resent you.

211
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,522
Ask him, and you'll see.

212
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:08,277
I'm too afraid...
I'm too afraid to ask him.

213
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,619
And... and yet you just had to...

214
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,373
In what world do you find someone so dumb

215
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:25,002
that he's prepared to give his own life
to create a fake brother?

216
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:31,384
You two brothers are all you've got,
aren't you?

217
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,889
Now, go after him!

218
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,103
- Run!
- Right!

219
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,537
- Broth--
- Come to think of it,

220
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,708
we haven't sparred in a while,
and I'm starting to get flabby.

221
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,759
Huh? Hey--

222
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,555
Just a minute, Brother!

223
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,099
Wait!

224
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,894
You're gonna open your wounds up!

225
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,194
I won!

226
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,489
That's the first time
I've ever beaten you!

227
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,955
- No fair, Brother.
- Shut up! A win is a win!

228
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,502
We've fought a lot,
ever since we were little, huh?

229
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,341
Thinking back on it now,
we fought over some stupid things.

230
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,135
Like who got the top or bottom
of the bunk beds.

231
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,012
Yeah.

232
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,974
- We even fought over candy, huh?
- And we squabbled over that toy.

233
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,061
I won that one. And when we were playing
at Rain River, too.

234
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,355
I got pushed into the river, didn't I?

235
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,482
We fought while we were training,
too, huh?

236
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,485
Teacher told us we were
making too much noise,

237
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,820
and beat us half to death.
That one was a draw.

238
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,990
We even fought over which one of us
was going to marry Winry.

239
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:22,953
- I don't remember that!
- I won. But then she shot me down.

240
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,039
Oh, yeah?

241
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,966
And you're telling me those were all lies.

242
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,385
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,680
You're saying that your feeling
of wanting to get your body back,

244
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,474
no matter what it takes, is also fake?

245
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,935
- It's not fake.
- That's right.

246
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,897
The two of us decided
that we'd get back to normal together.

247
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,316
We're gonna keep on pushing forward.

248
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,154
Push forward, and make our hearts
and fighting skills stronger.

249
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,951
- What about the milk?
- I'll drink... as much as I can.

250
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,871
Let's go get much, much stronger.

251
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,333
Mr. Hughes,

252
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,337
there are some things that do get across
without saying them out loud, huh?

253
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,841
There sure are.

254
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,193
My brother...

255
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,112
Master...

256
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,864
Where are you all?

257
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,282
Hey.

258
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,327
You're not Ishvalan, are you?

259
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,290
Oh, pardon me,
we haven't had the pleasure yet.

260
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:54,795
I am the State Alchemist
in charge of exterminating this sector.

261
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,722
You're awake.

262
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,519
- Where am I?
- A slum, just outside of East City.

263
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:18,110
- Old man, who are you?
- An Ishvalan, just as you are.

264
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,822
Relax, we will not sell out
one of our own.

265
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,826
Then there are other
Ishvalan survivors here?

266
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:32,750
Yes, indeed there are.
You can say, "there's no place like home,"

267
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,460
even here, where it reeks of soot.

268
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,839
But the whole world
is the bosom of our god, Ishvala.

269
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,302
You don't say.

270
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,887
Don't force yourself.

271
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,307
You're injured all over,
and were floating down in the sewers.

272
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:02,822
- Say, is my right arm still attached?
- Yeah, it's still there.

273
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,786
This tattoo sure is awesome.

274
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:16,293
Yeah. It's a precious bond I got...

275
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,878
from my family.
