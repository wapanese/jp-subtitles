00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,670
<i>Alchemy is the science
</i><i>of understanding, decomposing,</i>

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>and reconstructing matter.</i>

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,259
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,596
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,643
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>Alchemists have a taboo
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

8
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

9
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,466
FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,918
Brother.

11
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,130
What do you think about the stories
of this priest in Liore?

12
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,632
About his miraculous works?

13
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,178
They say he can transmute flowers
out of thin air, right?

14
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,474
- It could just be simple sleight of hand.
- Supposing it's not, though.

15
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:25,312
Yeah, supposing it's not,
then it just might be, huh?

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,484
"The celestial stone
that destroyed Xerxes in one night.

17
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,321
The grand elixir, sealed away
by the Eastern Sage.

18
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,867
It goes by different names, but in short,
it's something that intensifies alchemy.

19
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,994
That's the Philosopher's Stone."

20
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:46,541
If I only had that, I might be able
to get your body back, Al.

21
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,753
Damn! Write more information about it,
will you?

22
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,173
- Al...
- What?

23
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,509
I sure hope this is it this time.

24
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,719
Yes, that's right.

25
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,638
RESEMBOOL, 10 YEARS EARLIER

26
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,516
<i>Ed! Al! Where are you?</i>

27
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,521
Oh, my. Messing up your dad's study again?

28
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,441
No, you mustn't scribble there like that.

29
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,403
It's not scribbling! Watch.

30
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,865
That's alchemy, right?

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,119
Did your dad teach you that?

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,663
How can we learn anything
from someone who's not here?

33
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,957
We read the book,
and it was written in there.

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,250
It was written in there?

35
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,255
- Should we not have done it?
- Not at all!

36
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,341
Amazing! You are your father's sons,
all right!

37
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,135
Your mom is proud of both of you.

38
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,680
<i>Mom praised us.</i>

39
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,142
<i>We were so happy about that,
</i><i>that we became caught up in alchemy.</i>

40
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:51,231
<i>But the summer of that year,
</i><i>there was an epidemic,</i>

41
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,150
<i>and Mom passed away.</i>

42
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,655
Brother, I'm hungry.

43
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,160
It's cold. Let's go home.

44
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,040
- Once Dad comes home...
- Don't you talk about him!

45
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,626
That guy is not our dad!

46
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,421
He didn't even come home
for Mom's funeral.

47
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,057
I wonder if we can bring Mom back.

48
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,352
But it was written in that book
that creating people

49
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,896
is something you're not allowed to do.

50
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,608
That's why it will be our secret.

51
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,320
- You're here again.
- What do you want, Winry?

52
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,616
Grandma says that every time
you think of a dead person and cry,

53
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,453
the more tears you shed, the more the dead
person in the next world feels sad, too.

54
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,247
We're not crying!

55
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,086
What about you? Your mom and dad
are always out somewhere,

56
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,713
and you cry because you miss them.

57
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,216
I don't cry!

58
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,012
- Are you sure?
- I was worried about you for nothing.

59
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,515
If you're slower than me,
you don't get any supper!

60
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:11,603
- What's that for? Wait up!
- Wait!

61
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,855
<i>I gratefully accept this meal.</i>

62
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,109
Come on, Ed, you drink your milk, too.

63
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,071
I hate milk.

64
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
If you don't drink it, you'll stay short.

65
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,699
Who are you calling a runt,
you sawed-off old hag!

66
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,743
What was that, you little bean sprout?

67
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,204
- Minimum hag!
- Micro-peewee!

68
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,623
- Baby-ant-sized!
- Atom-sized!

69
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,796
You're reading a book
that's not from school again.

70
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,383
- You have to listen in class.
- Leave us alone.

71
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,134
Say, what sort of book are you reading?

72
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,097
- It's a secret.
- It's none of your business, Winry.

73
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,015
No fair! You two always keep secrets
between yourselves.

74
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,435
Bye, now.

75
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,650
Ed! Al! We're going to be having
stew tonight!

76
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,487
- All right!
- Yeah, see you later!

77
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,491
You know something,
whoever invented stew is great.

78
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,994
It even has milk in it,
and it still tastes so good.

79
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,370
What do you mean by that?

80
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,082
The idea of sticking milk
into vegetable soup is amazing.

81
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,461
A scientist needs those kinds of leaps
of imagination, too.

82
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,838
Maybe you're right.

83
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,841
Sure I am! I'm sure a leap of imagination

84
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,843
is what we need
for human transmutation, too.

85
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,433
<i>From then on, we looked into what we would
</i><i>need to perform human transmutation,</i>

86
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,935
<i>to bring Mom back to life,</i>

87
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,106
<i>and honed our skills
</i><i>under an alchemy teacher.</i>

88
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:43,236
<i>It took years and years,
</i><i>but we wanted to see Mom's smile,</i>

89
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,239
<i>and we wanted to live happily with Mom.</i>

90
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,742
<i>With those thoughts in mind.</i>

91
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,629
Done.

92
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,052
Water, 35 liters; Carbon, 20 kilograms;

93
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:11,056
Ammonia, four liters; Lime, 1.5 kilograms;

94
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,060
Phosphorus, 800 grams; Salt, 250 grams;

95
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,813
Saltpeter, 100 grams; Sulfur, 80 grams;

96
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,902
Fluorine, 7.5 grams; Iron, five grams;
Silicon, three grams.

97
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531
All right, now to write
the construction formula.

98
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,745
Now, we just need some soul data.

99
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,085
Here we go, Al.

100
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,807
Brother, there's something strange here.

101
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,482
Al!

102
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,448
- It can't be... a rebound?
- Brother!

103
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,244
Brother! Brother! Brother!

104
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,873
- Al!
- Brother!

105
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:28,758
- Al? What was I doing again?
- Hey.

106
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,639
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm glad you asked that.

107
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,435
I am what you call the world.

108
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,438
Or perhaps the universe, or perhaps God,

109
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,276
or perhaps truth,
or perhaps all, or perhaps one,

110
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,445
and I am also you.

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,911
Welcome, you stupid fool,
who doesn't know his own place.

112
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,712
Pipe down.
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

113
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,217
I will show you the truth.

114
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,438
<i>It was like a tremendous amount
</i><i>of information</i>

115
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,191
<i>was being stuffed directly into my head.</i>

116
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,443
Stop! My head's gonna split open!

117
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,283
I'm being broken down...

118
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:40,205
No, stop it! Stop!

119
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,374
<i>It felt like my head
</i><i>was going to burst open.</i>

120
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>But then suddenly, I understood.
</i><i>This was truth.</i>

121
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,924
Mom...

122
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,390
How was it?

123
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,817
Yeah. My theory of human transmutation
was wrong.

124
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,152
But it's missing something.

125
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,908
What I seek was just ahead...
The truth about human transmutation!

126
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,161
- Please, show it to me again!
- I can't.

127
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,916
I can only show you this much
for the toll you've paid.

128
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,795
- Toll?
- Yes, toll.

129
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,471
It's an equivalent exchange,
right, Alchemist?

130
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,692
Damn! This can't be happening!

131
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,695
It wasn't... It wasn't supposed to...

132
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,324
Damn it all! It's been taken away!

133
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:04,497
Help. Someone... Mom...

134
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,332
Mom...

135
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:25,310
No, this is wrong. This isn't...

136
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,103
This isn't what we wanted!

137
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,149
Alphonse...

138
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,861
Alphonse! Alphonse!

139
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,863
This is my fault.

140
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,489
Alphonse!

141
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,952
Damn it! Damn it!

142
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,205
Give him back. He's my brother.

143
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,835
Take my leg! Take my arm!

144
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,507
Take my heart! You can have it!
So give him back! He's my only brother!

145
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,265
Yo, are you still in Central?

146
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,519
Luckily, I'll be able to go back
to the Eastern Command Center.

147
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,939
Aren't you the hard worker?

148
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,525
Next time you come here, see to it that
you've made brigadier general, Colonel.

149
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,569
Easy for you to say.

150
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,074
Oh, right. If you're leaving,
I'll give this to you now.

151
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,536
- What is it?
- The final report on Isaac McDougal.

152
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,332
It probably hasn't reached
your office yet.

153
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,750
Yeah.

154
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,048
- Xingese alkahestry?
- Apparently, that's something they have.

155
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,134
To be honest, I have no idea what it is.
Do you know it?

156
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,053
No, first I've heard of it.

157
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:47,809
- By the way, how are the Elric brothers?
- I'm not their guardian.

158
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,690
Hey, why did you decide to make Ed
a State Alchemist?

159
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,858
He's still just a child.

160
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:02,240
As long as he's in the military,
he'll end up having to go through hell.

161
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,992
Like we did.

162
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,665
<i>Hell, huh?</i>

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,171
<i>Oh, they've seen hell.
</i><i>Both of them, and plenty of it.</i>

164
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,051
4 YEARS EARLIER

165
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,434
Lt. Colonel, they're not in the back
eith-- What is this?

166
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,855
Where are they?
Where are the Elric brothers?

167
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,526
Be quiet, Den.

168
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,988
Don't bark at our guests. Wha-- Hey, you!

169
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,657
What are soldiers bursting in here for?

170
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,415
We went to your house.
What was that over there?

171
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,292
What did you make?

172
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,799
We're sorry. Please forgive us.

173
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,303
We're sorry. We're sorry.

174
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,932
- We're sorry.
- You're...

175
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>This is a surprise.</i>

176
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,398
I had heard that there was a brilliant
alchemist here, so I came to see him,

177
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,817
but I never imagined
that a child like this

178
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,986
could ever perform human transmutation,
imperfect though it was,

179
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,074
and even bond a soul.

180
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,203
He is more than qualified
to become a State Alchemist.

181
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,539
Once he becomes a State Alchemist,

182
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,085
he will have to serve as a soldier
in the event of an emergency,

183
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,713
but at the same time, he will
receive various special privileges,

184
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,007
and research of the highest level
will become possible for him.

185
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,886
They may even find a way
to get their bodies back, or...

186
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,225
After he came stumbling in here,
covered with blood,

187
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,478
I went over to their house.

188
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,563
What was there...

189
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,025
What was there was not human.

190
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,570
Is alchemy what created
that horrific thing?

191
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,490
I'm against it.

192
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,660
Would you have these boys
go through hell again?

193
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,037
Here you are.

194
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,873
Thanks.

195
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,674
Lieutenant?

196
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,302
You can call me Riza Hawkeye.
Nice to meet you.

197
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,437
Miss Riza, have you ever shot anyone?

198
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,815
Yes.

199
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,318
I hate soldiers.

200
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:49,198
My mother and father were taken away
to the battlefield and were killed there.

201
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:55,079
And now, you're trying
to take Ed and Al away, too.

202
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:59,959
It's up to them to decide
whether or not they will go.

203
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,962
Yes, they will decide for themselves.

204
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,091
I'm not forcing you.
I'm just offering you the possibility.

205
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,218
Whether to move forward
or whether to stay still.

206
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,471
Will you end your days in despair?

207
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,724
Or will you seek the possibilities
and bow to the military?

208
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,977
The boys will be the ones to decide.

209
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,773
If the possibility is there,
you should move forward

210
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,859
in order to get your bodies back.

211
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,237
Even if the way ahead
is through a river of mud.

212
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,163
Miss Riza, why did you become a soldier?

213
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,960
Because there is someone
I have to protect.

214
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,175
- We're leaving.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,931
Well, goodbye, young lady.

216
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,934
It's Winry.

217
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,812
Okay, Winry.

218
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,441
I hope we'll meet again.

219
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,069
Will they be coming?

220
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,154
Yes, they will.

221
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,698
That boy had a spiritless look in his eye.

222
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,700
You think so?

223
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,080
Those... were eyes that had flame in them.

224
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:30,466
- Sure you won't regret this?
- Yes, I've already made up my mind.

225
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,719
How long will the surgery
and rehabilitation take?

226
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,596
About three years.

227
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,600
One year.

228
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,229
You're gonna be spitting blood.

229
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:50,486
Al, hang in there for a little while.
I'm going to get you your body back.

230
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,614
Yes, and when that happens, Brother,
your body will be with it.

231
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,840
Your body is perfect now.

232
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,261
Yeah! Now for the alchemy.
I haven't used it since then, after all.

233
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,515
Right, not since you transmuted my soul.

234
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,857
- Brother...
- Yeah, right on the money.

235
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,234
Amazing, Brother. You didn't even use
a transmutation circle.

236
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,113
You've gotten so you can do the same thing
that Teacher does.

237
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,992
- Al, you can do it too, right?
- No, I can't, Brother.

238
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,581
- You didn't see it?
- See what?

239
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,750
Nothing, never mind.

240
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,212
Hey! You've deformed my automail!

241
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,882
Does that make it okay for you
to deform my head?

242
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,637
Good grief, you are one
uncharming gearhead.

243
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,183
I'm okay with being uncharming.
I'm okay with being a gearhead.

244
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,021
I've made up my mind to support you
until you get your body back.

245
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,362
It's unusual for you
to observe the examinations.

246
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,282
Oh, but I heard there would be
a 12-year-old child here.

247
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,285
I thought I would come see
what the topic of conversation was.

248
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,914
A steel prosthetic, huh?

249
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
In the Eastern Rebellion...

250
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,047
You had a time of it in Ishval, then.

251
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,757
Who's that?

252
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,009
You idiot, that's His Excellency,
Fuhrer King Bradley.

253
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,015
Okay, begin the examination.

254
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,895
Do you have something to draw
transmutation circles with?

255
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,647
I don't need anything like that.

256
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,489
He's not even using
a transmutation circle.

257
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,544
That's quite something.

258
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,880
Excellency!

259
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,514
There might be those out there
who would assassinate VIPs like this,

260
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,351
so maybe you should reconsider
how you conduct examinations.

261
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,735
You must have nerves of steel.

262
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,529
But you do not know the breadth
of the world.

263
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:49,498
Good luck on the rest of your exam,
my overly young alchemist.

264
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,294
When did he draw his sword?

265
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,092
I wonder if Brother is doing all right
on his exam.

266
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,139
- Say, Al...
- What?

267
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:10,728
If Ed becomes a State Alchemist,
are you leaving the village?

268
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,903
<i>This is proof of your state certification:
</i><i>a silver pocket watch.</i>

269
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,070
EAST CITY, EASTERN COMMAND CENTER

270
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:24,074
Your certificate of appointment
and detailed regulations are here.

271
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,911
The Fuhrer has given you
quite the ironic title.

272
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,414
- What?
- Nothing. Congratulations.

273
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,583
You are hereby an official
Dog of the Military.

274
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:38,255
"In the name of Fuhrer King Bradley,
I appoint thee, Edward Elric..."

275
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:43,844
<i>...to be a State Alchemist,
</i><i>and grant the title, "Fullmetal".</i>

276
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,347
Fullmetal?

277
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:52,478
Yes, it's a second name
given to State Alchemists.

278
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,190
The name that you now bear is
the Fullmetal Alchemist.

279
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,319
Nice, it has an oppressive feel to it.

280
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,364
Sure, I'll take that on.

281
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,037
Brother, we're just about there.

282
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,794
Liore?

283
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>Will there be any leads
</i><i>to getting Al's body back in that town?</i>

284
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,051
The Philosopher's Stone.
