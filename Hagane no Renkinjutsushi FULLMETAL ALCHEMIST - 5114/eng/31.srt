1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,257
Vengeance... Damn it!

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,469
It's Scar! He knows
about Marcoh's involvement

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,304
in the War of Extermination, does he?

4
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,525
If I get any new information,
I'll let you know.

5
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,697
Being the Führer's assistant
is like being a hostage, right?

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,657
Will you be okay?

7
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,492
If you think about it positively,

8
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,787
it also means that given a chance,
I can kill the Führer while he sleeps.

9
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,914
You scare me.

10
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:09,296
Oh, right. Give the colonel a message.
Tell him Scar is still on the prowl.

11
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,298
You got it.

12
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,970
- Lieutenant...
- What?

13
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,309
Thanks for telling me about Ishval.

14
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,026
Al!

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,613
Brother! What is it?

16
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,953
So, that's what happened in Ishval, huh?

17
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,998
She described everything about it,
to a kid like me.

18
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,586
"Alchemists are seekers of truth."

19
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,715
But I didn't even know
about something so near at hand.

20
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,177
The colonel is thinking about what happens
after he attains his goal.

21
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,099
After he attains his goal, huh?

22
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,561
Al, after you get your original body back,
what do you want to do?

23
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:12,859
Let's see... First, I guess I want to eat
some of Winry's apple pie.

24
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,530
What about you, Brother?

25
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,536
I've had my hands full just trying to have
our original bodies back, so...

26
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,125
First thing I might do is go around
and pay some courtesy calls

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,086
to Granny and Teacher,
and tell them, "We're back!"

28
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah, after all they've done to help us.

29
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,804
They'll all be smiling when they greet us.

30
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,182
- Yeah.
- We'll get to see everyone smile, right?

31
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,434
Yeah.

32
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,689
The situation is pretty rough right now,
but somehow, I'm starting to cheer up.

33
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,567
There are some cheerful stories
to be had, too.

34
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>Back there, our alchemy didn't work.</i>

35
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,535
<i>At the same time, they apparently
</i><i>couldn't use it above ground, either.</i>

36
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,289
Then, that girl and Scar...

37
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,792
Yeah. They're the only ones
who could use it.

38
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:15,213
There's something about their alchemy.

39
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,008
Something we don't know about.

40
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,219
Yeah. We're not at a dead end yet.

41
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,722
<i>She left?</i>

42
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,849
The little beansprout girl?

43
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,643
<i>Yeah, early this morning.</i>

44
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,813
- So, where did she say she was going?
<i>- She didn't say.</i>

45
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,570
- We'll look for her!
- Throughout Central? Without any clues?

46
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,825
But we do have a clue!

47
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,375
- What's this?
- With my compliments.

48
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,214
Have you got any, you know, magazines,
with lots of girls in them?

49
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:04,179
- Don't go slacking off while we're gone.
- You're leaving already?

50
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,432
Yeah. Gonna get me some
of that famous western food.

51
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,103
Make sure to hold down the fort here.

52
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,231
Yeah. See you later.

53
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,446
You eat well, and grow up
big and strong now.

54
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,952
- Keep everyone safe while we're gone.
- Sergeant Fuery...

55
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,956
- Yo.
- Warrant Officer Falman?

56
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,458
You haven't left yet?

57
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,211
I came to return something
I borrowed from the colonel.

58
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,550
Aw... Sure was a short posting in Central.

59
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,387
Sergeant, you're in the
South Command Center?

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,181
Yes, sir. Completely opposite from you.

61
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,768
I'll bet the Northern Command Center
is cold.

62
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,689
Well, see you later, Sergeant Fuery.

63
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,483
Yes, sir. Let's meet up again sometime.

64
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,409
- Excuse me, Colonel.
- Lieutenant.

65
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,578
I came to get something I left here.

66
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:19,170
- I hear that Scar is still on the prowl.
- I'll have to watch out for him.

67
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,757
I'm losing my skilled bodyguard.

68
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,220
Please don't go dying, sir.

69
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,307
Yeah.

70
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,269
It must make you anxious, huh?

71
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,939
I may have picked the wrong person
to side with.

72
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,820
If you think I'm wrong, shoot me dead.
That's the promise you made that day.

73
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,780
You're still within my threshold.

74
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,575
Lieutenant, you're so nice to me.

75
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,996
Well, Colonel, see you later.

76
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:55,999
Later.

77
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,172
- Please don't let your work slide.
- Yeah.

78
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,186
My pawn...

79
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,064
Oh, you might say it sprang from my house.

80
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,024
My bishop...

81
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,776
Yes, sir! It is an honor!

82
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,195
My rook...

83
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,446
Hello, sir.

84
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,365
My knight...

85
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,993
I'm not all that bright, so I struggle
through the military academy.

86
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,829
And...

87
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,874
Into hell, if you so desire.

88
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,669
My queen has been taken.

89
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,301
But I still haven't been checkmated...

90
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,765
just yet.

91
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,645
Here, this cat! I'm looking for
the little girl who is with her!

92
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,022
So, do any of you recognize her?

93
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,149
I'm sorry.
Please ignore that alien over there.

94
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,410
- No word on that black-and-white cat.
- Maybe they're not in Central anymore.

95
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,413
Fullmetal...

96
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,665
Colonel!

97
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,338
I see... Xingese Alkahestry, huh?

98
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,092
All right. I'll ask around about this.

99
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,471
I really do hate to be
in your debt, Colonel.

100
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,017
Oh, yeah, speaking of debts,
give me back my money.

101
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,518
Watch where you're going!

102
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,940
You remember about that, huh?

103
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,402
How much was it, again? 500 cens?

104
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,989
Five hundred twenty cens!
Don't try wrangling me!

105
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:55,076
What? How nitpicky!
It's not that big a deal!

106
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,453
Sorry about this.

107
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,461
Actually, I'm going to keep
borrowing this.

108
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,047
I'll give it back to you, Colonel,
when you become Führer.

109
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,924
Who told you?

110
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:16,639
<i>Lieutenant Hawkeye.
</i><i>She told me about Ishval, too.</i>

111
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,189
Fullmetal...

112
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,737
You keep that borrowed money.
I'll make sure you return it to me.

113
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,075
Then, once I do, I'll borrow
some more of your spare change.

114
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,453
I'll say, "I'll pay it back once
the country is a democracy."

115
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:43,291
Then, once I return that,
I'll borrow some more.

116
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,961
And make you promise something else.

117
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,129
In other words,

118
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,674
you're telling me that I'm going
to have to live a long time, huh?

119
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,302
That's right. Don't you go
worrying the lieutenant, either.

120
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,308
Thanks for dropping us off.

121
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,149
You're late.

122
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,445
I got tired of waiting for you.

123
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
Yo.

124
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,915
Oh, Roy! Long time!

125
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:28,670
- You're looking well, Vanessa.
- It's been a long time, Roy.

126
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,633
- Good evening, Madam Christmas.
- How have you been?

127
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,845
Oh, absolutely terrible.

128
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,557
- I'm here to lift my mood.
- Want something to drink?

129
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,726
I'm recuperating,
so I can't have any alcohol.

130
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,606
Fix me up something special, Madam.

131
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,609
You got it.

132
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,281
General Grumman, sir...

133
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,576
You have a call
from a Madam Christmas, in Central.

134
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,665
Please, don't go giving out
our secret line to the general public.

135
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,960
Not half bad, huh?

136
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,964
The old man is being called upon.

137
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,972
You lose your arm, you were unable
to protect the young lord...

138
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,474
and now look at you...

139
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,106
Hey, what are you doing?

140
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,817
And you call yourself one
of the chosen ones from the Yao clan?

141
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,321
- You should be ashamed!
- Stop that, old man! She's injured!

142
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,239
Stop it, I said!

143
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,368
It's gone...?

144
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,582
Your arm... is gone...?

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,835
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

146
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,338
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,800
You fool.

148
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,096
You fool!

149
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,899
I have to keep my promise to Lan Fan,
to set her up with an automail mechanic.

150
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,983
You can't.

151
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,613
We accept your kind intentions,
but we need no more of your help.

152
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:23,034
We will find an automail mechanic
on our own somehow.

153
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,203
But we can't just leave you like this.

154
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,290
Now that the enemy
has seen Lan Fan's face,

155
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,876
we cannot allow your friend
to be caught in the middle.

156
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,758
All right. Thanks.

157
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,682
It is thanks to you
that my granddaughter is still alive.

158
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,684
- I am grateful.
- Wha...!?

159
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,561
I'm not the sort of doctor
that gets thank-yous!

160
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,732
Dr. Knocs, thank you very much.

161
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,070
Just get out of here!

162
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:04,242
I'm not such a softy that I'm about
to let you outstay your welcome!

163
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,378
His Majesty's condition appears to be bad.

164
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,422
We must quickly recover the young lord

165
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,426
and return to our country
with the means of attaining immortality.

166
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,761
- Let's go.
- Right.

167
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:38,151
Just you wait, denizens of the underworld.
We will be back.

168
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,887
I will never forget my debt to you
for helping me.

169
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,266
Dr. Knocs, thank you very much.

170
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,606
Me, playing at being a doctor now? Me?

171
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,571
Yeah! Who is it?

172
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,786
Good evening, Dad. It's been a long time.

173
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,748
- How are you doing, dear?
- Fine.

174
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,042
We had an errand that brought us
to the area, so...

175
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:43,091
- You've grown up.
- You've lost some weight, haven't you?

176
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,803
- As have you.
- Is work keeping you busy?

177
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,015
Yeah. Dealing with corpses,
same as always.

178
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:56,229
No, actually, I treated two live patients
just this week.

179
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,900
It's funny, thinking of me, saving lives.

180
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,903
Dad, I want to become a doctor.

181
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,492
I know that you've been tormented,
ever since you got back from Ishval.

182
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,996
Even so, Dad,
you never gave up being a doctor.

183
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,501
I love you, Dad, for being a doctor.

184
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,380
You jackass...

185
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:28,386
Come on in. It may not taste very good
but have some coffee.

186
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>Wow, what a mess!</i>

187
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,440
<i>Come on, let's straighten up
</i><i>while your father is making the coffee.</i>

188
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,363
God, if you're out there,
then let this slide.

189
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:53,161
It's okay for someone like me
to want the happiness

190
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,538
of enjoying some coffee
with his family, right?

191
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:10,553
Now, Ishval is completely
under armed forces jurisdiction.

192
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:15,475
Well done, Major Kimblee.
So, how did the Philosopher's Stone work?

193
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,479
It was fantastic.
By ignoring equivalent exchange,

194
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,106
I was able to perform greater
transmutations than I'd imagined.

195
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,611
Very good. Write up the details
in a report, and submit it to us.

196
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,821
We will be taking the Stone back.

197
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,408
What are you doing, Kimblee?

198
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,620
Now then, you are the only ones

199
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,915
who know the whereabouts
of the Philosopher's Stone, right?

200
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,082
Why, you...!

201
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,797
- What was that?
- What happened?

202
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,882
What's going on?

203
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,193
Come on out, Kimblee.
You're being released.

204
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,491
What is the meaning of this?

205
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:18,037
- Don't ask me any questions.
- Is this an order from above?

206
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,914
Shut up.

207
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,168
How is it that you kill five officers,
and don't get sentenced to death?

208
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,962
What kind of strings did you pull?

209
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,839
None at all. Maybe it's my natural virus.

210
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,801
Don't make me laugh, you mad bomber!

211
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,930
What are the higher-ups thinking,
letting a maniac like you go free?

212
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:48,526
Mr. Jailer, thank you for taking care
of me for this long while.

213
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,779
Don't ever come back here.

214
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,329
Just my way of saying thanks.

215
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:05,626
This isn't... Hold on a second!
Don't do this!

216
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,253
Get this off of me, Kimblee!

217
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,598
It's only a harmless toy. Please,
give it to your child, or something.

218
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,809
Well, farewell.

219
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,943
Now then...

220
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,534
Long time no see, Kimblee.

221
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,831
Congratulations on your release.

222
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:49,378
- It was an order from you guys?
- Yep. We're shorthanded, you see.

223
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,214
You mean, you have a job for me?

224
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,677
Do you remember Doctor Marcoh?

225
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,639
The researcher who created
the Philosopher's Stone?

226
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,724
I remember him well.

227
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,186
Marcoh has run away from us... maybe.

228
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,731
- Maybe?
- We're still not entirely sure.

229
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,235
<i>One of the Chimeras that we had posted
</i><i>as a watchdog is gone.</i>

230
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:19,408
<i>Marcoh is an alchemist
</i><i>who excelled in living transmutations.</i>

231
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,203
It may have taken his place.

232
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,163
And to complicate things,

233
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
there's a possibility that he's fled
with an Ishvalan named Scar.

234
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,379
What do you say, as the
Crimson Alchemist who was ordered

235
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,215
to carry out the extermination of Ishval?

236
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,511
Indeed. If he is an Ishvalan
that I should have bested,

237
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,472
then this is inexcusable.

238
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,685
When you find Scar,
you are free to kill him.

239
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,645
But bring Marcoh back to us.

240
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,023
That is the only reason
why you got me out?

241
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:58,447
Once you nab Marcoh, wipe a town
off the map, to serve as a warning.

242
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:03,327
- It's a great job, isn't it?
- You fight dirty, don't you?

243
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,792
It's been a long time
since I've been able to use this.

244
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,795
That might not be enough
to wipe out a whole town.

245
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,593
What's this?
Did you use more of the Ishvalans?

246
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,764
That was the men who were doing research
on the Stone under Doctor Marcoh.

247
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,309
You really do fight dirty.

248
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,445
Why did you get me out? I...

249
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,574
I still have some questions to ask you...

250
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,201
about the alchemist named Kimblee.

251
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:50,833
I don't understand parts of the research
notes that my brother left me.

252
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,710
Research notes?

253
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,548
Before my brother died, he said,
"This country's alchemy is strange."

254
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,508
He must have written about that
in his notes.

255
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:05,181
You are a shrewd alchemist.
You can make sense of it, right?

256
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,477
This country's alchemy... is strange?

257
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,145
Sir...

258
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,980
The girl has returned to us.

259
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,193
Mr. Scar, you're all right?

260
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,279
Do we have another colleague?

261
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,740
He's not our colleague.
His name is Marcoh.

262
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,242
He's the man who created
the Philosopher's Stone

263
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,620
and took part in the extermination.

264
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,206
The Philosopher's Stone? Immortality!

265
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,668
Mr. Marcoh, you know how
to create a Philosopher's Stone?

266
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,630
How is it done? Please tell me!

267
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,675
- No, it's...
- Stop!

268
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,719
Do not seek that!

269
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,527
I have only destroyed the surface
of your face.

270
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,448
- Stop his bleeding, would you?
- Right.

271
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,659
It will be easier for us
if your face is ruined,

272
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,912
- so people will not know who you are.
- Are you all right?

273
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,957
- We're leaving.
- Where to?

274
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,876
To the place where I hid
the research notes

275
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,753
that I inherited from my brother.

276
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,923
<i>To the north.</i>
