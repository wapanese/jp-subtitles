1
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,968
<i>You're free to shoot everyone
</i><i>but Colonel Mustang!</i>

2
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,695
They're free to shoot everyone
but Colonel Mustang?

3
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,698
They're free to shoot the missus?

4
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,621
<i>Those are words that I wanted to hear.</i>

5
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,080
Have I...

6
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:07,336
I mean, has my husband
been forsaken by this country?

7
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:12,257
Or has my husband forsaken me?

8
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,968
I do not know.

9
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:21,516
However, I promise you,
we will protect your life.

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,811
To prove to you,

11
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:29,524
once everything is over,
that we were not wrong.

12
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,157
Reinforcements coming in! Hurry!

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,868
We've spared your lives.

14
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,579
If we had been Briggs soldiers,
you'd be dead.

15
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,664
What?

16
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,711
Colonel, long time no see.

17
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,340
Good work. Where is General Grumman?

18
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,218
Finishing up with the train accident.

19
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,847
You haven't told the missus
about the Fuhrer going missing?

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,434
No, if she faints or anything,
it will be harder to move her.

21
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,402
This place is teeming with them.
You're quite popular, Colonel.

22
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,945
You got that right.

23
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,577
Haven't you dealt with him yet?

24
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,289
What are you doing?
There are only five of them!

25
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,960
- The enemy force has increased!
- There's a platoon's worth of them now!

26
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,590
- What are our losses?
- Fifty-nine men injured, zero dead.

27
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,218
Zero?

28
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,893
- Damn it! Are you all right?
- Yeah, more or less.

29
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:53,024
That guy's the Flame Alchemist,
a hero of the Ishval Civil War.

30
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,569
But he doesn't seem all that impressive.

31
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,487
You're right.

32
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,031
He's made nothing
but harmless explosions.

33
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,911
Jess! Parky!

34
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,456
Damn, that blew my eardrum out!

35
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,417
- What's the toll?
- Five wounded, none dead!

36
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,962
We're lucky nobody got killed.

37
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,887
They've got both the Hero of Ishval
and the Hawk's Eye.

38
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,973
It's strange that none of our men
have been killed.

39
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,057
Unless...

40
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,734
No doubt about it! They're...

41
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,944
They're going easy on us?

42
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,988
Yes, sir. We have many wounded.

43
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,990
But there's zero fatalities.

44
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,993
Even those who have been shot
have been hit in non-critical areas.

45
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,497
They're mocking us.

46
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,416
Send Dimitri Squad and Kim Squad!

47
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,461
Stack up the bodies of Mustang's men
right here, immediately!

48
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:01,384
Hasn't Mustang been caught yet?
What is General Cremin doing?

49
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,095
They aren't killing our men,

50
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,223
but instead,
they're whittling down our forces.

51
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,268
There's no way they can keep up
their crafty little charade.

52
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,229
Colonel Mustang is too soft.

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,982
Absolutely. What is he thinking?

54
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,778
And nothing is softer
than the Central forces

55
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,322
who can't defeat him.

56
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,366
They're almost like children playing.

57
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,742
What was that?

58
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,330
Come to think of it,
there was a single rebel

59
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,959
who nearly froze
the command center, right?

60
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,170
Ever since the nation's founding,

61
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,756
there hasn't been a large enemy force
that has attacked Central.

62
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,344
The lack of experience
is painfully obvious.

63
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
Their offense may be good,
but their defense is awful.

64
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
How about it?

65
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,605
Why don't you let me have
a few of the Central forces?

66
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,899
Don't get carried away, Armstrong!

67
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,445
Do you think you're in your position
because of merit?

68
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,907
You're just being detained here.

69
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,328
We know there's a strong connection
between you and the Briggs' forces.

70
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,248
That's why keeping you detained here

71
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,210
is a powerful deterrent against possible
rebellion from the Briggs soldiers.

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,717
You people don't know a thing about us!

73
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,180
I've told them to abandon me
if there is an emergency.

74
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,225
The law of Briggs
is survival of the fittest.

75
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,645
Even if I were to kick the bucket here,

76
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,232
they are a force that can
just write me off as being weak

77
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,236
and keep on moving.

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,238
That's who the Briggs soldiers are.

79
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,409
Don't speak about the men I've trained
as if you know who they are!

80
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,704
Colonel Mustang is exchanging fire

81
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,789
in the manufacturing quarter
on the west side.

82
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,167
There are many soldiers
being dispatched there.

83
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,887
We're moving out.
You can kiss this cellar goodbye.

84
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,433
Sink your teeth into the windpipes
of those Central pantywaists!

85
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,522
See? Here they come.

86
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,732
They are men of valor,

87
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,234
who are more than a match
against the bears of Briggs Mountain.

88
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,864
I wonder which is stronger,
them or your vaunted dolls?

89
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,081
Damn!

90
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,212
New forces?

91
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,714
Impossible! Where did they come from?

92
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,092
They just suddenly appeared
in the middle of town.

93
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,302
What is this sorcery?
How did they do that?

94
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,054
You guys head in there, too!

95
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,474
- What are the enemy numbers?
- Unknown.

96
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,353
However, judging from their gear,
I believe they are Northern soldiers.

97
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,813
From Briggs?

98
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,318
Inside the Armstrong mansion?

99
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,571
Yeah, using the repairs
to the mansion as a cover,

100
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,157
we moved soldiers and weapons
into the cellar.

101
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,368
Just how huge is that house?

102
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,539
- Charlie, give me some ammo.
- Sorry, but I'm out, too.

103
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,376
What do we do?
Isn't the supply unit here yet?

104
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,544
Did they get captured?

105
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,840
Listen, if it comes to that,
leave me here and go.

106
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,049
Roger that!

107
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,803
Don't you mean,
"We'll stay with you until the end"?

108
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,097
I'm not going out surrounded by men.

109
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,307
I've got a wife waiting for me at home.

110
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,646
Ah, you don't say!

111
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,571
They've all but stopped fighting back
with their guns.

112
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,573
Could they be out of ammo?

113
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,785
All right, we're moving in on them!
Round up everyone we have left!

114
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,880
- Yoo-hoo, Riza!
- Rebecca, you're late!

115
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,590
Sorry!

116
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:13,136
I've got some nice presents
for those of you who've been waiting!

117
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,556
- Awesome!
- It's not just ammo, either!

118
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,350
Way to go, Rebecca! I love you!

119
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,896
Shut up! Men without money
don't get to flirt with me!

120
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,233
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

121
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,237
Long time no see, Colonel Mustang.

122
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,872
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross,
returning without orders!

123
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,129
Why aren't those guys charging in here?

124
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,882
We've got the Flame Alchemist with us,

125
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,842
so they have to be careful
about approaching.

126
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,969
But we're in the middle of town,

127
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,097
so the colonel can't get too wild
with his flames.

128
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,725
Oh, dear, I came to Central
to snag me a nice man,

129
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,936
but you're all a bunch of wusses!

130
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,327
Damn it!

131
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,584
It's a tear-gas bomb from Xing.
It's got extra pepper spray.

132
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,838
By any chance,
did you get all of this from Xing?

133
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,676
I didn't know that you were part
of this operation.

134
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,720
Did you procure these weapons
all by yourself?

135
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,557
Or did someone else order this?

136
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,851
Would you like to speak
to them personally, sir?

137
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:51,943
Okay!

138
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,903
Here you go.

139
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,739
<i>Some dignitary from Xing?</i>

140
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,202
This is Colonel Roy Mustang
of the armed forces.

141
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,996
I am honored to be able to...

142
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,082
<i>Man, you sound so respectful!</i>

143
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,295
Let's just talk
in our regular tone, Colonel.

144
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,132
In your hearts for 80 years,

145
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,551
with everything from underwear bands
to armored vehicles,

146
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,221
delivered to you, anytime, anyplace,
just a phone call away...

147
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,557
We're your neighborhood
Havoc general store!

148
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
Havoc!

149
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,104
So, who's footing the bill?

150
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,983
I'll pay you when I've made it big.
Start a tab!

151
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,536
There's smoke rising in the city.
I can hear sirens, too.

152
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,374
Looks like the colonel
and the Briggs guys are on the move.

153
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,836
Central is in chaos right about now.

154
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,800
We should get going.

155
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,430
Yeah, the nationwide
transmutation circle counter is in place,

156
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,974
but it's best to keep it
from activating in the first place.

157
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,438
He's still inside a flask.
He's just gotten a lot bigger.

158
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,565
If we smash his container, he'll die.

159
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:21,574
We can also free the souls of people
that he has trapped inside him.

160
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,080
But how do we get to where he is?

161
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,458
We use the underground passageway
that I took with May earlier.

162
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,463
There will be a ton of vicious Chimera,
but we should make it through.

163
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,009
- Heinkel, hold down the fort here.
- Yeah, I owe you one.

164
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,260
Don't worry about it.

165
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,805
Dr. Marcoh,
don't let the military find you.

166
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,767
Yoki. You stay behind, too.

167
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,185
Gladly!

168
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,697
- Al.
- What is it, brother?

169
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,201
I'm going to pop out for a bit
and kick that underground bearded guy.

170
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,954
Be careful.

171
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,455
Yeah.

172
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,437
The city sure is in an uproar, huh?

173
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,063
We should hurry.

174
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:39,068
Father is about to show off
the secrets of immortality.

175
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,695
I know!

176
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,875
We'll cordon off this area!

177
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,959
Don't let Mustang's squad

178
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,086
or the Briggs soldiers
get past this point!

179
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,009
Tell your soldiers to pull out!

180
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,637
You're the ones who stole the command
of Briggs away from me, right?

181
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,599
Do you think you will get away with this?

182
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,644
What about you?
Do you think you will get away with this?

183
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,230
You must have heard of that "Father" guy.

184
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,108
What he's going to sacrifice
and what he's going to obtain.

185
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,694
Yeah, I heard.

186
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,031
Those of us who were chosen
will rise even higher,

187
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,493
while Amestris changes the world!

188
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,996
The pain that accompanies this change
cannot be avoided!

189
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,623
Why can't you understand that?

190
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,377
You guys are hopeless.

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,628
What?

192
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:49,931
Scum like you, who watch the battlefield
from the comfort of a safety zone,

193
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,644
make pain out to be something lofty
and exploit it.

194
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,896
You're going to turn traitor?

195
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,648
Who knows?

196
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,985
Once this is all over, I might be a hero.

197
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,153
However...

198
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:08,241
You'll find that I'm not as merciful
as the Hero of Ishval!

199
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,325
Wait!

200
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,913
- What?
- What?

201
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,500
Sir!

202
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,520
Major Armstrong!

203
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,522
Sergeant Brosh.

204
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,567
Isn't this your day off?

205
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,028
I saw the smoke from my house.
What's going on, sir?

206
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,201
Colonel Mustang and his former men
have taken the Fuhrer's wife hostage

207
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,703
and are fleeing through town.

208
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,787
What?

209
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,165
How cowardly of him!

210
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,292
First, he kills
the innocent Lieutenant Ross.

211
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,127
And now, he has Mrs. Bradley!

212
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,754
The man's the devil in disguise!

213
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,677
Major!

214
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,473
General Armstrong
just shot General Gardner

215
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,808
in one of the command center
conference rooms.

216
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,311
She killed him?

217
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,320
<i>Things are progressing faster
</i><i>than I imagined.</i>

218
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,947
<i>I have to find the Young Lord soon.</i>

219
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,742
<i>Then again, I can't trace his presence</i>

220
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,995
<i>because the gigantic flow of chi
</i><i>from underground is interfering.</i>

221
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,079
<i>My word...</i>

222
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:43,127
<i>It feels like the underground presence
</i><i>has spread itself out since yesterday.</i>

223
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,266
This won't work.

224
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,310
The military is using it
as a rallying point.

225
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,145
We can't get near it.

226
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,773
Looks like it's going to be hard
to force our way through.

227
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,654
There is another way in!

228
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,031
The Third Laboratory!

229
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,950
Al and the colonel broke inside
that place before

230
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,660
and fought that Homunculus!

231
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,045
There are three guards at the entrance.

232
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,214
Well, then, let's have a go at them.

233
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:15,136
No, a situation like this
calls for me to use my title.

234
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,138
Hey, Mr. M.P.!

235
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,891
I'm Edward Elric, the State Alchemist.

236
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,561
A State Alchemist?

237
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,981
Please help me! I'm being chased by Scar!

238
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,775
The man on the wanted list!

239
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,360
Don't move!

240
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,373
That was pretty mean of you.

241
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,542
Shut up. Let's go.

242
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,547
Excuse us, coming through.

243
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,008
I'm sure it was right around here...

244
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,261
Here it is!

245
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,113
- Should we split up into two teams?
- Yeah.

246
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,534
I'll go this way.
Edward and Scar, you go that way.

247
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,619
What?

248
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,372
Why do I get stuck with him?

249
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,124
Call it "distribution of alchemic power."

250
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,754
Besides, when he used
his alchemist-stopper technique,

251
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,757
Scar could still use his,
but you were helpless, weren't you?

252
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:40,012
Okay, that settles it.
These two are a pair. Anything else?

253
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,933
I'm a bit beyond standard,
so I should be fine on my own.

254
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,018
However...

255
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,146
As long as she's here,

256
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,525
why don't I take the Xingese young lady
along as my bodyguard?

257
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,906
All right, once we find him,
we'll smash him with all our might.

258
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,116
Roger that!

259
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,245
Are you sure you'll be okay
with just the two of you?

260
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,081
Yeah, I'll be fine.

261
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:11,335
This old man would be happier
with just the young lady.

262
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,383
- Dirty old man.
- Come on, let's go.

263
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,236
You need to search
for the Xingese prince, right?

264
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,662
Go on.

265
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,166
But...

266
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,917
Don't worry about us.

267
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,920
He's dear to you, right?

268
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,642
Thank you very much.

269
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,245
Seriously, what a pathetic bunch.

270
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,874
They can't even handle
those Briggs Mountain monkeys!

271
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,334
Please wait!

272
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,461
The multiple soul-bonding tests
haven't been--

273
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,839
Shut up!
If we don't use them now, when will we?

274
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,845
We worked so hard
to make these Philosopher's Stones

275
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,806
for a time like this, right?

276
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,654
Now, move! Dig into those rebels!
