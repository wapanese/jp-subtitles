1
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>Resembool! This is Resembool!</i>

2
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:45,480
What were the colonel's orders?
Tell me already, Major.

3
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,984
I haven't heard all the details myself.

4
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,322
He just told me to bring you
and rendezvous in Resembool.

5
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,741
Rendezvous? With who?

6
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,870
Hi there, Major Armstrong.

7
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,123
Yo, chief.

8
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,126
Lieutenant Breda?

9
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:15,135
My brother should be at Resembool by now,

10
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,763
but he hasn't called.

11
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,641
And for starters,
I'm here to do repairs, anyhow.

12
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:25,145
After the incident with Lieutenant Ross,
I don't know anything that's going on.

13
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,397
That's why I'm here to explain it.

14
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,657
- When did you get here?
- For that matter, how did you get in?

15
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,158
Through the window.

16
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,119
I mean, I am supposedly a criminal.

17
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,164
"ILLEGAL ALIEN"
AS WELL AS "LOCKUP ESCAPEE"

18
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,417
You don't have to worry about Ed.

19
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,420
By now, he's probably...

20
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,339
It's so hot...

21
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,264
The colonel never said anything
about leaving the country,

22
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,641
the bastard.

23
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,187
Mr. Han, is our destination much farther?

24
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,899
We're already here. You see?
The ruins of Xerxes.

25
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,664
PHEW

26
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,917
I NEARLY GOT BURNED
BY MY OWN AUTOMAIL

27
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,171
- Why is the kid with you?
- That's kind of a long story.

28
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,847
Xerxes, huh? I read about it
in <i>The Tale of the Eastern Sage.</i>

29
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,640
The Eastern Sage?

30
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,478
Yeah. It's a fairy tale about the one
who brought alchemy to our land.

31
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,399
The legend goes that a survivor
of the Kingdom of Xerxes,

32
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,734
which perished overnight,

33
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,779
wandered into Amestris
not long after it was founded

34
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,031
and spread alchemy around.

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:06,705
In my land, we have a legend
of a drifter from the West.

36
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,500
The art that he shared was mixed
with the art of Xing,

37
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,586
and it apparently became
the alkahestry we have today.

38
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,214
You mean, the practice that was
developed for the medical field?

39
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,095
We hold him in reverence
and refer to him as...

40
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,098
"The Western Sage."

41
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,311
Are you saying that this is
where the sage came from?

42
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,104
So it is said.

43
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,984
I wanted to see the ruins of Xerxes.

44
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,488
<i>I see. So that's why.</i>

45
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:46,536
But if the art they had was so great,
how is it that they perished overnight?

46
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,664
Perhaps it is just a legend.

47
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,011
What are you doing? This way!

48
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,866
- We're going quite a ways in, huh?
- Edward!

49
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,625
<i>Back east, where I was.
</i><i>That's a nice place.</i>

50
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,378
<i>There's no big-city hustle and bustle,</i>

51
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,880
<i>and best of all,
</i><i>there are lots of beautiful women.</i>

52
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,009
Damn that colonel!

53
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,389
Lieutenant Ross!

54
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,643
Come on! Give us a reunion hug!

55
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,395
That's okay!

56
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,524
It seemed risky to keep a person
who's supposed to be dead in the country,

57
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,484
so he sent her out of the country.

58
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,779
Then, the colonel knows
that Lieutenant Ross is innocent?

59
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,453
You think these actions
might be too harsh?

60
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,789
- You think so, too?
- Yeah.

61
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,834
Walking her out like a criminal
in front of all those people

62
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,336
and playing up the killing
of a fellow officer in the papers,

63
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,797
something that brings disgrace
upon the military...

64
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,721
It's me.

65
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,682
<i>There's a call for you on a public line
</i><i>from Warrant Officer Falman.</i>

66
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,142
Put him through.

67
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,728
<i>Colonel, about General Hughes' murder--</i>

68
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,105
<i>Hey, Falman, let me have
</i><i>the phone for a sec.</i>

69
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,189
Barry?

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,528
<i>Yo, Mr. Mustang, seen the papers?
</i><i>There's an interesting story in there.</i>

71
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,865
Hey, Bunny! I'm not supposed
to take personal calls!

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,993
I'll call you back from outside!
Wait just a minute!

73
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,581
What? Is this for real?

74
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,835
<i>Yeah. The bullet the lieutenant fired
</i><i>was the one she shot me with.</i>

75
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,088
<i>I still have the hole in my right hand
</i><i>from when I was shot.</i>

76
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,133
Maybe we should go on the offensive.

77
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,095
Barry, it's been so long.
How would you like to cut loose again?

78
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,144
Roger. I won't kill nobody.

79
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,104
Roadway number two
into the warehouse district, right?

80
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:32,160
Breda, get this together for me.
Pork bone and meat, carbon, ammonia.

81
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,244
What is this?

82
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm going to whip up a burned corpse.

83
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,998
Human transmutation?

84
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't be ridiculous.
At best, it's just a burned body.

85
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,506
But once the coroner sees it,

86
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,134
I'll make it so charred,
they won't be able to identify it.

87
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,762
What if they check dental records?

88
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,264
I'm way ahead of you.

89
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,767
Can you pull it off?

90
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:03,108
I'm no expert, but I do have
my share of knowledge.

91
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,861
Making burned corpses is my specialty.

92
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,114
Hurry.

93
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,622
Maria Ross, right?

94
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,629
It's a dummy.

95
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,174
You're going to die here tonight.

96
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,564
Don't just stand there!

97
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,710
Yo, Fullmetal.

98
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,212
What's going on here, Colonel?

99
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,591
Huh? Chief Fullmetal?

100
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,177
We didn't plan on this.

101
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,220
Edward.

102
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,474
Now, now, the colonel
will come up with something.

103
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,102
- Let's go.
- Right.

104
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:28,902
When Madam Ross was broken out,
the Young Lord and Barry struck a deal.

105
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,157
The orders I have from the Young Lord
are to take this woman east.

106
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,121
So we promised to rendezvous here
and allow Lieutenant Ross to escape.

107
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,374
- I see.
- I don't like it.

108
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,088
That bastard colonel put one
over on us, right?

109
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,882
Rather than telling you, he thought
you'd be more readily convinced

110
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,426
if you actually saw Lieutenant Ross.

111
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,431
All right, all right.
The colonel was right this time.

112
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,183
Speaking of the colonel...

113
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,063
He also said having a hot-tempered kid
hanging around

114
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,648
would interfere with the operation.

115
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,818
Damn that colonel!

116
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,155
Operation? Is there more to it
than just rescuing Lieutenant Ross?

117
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,867
Yes. He's thinking
of reeling in the mastermind

118
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,661
that's been haunting the military.

119
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,246
Next time I see him...

120
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,997
Reeling in?

121
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,543
Barry, who holds the secret
to the Fifth Laboratory,

122
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,045
went on quite a bold rampage.

123
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,006
<i>I'm sure they'll take steps
</i><i>to make sure he keeps his mouth shut.</i>

124
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,099
So that's what happened?

125
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,604
By any chance, was Ed taken away
just to get him out of his hair?

126
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,356
That's right.

127
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:56,030
So, I helped out, and in exchange, Barry
was gonna tell me the secret of his body.

128
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,115
But then...

129
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,744
The researchers who gave me
this body are all dead now,

130
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,871
so I can't tell you.

131
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,206
That's not fair!

132
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,877
I know. That Alphonse guy
has a body similar to mine.

133
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,920
Why don't you ask him?

134
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:17,385
So that's why I decided to ask you.
I was promised, so if you'd be so kind.

135
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:22,015
I don't have anything
to do with that promise.

136
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,643
I really didn't have anything
to do with it, huh?

137
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,438
How did I get caught up
in Philosopher's Stones,

138
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,690
Homunculi, and such?

139
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,696
We now have quite a bit of intelligence
gathered together.

140
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,824
If we can figure out the story
behind the general's murder,

141
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,992
the situation will change, too.

142
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,496
We are going to clear you
of this false accusation!

143
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,710
Col-- General Hughes...

144
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,505
...really is dead, huh?

145
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,509
What are you going to do now?

146
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:06,684
Keep moving forward
in some way that you can accept.

147
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,607
There are those who worked with me,
even when I committed the taboo.

148
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,279
Those who get angry at me and support me.

149
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:23,368
There's my brother, who I promised
to return back to his body.

150
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,747
And I can't turn back.

151
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:33,294
So I guess all I can do is move forward.

152
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,755
In a way I won't lose anyone.

153
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,761
If it looks like someone might
become a victim, I'll protect them!

154
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,308
Sure, it may be difficult.

155
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,644
That's what I need to do
to take care of them.

156
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:54,399
Maybe it's arrogant
to think I can protect others.

157
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:59,112
But I can't think
of anything else right now.

158
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,948
So, I'm going to move forward.

159
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,961
Lieutenant Ross, what are you going to do?

160
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,964
Sir, I'm thinking of going
to the land of Xing.

161
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,723
Shall I tell your parents?

162
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:35,523
No. If, by any chance, my parents
let it slip that I'm still alive,

163
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,442
it could do irreparable harm.

164
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,697
- I see.
- Major Armstrong, Lieutenant Breda.

165
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,244
Please tell Colonel Mustang
that I am grateful to him for saving me,

166
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:53,249
and, if there's ever an emergency,
to please call me back.

167
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,211
When he does, I will put my life
on the line to go work for him.

168
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,013
Take care, Edward.

169
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,516
I never got to get you back
for slapping me.

170
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,019
Maybe next time.

171
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,405
Yeah, maybe next time.

172
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,409
You've got some good friends there.

173
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,914
Mr. Fu, what kind of country is Xing?

174
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,833
It's a fine country, tolerant of others,

175
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,503
with an abundance of people and food.

176
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,921
You can rest at ease.

177
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,926
So, I can hope that once we cross
the desert, we will find paradise?

178
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,683
However, the desert is quite oppressive.
Watch yourself.

179
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,939
From here on,
don't go wasting your fluids.

180
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,986
I'll come by your shop sometime tomorrow.

181
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,114
What would you like
as a present, Elizabeth?

182
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,619
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
</i><i>Kate, we have a customer.</i>

183
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,455
<i>Would you call Jacqueline for me?</i>

184
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,375
Jacqueline, we have a customer.

185
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,502
Copy.

186
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,932
- Hold on!
- Barry?

187
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,853
Take it easy, Falman. Don't kill this one.

188
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,950
That smell of tobacco-- Lieutenant Havoc?

189
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,041
Look, you, why do you think
I'm wearing a mask?

190
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,378
This is why I can't stand guys
who aren't used to field work!

191
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,588
Sorry about that!

192
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,382
It just means that you've
been dragged into this.

193
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,468
Don't do anything.

194
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,095
You never know where those military folks
may be watching us from.

195
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,517
You're...

196
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,773
- We're going outside!
- Yeah.

197
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,739
- But the enemy may be outside!
- Outside is all right!

198
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,334
Aw, crap!

199
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,836
Lieutenant!

200
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,391
Don't worry. We've got
the hawk's eye on our side.

201
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,939
<i>- I heard a loud noise. What happened?
- It's all right.</i>

202
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,234
One of the customers was
getting naughty with Jacqueline,

203
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,944
so I just smacked him a little bit.

204
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,278
My, my...

205
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,781
<i>You're pretty harsh, Elizabeth.</i>

206
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,785
All right, don't move.

207
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,829
There's a few things I want to ask you.

208
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,665
Hey, does this guy even know
what I'm saying?

209
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,669
Hey, you're kidding me! This guy is...

210
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,838
It's my body!

211
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,674
What? What do you mean?

212
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:35,179
Those guys dumped the soul
of a lab rat or something into my body.

213
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,683
My body is here to get back its soul.

214
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,852
This takes me back!

215
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:46,190
It's the first time I've seen him
since my soul got yanked out of him!

216
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,739
A transmutation circle?

217
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,159
It's a lot like the one that was
in the Fifth Laboratory, but...

218
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,161
A two-headed dragon...

219
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,663
The sun...

220
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:05,084
Ah, damn it! I can't tell.
The top portion is missing!

221
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,844
You want something?
I'll tell you right now, I've got no--

222
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,263
An Ishvalan?

223
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,106
Young man,
would you mind being our hostage

224
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,984
so we can take back our holy land
from the State Military?

225
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,238
There's no way the military will
take action over a single kid like me.

226
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,368
It was the death of a single child
that triggered the Civil War.

227
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,414
You never know what will be
the catalyst that changes history.

228
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,000
Stop it. This is a disgrace.

229
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,588
Madame Shan!

230
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,259
You fool. Are you trying to bring shame
to the name of Ishvala?

231
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,806
Let him go. He won't attack you again.

232
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,104
Why did you come to my aid?

233
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,191
I thought you guys hated
Amestrisians. Don't you?

234
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,197
I know that not all Amestrisians are bad.

235
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,744
Madame Shan and I were saved
by Amestrisian doctors

236
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,331
when we were severely injured
during the Civil War.

237
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,334
To be honest, I do hate you,

238
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,338
but it's thanks to that couple
that I'm still alive today.

239
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,676
Couple? They wouldn't happen to have been
named Rockbell, would they?

240
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,600
- You're a friend of Dr. Rockbell?
- Yeah.

241
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,605
The doctor saved the lives
of many Ishvalans.

242
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,607
No kidding...

243
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,569
Aunt and Uncle Rockbell...

244
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:02,618
When the fighting became severe,
they stayed with us.

245
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,123
How did they meet their end?

246
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,629
The two of them were killed

247
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,133
by an Ishvalan patient they had helped.

248
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,885
Oh, no...

249
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,097
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,228
<i>We were unable to stop it.</i>

251
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,772
<i>Who was it that did it?</i>

252
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,234
I don't know his face,

253
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,529
but he was an Ishvalan monk
who had a tattoo on his right arm.

254
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>If you get the chance,</i>

255
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,961
<i>would you deliver something
</i><i>to the grave of the Rockbell couple?</i>

256
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,465
<i>Our gratitude and our apologies.</i>

257
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,193
This is fantastic!

258
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:22,573
You hardly ever get the chance
to carve up your own body.

259
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,327
You just told me not to kill him,
didn't you?

260
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,579
To hell with the operation now!

261
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:33,083
My soul is all abuzz! I want to slice...

262
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:39,173
No! And don't you want
to go back into your original body?

263
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,092
That body ain't gonna hold out
much longer.

264
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,346
Oh, it's rotting, huh?

265
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,141
Ah, I can't take it anymore!
I'm cutting it.

266
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,852
Whatever I do with my own body
is up to me!

267
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,063
I told you, no!

268
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,107
<i>- What's the matter?
- Some kind of argument?</i>

269
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,567
Sounds like one of the customers
is making trouble.

270
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,324
Uh-oh. I'll have to call you back.
I've got a customer of my own.
