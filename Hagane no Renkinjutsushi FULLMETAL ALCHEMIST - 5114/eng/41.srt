1
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,852
It's almost like a maze in here.

2
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,688
- Be careful not to get separated.
- Right.

3
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,612
- Are you all right?
- Sorry.

4
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,534
What's this?

5
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,704
- Dynamite.
- You're kidding!

6
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,250
No, these are completely soaked through.

7
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,836
Relax, they won't explode.

8
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,632
Hey, don't dawdle around.

9
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,634
There's no telling when someone
might come after us.

10
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,094
Right.

11
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,268
<i>It looks like the storm is over.</i>

12
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,522
- Get things ready.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,027
Kimblee and the men he brought
from Central...

14
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>When you get an opening,
</i><i>take out all three of them.</i>

15
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,866
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,301
We'll carry out the mission
with only those of us who are here.

17
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,137
This is top-secret, even to the soldiers
from Northern Command.

18
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,848
Hold on. Major Miles, by "take out,"

19
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,893
- do you mean kill?
- Of course.

20
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,771
I can't go along with killing them.

21
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,732
Better to keep him from using alchemy
and getting intel from him.

22
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,276
Do you think that guy
is going to freely tell us anything?

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,780
- It's too dangerous to keep him alive.
- Then what about his men?

24
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,032
They've been turned into Chimeras

25
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,701
and maybe they have no choice
but to obey him, you know?

26
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:26,206
You're right.
But ultimately, that's still a "maybe".

27
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,543
You're going to kill them
just because you're suspicious of them?

28
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,879
I mean, even in General Raven's case,
there was no other way!

29
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,842
Do not forget the law of Briggs.
"If you get careless, you're dead."

30
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,515
Your sense of mercy could cost you
or your friends their lives.

31
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,438
We don't need anyone careless
in these parts.

32
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,191
We're going to dispose of Kimblee
and the other two.

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,033
- He's still a child after all, huh?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,121
But in this world, it's naive to stick
to the idea of not having to kill anyone.

35
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,749
Then again,
I went through that phase myself.

36
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,003
So did I. But at our age,

37
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,006
after living through a number of wars,
you learn some things.

38
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,760
Like letting someone live
is harder than killing them.

39
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,390
The Elric brothers have chosen
the more difficult way.

40
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,310
- They are pretty arbitrary that way, huh?
- Yeah.

41
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,896
But I'm kind of envious of them too.

42
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,072
What's this "rasayana" here?

43
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,241
It's a miracle drug
from which one gains longevity.

44
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,538
The Philosopher's Stone maybe? Let's see.

45
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:54,044
"Changes all metals into gold and returns
the elderly back to their youth."

46
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,006
- What's "aurelian" here?
- That means gold.

47
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,802
It's all about immortality and gold.

48
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,471
That's because Mr. Scar's brother,
who wrote these notes,

49
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,390
was influenced by Xingese alkahestry.

50
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,059
How do you mean?

51
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,189
In Xing, we call an immortal a shinhito,
a "true person".

52
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:19,194
It means that they are a perfect person.
And since gold is the perfect metal,

53
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,239
a shinhito is sometimes
also called a "kinhito".

54
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:29,955
I get it. So a perfect person
is a gold person then?

55
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>In a sense. The person
</i><i>who brought alchemy to Xing</i>

56
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,629
<i>was an immortal man
</i><i>who had golden hair and eyes.</i>

57
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,965
<i>So that's apparently
</i><i>how they got to be called that.</i>

58
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,388
Gold hair and eyes. Sounds like Ed and Al.

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,599
Hey, everyone! Over here! The exit!

60
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,276
Wow, it's so bright.

61
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,279
We made it safely through the mountain.

62
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,366
The weather is nice.
Let's head for Briggs now while we can.

63
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,327
All right, men, follow me--

64
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,122
- Hey, help me!
- The snow is pretty deep.

65
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,957
- Hey, help me!
- Miss, hop on my back.

66
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,875
- Hey, guys, is anyone listening?
- We'll stomp it down

67
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,168
and make a path for you

68
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,297
- so you can follow behind us.
- Thanks.

69
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,101
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

70
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:37,272
<i>Help me! Somebody!</i>

71
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,275
- Al?
- Alphonse!

72
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,278
- Oh, no! Oh, no! I'll save you!
- Al, are you all right?

73
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm saved.
I got stuck here where it became deep

74
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,870
- and then got buried by it.
- Al, what are you doing here?

75
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,665
I crossed over the mountain
to get to you first.

76
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,169
You crossed over the mountain?
In that snowstorm?

77
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,924
I see. You came straight here
without taking any detours.

78
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,636
Why would you do something so reckless?

79
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,222
- I have an emergency message.
- Emergency message?

80
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,935
Central's forces are inside Fort Briggs.

81
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,649
General Armstrong
was apparently summoned to Central.

82
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,402
As such, it's too dangerous
to go to the fort now.

83
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:30,200
What do we do? We can't very well go back.

84
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:35,121
- We'll just have to hide someplace else.
- Someplace else like where?

85
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,589
- Follow me.
- Where are you going?

86
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,468
There's a village called Asbeck
that shouldn't be too far from here.

87
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:53,348
I've heard that some of my people
are taking refuge in the slums there.

88
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,892
An Ishvalan slum?

89
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,603
We don't appear to have any other options.

90
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,481
Good going, sir. Let's go.

91
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,446
- But are you sure that's a good idea?
- What?

92
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,033
Al, if you disappear all of a sudden,
won't Mr. Kimblee be suspicious?

93
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,746
<i>It's okay, it's okay.
</i><i>Brother will take care of that.</i>

94
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,042
- Squad 3, three men.
- Squad 4, five men.

95
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,586
All right, that's everyone.

96
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,673
Okay, each of you,
commence searching your areas.

97
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,008
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,723
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

99
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,225
Hey now, Alphonse.

100
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,729
You mean "right", don't you?

101
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,899
Man, I tell you, it's hard
to move around in this, Edward.

102
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:50,363
Please manage to somehow.
Come on, Kimblee is watching.

103
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,409
- Just a minute, Brother!
- Walk faster.

104
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,128
Hey, where are Kimblee
and the others searching?

105
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,797
There's that huge mineshaft
in the center of town, right?

106
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,800
He said he was going in there
to search the tunnels.

107
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,555
He said he couldn't trust
the northern soldiers,

108
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,058
so he was only taking the men
he brought from Central.

109
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,980
He's caught on, has he?
We'll head him off.

110
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,941
- Secure sniping positions near the shaft.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:41,289
Search the entrance to the tunnel.
If there are multiple sets of footprints,

112
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,874
- then there's no doubt.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,799
- Can you do it?
- Yes, at this distance...

114
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,846
What's the matter?

115
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,557
- It's Edward.
- What?

116
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,732
Kimblee, if you're going
to check out the tunnels,

117
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,693
shouldn't you leave that
to the Briggs soldiers?

118
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,571
It runs pretty deep in there.

119
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:19,119
The fact that you're intentionally
stopping me proves they're here.

120
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,080
What do you mean?
I want to get Scar as fast as--

121
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:26,584
Or are you buying time
until the snipers get into position?

122
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,587
You knew about that?

123
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:34,175
With as much bloodlust
filling the air around us, I knew.

124
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,886
I didn't survive the Ishvalan War
because of my good looks.

125
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,973
It looks like they're talking
to each other.

126
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,641
What do I do?

127
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,144
- Can you target just Kimblee?
- Yes, sir.

128
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,272
- Take careful aim and fire.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,494
That bastard!
He's using the snow to obstruct the view!

130
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,663
Damn.

131
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,332
Kimblee!

132
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,377
Why, you--!

133
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,980
You fellows are Chimeras too?

134
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,264
That bastard. I can't see anything.

135
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,560
But then, the other guys can't see either.
The odds are even--

136
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,689
Come quietly, Fullmetal Alchemist.

137
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,195
You can't escape from our sharp noses
in this poor visibility.

138
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,530
Shut up.

139
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,456
Fullmetal!

140
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,337
What's going on? Where are you? Answer me!

141
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,882
Major Miles? There are Chimeras here!

142
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,385
And they're accustomed
to fighting in poor visibility!

143
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,304
Don't come inside the snow cloud!

144
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,361
Damn it. I'm gonna be even shorter.

145
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,033
"Dynamite?" That's a mine for you.

146
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:13,251
Don't come too close!
You know what this is, right?

147
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,254
- You idiot.
- That stuff is too damp

148
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,839
to be of any help to you.

149
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,801
Fellows, do you know
what dynamite is made of?

150
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,845
Nitroglycerin?

151
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:29,434
Nitroglycol, wood flour,
ammonium nitrate and so forth?

152
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,688
Okay, and what is
the ammonium nitrate made of?

153
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,357
That's easy. Nitric acid and ammonia.

154
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,195
Ammonia?

155
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,116
Pee-yew!

156
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,960
- What is that smell?
- Ammonia.

157
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,047
Having a too sharp nose
can be a problem too.

158
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,382
These guys aren't any use to you anymore.

159
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,679
This is what happens,
the moment your hostage concerns are gone?

160
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,514
Whatever do you mean?

161
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:14,437
I'm just trying to get you
to spill everything you know.

162
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,148
Well, well, aren't you
the hot-blooded one?

163
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:22,028
Facing a youngster like you while
I'm on the mend will be quite taxing.

164
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,614
I don't have time to mess with you either.

165
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,785
How about I make use of this?

166
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,704
<i>He brought it out on his own.</i>

167
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,126
<i>He's fast.</i>

168
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,387
Too slow!

169
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,226
<i>He has no Philosopher's Stone</i>

170
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,061
<i>and he can't use
</i><i>his transmutation circles.</i>

171
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,313
- Now I've--
- You've won.

172
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,816
That's what you're thinking, right?

173
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:05,530
The resolve not to kill.
It is a fine policy. However,

174
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,783
on the battlefield, it's something
that can be taken advantage of.

175
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:13,830
You should have finished me off just then.

176
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,586
That sense of mercy
will be the reason for your defeat.

177
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,502
<i>I fell down the mine shaft?</i>

178
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,842
Why, that rotten-- He took us down too.

179
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,555
Damn it. Where did Kimblee go?

180
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,689
Hey, you're kidding, right?

181
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,591
- Al, what's the matter?
- Alphonse!

182
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,010
Al.

183
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,764
Yikes... I'm being pulled away again.

184
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,560
- What do you mean "pulled away"? Al.
- Hey, what's the matter, armor guy?

185
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,687
My soul...

186
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,690
is being pulled over.

187
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,695
Al! Al.

188
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,781
- His soul is being pulled away?
- Alphonse.

189
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,741
Miss, has anything like this
happened before?

190
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,493
Alphonse, stay with us.

191
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,870
- I don't know. Al.
- Alphonse!

192
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,456
Al, wake up.

193
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,960
No. Al, Al!

194
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,630
What do we do? What do we do?

195
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,800
Ed!

196
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:46,107
I can't make her cry
over something like this, can I?

197
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,334
Damn that Kimblee.

198
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:15,761
Hey, Fullmetal, are you alive?
Why did you save us?

199
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,847
You're more seriously injured
than we are, aren't you?

200
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,601
Don't get me wrong. I need someone...

201
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:26,856
to pull this thing stuck in my side...

202
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,359
out of me... or I've had it...

203
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:34,822
You want us to pull that beam out?
But we're the enemy.

204
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,033
Yeah, please.

205
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,749
Well, we don't have any orders
to kill you or anything.

206
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:49,086
- Here.
- But as soon as I pull that out,

207
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,672
you're gonna lose a lot of blood
and then it's lights out.

208
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,258
The moment you pull it out,

209
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:59,180
I'll close it up with alchemy...
before I lose too much blood.

210
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,643
What? Do you have any experience
in performing medical alchemy?

211
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:08,314
Long ago, when I tried to perform
human transmutation,

212
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,608
I researched it briefly.

213
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,904
Briefly? Your internal organs
are probably all torn up.

214
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,032
Without a Philosopher's Stone
or something like Mr. Kimblee has...

215
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:23,496
I'll use my own life...
in place of a Philosopher's Stone.

216
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,418
It may shorten my life
a little bit though.

217
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,297
- Are you sure about this?
- This is no time for debate.

218
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,384
If this is the outcome
of my sense of mercy,

219
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,887
then I've gotta wipe my own ass.

220
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,351
I'm not sure how you mean
but this is no time for debate.

221
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,770
I'll pull it out.

222
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,654
Okay, pull it.

223
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:01,158
<i>Think of your life
</i><i>as a sort of energy form.</i>

224
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,916
<i>The same as a Philosopher's Stone.</i>

225
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:18,801
<i>That's it. Right now,
</i><i>I am a one-soul-sized Philosopher's Stone!</i>

226
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:27,768
<i>Remember... how it felt... back then!</i>

227
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:34,442
<i>How it felt... to use... life!</i>

228
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,755
Is he dead?

229
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,009
Don't go writing me off.

230
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,928
Oh, it worked?

231
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:09,143
I'm not completely healed
but I spliced together a working system.

232
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,814
And for now... this jury-rigging
has at least stopped the bleeding.

233
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,150
Then you need
to have a doctor look at you.

234
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,528
No. There's no time for that.

235
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,781
Hey.

236
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:27,953
I have to go after Kimblee
or the others will be at risk.

237
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:35,753
Fool, there's no way you can fight
and win in your shape.

238
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,883
What is it?

239
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,348
A Philosopher's Stone?
That's the one Mr. Kimblee had.

240
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,475
We don't need to call
that freak "Mister" anything.

241
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,603
Not after he got us tangled up
in this too.

242
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,522
You're right.

243
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,941
What do you say we bid
that bastard farewell now?

244
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:01,737
Yeah. We'll let him think we died here
and become free men.

245
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,241
So, what do we do about him?

246
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:11,330
We can't just let him die, right?
We owe him our lives after all.

247
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,458
Yeah.

248
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,461
Once we get outside, we'll have
to find him a doctor right away.

249
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,712
Yeah.
