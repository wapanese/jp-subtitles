1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,961
<i>You idiot!</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,257
You believed the word of the enemy
and lost the will to fight?

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,467
I am terribly sorry, sir.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,263
Don't let it get the better of you!
Don't give up on living!

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,974
If you're going to be my adjutant,
you've got to be stronger!

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,976
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,314
I'm going to continue
trusting you to watch my back.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,607
Commit yourself.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,735
Colonel, you're not one to talk, sir.

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,779
A commander who just waltzes
on in like that.

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,863
You shut up!

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,286
And why are we even in the same room?

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,997
Ordinarily, I'd have my own room,
with a beautiful nurse!

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,416
Please try to make do, sir.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,919
Having you in the same room
makes it easier to guard you.

16
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,003
About that...

17
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,382
why haven't they come to kill us?

18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,384
Why?

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,762
Why did you let that flame bastard
out of there alive?

20
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,806
He burned Lust to death!

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,893
Lust is dead.

22
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,604
It's still not too late! Kill him!

23
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,984
Roy Mustang. We can make use of him.

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,986
Use him?

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,780
You don't mean him and the doorway?

26
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,740
Don't you worry about him.

27
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,744
Father has left him to me.

28
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,048
What do I do if I'm all rotten?

29
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,262
My body, which is over there,
isn't getting any nutrition!

30
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,348
Even if I'm able to get back
into that body...

31
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,810
Brother... Winry...

32
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,439
Eh? Hey, Ed!

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,239
This is just a hypothesis,
but when we tried to transmute Mom,

34
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,909
you and I mixed our blood together
for the soul information, right, Al?

35
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:26,957
<i>Now the two of us were both
</i><i>taken over there, and decomposed.</i>

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>Isn't there some chance
</i><i>that during that process, Al,</i>

37
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,381
<i>our spirits got some
</i><i>of their wires crossed?</i>

38
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,383
What do you mean?

39
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,344
I mean, isn't there a chance
that me, here,

40
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,763
and your body, over there, are connected?

41
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,101
I mean, look, for my age,
I'm a little sh...

42
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,146
Sh...

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,106
Short.

44
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,151
He admitted it! He's faced reality!

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,823
So, Ed, you're taking on growing
for Al's body too?

46
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,408
That sure seems like a farfetched idea.

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,994
It's not farfetched!

48
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,413
You don't grow
because you don't drink milk!

49
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,415
Not the milk thing again!

50
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,459
- Of course!
- Come to think of it.

51
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,961
- It makes your bones grow stronger!
<i>- Brother is always sleeping.</i>

52
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,423
<i>Could it be that he's sleeping
</i><i>enough for my share too?</i>

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,633
- Drink it! Drink it!
- No way! I can't!

54
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,761
- Drink it!
- I hate it!

55
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>I hope that's it.</i>

56
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,138
- Drink it!
- No way!

57
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,727
<i>Going to visit the colonel?</i>

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,146
Mr. Havoc is injured too.

59
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,731
We wanted to make sure
we paid our respects.

60
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,027
If the colonel hadn't come right now,
who knows what would have happened to me?

61
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,947
Sergeant Fuery, are you visiting them too?

62
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,784
I'm on an errand from the lieutenant.

63
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,621
Based on the number of footsteps I counted

64
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,498
once we got to the basement
under the Third Laboratory,

65
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,002
I figured the approximate distance
from there to that large doorway.

66
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,630
I couldn't be sure about the direction,

67
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,883
so I used the lab as a central point,
and drew a circle around it.

68
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,014
Central Command Center?
And what's more, this building is...

69
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,517
The Führer's residence.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,686
Under there is where the Homunculi are.

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,274
So there's a chance that the Führer
is connected to that group?

72
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,236
If he's connected,

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,447
then why did the Führer
go after Greed and company?

74
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,367
That's strange,
even if he wasn't connected.

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,953
He wiped them out, without trying
to get any information out of them.

76
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,957
The Führer is inscrutable.

77
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,918
Whatever the case,

78
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,796
the enemy has penetrated
fairly high into the military.

79
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,966
From here on, we should
be careful confronting them.

80
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,009
Fullmetal, watch yourself.

81
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,724
The Homunculi and the Führer...

82
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,771
Looks like we made an even bigger catch
than we expected.

83
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,983
I get the feeling that it's too big, sir.

84
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,609
It makes this all worth doing.

85
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,363
Now, I'm going to work you guys ragged.

86
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:07,867
About that, sir,
you'll have to count me out.

87
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,332
I can't feel my legs.

88
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,547
I'm sorry. I'm retiring.

89
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,679
Yo.

90
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,891
Yo. Are you in here for something?

91
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,268
My lower back.

92
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,397
Medical examiners always have to stand,
and it gets to an old guy like me.

93
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,946
When I heard that it was you
who burned that thing, something clicked.

94
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,156
What are you plotting?

95
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,783
You knew I was plotting something,

96
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,328
and yet you still determined
that other thing to be Lieutenant Ross?

97
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,996
Thank goodness for old war buddies.

98
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,875
We're not old war buddies.
We're partners in crime, aren't we?

99
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,337
You would burn them,
and I would do the autopsies.

100
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,381
Ishbal was just one giant test site.

101
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,639
You get too involved
in this dangerous business,

102
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,308
and you're gonna get hit with a backlash.

103
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,727
I already have.

104
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,731
Has something happened?

105
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,734
One of my men.

106
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,739
<i>His lower half is paralyzed
</i><i>from a spinal injury.</i>

107
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,874
And I only got permission
to have one of these per day.

108
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,047
It's laughable, being struck
by a woman and having to retire.

109
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,883
What are you going to do once you're out?

110
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:52,806
My family runs a general store.
I can at least answer the phone.

111
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,892
Can they do anything about it
with automail?

112
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,564
The nerve connections to the lower half
of my body are cut off,

113
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,733
so they can't do anything.

114
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,153
The retired lifestyle
sure doesn't suit you.

115
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,618
Colonel.

116
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,996
About Havoc's legs...

117
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,249
I picked up some information
from Chief Fullmetal.

118
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:25,588
<i>Doctor Marcoh, an alchemist
</i><i>with mastery in the medical field</i>

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>and a Philosopher's Stone.</i>

120
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,634
Can I extend my leave
a little longer, sir?

121
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,886
Approved.

122
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,722
Get going.

123
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,519
Ah, Major!

124
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,981
Are you back from your leave?

125
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,441
How was your trip to the east?

126
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,945
Don't tell him!

127
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,533
It was a nice place
with lots of beautiful women.

128
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,205
Oh, right, Major. This just came
from the Provost Marshal's Office.

129
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,001
It's a priority message to be delivered
to State Alchemists.

130
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,753
What's this?

131
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,883
How did it go?

132
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,471
Once I told them I was a State Alchemist,
they let me in without any problem.

133
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,724
- And the entrance to the basement?
- It wasn't there.

134
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,145
But there were traces of it
being closed up with alchemy.

135
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,275
<i>Not even they are dumb enough
</i><i>to leave an entrance.</i>

136
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,402
Oh.

137
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,198
It looks like going to see the Homunculi
won't be possible, then.

138
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,910
They said that I was a precious sacrifice,

139
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,162
and that they'd be screwed
if I were to die.

140
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,413
They said the same about me.

141
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,209
I could be a sacrifice,
since I opened the doorway.

142
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,628
Sacrifices probably refer to alchemists

143
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,423
that have the ability to open the doorway
and make it back.

144
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,761
I wonder what they have in mind
by making sacrifices of us.

145
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,429
Let's pry it out of those guys!

146
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,225
- Edward!
- Sergeant Brosh?

147
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,519
Thank goodness.

148
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,395
Hey, what's the matter?

149
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,897
Get back to the hotel right away.

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,650
If you'd like, I can escort you.

151
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,238
<i>This is a citywide announcement
</i><i>from the Provost Marshal's Office.</i>

152
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,115
<i>It appears that Scar
</i><i>has once again surfaced in Central.</i>

153
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,785
<i>Three are dead,
</i><i>all of them State Alchemists,</i>

154
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>as well as several others wounded.</i>

155
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,039
<i>According to eyewitness reports,</i>

156
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,959
<i>he is distinguished as being an Ishvalan,</i>

157
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,253
<i>having a large cross-shaped
</i><i>scar on his forehead,</i>

158
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,588
<i>as well as a tattoo
</i><i>over his entire right arm.</i>

159
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,970
A tattoo on his right arm!

160
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,390
Scar killed Aunt and Uncle Rockbell?

161
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,810
I haven't confirmed it yet, but yeah.

162
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,648
Oh, man.
Brother, we can't tell Winry about this.

163
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,899
How could we tell her?

164
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,194
I don't want to see tears
on her face again.

165
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,697
Me neither.

166
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,577
We're going to have to face
Scar again, aren't we?

167
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,787
To find out the truth?

168
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,456
There's that too,
but also one other reason.

169
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,084
To lure out the Homunculi.

170
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,672
Those guys can't have us dying on them.

171
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,551
So if we get attacked by Scar
and get into a real emergency...

172
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,096
They'll come forward?
I don't think the chances are that good.

173
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,473
It's better than doing nothing.

174
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,811
But last time, it only took Scar
a moment to beat us.

175
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,441
We're probably stronger
than we were before.

176
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:36,362
Supposing the Homunculi do show up,
how do we catch them?

177
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,573
Not only are they strong,
they're all but indestructible.

178
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,201
Indestructible? You mean...

179
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,870
Immortal, right?

180
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,123
Again through the window.

181
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,044
We'll help you out with that mission!

182
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,712
What?

183
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,839
I'm not interested
in the military entanglements,

184
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:59,052
but if the Homunculi are immortal,
that's another story.

185
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,222
You doubt me somehow?

186
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,727
I'm grateful to you for helping out
with Lieutenant Ross. Still--

187
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,854
The more friends you have,
the better, right?

188
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,151
I'm being serious too.
The fate of my clan is at stake here.

189
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,620
Okay, fine. Just don't run away
with the Homunculi!

190
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,416
I'll keep my promise.
I owe you for a meal, after all.

191
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,542
A meal?

192
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,508
- A room service bill?
- Thanks for treating!

193
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,095
Like hell this is for one meal!

194
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,099
Shut up! It's still early in the morning,
and I can't sleep!

195
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,269
Oh, that's right.
You're going back to Rush Valley?

196
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,694
Hold on. Cancel that, and stay here
in Central a little while longer.

197
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,324
I mean, you know,
maybe I'll damage my arm.

198
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,702
I'll probably even destroy it.

199
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,621
You're planning to destroy it?

200
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,457
Ah, Brother, your soul!

201
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,209
Good grief!

202
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,130
Don't do anything too dangerous, okay?

203
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,308
Doctor? Doctor, are you in?

204
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,653
Damn.

205
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,159
I see. Good work.

206
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,662
A dead end, huh?

207
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,337
Well, if you'll excuse me.

208
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,552
Who was that?

209
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,889
My mother, and someone
from the Veterans Administration.

210
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,768
I've made arrangements to retire.

211
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,813
We're still not certain
that you can't be treated.

212
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm not so dumb that I don't know
when I'm of no use, sir.

213
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,194
But...

214
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,781
You don't need any pawns
that can't move, right?

215
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,287
Why are you looking at me like that?

216
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,749
Leave me behind! Cut me loose!

217
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,502
Do you have time to be concerned
about one of your lowly underlings?!

218
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,254
You've got a promise to keep
to General Hughes, don't you?!

219
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,090
- I don't need your pity!
- Lieutenant Havoc!

220
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,932
Let me pack it in.

221
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,769
I'm begging you.

222
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,818
All right.

223
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,861
I'll leave you here.

224
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,911
I'll leave you here,
so you catch up to me.

225
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,624
I'm going on ahead.
I'll be waiting for you at the top.

226
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:26,259
He wasn't about to cast even me aside,
and I had given up on living.

227
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,012
He then said he was entrusting me
to watch his back.

228
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,556
He doesn't abandon others.

229
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,100
The fool.

230
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,104
There's no way he can climb his way
to the top of this country

231
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,106
if he's going to be so soft, is there?

232
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,986
I think it's okay to have
at least one fool like that.

233
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,620
Bring me my uniform.

234
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,497
You're in no shape
to leave the hospital yet.

235
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,541
Just bring it.

236
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,423
As you wish, sir.

237
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,344
How could you do that to me?

238
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,847
I'm so sorry!

239
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,517
Now I'll have to close up for the day.

240
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,853
You seem to be having some trouble!

241
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,233
State Alchemist Edward Elric is here!

242
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,947
That's amazing, kid!

243
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,616
Thank you very much!

244
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,493
How much would you like me
to pay for this?

245
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,787
Pay? That's not necessary,
not necessary!

246
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,208
I've broken a vase that's important to me.

247
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,669
- I wonder if you could fix it.
- Easily done!

248
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,890
I'm Edward Elric!

249
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:00,937
Your neighborhood State Alchemist,
Edward Elric!

250
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,314
- This too, please!
- Could you fix this?

251
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,987
Looks like word about me
is spreading all over town.

252
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,406
Sure, as flashy as you're being.

253
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,703
This isn't like you, Fullmetal.

254
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,163
Colonel?

255
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,290
Are you sure you should be
out of the hospital?

256
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,708
Maybe.

257
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,547
I heard about Lieutenant Havoc.
Knowing Doctor Marcoh--

258
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,673
Wait.

259
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,385
We're drawing attention. Get in.

260
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,138
On second thought, get out.

261
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:42,478
- Dr. Marcoh is missing?
- They probably abducted him.

262
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,900
By the way, Fullmetal,
you did hear about Scar?

263
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,905
What's with your behavior,
all but begging him to find you?

264
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,283
I want him to find me.

265
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,204
- I have to fight him once more.
- Don't be ridiculous!

266
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,748
Did you forget what happened in East City?

267
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,127
Oh, my. Are you afraid of Scar?

268
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,756
It's because you were useless
against him last time, Colonel, sir.

269
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,717
Don't you mock me!
It's clear and sunny today!

270
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,512
No, instead, you're all weak
and feeble, aren't you?

271
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,016
- You're still useless.
- You shut up!

272
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
Well, he's here, isn't he?

273
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,355
What's the matter?

274
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,524
It's not even raining,
and you're dripping wet.

275
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,652
Wait, Lieutenant! Don't shoot!

276
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,820
What are you talking about?

277
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,408
I'm gonna do like the colonel,
and try my hand at a little fishing!

278
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,792
Brother is using himself as bait
to lure out the Homunculi.

279
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,463
After all, he's a sacrifice to them,
one that they can't allow to die.

280
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,634
- That's crazy!
- We don't want anyone else to get hurt.

281
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,886
Using Brother or myself as bait
was the only thing we could do!

282
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,392
What are you going to do if Scar gets shot
by the MPs before the Homunculi show up?

283
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,187
Colonel, you can make sure
that doesn't happen, right?

284
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,941
You're giving orders to me?
You've got nerve.

285
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,778
Once you catch the Homunculi,
I want my cut!

286
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
You got it!

287
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,623
Sergeant Fuery's townhouse is nearby.

288
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,124
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

289
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,004
It's starting.

290
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,552
You two! Please stand aside!

291
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,639
Don't shoot! You'll hit my brother!

292
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,643
<i>Damn, if Scar gets shot,
</i><i>we'll lose everything.</i>

293
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,311
<i>Talk about maintaining
</i><i>a careful distance--</i>

294
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,731
<i>He's wearing me down!
</i><i>What's taking so long, Homunculi?</i>

295
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,734
Where's the Provost Marshal
Office's channel?

296
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,070
Here it is! That's our Fuery for you.

297
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,325
This is Sector 3 MP Patrol.

298
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,537
We're currently engaging Scar!
Request immediate backup!

299
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,248
Hey, what are you doing?

300
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,252
There, now for Sector 17.

301
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,254
This is starting to be fun. This is--

302
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,133
What's going on here?
Scar is in Sector 17 too?

303
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,843
Then what's happening in Sector 3?

304
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,095
Colonel Douglas,
he's appeared in Sector 8 too!

305
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,179
What?

306
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,599
Central Provost Marshal's Office
calling Sector 8,

307
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,268
Scar and a young man
are fighting each other.

308
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,272
The young man is a State Alchemist!
Hold your fire!

309
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>There are false reports flying around!
</i><i>What? A fourth person has spotted Scar?</i>

310
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,069
<i>This is Sector 3.
</i><i>Nothing to report on the streets.</i>

311
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,364
<i>This is Sector 8! We've spotted Scar!
</i><i>Requesting immediate backup!</i>

312
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,998
- Gluttony?
- I smell him, I smell him!

313
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,375
I smell the Ishvalan!

314
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,006
What is that presence?
Do you feel it, Lan Fan?

315
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,175
- Yes.
- All right, let's go!

316
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,182
<i>Which one?
</i><i>Bodily destruction? Or automail?</i>

317
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,349
Brother!

318
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,192
Lucky!

319
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,444
You cancelled out
his decomposition energy?

320
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,405
That's so reckless!

321
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,158
A tattoo on his right arm?

322
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,329
You bastard, I knew it!

323
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,956
I smell him, I smell him!

324
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,340
Hi! Hello there!

325
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,383
You're pretty unusual on the inside?

326
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,886
How many people do you have inside you?

327
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,180
Who are you?

328
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,725
It's no use trying to get away.
You have a unique chi.

329
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,852
I can follow you anywhere.

330
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,815
Enemy? Enemy?

331
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,025
Can I eat them?

332
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,861
<i>- Sure enough.
</i><i>- He's a Homunculus.</i>

333
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,365
Oh, you can sense his presence, can you?

334
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,455
That's a pesky ability.
I'll have to eliminate it!

335
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,001
Lan Fan! Get out of here!

336
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,923
Lan Fan!
