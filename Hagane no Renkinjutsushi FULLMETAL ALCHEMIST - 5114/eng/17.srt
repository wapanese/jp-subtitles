1
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,148
This is the bullet that was used
to kill General Hughes.

2
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,736
It's a .45 caliber.
Only one bullet was used.

3
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,156
I'd like to say it was a good shot,
but it was at point-blank range.

4
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,159
Close enough that even a woman
could have done it.

5
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:05,959
- What caliber is the gun that you use?
- .45 caliber.

6
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:12,215
This is your ammunition re-supply request,
is that correct?

7
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:19,431
It says here that you fired one shot.
What was it used for?

8
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:25,062
As it says on there, to protect
Edward Elric at the Fifth Laboratory.

9
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:32,319
The Fifth Laboratory had been closed
and was unmanned.

10
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,945
It was not unmanned.

11
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,448
So you claim.

12
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,412
Shall I request that the bullet
you say you fired be searched for?

13
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,540
The Fifth Laboratory
is now a pile of rubble

14
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,334
because of a mysterious explosion.

15
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,962
So the location where you claim
to have used your gun was unmanned,

16
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,549
and even if we were to search
for the body, it's under a pile of rubble.

17
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,968
Is that what you're saying?

18
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,933
We have an eyewitness testimony
that states that, on that day,

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,645
at the time of the murder,
you were spotted leaving the scene.

20
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,940
- That's preposterous!
- Calm down.

21
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,403
What were you doing at that time?

22
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:18,281
I had that day off
and I was at my parents' house.

23
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,450
Please check with my parents.

24
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,121
The testimonies of your family
and those you are close with

25
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,040
are not admissible as alibis.

26
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,629
Lieutenant Maria Ross
is currently being questioned.

27
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
Not even her superior officer
may be present.

28
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,883
I see.

29
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,014
Major Armstrong!

30
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,643
- Sergeant Brosh...
- You're here too, Major?

31
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,523
- Is this about Lieutenant Ross?
- Yes. The truth is...

32
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,484
The truth is, the lieutenant and I
both fired a single shot

33
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,322
to defend the Elric brothers
at the Fifth Laboratory.

34
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,449
What?

35
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:04,703
I said so in my report,
but it's being rejected.

36
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,500
Are they trying to frame
the lieutenant as the culprit?

37
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,266
When you look closely,
you're full of scratches.

38
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,728
You're having a hard journey, huh?

39
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,152
Say, what are you going to do now?

40
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,656
Hey...

41
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,081
What are we going to do?

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,211
<i>Mama, don't cry.</i>

43
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,721
What would you like us to do?

44
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,726
What?

45
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,482
It's just that you've never asked
for advice about yourselves before.

46
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,867
I was scared.

47
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,206
Ed and Al, you were fighting so long
in such a dangerous place,

48
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,459
the place where Mr. Hughes was killed.

49
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,004
I got really scared
when I thought about it.

50
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:48,265
I mean, you could die. Suddenly,
you wouldn't be around me anymore.

51
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,018
Like Mom and Dad did.

52
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,609
I got really scared
when I thought about that.

53
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,946
To be honest, I wished you
would give up your journey.

54
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,452
I do want you to get your original body,

55
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,830
but I wish you'd give up
your dangerous journey, too.

56
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,957
I mean...

57
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Then again...

58
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,425
Sorry.

59
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,179
I don't know what I want to do, either.

60
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,353
- Winry, you're sure being nice.
- What are you talking about?

61
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:41,318
- I'm always nice! What do you mean?
- Stop! You're adding more scratches.

62
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,450
Here ya go.

63
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,912
- Evening edition!
- Oh, it's here, it's here!

64
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:58,835
- What, the newspaper again?
- I'm stuck hanging out with you all day.

65
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,796
This is about the only pleasure I get.

66
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,511
This is Lieutenant Falman,
calling on an outside line.

67
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,933
Please connect me to Colonel Mustang.
Yes. My code is...

68
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,226
Man, what's all this about?

69
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,897
...Airam, George, Oliver, Four, Six.

70
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,652
This is that chick from back then.

71
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,573
<i>The Philosopher's Stone...</i>

72
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,661
<i>The people with the Uroboros marks...</i>

73
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>Homunculi...</i>

74
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,416
<i>How do they--?</i>

75
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,418
Brother!

76
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,255
- Here.
- Don't startle me like that.

77
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,217
The newspaper at the front desk...

78
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,803
What?

79
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,515
What?

80
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,521
"Lt. Maria Ross found to be the culprit
in Gen. Hughes' murder"?

81
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,358
I can't believe it.

82
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,319
The colonel or the major might know
something about this.

83
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,323
- What about Winry?
- We'll explain later.

84
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,328
I don't like these.

85
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,290
Quit your complaining.
They're like a collar for a mutt.

86
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,378
By the way, I have to ask you again,
are you really 15?

87
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,214
- That's right.
- Get out of here!

88
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,882
It's the truth.

89
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,386
What's that?

90
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,515
- What's the matter?
- There's an intruder! Give us a hand.

91
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,641
What?

92
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,145
- You behave yourself.
- Okay.

93
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,652
Lame! Lame! Lame!
You guys think you're tough?

94
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,823
- What's with this guy?
- Guns don't have any effect.

95
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,367
Move it! Why, you...

96
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,745
"Ghost!"

97
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,373
GHOST!

98
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,592
Man, it sucks not being allowed to cut.

99
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,053
Hello there,
man who isn't affected by guns!

100
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,388
Let me out of here!

101
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,184
- Who are you?
- An illegal immigrant from Xing.

102
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,771
Oh, yeah? Nice going,
coming here from a faraway land.

103
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,564
If you let me out, I'll help you.

104
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,692
I don't have time to bother with--

105
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,572
- Where did you say you were from?
- Xing, to the east.

106
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,285
- Come with me.
- Thanks.

107
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,294
What?

108
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,722
Hello, honey! I finally found you!

109
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,850
You were at the Fifth Laboratory!

110
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,187
I'm so glad you remember me.

111
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,318
Every time I look at the hole
you put in my right hand,

112
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,905
I think of the chick who killed Hughes.

113
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,491
- That's a misunderstanding!
- Is it?

114
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,994
The papers say they found you
to be the culprit.

115
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,454
That can't be...

116
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,873
As it stands,
they're going to pin the guilt on you,

117
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,918
and you'll face a firing squad.

118
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,214
It's not true. It's not true. If they
would just do a proper investigation...

119
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:36,719
Choose. Stay here and be tortured to death
or run away with me.

120
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,555
Choose one or the other.

121
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,350
This is terrible.

122
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,355
- Don't I have any other choices?
- It doesn't look like it.

123
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:55,572
Oh, man. Mom, Dad, I'm sorry.

124
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,869
Okay, I'll run away. I'm running away.

125
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,622
Just make sure you escort me,
you big, dumb armored bonehead!

126
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,666
Oh, you've got spunk.

127
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,460
A girl's gotta have some nerve!

128
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,799
Yes... Yes, as you wish.

129
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,764
Notify every zone in the city.
Maria Ross has broken out.

130
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,226
She appears to be with a violent
companion. Catch them at once.

131
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,440
If she resists,
they are free to shoot to kill.

132
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,866
- How far are we going?
- Just keep running!

133
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,536
Lieutenant Ross?

134
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,040
Edward! Alphonse!

135
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,295
- You're that guy!
- And even Ling is here!

136
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,215
- Hey, guys, what are you up to?
- I was about to ask you that!

137
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,302
Hey! We don't have time for this!

138
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,721
Why, you!

139
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,807
Hey, sweetheart, take that back alley.
Run directly to the warehouse district.

140
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,185
You'll be able to get away
under the cover of darkness!

141
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,229
Lieutenant Ross! Was Colonel Hughes...

142
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,858
Run! If the MPs show up, they'll shoot.

143
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,444
- Lieutenant Ross!
- Stay back!

144
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,781
Lieutenant! Lieutenant Ross!

145
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,965
Maria Ross, right?

146
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,683
- What?
- Oh, they got her.

147
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,685
Hey, wait!

148
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,854
Watch out!

149
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,691
- Let's go, closed-eyes!
- Okie-dokie.

150
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,694
Ling, what are you doing with that guy?

151
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,445
I'll tell you later.

152
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,448
Man!

153
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,457
Yo, Fullmetal.

154
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,965
What's going on here?

155
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,969
What's going on here, Colonel?

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,484
Why?

157
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,988
Why is Colonel Hughes...?

158
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,784
Why did Lieutenant Ross...?
Why didn't you say anything?

159
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,752
You would raise your hand
to your superior officer?

160
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,587
Don't forget your place.

161
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,182
- No, Brother!
- Let me go, Al!

162
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,725
I said no!

163
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,728
- This bastard killed Lieutenant Ross!
- Lieutenant Ross?

164
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,818
What is the meaning of this, Colonel?

165
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,032
There were orders to shoot
the fugitive Maria Ross on sight.

166
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,494
- That's all.
- That's all?

167
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,331
I apologize for hiding Hughes' death.

168
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,211
But do not argue against orders.
Do not ask for explanations.

169
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,213
Just follow them.

170
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,216
That's what a soldier does!

171
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:58,731
Colonel Mustang... Tell me what happened.

172
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,569
The message went out that if she resisted,
we were permitted to shoot to kill.

173
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,156
She resisted, so I killed her.

174
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,828
I understand the brigadier general
was a good friend of yours.

175
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
Yeah.

176
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,998
He was a good guy.

177
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,003
I don't suppose it was one of your men
who broke Lieutenant Ross out.

178
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,466
- Me? Why?
- Why?

179
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,220
So you could burn her to death
by your own hand.

180
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,726
I'd appreciate it
if you avoided such speculation.

181
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,490
I truly am sorry for not telling you
about General Hughes' death.

182
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,370
It's my fault.

183
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,377
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

184
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,301
- You're all together, huh?
- Dr. Knocs...

185
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,304
The damage is severe.

186
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,640
But judging from what little was left
of the dental work,

187
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,809
I was able to conclude
that this was Maria Ross.

188
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,645
It's an awful thing,

189
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,733
turning a beauty like her
into charcoal like this.

190
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,530
You must have held quite a grudge,
Mr. Mustang.

191
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,785
Do you feel better
now that you've taken vengeance?

192
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,836
The hero of the Ishval War
going this far against a little girl...

193
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,755
It makes me sick.

194
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,221
Colonel, let me take this opportunity

195
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,556
to apologize for what one
of my own men did.

196
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,561
To think that Lieutenant Ross
could commit murder...

197
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:08,486
She was such a straightforward,
earnest, considerate woman.

198
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:26,629
Fatigue seems to be catching up with you.
You should take leave.

199
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,925
Back east, where I was.
That's a nice place.

200
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,511
There's no big-city hustle and bustle,

201
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,638
and best of all,
there are lots of beautiful women.

202
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:49,443
And so, Mustang handily avenges
his brother.

203
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,154
And all's well that ends well.

204
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,615
Don't you think the ending is a little...?

205
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,327
The plan was supposed to get
the colonel to behave himself.

206
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,790
Who cares? The dog eating the bait
works out pretty slick, too.

207
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,295
Besides, it looks like
we came across a little antagonism.

208
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,298
There's no love lost between him
and his subordinates, is there?

209
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,175
What's that?

210
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,428
A request for leave.

211
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,265
- At a time like this?
- Is it out of line?

212
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,769
- No, it's fine. Approved.
- Thank you very much.

213
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,746
All right, you, going out
on your own like that...

214
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,415
What would the colonel say to me
if you were found out?

215
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:49,462
- Nobody saw me when I came back.
- That's not the issue here!

216
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,798
You're just a poor soldier

217
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,469
held captive by a heinous criminal,
so it's all right.

218
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,516
Yo! What are you up to out there?

219
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,977
- A signal fire.
- A signal fire?

220
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,939
What were you thinking, bringing someone
you know nothing about back here?

221
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,859
Young Lord! We've been looking for you.

222
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,196
- Oh, that was fast.
- Now there's even more.

223
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,037
Hey, Elizabeth, how are you?

224
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,289
<i>Thanks so much for calling me.</i>

225
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>Are you sure your scary adjutant
</i><i>won't get mad at you</i>

226
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,669
<i>if you blow off too much work?</i>

227
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,672
That's okay, she's not in.

228
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,801
And I'm able to call you like this
because she isn't.

229
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,095
How about that?

230
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,723
The moment the lieutenant goes on leave,
he gets like this.

231
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,603
Man, she really is like his nanny, huh?

232
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:52,692
That's right. I haven't had a day off
since I got here,

233
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,610
so I'm thinking about going on leave.

234
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:59,865
<i>- Are you going somewhere?
- Lately, I've been caught up in fishing.</i>

235
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,035
Care to come along?

236
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,381
Yes? Who is it?

237
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,472
What did you do that for, Major?

238
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,225
Edward Elric...

239
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,816
This is bad. You've broken your automail.

240
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,488
This is a serious situation.
We'll have to repair this at once.

241
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,826
Allow me to escort you to Resembool.

242
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,372
- What's this?
- You're going home to Resembool?

243
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,750
Oh, Al, listen to me.

244
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:56,630
Alphonse Elric, you would stand out there.
Remain in Central.

245
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,715
- Right.
- All right!

246
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,927
Let's make arrangements for the train
right away! Come along, Edward Elric.

247
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,726
Cut it out already, Major.

248
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,145
I can't do that.

249
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,397
These are my orders...

250
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,942
<i>...from him.</i>

251
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,863
Yes. Roger that.

252
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,909
Major Armstrong and Edward Elric
have gotten aboard the train.

253
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,244
I see.

254
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,416
<i>Now, everyone is out of the way.</i>

255
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,385
I made contact with a witness who saw
the man who stormed the lockup.

256
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,805
And... this is a sketch of the culprit.

257
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,307
Oh, he's still alive, then.

258
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,519
Any link to the Flame Colonel?

259
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,356
Who knows? I'd say the chances
are pretty good, though.

260
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,733
Where did he run to?

261
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,695
Well, he ran away quickly
and he's good at hiding.

262
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,907
In other words, you don't know.
You're lying.

263
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,369
Shut up, you old biddy.
I was short on manpower.

264
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,037
Manpower?

265
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,749
You've got plenty of manpower,
right, honey?

266
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,130
Come on. You're on, Barry the Chopper.
