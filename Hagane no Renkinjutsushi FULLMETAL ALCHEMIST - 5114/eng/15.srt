1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,096
You would challenge the Silver Alchemist
Giolio Comanche to battle?

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,057
You've got guts.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,433
However...

4
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,555
Not bad at all.
You got off with just a scratch.

5
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,892
Just a scratch, was it?

6
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,211
What the hell is this?

7
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,297
Oh, sir, you're back?

8
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,007
What is this?

9
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,133
Pleased to meet you.

10
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,969
My name is May Chang.

11
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,563
As I had collapsed by the roadside,
your master, Mr. Yoki, saved me.

12
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,607
Master?

13
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,489
If you've recovered,
then be on your way at once.

14
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,458
What?

15
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,627
Let me close up your wound.

16
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,894
It's healed!

17
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,647
This is alkahestry from the land of Xing.

18
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,649
Xing?

19
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,278
That's right. She says she crossed
the great desert to the east

20
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,238
all by herself to come here.

21
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,365
Ridiculous, isn't it?

22
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,242
I wasn't all by myself!

23
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,119
It was me and her!

24
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,041
Her? You mean that little thing?

25
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,252
That's right. This is Shao May.

26
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,717
This is alkahestry, right?

27
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,470
The art of reading the dragon's pulse,

28
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,723
the power that flows
through the earth, and using it.

29
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,436
This tattoo matches up
with the flow of alkahestry from my land.

30
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:37,569
My brother researched
both alkahestry and alchemy.

31
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,781
This tattoo is the result of his research.

32
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,326
My, your brother
is really outstanding, isn't he?

33
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:53,210
I'm not sure what any of this is,
but your wound is now healed.

34
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,338
So now,
we can go to Central without trouble.

35
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,757
In that case, let's get ready.

36
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,552
See here! He told you to get going, right?

37
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,514
We're not going there for the fun of it.

38
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,140
But I'm serious about this too.

39
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,685
You mean that immortality affair
you spoke of earlier?

40
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,479
There's no such thing.

41
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,523
Yes, there is! That's why I'm here!

42
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,442
Shut up! A kid should act like a kid--

43
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>Immortality could not be attained
</i><i>through alkahestry.</i>

44
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>But by using alchemy...</i>

45
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:32,165
<i>That's why I have to meet the man
</i><i>I've heard so much about.</i>

46
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,088
<i>With golden hair, golden eyes,
</i><i>gallantly sporting a red coat,</i>

47
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,008
<i>brilliantly saving others,
</i><i>that gifted alchemist,</i>

48
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,261
<i>Sir Edward Elric!</i>

49
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,765
What do we do, sir?

50
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,521
Suit yourself.

51
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,618
What's the matter, Black Hayate?

52
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,333
It's dangerous to be out
walking alone at this hour.

53
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:23,675
If you do, you'll get attacked by me,
Barry the Chopper!

54
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,849
What'd you go and do that for?

55
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,730
Damn it! Then how do you like this?

56
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,364
Whoa, how come you're not surprised?

57
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,908
Because I know someone similar to you.

58
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,870
Similar? You mean,
that Alphonse what's-his-face guy?

59
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,873
You know Alphonse?

60
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,794
So you're a friend of his, huh?

61
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:04,924
You know, sweetheart,
you're pretty strong.

62
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,181
<i>The Philosopher's Stone.</i>

63
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,353
To think that the Fifth Laboratory
was involved in making them.

64
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,939
There's a possibility
that the military's senior staff

65
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,941
is connected as well.

66
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,944
Plus, there are those others,
Lust and Envy.

67
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,072
Are they the ones
who turned you into that?

68
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,741
Nah, it was the researchers.

69
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,828
They ripped my soul
out of my body by force.

70
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,706
If we look into those researchers,

71
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,125
we might be able to find out the identity
of whoever ordered the experiments.

72
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,544
No chance.

73
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,589
Those guys were all used
to make Philosopher's Stones with,

74
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,299
and there's not a single one of them left.

75
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,681
Both hushing them up and using them
as ingredients. How economical.

76
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,310
Does this mean there's no need
to make the stones anymore?

77
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,313
Let me ask you one last thing.

78
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,319
Are you the one
who killed a military officer

79
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,072
at a telephone booth in Central
a little over a month ago?

80
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,035
Don't know about that.
Was he all chopped up?

81
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,664
No.

82
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,041
If you don't know about it, never mind.

83
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,296
Yo, Miss Winry!

84
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,217
We appear to find you
in good spirits today.

85
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,888
Ed, Al!
What are you up to, popping in like this?

86
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,314
Good grief.

87
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,359
Even Paninya is holding down
an honest job now, and look at you.

88
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,861
Paninya is?

89
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,072
Yeah, she's given up pick-pocketing

90
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:56,119
and is now making a living fixing roofs
and other work in high places.

91
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,623
What about you guys?
Made any progress?

92
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,461
Yeah, we're taking the long way, though.

93
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,465
We're moving ahead, little by little.

94
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,383
I guess.

95
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,970
Okay. Good, then.

96
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,974
There, the first aid is done.

97
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,434
Thank you, Winry.

98
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,978
We're short on parts right now
so make do with that for the time being.

99
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll go get them right now,
so would you mind killing a little time?

100
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,735
Yeah, but...

101
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,867
this place has nothing but automail shops.

102
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,248
- Al?
- Brother.

103
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,920
What, did you find another cat
or something?

104
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,546
Yeah.

105
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,718
Ah, I feel alive again!

106
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,054
You guys saved my life. Thank you.

107
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,430
And thanks for treating.

108
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,891
I never said I was treating.

109
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,936
- Don't worry over such a little thing.
- Don't say "little"!

110
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,691
You know, I sure am glad
for kindness found in foreign lands.

111
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,653
Foreign lands? You're a foreigner?

112
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,030
Yeah. I came from Xing.

113
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,533
Xing?

114
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,868
You mean, the large country to the east?

115
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,664
Yeah. Man, crossing the desert was rough.

116
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,291
Why on earth would you take that route?

117
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,962
Because I wanted to see the ruins
of Xerxes?

118
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,964
Xerxes?

119
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,259
I'd heard there was nothing there.

120
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,302
I just looked around a little.

121
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,472
I came to this country to check out things
relating to alkahestry.

122
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,723
Alkahestry?

123
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,477
Ah, I think you call it alchemy
in this country.

124
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,939
<i>In our country, it's called "alkahestry,"</i>

125
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,608
<i>and it's a prominent art
</i><i>in the medical field.</i>

126
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,987
<i>Huh. Different lands, different style.</i>

127
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,739
Here, it has lots of military uses.

128
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,077
<i>Even now, there are unending skirmishes
</i><i>near the borders</i>

129
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>of Aerugo to the south and Creta to west.</i>

130
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>We face the huge country
</i><i>of Drachma to the north.</i>

131
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,837
<i>We have a tentative nonaggression treaty
</i><i>with them.</i>

132
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,840
<i>Briggs Mountain is in the way
</i><i>and that keeps them from attacking.</i>

133
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,508
<i>But our relationship is still dicey.</i>

134
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,761
What a restless country.

135
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,306
I'd say things started tending more
to the military

136
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,809
once the current FÃ¼hrer, Bradley,
came to power.

137
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,186
I have to admit, though,

138
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,107
I'm interested
in this medically-specialized alkahestry.

139
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,025
You bet.

140
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,237
By any chance, are you guys alchemists?

141
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,910
Oh, yes.
I am Edward Elric, State Alchemist.

142
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:46,289
I am his brother, Alphonse Elric.
Pleased to meet you.

143
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,750
I'm Ling Yao. My pleasure.

144
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,546
Say, Ling,
tell us more about this alkahestry.

145
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,383
I can't. I'm not an alkahestrist.

146
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,306
If you're not an alkahestrist,
what did you come to investigate?

147
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,058
I'm kind of looking for something.

148
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,686
Maybe you might know of it.

149
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,813
The Philosopher's Stone?

150
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,317
I really want it badly.

151
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,528
Do you know anything about it?

152
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,449
Nope, we don't know.

153
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,619
Looks to me like you do know.

154
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,540
I wonder if you'd tell me about it.

155
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,418
What are you going to use
the Philosopher's Stone for?

156
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,967
I'm looking for the way
to gain immortality.

157
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,847
So would you tell me about it?

158
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,976
Immortality. What a bunch of nonsense.

159
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,686
I'm serious.

160
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,064
In any case, is this the attitude you take
when you ask people for things?

161
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,149
I don't think so!

162
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,738
Brother!

163
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,323
You defy us too?

164
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,658
Hold on!

165
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,791
You jerk. What are you, an acrobat?

166
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,919
Maybe it's a "Xingese" fighting style.
Must be challenging.

167
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,213
- Even so...
- Yeah.

168
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,966
- They're not as strong...
- As Teacher!

169
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,054
Huh?

170
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,976
Off they go.

171
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,980
- Pops, add on some dessert, okay?
- Sure.

172
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,507
Yikes.

173
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,183
Damn.

174
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,061
Bringing up the Philosopher's Stone
and immortality,

175
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,313
then picking a fight with us
out of nowhere like this--!

176
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,650
What are you up to?
Both you and that closed-eyed idiot?

177
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,199
Whoa, I hit him. Yow!

178
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,245
Ouch...

179
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:37,835
<i>As soon as I called that bastard
</i><i>a closed-eyed idiot...</i>

180
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,546
<i>I see.</i>

181
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,926
Ah, long time no see, Paninya!

182
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,011
What on earth are you up to?

183
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,305
Then again, I have a pretty good idea.

184
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,308
Oh, right, Paninya,
I have a favor I need to ask.

185
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,978
Strange. I don't sense the flow of chi

186
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,731
that any living person
should have from this suit of armor.

187
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,566
What exactly is...?

188
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,072
Did you think it would do any good
to bring others to your side?

189
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,573
You fool!

190
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,705
What's wrong, what's wrong?
I'm starting to predict your movements!

191
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,460
If this is the best
his flunkies can manage,

192
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,922
that Ling bastard
must not be all that special either!

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,807
Sure enough, as soon as I put down
his master, he suddenly loses his cool.

194
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,559
Once that happens...

195
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,146
his attacks become dull and overblown!

196
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,734
Now then, I think it's about time...

197
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,571
I had a look at your face!

198
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,657
You're a girl?

199
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,172
<i>A cannon in her prosthetic limb?</i>

200
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,590
<i>This country
</i><i>is something to be reckoned with.</i>

201
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,468
What?

202
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,143
Hmm, well, for my first time,
I guess that's what you'd expect.

203
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,062
Alkahestry, without an array?

204
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,317
Now then.
I wonder if brother is all right?

205
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,823
I overdid it.

206
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,244
What do I do?
Master Ling is going to yell at me.

207
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,586
Hey, girly.

208
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,381
How could you use something like that
in the middle of town?

209
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,008
If it hadn't been me,
you could have killed someone.

210
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,928
You removed your own arm?

211
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,598
I chased a lot of rabbits around
as a kid.

212
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,892
So setting traps is a cinch for me.

213
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,435
Brother!

214
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,312
Hey, Al.

215
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,105
Okay, good work, everyone.

216
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,525
Why, you--? How can you be so carefree?

217
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,402
Wow, you guys are good.

218
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,864
How about if you come and work for me
and we'll rule the whole country?

219
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,576
Enough of your blathering!
You go back to Xing, right now--

220
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,911
Oh, there they are!

221
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,290
You've done quite a number,
wrecking the town, haven't you?

222
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,625
You're paying for the damages.

223
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,168
And your dinner bill.

224
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,379
Just a minute.

225
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,006
Have this guy and his entourage pay
for the food and damages.

226
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:34,053
I no understand this country language.
Goodbye.

227
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,846
Hey, you, wait the hell up!

228
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,598
Huh?

229
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,058
Ah! He ran away!

230
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,310
This one too!

231
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,941
Aw, man. How can I fix things
in the shape I'm in?

232
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,152
It's okay, brother. I'll do it.

233
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,366
So you can do it now
without transmutation circles?

234
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,536
I think it's because I got my memories
about the truth back.

235
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,747
Which means...

236
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,999
ALCHEMIC TECHNIQUE
OLDER BROTHER'S DIGNITY

237
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,500
HEIGHT

238
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,212
OLDER BROTHER'S DIGNITY

239
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,048
Leave the rest to me.

240
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,343
What's the matter, brother?

241
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,013
We're back!

242
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,056
Hey, we meet again.

243
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,686
Don't just sit there drinking tea!

244
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,105
How cruel, even though we're friends.

245
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:31,193
Who are you calling "friend"?
Those two gave us a real hard time.

246
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,779
Let it go. I'll give them
a good talking-to later.

247
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,950
<i>The girl's name is Lan Fan,
</i><i>and the old man is Fu.</i>

248
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,077
Those two are from a family

249
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,747
that has served us for generations,
so accept their regards.

250
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,626
For someone
who shakes down others for food,

251
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,045
you must have considerable status
to have two attendants.

252
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,006
Well, I am the emperor's son.

253
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,508
Huh? The emperor's son?

254
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,513
You mean you're a...

255
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,307
prince?

256
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,021
Usually, one would be surprised by that.

257
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,315
Oh, sorry. It was just so unexpected.

258
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,567
Imagine, the guy who collapsed
by the side of the road

259
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,444
and freeloaded a meal out of us
being the son of an emperor--

260
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,367
I won't allow you to speak ill of Master.

261
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,619
You are here?

262
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,872
Okay, sure,
maybe it's not all that surprising.

263
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,625
The emperor has many sons.

264
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,297
Xing is a nation made up
of 50 different clans

265
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,425
with an emperor reigning
over them at the top.

266
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,720
<i>Also, the daughter of each clan's chief
</i><i>is wed to the emperor,</i>

267
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,305
<i>and bears his children.</i>

268
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:47,687
The current emperor has 24 sons
and 19 daughters.

269
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,730
I am the 12th among them.

270
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,692
Forty-three children...

271
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,277
Is there any competition
to be his successor?

272
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,114
That is indeed a problem
that we are faced with right now.

273
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,159
The emperor is in fairly poor health.

274
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,122
Each clan is going all-out to try
and kiss up to him while they still can.

275
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,248
Which is what I'm up to also.

276
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,127
You're going to use the method
of gaining immortality to entice him.

277
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,128
You are correct.

278
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,257
Okay? So tell me some information
about the Philosopher's Stone.

279
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,428
No way. The Philosopher's Stone
is not a tool for you to get ahead!

280
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,597
Tell me or I'll tag along
with you forever.

281
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,807
Don't you tag along!

282
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,475
I'm back!

283
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,895
There was some kind of huge commotion
on the main street

284
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,480
so it took a while to--

285
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,612
Why is it broken off?

286
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,323
Why, you--! Why, you--! Why, you--

287
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,658
I'm sorry!

288
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,993
Young Lord!

289
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,498
There is no need for you to bow your head
to someone so beneath you.

290
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,919
If all it takes is me bowing my head,
it's a small price to pay, right?

291
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,131
The fate of 500,000 Yao clansmen
are riding on this.

292
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,718
We can't be so fussy about appearances.

293
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,139
So where are you going to break
your automail this time?

294
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,433
You just assume I'll break it?

295
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,269
We were thinking
of looking around in Central.

296
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,480
Huh? You're going to Central?

297
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,523
I want to go, I want to go!

298
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,775
What are you going there for?

299
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,652
I want to go to Mr. Hughes' place
to visit.

300
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,530
But, Winry, you have to work, don't you?

301
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,450
That's okay, Winry.

302
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,160
You should take a breather
once in a while.

303
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,038
Really? Thank you, Mr. Garfiel!

304
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,541
- Okay then, why don't we all...
- Go to Central.

305
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,668
Yeah.

306
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,588
I can't wait to see Central!

307
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,091
I told you, you're not tagging along!

308
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,765
So she's tagging along with us after all.

309
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:54,104
By the way, sir,
you still haven't told me your name.

310
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,190
Won't you please tell me?

311
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,571
The Ishvalan people take pride
when they speak their names,

312
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,073
as they are a gift from God.

313
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,326
Well, well, sir,
yours must be a fine name.

314
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,578
As such, I have renounced my name.

315
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,332
Go! Keep moving!

316
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,834
Yes, sir!

317
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,837
If this is to be a road
from which I cannot return,

318
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:22,800
then I will leave behind
all that I have received from God.
