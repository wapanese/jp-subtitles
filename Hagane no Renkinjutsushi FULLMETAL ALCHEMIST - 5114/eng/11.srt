00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>Alchemy is the science
</i><i>of understanding, decomposing,</i>

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>and reconstructing matter.</i>

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,343
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,765
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,</i>

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,893
<i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,812
<i>This is the concept
</i><i>of equivalent exchange,</i>

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>the fundamental basis of alchemy.</i>

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,152
<i>Alchemists have a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

10
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

11
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>Maes Hughes is dead.</i>

12
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,713
<i>He was murdered by mysterious people
</i><i>with Uroboros tattoos.</i>

13
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,798
<i>Harboring suspicions about his death,</i>

14
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,093
<i>Mustang learns of the
</i><i>military senior staff's involvement,</i>

15
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,972
<i>and reaffirms his determination
</i><i>to make his foray into Central.</i>

16
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>Meanwhile, unaware of what had happened,</i>

17
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,852
<i>Ed and Al, along with Winry,
</i><i>had departed southward,</i>

18
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:28,857
<i>toward the town of Dublith,
</i><i>where their teacher lived.</i>

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,983
<i>However...</i>

20
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,991
Rush Valley!

21
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,493
Automail!

22
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,994
Automail!

23
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,496
Automail!

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,375
I'm so happy!

25
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,380
It's the Gods '11 model!

26
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,464
GASP

27
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,967
I never thought the day would come
where I'd behold it with my own eyes!

28
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,931
That's the Holy Land of Automail for you.

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,974
This place is bustling.

30
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,353
Why do we have to come out
in all this freaking heat,

31
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,730
and look at automail?

32
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,734
We should have left Winry behind,
and gone straight to Dublith!

33
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,737
You there, you have a second?

34
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,990
What an unusual model of automail.

35
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,493
It really is. Everyone, come look at this.

36
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,248
Hey, hold on! Stop, stop that!

37
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,332
SWARM
JOSTLE

38
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,335
No, don't undo that! That's--!

39
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,588
Everyone's eager to study them.

40
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,840
Stop screwing around!

41
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,676
Geez.

42
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,760
BADGER
AWESOME, HE'S HUGE

43
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,220
This is why I can't stand
automail engineers.

44
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,265
Huh?

45
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,558
What is it?

46
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,102
It's gone...

47
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,354
What is?

48
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,773
The thing that proves
I'm a State Alchemist.

49
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,693
My silver watch is gone!

50
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,281
That must be the work of Paninya.

51
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,449
Paninya?

52
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,076
A pickpocket that targets tourists
as her marks.

53
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,248
Do you know where she might be?
That thing is important!

54
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,001
We'll tell you...

55
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,587
But in return...

56
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,590
Show us your automail once again.

57
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,344
The shop of an automail engineer
named Dominic.

58
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,977
They say he lives deep in the mountains

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,021
because he can get
high-quality ores out here.

60
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:36,818
Is this really the right way?
They didn't trick us, did they?

61
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,574
This is all because you said you wanted
to go see that town, you know!

62
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,660
It's your own inattentiveness
that allowed your watch to be stolen!

63
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,370
Shut up!

64
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,039
- Hey, both of you!
- What?

65
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,208
Isn't that her?

66
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,886
I've found you!

67
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,030
Give it back!

68
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,033
Amazing. Who are you, mister?

69
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,036
I'm an alchemist!

70
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,125
Amazing, amazing!

71
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,420
Stop moving around!

72
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,382
Come on, come on,
you're starting to breathe hard.

73
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,135
I've been waiting for you.

74
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,771
Nicely done.

75
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,149
Now, why don't you give me back my watch?

76
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,323
It's not all that unusual, is it?
Not in this town.

77
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,533
By the way...

78
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,830
I have a 1.5-inch culverin in my left leg.

79
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,126
- Wait!
- Just try to catch me!

80
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,923
I'm not gonna let you get away.

81
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,635
Nice work, Winry! Don't let go of her!

82
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,553
SQUEEZE

83
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,762
Yeah, as if I'd let go!

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,434
Not until you let me have
a closer look at your automail!

85
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,690
Oh, Paninya,

86
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,525
friends of yours?

87
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,278
- I'm so gonna study those!
- Not exactly.

88
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,910
I've never seen automail like this.

89
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,537
It has an advanced suspension,

90
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:57,667
but more than anything, it's the balance!

91
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,211
- This streamlined design is true art--
- About my silver watch...

92
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,296
RUB
EEP

93
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,505
It's no use, brother.

94
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,218
I really respect you for being able
to make automail like this.

95
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,597
Oh, I'm not the one who made this.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,265
I am.

97
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,524
Isn't that a bit heavy?

98
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,652
Yes, it is.

99
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,279
It's no good to place a strain
on your wearer.

100
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,657
That's why this guy's so small, ain't it?

101
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,824
Don't call me small!

102
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:30,825
AH!

103
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,455
So you're saying that if these
were made lighter, I would grow taller?

104
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,831
It's possible.

105
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,918
Brother, you're so big!

106
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,711
So tall!

107
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,629
HA HA HA HA

108
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,172
You guys sure are small.

109
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,009
Hmm, that settles it, all right.

110
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,970
Mr. Dominic...

111
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,764
Please take me on as an apprentice!

112
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,766
Not a chance.

113
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,561
If you would take some time to consider...

114
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,772
Cork it. I don't take apprentices.

115
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:05,068
Could you at least see your way
to teaching her how to make automail

116
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,529
so that I can grow taller?

117
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,780
Shut up, water flea.

118
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:20,041
Sorry about that.
My old man is pretty stubborn.

119
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,923
Water flea... Water flea...

120
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,009
Water flea...

121
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,766
You're having a baby, right?

122
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,768
That's right.

123
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,147
Would it be okay if I touched your tummy?

124
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,107
Go ahead.

125
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,921
It seems so miraculous somehow.

126
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:12,552
Yeah. To think that we were once
inside Mom's tummy like this too.

127
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,181
Are you okay?

128
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,016
Yes.

129
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,733
My stumps always ache
when the weather turns bad.

130
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,860
How did you end up with automail?

131
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,533
I was in a train accident,
and my parents were killed.

132
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,912
I lost both my legs.

133
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,333
Not only could I not walk anymore,
I didn't have anyone to turn to,

134
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,419
so it felt like my world had ended.

135
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,341
That's when I met Mr. Dominic.

136
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,482
You look like you're the most miserable
person in the world.

137
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,068
Nothing grates on me
more than people like you!

138
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,737
Let me go! Let me go!

139
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,281
"Eyes of a dead person..."

140
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,244
At the time,
I'm sure I really did look miserable.

141
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,248
So without ever really understanding why,

142
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,834
I was outfitted with automail.

143
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,253
The surgery was painful,

144
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,673
the rehabilitation was hard,
it was as bad as anything could be.

145
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,133
But...

146
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,265
<i>When I was able to stand
</i><i>on two legs again, I was so happy.</i>

147
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,062
I really am grateful to Mr. Dominic.

148
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,525
I plan to pay him back,
even if it takes my whole life.

149
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,988
He's never once accepted
any money from me, though.

150
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,073
Which is why you're a pickpocket.

151
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,828
If you're really grateful to him,
stop picking pockets!

152
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,166
Mr. Dominic gave you these legs
out of his good will.

153
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,420
So you have to live up
to that with good will too.

154
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,797
If you're ready to spend your whole life,

155
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,677
then don't pick pockets,
stand up tall on those legs, and work!

156
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,183
I'm sure that by doing that,
you'll please Mr. Dominic too.

157
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,106
Yeah. You're right.

158
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,817
Yeah, I'm giving up picking pockets.

159
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,903
I'll work honestly, and pay him back!

160
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,406
Oh, that's right.
I have to give this back.

161
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,449
Right!

162
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,038
Huh? Oh, I may have broken it.

163
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,623
It won't open.

164
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,041
Let me see.

165
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,420
No, you didn't.
It's been closed up with alchemy.

166
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,422
Why?

167
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,965
Isn't that obvious?

168
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,845
It's because there's something in here
he'd be embarrassed to have anyone see!

169
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,097
HM, HM, HM, HM

170
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,557
It's open!

171
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,977
Now, let's have a look at Ed's treasure.

172
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,443
"Don't forget, October 3rd, '11."

173
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,736
What's that?

174
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,659
Give this back to Ed.

175
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,452
Winry?

176
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,828
I...

177
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm going to go ask Mr. Dominic
if I can be his apprentice again.

178
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,717
What's the matter?

179
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,469
The ba...

180
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,054
The bay?

181
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,889
The ba... the ba...

182
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,891
What about the bay?

183
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,559
The... the...

184
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,478
The baby's coming! Mrs. Satera said so!

185
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,030
In this rain, we can't take her
to a hospital in town.

186
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,241
I'll dash over there,
and call for a doctor.

187
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,789
Pop will be right back with a doctor.

188
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,958
Just hang on a little while longer, okay?

189
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,626
Hang on?

190
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,920
It'll come whenever it comes--

191
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,839
What's the matter?

192
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,551
Huh?

193
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,931
Hmm? What was that? I didn't hear.

194
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,686
It's coming!

195
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,938
It's coming?

196
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,524
What do we do? The doctor isn't here!

197
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,656
- We'll just have to do it.
- Do what?

198
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,949
Deliver it.

199
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,788
Have you ever been there
when a baby was born?

200
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,585
No, but we don't have
any time to dither around.

201
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,171
Everyone, help me out here.

202
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,631
We're going to deliver this baby!

203
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,719
- Ed and Al, go boil some water.
- You got it!

204
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,096
Paninya, gather up
as many towels as you can.

205
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,598
Roger!

206
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,976
Mr. Ridel,
do you have any disinfectant alcohol?

207
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,020
I think there were some in the storeroom.

208
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,024
Ah, and some drinking water
for Mrs. Satera, at her bedside!

209
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,447
Say, is she okay in there?

210
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,409
She comes from a family of doctors.

211
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,163
She grew up reading medical-related
books instead of picture books.

212
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,793
But it's not as though she
actually learned anything, did she?

213
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,463
I'd guess whatever she knows,
she just vaguely remembers.

214
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,464
Ah, jeez...

215
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,007
But right now,

216
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,885
all we can do is defer
to her knowledge and nerve!

217
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,812
Boil water, disinfect...
What else was there?

218
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,066
Remember... remember...

219
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,275
Winry.

220
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,820
Good luck!

221
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,782
Yeah.

222
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,829
- Paninya, give me a hand in here.
- Okay.

223
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,839
Brother...

224
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,469
Right now, when it really counts,
I can't do anything.

225
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,724
It hurts!

226
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,227
I'm gonna die here!

227
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,728
COWER

228
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,732
It hurts! I can't take any more!

229
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,989
I know we don't believe in God...

230
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,657
Yeah.

231
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,994
But just this once,
for God's sake, please...

232
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,469
Brother!

233
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,304
Hey...

234
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,098
The blood...

235
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,434
I can't go on anymore.

236
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,648
Hey, what's going on?

237
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,331
The baby's been born!

238
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,334
Hooray!

239
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,086
Awesome! The baby really has been born.

240
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,132
- Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
- "Awesome, awesome!"

241
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,635
What a childish sentiment.

242
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,346
But this is the birth of a new life.

243
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,266
Alchemists have been working for centuries
and we still haven't accomplished that,

244
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,352
a person creating another person.

245
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,481
Don't go lumping alchemy in
with the mysteries of life!

246
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,983
I can't help it.
It's the line of work I'm in.

247
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:13,074
Still, it really is awesome.
People are awesome.

248
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,995
Now then, the baby has been safely born,

249
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,373
is there anything else I can do now?

250
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,166
Yes, there is.

251
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,961
You can start by picking me up.

252
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,045
UNABLE TO STAND UP

253
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,425
It's humiliating, being carried
by a man smaller than me.

254
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,885
I'll drop you.

255
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,097
Ed...

256
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,352
I saw what was inside your silver watch.

257
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,398
It hurts.

258
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,068
You forced it open?

259
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,907
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,040
You dumbass.

261
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,010
I haven't even shown it to Al.

262
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,012
Why?

263
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,975
It's my resolve, and admonition to myself.

264
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,186
I hate to admit what a pansy I am,

265
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,689
having to put what happened
that day in this form

266
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,733
so I can carry it around with me.

267
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,075
What are you crying for?

268
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:51,589
- There's no turning back for us now, huh?
- Yeah.

269
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,316
<i>What are you crying for?</i>

270
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,488
You two brothers won't cry,
so I'm doing it for you.

271
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,157
Dumbass.

272
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,329
You should go back to the countryside.

273
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,748
Granny must be lonesome all by herself.

274
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,708
No. I'm not leaving.

275
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,335
Hey, now...

276
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,421
Not after I saw your resolve, Ed.

277
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,676
I can't live with myself being
only half-committed either.

278
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,429
There's no reason for you
to be involved too.

279
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:47,311
I want to hone my skills,
and make you some better automail,

280
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,690
so that you can continue your journey
with peace of mind, Ed.

281
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,861
That's why I'm going to ask Mr. Dominic
to accept me as his apprentice again.

282
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,824
Okay.

283
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,283
Good luck.

284
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,785
Yeah.

285
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,706
Winry, Mr. Ridel said he'd like you
to come over for a minute.

286
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,958
Huh? What's the matter?

287
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,586
Oh, it's nothing. I'll be right there.

288
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,838
Paninya...

289
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,260
Ouch! What was that for?

290
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,555
Shut up and give me
my silver watch back, you thief!

291
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,432
<i>You didn't have to hit me
</i><i>with your right arm!</i>

292
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,560
<i>Then I'll hit you again with my left!</i>

293
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,314
I'm your granddaddy!

294
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,316
You sure are cute!

295
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,401
MUSHY

296
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,944
That's out of character.

297
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,280
Mother and baby are both doing just fine.

298
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,865
Postnatal treatment
has also been appropriate.

299
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,744
Being present at a childbirth is something
that even adults freak out over.

300
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,580
Oh, well, we were desperate.

301
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,461
We really are in your debt.
Especially the young lady.

302
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,463
Thanks.

303
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,632
Please, no need to be so formal.

304
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,010
Aw, gosh, now I'm gonna blush.

305
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,428
PING!

306
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,223
What do you say?
Just this once, take on an apprentice?

307
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,018
This doesn't have anything
to do with that.

308
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,895
I don't take on apprentices.

309
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,565
But...

310
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,860
if you insist, I can refer you
to an accomplished engineer

311
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,528
who lives at the base of the mountain.

312
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:27,578
Would it be okay if I came by
once in a while to watch you work?

313
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,456
If you were to come by once
in a while to see my grandchild,

314
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,082
that would be okay.

315
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,627
Same goes for the tomboy, there.

316
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,592
Yikes! We gotta hurry!

317
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,638
If we miss this one, the next one
to Dublith isn't for three days!

318
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,391
- Be careful!
- You too!

319
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,814
Make sure you call Granny!

320
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,858
You're a fine one to talk!

321
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,986
You steal all
of that old man's techniques,

322
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,032
and make me something better
next time we meet, okay?

323
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,957
They're gone.

324
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,459
Don't you worry about it.
