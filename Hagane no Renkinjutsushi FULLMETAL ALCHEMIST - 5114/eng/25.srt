1
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,970
Hey, is anyone here?

2
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,391
Al! Answer me!

3
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,895
Where is this place? Damn.

4
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,065
Ling, you dumb prince!

5
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,650
Dumb? What do you mean, dumb?

6
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,987
Ling?

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,239
What a thing to call
the prince of a nation!

8
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,033
You're all right?

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,496
- You're...
- What?

10
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:06,251
- You're not Envy, turned into him, right?
- Now, look...

11
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,297
If you want, I can recite the entire
hotel room service menu!

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,590
All right, it's really you.

13
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,634
What about you?

14
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,802
You're not a fake, are you? You bean--

15
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,472
Who're you calling a bean-sized runt?

16
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,223
All right, it's really you.

17
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,773
I have to ask, where is this place?

18
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,403
<i>I'm pretty sure we were swallowed whole
</i><i>by Gluttony back there.</i>

19
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,991
There's no way the inside of his belly
could be as big as this.

20
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,576
Yeah, but...

21
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,995
Look.

22
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,749
That's the run-down house we were just in.

23
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,959
What's more, over here is...

24
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,462
The lieutenant's car?

25
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,008
The fires all around
are probably the colonel's, aren't they?

26
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,593
<i>Yeah.</i>

27
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,973
Which means,
we really are inside Gluttony's belly?

28
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,350
I don't know.

29
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,353
But it is pretty clear
that this isn't a good place.

30
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,521
Let me borrow this.

31
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,272
What's wrong?

32
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,320
Ling, look at this.

33
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,322
Is that Al's?

34
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:22,702
If it's just his hand,
that means that Al wasn't swallowed.

35
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,329
Thank goodness.

36
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,040
I'll bet Al's worried, though.

37
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:32,170
He doesn't know where we are, either.

38
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,385
Awaken conveniently, my telepathic powers!

39
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
Elric Telepathy!

40
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,348
- Come in, my brother!
- You can just do that by yourself.

41
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,398
There are all sorts of buildings
and skeletons scattered around.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,692
The time periods are all mixed up, though.

43
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,403
Is there even a way out of here
in the first place?

44
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,864
I don't know.
If there isn't, I'll make us one.

45
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,491
Make us one? Where?

46
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,372
- All right, let's have the torch.
- I've got it.

47
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,332
Let's see.

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,426
I didn't hear it hit bottom.

49
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,720
The wall! Let's find a wall!

50
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,514
Yeah! However big this space may be,

51
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,933
if we keep going straight,
we'll reach the edge of it!

52
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,228
We should then find an exit!

53
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,648
I didn't find her.

54
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,989
Where could Shao May have gone?

55
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,533
Are you sure she wasn't eaten
by a stray dog, or something?

56
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,285
Stray...?

57
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,789
Sorry, I was kidding!

58
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,791
She...

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,169
Shao May is a giant bearcat,

60
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,631
who was sick from birth
and never grew very big.

61
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,801
I took her in when her mother
abandoned her.

62
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,055
Ever since, we've grown up together,
like sisters.

63
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,517
<i>My clan, the Chang clan,</i>

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,395
<i>is the lowest-ranked clan in all of Xing,</i>

65
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>and we wield next to no power.</i>

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,320
<i>Maybe that's why...</i>

67
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,658
<i>Maybe those whose positions
</i><i>are weak are drawn to each other.</i>

68
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,664
<i>Maybe at first, it was out of sympathy.</i>

69
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,385
<i>But we've lived together like family,</i>

70
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,847
<i>and gone through hardships together...</i>

71
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,644
<i>and she has become
</i><i>an indispensable part of my life.</i>

72
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,570
I've been able to endure many things
because of her.

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,657
I was only able to cross the desert
because of her.

74
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,410
Yeah, but there was no need for you
to cross it in the first place.

75
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,580
Why, for the sake of something
as ridiculous as immortality,

76
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,540
would you intentionally...

77
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,084
If I don't return with the way
to gain immortality,

78
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,421
present it to His Highness the Emperor
and gain his trust,

79
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,133
our clan will continue on
until it perishes.

80
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,555
That's why I came to this country
with her...

81
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,809
- Shao May!
- Ah, don't cry anymore! I'm begging you!

82
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,654
Sir?

83
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,198
There's still some time left
before the sun comes up.

84
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,784
There will be fewer military police now.

85
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,289
You're going to help me look for her?

86
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,918
He's a good person.

87
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:03,632
His people were wiped out
in the civil war earlier.

88
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,926
That's why maybe he feels some kinship

89
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,139
for the survival of your minor clan.

90
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,311
Well? Aren't we going to go look?

91
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,313
Yes, we're going!

92
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,823
It sure is tiring,
when our footing is like this.

93
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,159
Yeah.

94
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,079
What's worse,
after all this, there's no exit.

95
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,957
I'm starving.

96
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,464
Once we get out,
I'll feed you as much as you like.

97
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,760
You can eat as much as you like,
and sleep as much as you like.

98
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,013
Ling?

99
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,350
I've had it.

100
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,477
Hey, now, throwing in the towel?

101
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,983
What a wuss.
You're going to collapse here too?

102
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,985
Get up! Walk!

103
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,654
Move forward! Come on!

104
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,990
Go on.

105
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,744
You spineless wimp! I'm going!

106
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm not going to let myself croak
someplace like this, after all this!

107
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,795
I really am going to go, all by myself!

108
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,091
I really, really am!

109
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,435
I thought you were going.

110
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,813
I'm not going to let us both go down!

111
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,650
You've got people
waiting for you too, don't you?

112
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,487
And if you've got strength enough
to talk--

113
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,249
If only we had something to eat...

114
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,670
You know something, Ling?

115
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,805
Leather goods are edible.

116
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,478
Just about there. Here.

117
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,898
There's no athlete's foot, right?

118
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,901
Does it look like there's any,
you bonehead?

119
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,905
I'm full.

120
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,159
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

121
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,911
This is all
because you were protecting me.

122
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,996
It's nothing.

123
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,123
Compared to the training
I went through as a kid,

124
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,000
this is no big deal.

125
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,878
It sucks that we don't know
where this place is though.

126
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:52,092
But we're still alive and kicking,
so we can look for a way out.

127
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,094
You sure are positive.

128
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,471
I'm just stubborn about staying alive.

129
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,181
If I give up even a little bit,

130
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,559
I find get Al's iron fists
and angry howls flying at me.

131
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,690
- What is it?
- Something's coming.

132
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,655
- Is that...?
- Oh, my, it's you guys, is it?

133
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,034
- It's Envy, all right.
- Tell me the way out of here!

134
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,703
That's pretty ugly of you, Edward Elric!

135
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,540
Shut up!
A man will do anything to survive!

136
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,041
- For shame! For shame!
- Shut up!

137
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,043
Unfortunately, there is no way out.

138
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,506
You've really gone and done it now.

139
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,967
You even got me, Envy,
dragged into this as well.

140
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,972
Where is this place?
Are we really inside Gluttony's belly?

141
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,725
We're both inside his belly,
and not inside his belly.

142
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,270
Fullmetal pips--

143
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,982
Alchemist, you've realized
what this place is, haven't you?

144
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,319
Now that you mention it, from the moment
that Gluttony swallowed us,

145
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,821
I've felt that sensation before somewhere.

146
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:00,076
You remember it, right?
You experienced it in the past, after all.

147
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,461
The Doorway of Truth!

148
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,088
But...

149
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,800
But it wasn't like this there!

150
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,803
It was an all-white space, with a doorway.

151
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,723
Yeah? So that's what the real thing
is like, huh?

152
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
The real thing?

153
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>Gluttony is a failed attempt by our Father
</i><i>to create a Doorway of Truth.</i>

154
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,316
He's what?

155
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,904
But Father couldn't create one,
not even with his power.

156
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,573
This is a defective Doorway of Truth.

157
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:43,328
I guess you could call this the area
between reality and truth.

158
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,204
Between?

159
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,875
There are no exits, nor any ways out.

160
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,338
All we can do is use up our strength
and wait for our lives to end.

161
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:57,884
Guys, all we can do is wait
around in here to die.

162
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,517
No way...

163
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,562
I'll be damned if that's true!

164
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,650
Don't go telling us
crap like that, Envy! Hey!

165
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,655
There isn't any exit?
We're going to die here?

166
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:24,786
Hey... Hey! Hold on! If I die...

167
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,039
What's Al going to do?

168
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,125
I promised him!

169
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,044
We're going to get back
to normal together!

170
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,964
Damn it!

171
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,552
Doorways and creating things aside,
just who is this Father?

172
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,972
Is it Führer Bradley?

173
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:50,228
Bradley? Ha! No, he's just a Homunculus.

174
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,231
I knew it.

175
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,819
<i>The Fifth Laboratory...
</i><i>Human lives used to make...</i>

176
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,029
<i>Philosopher's Stones...</i>

177
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,949
<i>Homunculi...</i>

178
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,287
If the Führer is one too, then are
you guys behind the Ishval War?

179
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,872
Ishval?

180
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,919
I've never had a job more delightful
than that one.

181
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,880
Do you know what the trigger was
that started the uprising?

182
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,886
As I recall, a military officer
accidentally killed an Ishvalan child.

183
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:29,434
Yes. And I, Envy, am the very person
who shot that child.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,501
Um...

185
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,506
I heard from Mr. Yoki
about what happened to Ishval.

186
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,805
That felt so good.

187
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,767
The civil war flared up
right before my eyes, all over one bullet.

188
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,937
Man, that was a real thrill.

189
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,397
Ah, and incidentally...

190
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,526
the officer that I, Envy,
turned myself into

191
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,572
was a moderate, who opposed
the military's intervention in Ishval.

192
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,158
And the guy...

193
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:32,163
he couldn't even account for himself,
and was court-martialed!

194
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:37,668
You humans really are easily
manipulated creatures.

195
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:44,509
So you're the one who shot
that innocent child?

196
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,264
Who ruined our home,
and drove out the Ishvalans?

197
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,018
The one who made Scar
so hell-bent for vengeance?

198
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,603
The reason

199
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,357
why Winry's parents were taken from her?

200
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,651
Why, you...

201
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,200
What? He didn't even flinch.

202
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,869
You wanna fight, you punks?

203
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,788
Ed, get back!

204
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,547
We're all going to die here anyway.

205
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,425
Let me show you something neat
before you pass on.

206
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,762
Did you see his footprints
when we were fighting in the forest?

207
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,680
No.

208
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,518
You mean...

209
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,980
He's unusually heavy for his size.

210
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,858
His true body is quite...

211
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,874
- Damn.
- What is this?

212
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:04,088
How is he a Homunculus,
a man-made person?

213
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,198
What do I do?

214
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,118
I don't know.

215
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:42,126
What do I do? Father will be mad at me.

216
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,756
Father? You have a dad?

217
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,382
Yes.

218
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,260
The person who made the Homunculi?

219
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,512
Yes, he made us.

220
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,978
Where does the mass he swallows go?

221
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,939
Is it some kind of trick?

222
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,775
Think! Think!

223
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,320
We promised each other
we'd get back to normal together.

224
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,239
What good will it do to give up?

225
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,157
Gluttony!

226
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:17,078
Take me with you!
Take me to where your father is!

227
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,873
Okay.

228
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,211
You are a sacrifice, after all.

229
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,215
Ah, right! I'm a sacrifice.

230
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,636
What does that mean, "sacrifice"?

231
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,182
<i>As for that matter, the only ones
</i><i>that have been confirmed at present</i>

232
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:42,019
are the two Elric brothers.

233
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,273
What about Dr. Marcoh?
Isn't it about time...?

234
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,482
There's also Kimblee.

235
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:51,320
He doesn't have the nerve it takes
to open the doorway.

236
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:57,034
Come to think of it, what about Mustang,
the other sacrifice candidate?

237
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:02,206
The Führer said he would like
to have a nice long talk with him.

238
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,129
Why are you keeping me alive?

239
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,008
In order to allow you
to understand your position.

240
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,013
How long has the military
been bowing to the Homunculi?

241
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,602
This has all been set up
since the birth of this nation.

242
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,979
So you've been watching us struggle

243
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,772
and snickering to yourselves
for all this time?

244
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,694
Your hands that were trembling
at General Hughes' funeral...

245
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,655
Did you fake that too?

246
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,661
Everyone makes too great a fuss
over the death of one soldier.

247
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,706
He must have at least known
that there was a possibility

248
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,542
that his uniform
was what he would be buried in.

249
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,046
General Hughes' child...

250
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,134
Could there be anything more noisy
in the middle of a funeral?

251
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,055
She truly did grate on my nerves.

252
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,185
I thought you had a child too!
How can you say that?

253
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:09,774
You mean Selim? He's a very good boy.

254
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,820
What if he were to find out that
the father he looks up to is a Homunculus?

255
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,201
Is that a threat? It won't work.

256
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,081
He will never be a way to get to me.

257
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:32,088
But your case is different.
She can be used to get to you.

258
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,635
Lieutenant Hawkeye!

259
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,428
What is it?

260
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,098
Someone from the Personnel Bureau
came by earlier.

261
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:47,103
They informed me that I was being assigned
to duty at the Southern Command Center.

262
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,356
- What?
- And it's not just me.

263
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,317
<i>Lieutenant Breda is going
</i><i>to the Western Command Center,</i>

264
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,362
<i>and Warrant Officer Falman
</i><i>has apparently been transferred</i>

265
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,072
to the Northern Command Center.

266
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,669
- Lieutenant Hawkeye?
- Yes, sir.

267
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,548
- I'm Yakovlev, from the Personnel Bureau.
<i>- Personnel Bureau?</i>

268
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:21,262
And I'm Storche, assistant to the Führer.
Please take this.

269
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,891
- Are these transfer orders?
- That's correct.

270
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,186
If I may look at them...

271
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,025
What's this?

272
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,404
What kind of implausible assignment
is this?

273
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,905
Where are you being whisked away to?

274
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,660
"Starting tomorrow,
First Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye

275
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,246
is assigned
to the Central Command Center...

276
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,666
as an assistant to the Führer."

277
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,921
And that's that, Colonel Roy Mustang.

278
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,596
- Let us out!
- The pain!

279
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,181
Ah, delightful, delightful...

280
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,559
Damn, there's nothing delightful
about this.

281
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,228
Yeah, no doubt.

282
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,777
Ling!

283
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,158
Ed!

284
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,789
- Can you make a weapon?
- Leave it to me!

285
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,794
With this sea of blood,
there's no shortage of iron.

286
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,842
You've got lousy taste.

287
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,888
What part? It's pretty slick, isn't it?

288
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,268
Can we take him?

289
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,188
I'm not sure.
I mean, what with the way he's built.

290
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,192
What's worse, he broke two or three
of my ribs in that last attack.

291
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,194
I'm in pretty similar shape.

292
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:05,074
Nonetheless,
we have to pump this guy up full of hurt!

293
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,042
Gluttony,
are you sure this is the right way?

294
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:19,255
But this way is... This is...

295
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,051
Your Father is in Central?
