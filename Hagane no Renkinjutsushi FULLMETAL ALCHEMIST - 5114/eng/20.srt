1
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,470
Edward... You've gotten bigger.

2
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,975
I heard from Pinako.

3
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,477
About you performing
human transmutation.

4
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,898
Why did you come back here now?

5
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,068
This is not where you belong anymore!

6
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:56,908
Oh, right. My house...
Why did you burn it down?

7
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,955
Because we made up our minds
that there was no turning back.

8
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,916
- We did it to show our resolve--
- No, you didn't.

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,918
You didn't want to look at it.

10
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,090
You wanted to escape
from your unpleasant memories.

11
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,844
You wanted to hide the traces
of what you'd committed.

12
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,805
You're wrong!

13
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,976
Just like a child hiding the sheets
when he wets the bed.

14
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,729
You ran away, Edward.

15
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,152
What the hell do you know?

16
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,614
Damn! You turn my stomach!

17
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,619
Just like when I was young.

18
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,082
You haven't changed.

19
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:32,337
You're just...
as you were all those years ago.

20
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,092
Why didn't you come back any sooner?

21
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,387
Trisha was waiting for you all that time.

22
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,564
Pinako...

23
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,276
What my sons transmuted...

24
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,487
Was it really Trisha?

25
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,910
I told you. It didn't have a human form.

26
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,414
- I wouldn't say it was Trisha--
- No, that's not what I mean.

27
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,585
For example,
the eye color and the hair color.

28
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:19,176
What do you mean?
Are you telling me that wasn't Trisha?

29
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,930
Are you saying that those boys
created someone completely unrelated

30
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,184
and had their bodies taken away
because of it?

31
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,939
You can keep going
without ever eating or sleeping?

32
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,443
As long as this seal is unharmed.

33
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,946
Amazing! You truly are immortal,
aren't you?

34
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,368
No, I'm not.
This body is like a... time bomb.

35
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Barry mentioned it.

36
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:53,418
A body is inherently incompatible
with someone else's soul.

37
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,671
If you force one into it,
it will undergo rejection.

38
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:03,595
Whether that will happen tomorrow
or ten years from now, I don't know.

39
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,724
Oh, no. Then you need to get back
to normal as soon as you can.

40
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,770
Yeah, but still,
if your body has some sort of problem,

41
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,523
can't you transfer your soul
into something else and go on living?

42
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,984
If that's the case,
then the way you are now...

43
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,656
You don't feel pain
and you don't need to eat.

44
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,866
That body of yours
is nice and handy, isn't it?

45
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,286
There's nothing nice about it!
You don't know anything!

46
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,543
- Sorry.
- Winry.

47
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,347
Winry? I'm coming in.

48
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:58,316
Geez, Winry, you and Brother
always get mad so quickly.

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,735
My timing is always off
when it comes to getting upset.

50
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,698
Well...

51
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:14,082
Apparently, this body
is unable to go to sleep.

52
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,585
Al...

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,846
You'll be able to get
your original body back. Right?

54
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:40,483
Give it back! It's my brother's body!
He's the only... the only family I have!

55
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,985
Give it back?

56
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,821
What are you talking about?

57
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:50,076
You're the one who put your brother
in that body, alchemist.

58
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:57,876
Yes. You're just like I am, Edward Elric.

59
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,377
Besides...

60
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:07,302
Edward... I don't like
being stuck in this form.

61
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:15,352
Ed! Are you still in bed?
Your father is leaving.

62
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,068
Do you mind... if I take this?

63
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,446
This was taken with the four of us.
It's the only one.

64
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,367
- No, I don't mind.
- Thanks.

65
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,830
In return, I'm going to let you in
on something important.

66
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,879
Something awful is going to happen
in this country soon.

67
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,714
Run away to some other land.

68
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,970
Awful things are not all that rare.
For that matter,

69
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,724
there are those who use this place
as somewhere to come home to.

70
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,978
I've given you my warning.

71
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,898
Hohenheim!

72
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,151
Come back once in a while
and break bread with us!

73
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:16,663
It's a shame, Pinako. I won't be able
to eat your cooking anymore.

74
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,772
Are you really going to dig that thing up?

75
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,988
Do you want to stop?

76
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,325
No. My stumps are aching.

77
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,830
It's going to rain.
Let's hurry and get this done.

78
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,141
Ed!

79
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,977
Didn't I tell you so?

80
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,319
Let's pack it in, already.

81
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,488
No.

82
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,869
I can't move forward
unless I'm sure! Besides...

83
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,537
You ran away.

84
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,207
I'm not about to run away!

85
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:44,102
Granny, Mom's hair was chestnut-colored.

86
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,106
It's black.

87
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,611
The femur... is too long.

88
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:59,367
- And the pelvis... This one is male.
- Granny...

89
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,619
Ed...

90
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,623
This is not your mother.

91
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:30,648
That's it. A dead person cannot be
brought back. That's the truth.

92
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,903
It was impossible to do.

93
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,659
Ed, snap out of it.
Get a hold of yourself.

94
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,706
I'm all right, Granny.

95
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,294
Ever since that day,
this has been a symbol of despair.

96
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,964
But now, it's our link to hope.

97
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,969
Al can be returned to normal.

98
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,912
Yes, Curtis residence.
Oh, it's you, Ed. What's up?

99
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,166
Teacher, there's something
I need to ask you.

100
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,043
It's just...

101
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,797
What? Just say it.

102
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,594
<i>It's about when you transmuted your baby.</i>

103
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,766
What about it?

104
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:53,022
Teacher, what Al and I transmuted
was not our mother.

105
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,694
What are you talking about?
What are you trying to say?

106
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,948
Teacher, the child that you transmuted...

107
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,243
<i>Was it really your child?</i>

108
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,674
I see.

109
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,179
My son and his wife did
some good on the battlefield?

110
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,390
You don't say...

111
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,902
Where did he...
Where did Hohenheim say he was going?

112
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,905
He didn't say.

113
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:48,661
I forgot. I have an important message
to give him.

114
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,663
- Message?
- Yeah.

115
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,167
Trisha's last words to him.

116
00:13:55,752 --> 00:14:00,173
Once he comes back,
could you tell him something for me?

117
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,969
Tell him I couldn't keep my promise.

118
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:09,015
That I was dying before him
and that I'm sorry.

119
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,018
Promise? What promise?

120
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,939
Who knows? I hate to ask,
but if you see him, tell him.

121
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,274
Why should I have to?

122
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,779
Despite how he acts, he really
is quite concerned about you two.

123
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,283
I'll tell him after I pop him one!

124
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,705
<i>You're going back to Central?</i>

125
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>Yeah. Al's going to be mad at me,
</i><i>off doing all this on my own.</i>

126
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,842
What the hell!

127
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,011
I'm sorry.

128
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,848
You're all beat-up!

129
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,226
And what's worse...

130
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,646
- What are you guys doing here?
- We're eating.

131
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,484
Sheesh, what happened to you?

132
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,698
A Homunculus, Barry the Chopper,

133
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,911
and to top it off, a reaction of rejection
between an incompatible body and soul?

134
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,666
I'll extend what's left of your armor.

135
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,974
Al... can go back
to the way he was, right?

136
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:37,186
Of course, he can! I said I would
put him back together and I will!

137
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,649
Al...

138
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,696
I dug up what we transmuted
together in Resembool.

139
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,118
Why would you do that?

140
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:57,123
And as a result,
I discovered that it wasn't Mom.

141
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,006
What are you talking about? I mean...

142
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,469
What we transmuted
was something completely different.

143
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,929
So then, that means I was...

144
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:16,184
And I've become convinced
that you can get back to normal.

145
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,935
Really?

146
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,190
Yeah. But, before I get into that...

147
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:27,904
Winry, do you remember
when we had that brotherly quarrel

148
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,615
about which one of us
was going to marry you?

149
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,327
You mean what we talked about
on the roof before?

150
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,121
Yeah. Al said you turned him down.

151
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,165
I did, I did.

152
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,628
So, this question is for both of you.
What was the reason?

153
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,634
- I don't like men shorter than me.
- I don't like men shorter than me.

154
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,182
Don't go judging the value of men
by their height!

155
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,519
So does this have something to do
with Al's body?

156
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,815
What it comes down to
is that Al knew something that I didn't.

157
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,610
And Winry,
since you remember the same thing,

158
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,363
it means that it was an actual event.

159
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,657
Since Al remembers something
that actually happened,

160
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,410
it means that what's bonded
inside that armor really is Al.

161
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,915
<i>I really was able to pull you
</i><i>out of that doorway,</i>

162
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,168
<i>even if it was just your soul.</i>

163
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,171
And if I was able to pull your soul out,

164
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,675
we should be able to get your body back
from beyond the doorway, too.

165
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:35,471
My body...
existing separately from my soul...

166
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,682
Barry the Chopper!

167
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:46,732
Al, try to remember back,
when you were taken inside the Truth.

168
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,696
<i>Back then...</i>

169
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,909
It's me! It was me in there!

170
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,038
Yeah. So, just like when
I pulled your soul out,

171
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,792
- we just need to get your body, as well!
- Brother!

172
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,256
<i>At the time, I could see you
</i><i>from inside the thing...</i>

173
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,258
<i>we thought was Mom.</i>

174
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,637
So it was you inside that thing?

175
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:22,059
<i>My soul probably didn't bind to it
</i><i>because it was rejected.</i>

176
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,940
We didn't do any harm to anyone's soul.

177
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:35,990
Mr. Elric, sir? You have a telephone call
from Mrs. Izumi Curtis.

178
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,911
<i>I checked into the family lines
</i><i>of both me and my husband.</i>

179
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:41,996
<i>It turns out...</i>

180
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,626
going by the skin and hair color
of the child I transmuted,

181
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,254
it was something that couldn't
have been born to us as a couple.

182
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,257
You've struck upon something, haven't you?

183
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:57,011
Yes. I'm convinced
that we can get Al's body back.

184
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,057
And that bringing back the dead
is impossible.

185
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:08,564
I get it. It's not
that we were missing something.

186
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,025
It was impossible to do
in the first place.

187
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,446
<i>- Ed!
- Yes?</i>

188
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,074
<i>Thanks.</i>

189
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,788
What did our teacher say?

190
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm not entirely sure why.

191
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,252
But she said thanks.

192
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,096
Al?

193
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,102
Ever since that day,
I've been blaming myself.

194
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,604
I thought that...

195
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>I was the one who put Mom
</i><i>in that form and killed her.</i>

196
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,362
So did I, Al.

197
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:03,119
Thanks, Brother.
I didn't kill Mom after all.

198
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,957
Izumi...

199
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,876
I feel like I've been saved.

200
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,256
I didn't kill our child a second time.

201
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,176
<i>Still...</i>

202
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,764
The fact remains that I am the one
who put you in that body.

203
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,392
Whatever it takes,
I'm going to make your body right--

204
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,601
Brother...

205
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,605
I agreed to what we did,
and I'm just as much at fault.

206
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,692
So don't talk about it
as though it's all on you.

207
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,194
You always take it all on yourself.

208
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,033
I can't stand to let others become victims
over what I've done anymore!

209
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,536
Like Mr. Hughes!

210
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,542
When I found out he was dead,

211
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,295
I honestly felt that if it meant
others were going to get hurt,

212
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,298
I didn't need my body back.

213
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,928
Brother...

214
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,931
<i>I've seen others
</i><i>who didn't have human bodies.</i>

215
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,726
<i>And they all managed to live
</i><i>in their own way.</i>

216
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,024
<i>Even in this body, people around me
</i><i>treat me as a human being.</i>

217
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,528
Maybe this body is a ticking time bomb,
but even with a live body,

218
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,282
you never know when you might die
in an accident or from an illness.

219
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,913
So because I can live normally,
I'm not bothered by this body.

220
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,792
That's what I've started to think. But...

221
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,294
I just can't take it.

222
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:46,555
I... I... I can't take
all the nights by myself!

223
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:53,103
That's the reason
why I want to get back to normal.

224
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,856
Yeah. We'll get it done.

225
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,151
We'll send that Truth bastard flying.

226
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,154
And pull your body out of there!

227
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,461
<i>Have his...</i>

228
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,257
<i>Have his shoulders always been so broad?</i>
