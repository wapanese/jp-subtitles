1
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,309
Why, you...!

2
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,164
I won't let you have any more!

3
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,424
Dad!

4
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:17,012
He was trying to create
another Philosopher's Stone.

5
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,681
The humans should just turn
into the Stone.

6
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,229
Why do you treat them
like lower life forms?

7
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,857
Philosopher's Stones
are made from humans.

8
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,610
Homunculi are made
from Philosopher's Stones.

9
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,404
So, what do you make from Homunculi?

10
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,490
What do they produce?

11
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,535
Can you call a being
that only brings about destruction a god?

12
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,497
You may think you've become
a perfect being,

13
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,166
but you've reached a dead end!

14
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,962
Have I? Then I will produce humans.

15
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,575
I have obtained immortality.

16
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,912
I am... still... alive...

17
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,915
King Xerxes!

18
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,305
A body!

19
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,850
- I've gotten a body.
- I finally got a body.

20
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,060
No! Stop it!

21
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,395
- We're human again.
- This is...

22
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,772
- We suffered for so long.
- This isn't right!

23
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,899
Look! We have bodies.

24
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,067
Hohenheim...

25
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,319
Everyone...

26
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,824
Damn you!

27
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,209
Oh, no--

28
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,842
What's this? What's happening?

29
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,432
- Damn it!
- Greed!

30
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,225
- Gorius!
- Are you all right?

31
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,312
Perfect. Let me hop on too!

32
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,314
You need someone
who knows the situation, right?

33
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah. What the hell is going on?

34
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:39,154
Father, the first of the Homunculus,
is running amok.

35
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:43,033
At this point, we should leave behind
anyone who can't fight anymore.

36
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,120
Hey, the frog with the two women, get off!

37
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,789
You're hurt, right?

38
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,125
Don't be ridiculous!
If I don't lead our forces, who will?

39
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,003
Who cares? Get off, now!

40
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,339
This is no time to be talking
about who's in charge!

41
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,967
- I'm not taking orders from--
- Sir!

42
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,595
Transmission from headquarters.

43
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,806
<i>Operations, it's me.</i>

44
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,974
<i>What's going on there?</i>

45
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,727
Sir, half of Central Command Center...

46
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,731
Has been blown away.

47
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,233
What?

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,610
<i>We can't establish contact
</i><i>with the northern gate.</i>

49
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,906
That's the magnitude of his power.

50
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,910
What sort of monster is he?

51
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,538
By all appearances, he's an ordinary man.

52
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:34,334
However, he has thousands of souls
in the Philosopher's Stone inside of him.

53
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,004
And with that energy, he has obtained
what he calls the power of God.

54
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,884
You alchemists understand
how serious that is, right?

55
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,844
A Philosopher's Stone...?

56
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,055
You regular humans, get off here.

57
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,435
My men are still fighting out there.

58
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,813
I am their commanding officer.

59
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,319
Sir, headquarters wishes to speak to you.

60
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,281
What is it?

61
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
<i>Don't worry about it, sir.</i>

62
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,118
Have you forgotten that we Briggs soldiers

63
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:12,372
are a force that can act
without missing a beat,

64
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,790
even when without our boss?

65
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,126
Yellow Squad, at the weapons depot,
are you still there?

66
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,087
East gate, Blue Squad, come in!

67
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,007
<i>From what I gather,
</i><i>you're injured, aren't you?</i>

68
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,926
<i>Please, stay back and watch.</i>

69
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,847
- Alex!
- Yes, sir?

70
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,975
Take the radio with you.

71
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,519
Make sure you win.

72
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,440
You don't have to tell me that!

73
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,525
All right, let's go, Lieutenant.

74
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,903
Hey now, the two of you are hurt,
aren't you?

75
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm going to burn up
his Philosopher's Stone.

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,868
I need the lieutenant's help to do so.

77
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,663
Whatever, let's hurry and get going.

78
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,335
My job is to protect the young lord.

79
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,635
Take care of Izumi and the others.

80
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,142
Okay then, here we go!

81
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,625
So this is where you died.

82
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,877
You're the one who defeated him?

83
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,799
He was already covered
in wounds when he came here.

84
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,385
If he hadn't been,
it would have been a close call.

85
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,598
Captain Buccaneer,
working with the man from Xing,

86
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,767
inflicted a mortal wound upon Bradley.

87
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,776
Well, Bradley?

88
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,153
My men are strong, aren't they?

89
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,516
Shao May, you're all right.

90
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,184
Thank goodness.

91
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,026
Alphonse!

92
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,116
May.

93
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,994
Thank goodness you're alive.

94
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,288
Alphonse, your body...

95
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,879
Alphonse!

96
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,135
Oh, no! You shielded me, and...

97
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,805
Alphonse! Alphonse!

98
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,033
Sensei!

99
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,536
Sensei! Sensei!

100
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,996
I'm alive.

101
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,835
Mr. Hohenheim protected me
in the nick of time.

102
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,468
Hohenheim!

103
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,139
Hey, shake it off! Hey--!

104
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,320
Hohenheim!

105
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,614
I'll start with you two.

106
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,203
Stop!

107
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,257
Target the long-haired blond man.

108
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,092
Do not hit the Fullmetal Alchemist!

109
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,009
Yes, sir!

110
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,262
East gate, Blue Squad, hurry!

111
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,598
West gate, White Squad,
take position in front of the west wing!

112
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,143
Roger!

113
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,310
Sensei!

114
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,279
Fire!

115
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,918
Yo, Fullmetal, are you okay?

116
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,713
It's no use!
That won't even make him flinch!

117
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,797
You're kidding me!

118
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,347
Don't give him a chance to hit back!

119
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,557
Yes, sir!

120
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,945
Damn! He's not even breaking a sweat!

121
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,698
Copy that. Patch me to all units.

122
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,658
Yes, sir. Are you sure?

123
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,161
Cease fire! Get down!

124
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,068
- Did I hit him?
- You were off by just a bit.

125
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,486
Adjust targeting to 12 o'clock!

126
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,698
I can't see,
so I can't throttle the flames.

127
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,867
You don't have to throttle them at all!

128
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,828
Range 50. No, 53!

129
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,706
This clapping transmutation
just feels weird!

130
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,674
Incoming attack, dead ahead!

131
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,971
Nicely done.

132
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,682
Oh, this is handy.

133
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,018
Fire! Fire! Keep firing!

134
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,437
Don't give him the opportunity
to hit back!

135
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,607
Keep making him use
his Philosopher's Stone!

136
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,134
Awesome!

137
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,221
With that kind of power,
I could conquer the whole world!

138
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>Hey, Greed.</i>

139
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,393
Is this what you meant
when you were talking about

140
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,145
obtaining the whole world?

141
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:37,608
Yeah, once I get that,
everything in the world will be mine!

142
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,446
That just might fill the emptiness
inside me!

143
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,242
It could quench the thirst I've had
ever since I was born!

144
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,369
How despicable of you, Greed.

145
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,246
What you really want is something else.

146
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,168
You keep quiet, you little pissant.

147
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:00,173
I am Greed the Avaricious!
Whatever I want, I get!

148
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,471
Roasting time!

149
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,485
No effect whatsoever.

150
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,198
We have to do something
about his defenses.

151
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,991
We're running out of ammo!
Bring in some more!

152
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,410
How futile.

153
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,706
You humans cannot lay a finger on me.

154
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,003
If humans can't,
then how about a Homunculus?

155
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,386
You're just in time, Greed.

156
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,805
Such an obedient son.

157
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,393
I happened to need
another Philosopher's Stone.

158
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,144
I'll be taking yours.

159
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
Just kidding!

160
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,328
You can't take my Philosopher's Stone
unless you drop your barrier, huh?

161
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:18,126
But you didn't think that you could have
your godly powers taken from you, did you?

162
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,089
I will be taking all of it!

163
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,472
Greed!

164
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,125
Don't give up!

165
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,474
He defended himself with his arm.

166
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,980
He's at his breaking point!

167
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,238
He can't keep God or whatever
under his control anymore!

168
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,488
Stone... Stone!

169
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,740
Philosopher's Stone!

170
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,965
Get out of there, Edward!

171
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,841
Brother! Run!

172
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,760
Brother!

173
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,431
Stop!

174
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,724
Damn it!

175
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,018
Al!

176
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,398
Stop! Stop!

177
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,359
Let Brother... Let Brother...!

178
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,194
Let Brother...!

179
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,874
May, I need a favor.

180
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:10,047
Brother sacrificed his right arm
to bring my soul back.

181
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,218
So the reverse should be possible.

182
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,722
Alphonse...?

183
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,809
Just clear a path for me.

184
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,185
You can do that, right?

185
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,271
But if you do that, Alphonse--

186
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,732
There's no time! Please!

187
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,737
You're the only one I can ask to do this.

188
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,245
Stone...

189
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,748
Human...

190
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,999
Give me...

191
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,250
Edward!

192
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,044
...your energy!

193
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,019
What do you think you're doing?

194
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,397
No! Don't!

195
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,399
Al!

196
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,654
Beat him, Brother.

197
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,656
Stop!

198
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,217
Are you ready now?

199
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,720
Now we put our faith in Brother.

200
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,838
Yo, your soul has entered you, huh?

201
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,842
Will he be coming to get you back?

202
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,595
He will. Absolutely.

203
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,771
I can't wait to see what
he will sacrifice.

204
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,994
You dumbass!

205
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,274
It's working.

206
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,443
He's doing it. He's doing it!

207
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,695
- Go!
- Kid!

208
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,946
Go!

209
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,449
- Let him have it, short stuff!
- Lay him out!

210
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,534
- Edward!
- Ed!

211
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,203
Edward Elric!

212
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,206
Go!

213
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,958
Go!

214
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,211
<i>Greed.</i>

215
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,380
This is what you wanted so badly.

216
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,175
<i>Am I right?</i>

217
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,384
Edward!

218
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,636
Edward!

219
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,471
Go!

220
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,388
Fullmetal!

221
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,142
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>

222
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,604
<i>What I wanted...</i>

223
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,487
<i>was to have friends like these.</i>

224
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,545
Get up, benchwarmer!

225
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:24,051
I'm gonna show you
just how out of our league you are!
