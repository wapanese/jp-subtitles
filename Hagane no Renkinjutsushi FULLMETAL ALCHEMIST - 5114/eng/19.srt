1
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,880
<i> Elizabeth! Hey!</i>

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,298
Elizabeth!

3
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,063
And this is a secret.

4
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:49,109
According to what Barry said,
the colonel is trying to smoke out

5
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,404
the military group that had something
to do with the Fifth something-or-other.

6
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,282
The Fifth Laboratory.

7
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,160
Al...

8
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,871
I have to go.

9
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,708
I might be able to find out
about the person who killed Mr. Hughes.

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,794
Just a minute!
What about the secret of your body?

11
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,091
- I'll tell you once I get back.
- Man...

12
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,636
I'll be back soon.

13
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,098
You make sure you come back safe.

14
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,852
I promise.

15
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,114
Are you done yet?

16
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,992
Can I eat you?

17
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,339
What a pest. Move!

18
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,673
Lieutenant!

19
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,902
Out of ammo? Out of ammo?
Well then, time to eat!

20
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,746
I made it in time.

21
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,253
Colonel... Why did you come out here?

22
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:36,383
You could have eluded the enemy's pursuit,
regardless of what happened to us!

23
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,136
And yet, you just stroll on
in here like this!

24
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,971
Are you, in fact, an idiot, sir?

25
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,975
Yeah, okay, okay. I'm an idiot.

26
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,439
Who is that guy?

27
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,150
Colonel, the target has started to move!

28
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,403
Sergeant, break camp!
Leave no trash behind!

29
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:01,032
- Hayate, you stay with the sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

30
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,246
- Colonel.
- What?

31
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,914
Thank you very much.

32
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,751
Save it for later.
Right now, we're on a mission.

33
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,753
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,843
- Get in!
- Yes, sir.

35
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,392
This has something to do
with Mr. Hughes' case, doesn't it?

36
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,023
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

37
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,739
- Don't lose sight of him.
- He's not getting away from me.

38
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,995
My whole soul is abuzz,
saying, "This way! This way!"

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,917
Is that monstrous, fat guy
going to show up again, too?

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,211
I don't know. Who was that guy, anyhow?

41
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,880
I shot him several times
in critical areas,

42
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,633
but he still kept a straight face.

43
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,886
By any chance,
did he have an Uroboros tattoo?

44
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,970
Tattoo?

45
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,225
<i>There was one on his tongue.
</i><i>Is that what you're talking about?</i>

46
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,229
That was... probably... a Homunculus.

47
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,732
Watch out!

48
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,234
You idiot!

49
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,947
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
A Homunculus? There's no such thing!

50
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,118
Down south, I met a Homunculus
by the name of Greed. He told me,

51
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,747
"There's no such thing
as no such thing."

52
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,085
Homunculi have incredible
regenerative abilities.

53
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:41,091
Greed had half of his head knocked off,
but he was back to normal soon after.

54
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,928
Although, I doubt you would believe me.

55
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,182
I have no choice but to believe you
after what I saw.

56
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,475
You're not trying to tell me

57
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,228
that even after he got scorched
and fell out of that high tower,

58
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,604
he still isn't dead, are you?

59
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,773
Probably not.

60
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,944
For the love of--
pseudo-human freak show?

61
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:19,379
- My body fled here.
- The military's Third Laboratory?

62
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,300
Now I've got something
to hold over the senior staff.

63
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,178
That's a good enough catch.
We're pulling back.

64
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,180
- It's not good enough!
- You idiot!

65
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,438
- This is not good, Colonel.
- No, it works to our advantage.

66
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,814
Move it.

67
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,651
Move it. Move it.

68
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,654
I don't have any interest in your flesh!

69
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,657
Where are you, my little meatie-pie?

70
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,038
All remaining personnel,
evacuate immediately!

71
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,251
- Colonel?
- The intruder is a violent killer.

72
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,503
Leave his capture to us.

73
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,507
- Have guards seal off all the exits!
- Yes, sir!

74
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,227
Where has Barry gone off to?

75
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,316
- Split up into two groups.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,954
Looks like it's been a while
since this place was abandoned.

77
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,498
Was this... a laboratory?

78
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:41,503
If so, it doesn't look like
they were doing legitimate experiments.

79
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,505
My, what are the chances?

80
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,428
How unkind of you
to stand me up for our date.

81
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,181
I was waiting for you.

82
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,560
I've missed you, Jean.

83
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:02,607
- Solaris? What are you doing here?
- Hey, Havoc.

84
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,112
- She has an Uroboros tattoo!
- I'm just finding that out myself, sir.

85
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,367
I'm sorry I had to deceive you.

86
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,748
I get it. No wonder you were taken in.
You do like big boobs?

87
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,253
I love big boobs!

88
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,672
Boobs... Boobs... Boobs...

89
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:30,719
- Did you tell this woman anything?
- I never said anything about work!

90
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,851
Do you know who Maes Hughes is?

91
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,355
He was a quick-witted man, wasn't he?

92
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,233
I'm only sorry I didn't get
to strike the last blow.

93
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,781
On your knees.
Tell me everything you know.

94
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,324
I can't.

95
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:59,080
You two can't make me get on my kn--

96
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:09,257
Just what you'd expect
from the hero of Ishval. No mercy?

97
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,556
- You're a Homunculus!
- My, aren't you well-informed, Jean?

98
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,642
As a reward, let me show you this.

99
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,522
Can you see it?

100
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,941
It's a Philosopher's Stone.

101
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,197
People who are created
with these Stones at their core,

102
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,075
like we are, are Homunculi.

103
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:40,497
- You monster!
- How rude. We do have feelings.

104
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,501
We have affection towards our parents.

105
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,503
We are human.

106
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,092
If you're telling us
such an important secret,

107
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,594
it means you're not planning
on letting us out of here alive.

108
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,513
Yes. It's a shame, too.

109
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,309
Too slow!

110
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:10,276
Oh, dear. Now you can't produce
your celebrated flames.

111
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,953
What do we do, sir?
At this rate, she's going to slice us up!

112
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,330
Actually, she did me a favor.

113
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,291
With this much water,

114
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,045
I just have to decompose it
to produce hydrogen and oxygen!

115
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:52,068
This sucks.
I got this from a former girlfriend.

116
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,115
Damn. Colonel, can you give me a light?

117
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,745
- I guess not.
- What am I, a soggy match?

118
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,584
No doubt about it, that woman is cooked.

119
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,503
- How can you tell, sir?
- The smell.

120
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:15,758
- I've smelled a number of burned bodies.
- You mean your experience in Ishval?

121
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,511
Still, we can't count out
their regenerative abilities.

122
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,929
- Stay sharp.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,146
Havoc!

124
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,031
- Havoc, stay with me!
- Oh, no.

125
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:42,410
- You can't save him now.
- No!

126
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:52,420
- It's no use! I'm still not dead!
- The way to save him is right in here!

127
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,267
I'm going to use it to treat him.

128
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,273
Medical field alchemy
is outside of my expertise,

129
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,276
but by using this
to increase my abilities--

130
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,784
Is suddenly plunging his hand into
a lady's chest the act of a gentleman?

131
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,967
FÃ¼hrer. Your Excellency!

132
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,761
I heard there was an intruder.

133
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,682
Yes, sir. The criminal who attacked
the west-end lockup is inside.

134
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,517
Colonel Mustang went after him.

135
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,938
Well, then, I will go help him.

136
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,149
- We will accompany you!
- No.

137
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,569
I will be fine on my own.

138
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,536
I told you,
the Philosopher's Stone is my core.

139
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,418
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:19,132
You were a candidate for sacrifice,
but now you must die.

141
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,717
Why, you...

142
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:28,224
Die, as you watch your own man
grow cold before your eyes.

143
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,770
Lieutenant Havoc...

144
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,773
Answer me. Damn.

145
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:40,278
You are not allowed to die before I do.

146
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,114
Havoc...

147
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,292
You're late, lady.

148
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,671
Look at how decayed my body has become.

149
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,592
It's inherently impossible
to stick someone's body together

150
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,093
with a different soul.

151
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,017
If a soul is incompatible
with another person's body,

152
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,062
then me being a soul
within an iron body...

153
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,650
That's right. There's no guarantee
that this body will hold out...

154
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,403
until we achieve our goal.

155
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,947
Brother...

156
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,245
There you are, Miss Lust.

157
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,083
Number 66, why were you working
with the colonel?

158
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,879
Because it seemed like
it would be fun! Besides...

159
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,507
I want to chop you up more than anything!

160
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,638
Such a troublesome man.
And what about you, armor boy?

161
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,601
What brings you to someplace like this?
This is taking a heavy toll.

162
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:58,606
To think that I'll have to kill
two sacrifice candidates in one night!

163
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:04,612
- Sacrifice? Two?
- Yes. You and one other.

164
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,866
Enough with all the mumbo-jumbo,
Miss Lust!

165
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,588
I hate annoying men.

166
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,341
Now then, Miss Lieutenant,

167
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,719
I'll be sending you
to where I sent your superior.

168
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:41,107
Wait. You said two sacrifices
in one night, right?

169
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,610
You don't mean... You don't mean...

170
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,408
Why, you...!

171
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,100
Finished?

172
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,458
You truly are foolish and weak.
You poor creature.

173
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,884
- Lieutenant, get up and run away.
- Do you want to die first?

174
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,725
I see. You opened the doorway.

175
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,776
It's too bad.
You'd definitely be a sacrifice.

176
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,242
Alphonse, leave me here and run away.

177
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,368
- No!
- Run away!

178
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,620
- No!
- You, at least, have to--

179
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,913
I said no!

180
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:25,336
<i>I'm sick of people dying before my eyes!
</i><i>I've had enough!</i>

181
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,090
<i>I won't let anyone get killed anymore!
</i><i>I'll protect them!</i>

182
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,600
Well said, Alphonse Elric.

183
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,740
I've finally got you on your knees.

184
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,038
You used the flint as a starter,

185
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,250
and a transmutation circle
drawn in your own blood?

186
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,171
How did you get here with your wound?

187
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,676
I burned it closed. I nearly passed out
two or three times, too.

188
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,518
You said you still weren't dead,
didn't you?

189
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,189
Then I'll just have to kill you
until you are dead!

190
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,153
Colonel!

191
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,729
I've been beaten.

192
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,650
I hate to admit it.

193
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,236
But being killed by a man like you
isn't so bad.

194
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,239
Those eyes looking straight ahead,
unwavering...

195
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,909
I can't wait.

196
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:25,623
<i>The day when those eyes will
</i><i>be twisted in agony is not far off.</i>

197
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,302
Colonel!

198
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,180
Are you all right?

199
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,182
Never mind me, please.
Worry about yourself, sir!

200
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,062
Alphonse, thank you for protecting her.

201
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,939
Never mind that.
Let's hurry and get you to a doctor!

202
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:56,404
Yeah. Hurry and call a doctor
for Havoc. Please.

203
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,709
He's all right.

204
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,044
He's all right.

205
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,433
I'm home.

206
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,439
You dummy! Welcome back!

207
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,983
Yeah.

208
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,528
So...

209
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,836
- It came off!
- Yikes, it won't go back on!

210
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,469
Well, well. I barely survived that one.

211
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:07,099
In the shape I'm in, I wonder
if someone will be able to fix me.

212
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,022
Are you still alive?

213
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,108
Hey, what are you doing?

214
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,278
I've still got killing, killing,
and more killing to do!

215
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:24,867
Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop!

216
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,863
<i>It couldn't be.</i>

217
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,535
<i>It is...</i>

218
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,964
Hohenheim!
