00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,341
1909: THE CONCLUSION
OF THE ISHVALAN CIVIL WAR

2
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,225
Aren't you going back?
You'll be left behind.

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,562
A war buddy's grave?

4
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,857
No. It's an Ishvalan child.

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,736
One who was left dead by the wayside.

6
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,242
Let's go home. The war is over.

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:40,249
The Ishvalan War is still not over
within me.

8
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,253
No, it will never be over
for as long as I live.

9
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,508
I am the one who believed in you

10
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,261
and entrusted my father's research to you.

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,265
I am also the one
who entered the military academy,

12
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,268
in hopes for the happiness of the people.

13
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,188
And even if that did come
to an unwanted result,

14
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,774
I cannot escape the truth.

15
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,530
There is no way I can atone
for what I've done.

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,536
I have a favor to ask, Mr. Mustang.

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,291
Please burn... and deface my back.

18
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,795
- There's no way I could do that!
- At least...

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,756
If I can't atone,

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,051
I, at least, want to destroy
the secrets on my back

21
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,053
so that no other Flame Alchemists
can be produced!

22
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,183
Can you do that?

23
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:48,191
If so, then please release me
from my charge.

24
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,488
Please set me free from the burden

25
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,368
placed on me by my father
through his alchemy.

26
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,538
I beg you.

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,425
All right.

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,136
I will burn you,
leaving as little trace of it as I can.

29
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,145
Thank you very much, Mr. Mustang.

30
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,173
What are you trying to pull, Lieutenant?

31
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,759
Who do you think
you're pointing your gun at?

32
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,928
Who? Don't make me laugh.

33
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:27,476
When it's just the two of us,
the colonel always calls me "Riza."

34
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,104
- That's how close you two are?
- I lied.

35
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,526
Thanks for falling for it, Envy.

36
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,781
Now, die here for me.

37
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,830
That hurts!

38
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,090
Damn it.

39
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,843
You're taking the potshots too far!

40
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,517
I'll dump you in front of the colonel
like a worn-out dishrag--

41
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,813
Colonel.

42
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,547
What are you doing to my dear subordinate?

43
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,846
Don't do anything rash, Lieutenant.

44
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,392
I told you I was going
to take care of him.

45
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,952
Damn, human. Don't you look down at me!

46
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,827
Damn it.

47
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,955
Not this again.

48
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,084
Is that your true body?

49
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,587
You're ugly.

50
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,842
Envy, your name means "jealous," right?

51
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,595
That makes sense.

52
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,766
No. Don't!

53
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,309
And jealousy...

54
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,937
is an ugly thing.

55
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,148
No, I don't want to die!

56
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,652
- No! No!
- Be gone...

57
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,737
from my sight!

58
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,367
What do you think
you're doing, Lieutenant?

59
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,369
That's enough, Colonel.

60
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,372
I will deal with him from here.

61
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,460
One more blast will finish him.
Put down your gun.

62
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,588
I cannot obey that order, sir.
Please put your hand down.

63
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,757
Stop screwing around! I said put it down!

64
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,557
Fullmetal.

65
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,144
Let me have that.

66
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,652
I'll ask you one more time.
Let me have that.

67
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,655
No.

68
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:26,172
I must give him the worst of all deaths.

69
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,549
No.

70
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,136
Give him to me! Or I will burn him up
along with your right hand!

71
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,639
Fine with me!
I'll fight you like I mean it!

72
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,308
But before I do,
take a good look at your own face!

73
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:41,688
Is that the face you plan to wear
when you're the nation's top man?

74
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,273
That's not what you...

75
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,652
Colonel, that's not
what you're after, is it?

76
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,117
Those below me
will protect those below them.

77
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,038
We, tiny humans, should be able
to do that much, at least.

78
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,459
This could be interesting.
I'll take a piece of that action.

79
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,880
I want to see how your naive idealism
changes this country.

80
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,926
Are you going down the path
of the beast, given over to his passion?

81
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,887
You can if you want to.

82
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,182
If you're going to live for revenge,
I won't stop you.

83
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,266
Hey!

84
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,770
I have no right to stop another
from taking vengeance.

85
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,983
But I do think it would be a sight
to see what sort of world

86
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,070
a man who is held captive
by his own hatred,

87
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,654
at the head of everyone else,
would create.

88
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,910
Colonel, I cannot allow you to kill Envy.

89
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:41,539
That being said,
I do not intend to let him live.

90
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,666
I will dispose of him, sir.

91
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,836
I finally did it! I finally ran him down!

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,921
I know!

93
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,297
But still...

94
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,718
But still, what you are about to do

95
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,680
is not to help the country
or your friends!

96
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,766
It is to vindicate your hatred.

97
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,185
That is all that consumes you.

98
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,689
I cannot allow you
to descend to that level!

99
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,345
If you wish to shoot me, then shoot me.

100
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:44,477
However, after you shoot me,
what will you do then?

101
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:51,526
I have no intention of living on
by myself, free of care.

102
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,903
Once this fight is over,

103
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,865
I will remove my body,
along with its maddening flame alchemy,

104
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,201
from the face of the Earth.

105
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,919
I can't have that.

106
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,463
I can't...

107
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,466
afford to lose you.

108
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,973
What kind of situation is this?

109
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:27,979
Scolded by a child, lectured by a man
who once came after me as an enemy,

110
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,484
causing you pain, once again...

111
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,948
I'm just a big fool.

112
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,043
I'm sorry.

113
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,141
What are you, dense?

114
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,686
Just flowery words
and make-believe empathy?

115
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,313
It's turning my stomach.

116
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,192
Are you humans really that over-the-top?

117
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,446
Just do whatever you want to,
like your gut tells you to do!

118
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,865
Colonel Mustang! Have you forgotten?

119
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,452
Scar was out to take your life.

120
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,245
As I recall,

121
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:31,501
Scar is also the one who killed
the pipsqueak's friend's parents.

122
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,506
Yeah, yeah.
And the girl-and-dog Chimera in East City.

123
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,218
Isn't Scar the one who killed her, too?

124
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,886
And as for you, Scar,

125
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,514
what happened to all that hatred

126
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,933
over your countrymen killed in Ishval?

127
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,559
And the woman,

128
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,438
all full of herself,
called the "Hawk's Eye,"

129
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,940
she shot your pals left and right!

130
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,275
You'll never get another chance like this!

131
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,529
Well, go get them!
This is a prime opportunity!

132
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,365
Hate and weep. Kill and be killed!

133
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,702
Thrash around! Grovel in the dirt.

134
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,537
Teaming up together as friends

135
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,040
is something you scum
couldn't possibly do!

136
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,293
Right, pipsqueak? Right, Hawkeye?

137
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,296
Mustang? Scar?

138
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,056
How come?

139
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,977
How come?

140
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,816
How come? How come? How come?

141
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,069
How come?

142
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,195
Envy...

143
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,576
You're... jealous of humans.

144
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:55,168
Humans are supposed to be
so much weaker than you Homunculi.

145
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,129
And yet, even when we're beaten down
and get discouraged

146
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,757
or seem like we're about
to go astray and fall,

147
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,051
we still stand up to the challenge,
again and again.

148
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,054
Those who are around us pick us back up.

149
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,434
And you...
you're envious of humans like that.

150
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>If you forsake the smaller part,
</i><i>the greater will be saved.</i>

151
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,984
<i>If you think about it just a little,
</i><i>you'll see that.</i>

152
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,778
<i>You can't shoot like this, huh, human?</i>

153
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,614
<i>But then again, that's just the way
</i><i>you humans are.</i>

154
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,991
<i>But, as long as I'm going to transform,</i>

155
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,869
<i>something young and cute
</i><i>would be better, huh?</i>

156
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,663
<i>You humans really are such fools.</i>

157
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,957
<i>You risk your lives
</i><i>over the most pointless things.</i>

158
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,627
<i>Only human, all right.</i>

159
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,878
Humans?

160
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,963
Humans...

161
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,971
Hey, you! Don't run away!

162
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,681
Hey, hold on a second!

163
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,392
You idiot, if you squeeze yourself out...

164
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,106
Wait.

165
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,900
He won't last much longer.

166
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:08,658
It's so humiliating,
ending up like a worn-out dishrag...

167
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,957
walked on by you humans,

168
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,042
you loathsome beings.

169
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:26,426
What's worse,
of all the scum out there,

170
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,178
the scummiest pipsqueak
had to be the one--

171
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,785
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

172
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,039
How humiliating. How humiliating.

173
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:02,003
Me, Envy, jealous of you humans?

174
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,797
Me, Envy?

175
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:12,221
Me, Envy, being understood by this kid?

176
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,185
That's the ultimate humiliation.

177
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,405
We'll see how long
those flowery words will last.

178
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,700
Best of luck with that.

179
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:02,939
Bye, bye, Edward Elric.

180
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,453
He terminated his own life?

181
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,581
Cowardly bastard.

182
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,346
His wounds are healing.

183
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,475
He's a monster.

184
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,727
Hey, what is that thing?

185
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,730
You're here just in time! Give us a hand!

186
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,982
Give you a hand?

187
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,152
We have orders to shoot General Armstrong.

188
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,532
General? And you, too, Major?

189
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,825
You're just in time.

190
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,327
From here on out, I'm running the show!

191
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,331
Just help us out, now!

192
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,918
Hey, what are those things?

193
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,756
Get your heads down!

194
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,310
Bullets don't have any effect on them.
Smash in their upper jaws.

195
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,313
At least, we won't have to worry
about being chewed to death.

196
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,109
Attack in pairs, and make sure
to take out at least one each.

197
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,363
Show me the valor of the Central soldiers!

198
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,368
Let's see. What was I doing?

199
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,790
I remember.

200
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,002
Kill the woman general.

201
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,178
No, you don't!

202
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,305
Let go!

203
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,981
It sure is hard
only being able to use one arm.

204
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,907
- Major.
- General!

205
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,409
He's gonna beat him to death!

206
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,994
If someone doesn't get in there
to help him out!

207
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:22,912
Leave him!

208
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,664
My brother...

209
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,792
has trained himself better
than to be killed like that!

210
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,463
This...

211
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,715
is the end.

212
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,261
Major!

213
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,529
My shoulder has popped back in!

214
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,281
All right.

215
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:39,280
This artistic muscular
and artistic alchemic collaboration...

216
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,200
is excellent and elegant!

217
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,710
Yes, sir. The Armstrong estate
is completely empty!

218
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,465
Damn it. Is this where
they assembled that tank?

219
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,976
This is the gate commander
calling Operations!

220
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,022
<i>We're taking fire from what
</i><i>we believe to be a Briggs tank.</i>

221
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,733
<i>- Come in, Operations!
- Stop shouting! I can see!</i>

222
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,194
No matter, return fire!

223
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,404
But the civilians
haven't finished evacuating.

224
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,282
If we wait for them,
we'll lose the main gate!

225
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,701
Contact the command center
and main gate batteries--

226
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,624
Damn it. What was that?

227
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,587
You were going to fire on an urban area?

228
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,048
You want that to go out
over the radio, too?

229
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,217
Why, you...

230
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,846
This is Briggs equipment!
How did you get in here?

231
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,432
A man formerly stationed
at Central Command Center,

232
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,938
one with a sharp memory,
remembers exactly where this location is.

233
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,191
All that was left was for someone
to single-handedly

234
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,486
dig a tunnel
from the urban area to right here.

235
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,780
Is there anyone able
to pull something like that off?

236
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,575
- Yes, there is. Right here.
- Who?

237
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,412
When anyone asks who I am,
I tell them I'm a housewife.

238
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,289
That is only proper for me.

239
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,419
But, today, why don't I identify myself
as something else?

240
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,923
I'm an alchemist!

241
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,875
You're alone?

242
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,965
I thought you would bring
those brothers with you.

243
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,385
I don't need to bring
a bunch of others along

244
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,387
to chastise a bad little boy, do I?

245
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,934
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus?

246
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:23,694
Slave No. 23,
who gave me a part of his body...

247
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:28,198
Now, you will become a part of my body.
