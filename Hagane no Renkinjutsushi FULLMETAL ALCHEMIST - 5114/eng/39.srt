1
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:45,314
Do you remember, Kimblee,
when we first met?

2
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,234
- The situation is reversed now!
- Don't you look down on me!

3
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,156
Kimblee! Why, you!

4
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,244
Why? Why is Winry here?

5
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,498
Here we've finally cornered Scar,
and now he's taken her hostage!

6
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,542
Stand aside.

7
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,963
You dumbass!

8
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,429
Stop, Crimson Alchemist!
Can't you see Winry up there?

9
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,060
I wish you would keep out of my way.

10
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,030
Just a moment, Scar!

11
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,325
Mr. Kimblee! It's too dangerous
to get close to the building!

12
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,536
Fall back!

13
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,289
- A snowstorm is moving in!
- Hurry!

14
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,050
- That was a convincing performance.
- It wasn't a performance.

15
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,514
I really am seething with anger
at how worthless I am,

16
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
having to put on a charade like this.

17
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,106
Why did you kill my mom and dad?

18
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,652
Anything I say would only be an excuse.

19
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,739
The fact remains,
I killed the Doctors Rockbell.

20
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,199
With this hand.

21
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,710
Young girl, you have every right
to pass judgment on me.

22
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,809
Your arm... You're going to bleed
to death if we don't do something.

23
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,353
- Winry.
- I know.

24
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,482
But this is probably
what Mom and Dad did, too.

25
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,989
Mom and Dad saved his life, after all.

26
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,907
I think there's some sort
of meaning in that.

27
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,202
You are forgiving me?

28
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,206
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not forgiving your wantonness.

29
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,973
- Winry...
- It's all right. I'm not going to cry.

30
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,896
I promised you that the next time I cried,
they'd be tears of joy.

31
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,990
Hey, Scar.

32
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:47,329
That may be what Winry says,
but I still want to beat you to a pulp

33
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,999
and drag you out
to the Rockbell family grave!

34
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,840
- Should we contact headquarters?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,009
Miles, wasn't it?

36
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,263
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

37
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,767
You called me one of your people.

38
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,980
That's right. I'm Ishvalan,
on my grandfather's side.

39
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,361
I wish we didn't have to meet like this,
my red-eyed brother.

40
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,157
Why do you take part
in the Amestrisian armed forces?

41
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,872
In order to change the minds
of the people in this country

42
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,833
regarding Ishvalans from the inside.

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:41,132
I doubt it's going to be so easy
to change minds.

44
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,343
There's no telling how long it will take.

45
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,847
But there's something I can do
because of my mixed blood.

46
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,353
I am an Ishvalan pebble,
tossed into the Amestrisian armed forces,

47
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:59,109
and in time, perhaps my small ripples
may become great waves.

48
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,697
And ironically enough,

49
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,367
it was a native-born Amestrisian
that made me realize it.

50
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:16,751
I am the festering discharge of hatred,
born of that civil war.

51
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,881
I am glad that there are those like you.

52
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,385
Major...

53
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,140
Headquarters? This is Miles.

54
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,059
We've captured Scar
in a building in Area D.

55
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,395
Inform Kimblee.

56
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,862
Whatever your circumstances might be,
I cannot let you go.

57
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,031
You must accept the judgment due to you.

58
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,283
- Just a moment!
- Who are you?

59
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,787
May! Dr. Marcoh!

60
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,291
Please don't take that man away.

61
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,298
This isn't looking good, Mr. Kimblee.

62
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,052
The clouds are moving fast.
There's a storm coming in.

63
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,264
Hurry it up.

64
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>Deciphering research notes?</i>

65
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:18,480
It's ground-breaking research
that attempts to fuse

66
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,315
Amestrisian alchemy
and Xingese alkahestry.

67
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:25,737
But all of the critical parts
are written in ancient Ishvalan.

68
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,240
Scar is the only one who can read it.
So you see...

69
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,871
You're the alkahestry girl, aren't you?

70
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,832
I have orders to bring you back
to the fort.

71
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,251
Me?

72
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,214
Don't worry. You're to receive
a warm welcome.

73
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,884
Well now, if Scar can't be captured

74
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,596
and it would be bad if they found out
that Marcoh is here...

75
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,811
It might be best to hide
all of you together at Fort Briggs.

76
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,814
Hold on a second. What do you mean?

77
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,483
Are you telling me
we're bringing him, too?

78
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,111
We need him to decipher
the research notes, right?

79
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,197
To think that we need this guy's help...

80
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,617
- Just hand him over to Kimblee already!
- The countrywide transmutation circle

81
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,287
and the origins of this country...

82
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,874
I heard all about it
from General Armstrong.

83
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,504
Something is about to happen
that is going to engulf all of Amestris.

84
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:29,259
Deciphering the research notes
is more important than anything, isn't it?

85
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,265
I heard that the Rockbell girl
is being kept as their hostage.

86
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:40,020
If we act now, we can disgrace Kimblee
and hide her away.

87
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,947
Scar, if you work with us,
I will postpone your judgment until later.

88
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,574
What do you say?

89
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,369
It appears that I don't have
any other choice.

90
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,372
I promise to work with you.

91
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,875
You're sincere?

92
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,380
I swear it on my Ishvalan blood,
my red-eyed brother.

93
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,300
That's that.

94
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,637
I'm sorry, miss, but you'll have to wait
a short while for him to be punished.

95
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,848
Okay.

96
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,895
Come to think of it.
I forgot about these guys.

97
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,229
- Dispose of them.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,564
Hey!

99
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,192
Just a minute!
You don't have to kill them!

100
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,278
There's no value in leaving them alive.
Kill them.

101
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:34,908
No, it's not about value.
Isn't there any way to let them live?

102
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,578
Are you showing us mercy? Is that it?

103
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,624
Who asked you,
you sentimental know-nothing?

104
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,877
In the bodies we have,
we know what lies ahead for us anyhow.

105
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,129
If you're gonna kill us, then do it.

106
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,926
Misters, don't you have families
or loved ones?

107
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,677
Sure we do.

108
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,723
But once we got these bodies,
they were told that we were dead.

109
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,058
We haven't seen them since.

110
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,519
Don't you want to see them?

111
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,814
Even if we do, there's no way we can,
in our shape.

112
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,194
Then you don't want to go back
to your original bodies.

113
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,155
You're content with the bodies you have?

114
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,117
- No way we could be!
- Of course we want to go back!

115
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,620
There's your answer, right?

116
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,999
Don't go talking to me
about "anyhows" or "no ways".

117
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,671
Not without investigating the possibility
of getting your original bodies back.

118
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,593
- What could you possibly know about us?
- What possibility is there of going back?

119
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,519
I'm going back.
No matter how many years it takes.

120
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,021
I'm not going to give up.

121
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,899
Major!

122
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,402
- What is it?
- This is bad.

123
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,154
There's going to be a storm.

124
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,907
We can't conduct a snowbound march
with the equipment here.

125
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,077
We won't be able
to reach the fort at this rate.

126
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,163
What do we do?

127
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,832
This is a mining town, right?

128
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,168
Why don't we just use
the underground tunnels?

129
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:14,465
What? I mean, as large as this mine is,

130
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:20,138
there has to be a tunnel that goes
beyond the mountain... I think.

131
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,432
- That's it!
- Mr. Yoki!

132
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,018
Give a little credit
to the former mine proprietor.

133
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,771
We can make it.
The tunnels come out past the mountain.

134
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,943
All right. Once you meet some soldiers
from Fort Briggs, give them this.

135
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,573
I've written down what's going on inside,
so they will provide you with shelter.

136
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,741
Thank you.

137
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,703
That leaves the matter of the young lady.

138
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,792
Assuming she comes together with us,
when it comes out that she's gone missing,

139
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,630
the Elric brothers will be the first ones
they suspect, won't they?

140
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,506
We can handle ourselves.

141
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,719
I don't mean to brag, but when it comes
to having a smooth tongue...

142
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,306
No, this is the skeptical Kimblee
we're dealing with.

143
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,142
If you try anything half-cocked,
it will just make him more suspicious.

144
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:19,238
I hate to be the one
to suggest this, but...

145
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,993
What if I were to be taken hostage
by Scar?

146
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,127
Kidnapped?

147
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:38,216
So what you're saying is, let him go?

148
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,386
Yes, Scar will run away, carrying me.

149
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,181
Ed, you and the others
will try desperately to stop him,

150
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
or so it will look like to those
who are after us.

151
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,396
- How can you do anything so dangerous?
- My life is in their hands!

152
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,233
So unless I risk my life to escape,
I won't get away!

153
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,360
But to go together with Scar...

154
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,863
Yeah! There's no need for you
to risk your life!

155
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,535
You guys, stop, always taking everything
upon yourselves!

156
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,667
Make up your minds quickly.
The storm is closing in.

157
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,294
Soon, we won't be able
to set one foot out of here.

158
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,051
Kimblee's forces are within sight!

159
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,806
Damn it all!

160
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,563
- Scar, if you pull anything...
- I know. I will keep my promise.

161
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,277
Us, too...

162
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,780
Take us with you, too!

163
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,579
I know you don't trust us,
so we don't mind if you take us in cuffs.

164
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,833
Mr. Kimblee is merciless to troops
who can't do their jobs.

165
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,793
One way or the other, we're dead.

166
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,172
Besides, we don't want to give up, either.

167
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,426
You're sure we can trust you?

168
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:10,516
If you do anything to obstruct us,
the country could be destroyed.

169
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,686
Including your loved ones.

170
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,689
Hold on a minute!
What do you mean by that?

171
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,318
The Central forces
weren't told anything about this!

172
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,821
Tell us more! What's going on?

173
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,290
- You're sure about this?
- Yeah.

174
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,126
You'll be able to rest easier
this way, too.

175
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,421
Scar, give us a good show.

176
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,423
All right.

177
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,677
You keep your oath
on your Ishvalan blood.

178
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,103
Miss, your ear piercings.

179
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,564
They're made of metal, right?

180
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,109
If you don't take them out,
you'll get frostbite.

181
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,535
Ed.

182
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,746
You hang onto these.

183
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,418
I'll be waiting for you at the fort.

184
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:33,099
Kimblee! Why, you!
How come you didn't keep an eye on Winry?

185
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,076
I'm worried about Zampano and Gerso.

186
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,955
Either Scar did them in
or they're trapped out in this storm.

187
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,541
Scar won't be able to move, either.

188
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,127
He must be somewhere in this town.

189
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,213
Let's make arrangements for our next
search operation now while we can.

190
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,594
Man, this storm really saved our hides.

191
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,722
Please let them reach the fort, quickly.

192
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,309
Major Miles,
Briggs is on the line for you.

193
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,439
This is Miles.

194
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,775
What?

195
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,534
So then, you're the daughter
of the Rockbells?

196
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,287
You knew my parents?

197
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,040
There isn't a doctor
that went through Ishval

198
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,792
that doesn't know their names.

199
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,796
They stuck to their physician's duty
without any regard for themselves.

200
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,218
I'm not forgiving your wantonness.

201
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,139
You must abide this.

202
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,850
And forgive what the armed forces
have done?

203
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,770
"Forgiving" is not "abiding".

204
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,397
You must not forgive
the wantonness of the world.

205
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:08,903
As a man, you must be indignant at it.
But you must abide it.

206
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,156
You must sever the chain of hatred.

207
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,825
If negative feelings come together,

208
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,286
the world will be caught
in a stream of negativity.

209
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,997
On the other hand, if positive feelings
are brought together,

210
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,042
we can also make the world
a positive stream.

211
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:28,005
That's the reason
why I'm learning alchemy.

212
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,511
Oh, here it is, here it is.

213
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,805
What is this place?

214
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:41,352
The mine's staff room.
In here should be...

215
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,022
Here it is.
See? A detailed map of the tunnels.

216
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,401
Looks complicated.
I can't tell what is what.

217
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,279
We need to go through here,
here, and here.

218
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:56,158
- Ho, you're amazing.
- Keep the praise coming.

219
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,953
At this rate, we should get
to the other side of the mountain

220
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,539
quicker than we thought.

221
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:06,252
Say, Dr. Marcoh, are there any hints
in those research notes

222
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,629
about how we can get
our original bodies back?

223
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,965
There is a possibility.

224
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,385
After all, it is an alchemy
that we know nothing about.

225
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:19,432
We've got great expectations, Doc.
I can't wait to see my family again.

226
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,561
And as henpecked as you used to be.

227
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,022
It's only your daughter
you miss, isn't it?

228
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,191
What about you? You were such a drunkard.

229
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,863
Your son can't stand you, can he?
You think you can face him now?

230
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,823
You would have to say that.

231
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,912
- Is something wrong, May?
- No.

232
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,000
Back in my country
my clan is waiting for me,

233
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,169
but when I think about when I go back...

234
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,176
The Philosopher's Stone
is made from living people.

235
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,179
No one should be allowed to seek it.

236
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,515
Even without the Stone,
if he knew how to make one,

237
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,519
His Highness, the Emperor
wouldn't hesitate to try it out

238
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,939
and sacrifice a great deal of people.

239
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,778
Just how does one obtain immortality?

240
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:19,033
It's possible that the answer to that
is written in these research notes.

241
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,496
Let's hurry to the fort
and carefully decipher them.

242
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,791
- Right.
- The fort is no longer safe?

243
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,045
General Armstrong
was summoned back to Central.

244
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,132
There are Central forces
entering the fort in great numbers.

245
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,135
No doubt at Kimblee's behest.

246
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,890
When we were at the fort, he was making
calls pretty frequently, after all.

247
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,810
Hold on. If the general is gone...

248
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:50,064
A commander affiliated with Bradley
will be posted in her place.

249
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,857
Then, what about Winry and the others?

250
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,694
Hiding them just became difficult.

251
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,863
In fact, if they're not careful,
they'll fall into enemy hands.

252
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,620
We have to warn Winry
and the others somehow.

253
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,124
It will be impossible
to catch up to them in this storm.

254
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,127
So are we just going to let them go?
I'm going after them.

255
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,338
Don't go belittling the storm, rookie.

256
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,967
You'll lose all your strength
in no time flat and freeze to death.

257
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,636
There is a way.

258
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,889
A person with a body
that doesn't get tired

259
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,102
and won't freeze to death.

260
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,778
This is worse than I imagined.

261
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,198
Let's see. The marker, the marker...

262
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,992
There it is!

263
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,334
Everything is white. I can't see anything.

264
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,031
What was that just now? My body?

265
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,534
How did...

266
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,038
It's inherently impossible
to stick someone's body

267
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,123
together with a different soul.

268
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,711
A body, which by all rights
shouldn't have a soul in it...

269
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,338
It's being rejected.

270
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,842
My body is pulling on my soul?

271
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,225
Snap out of it! Snap out of it!

272
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,355
I have to hurry.

273
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,028
Alphonse Elric...

274
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,784
Edward Elric...

275
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,538
And...

276
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,542
Van Hohenheim...

277
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:20,047
Izumi Curtis is also a possibility.

278
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,970
That leaves one more...
