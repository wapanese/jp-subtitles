1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,972
<i>The Freezing Alchemist?</i>

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:17,434
Yes. He has sneaked his way here
into the Central.

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:23,148
Colonel Roy Mustang, I would like
to put you in charge of capturing him.

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,566
If that is your order.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,320
Oh, I'm so glad you are in Central.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,948
- I can rest assured leaving this to you.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:36,245
One more thing. The boy is here, as well.
Use him however you like.

8
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,540
Fuhrer Bradley, by boy, do you mean...?

9
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,253
Yes, the Fullmetal Alchemist,
Edward Elric.

10
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:48,257
Man, the colonel is such a slave driver.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,511
We'd already bought our tickets to Liore,
but that's been cancelled, huh?

12
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,721
Nothing we can do about it.

13
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,767
- Let's hurry and get this over with, Al.
- Brother.

14
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,288
FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST

15
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,238
There he goes! That way!

16
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,740
Halt! Halt, or else!

17
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,259
Freezing and boiling,
both attributes of water.

18
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,808
Alchemy...

19
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,310
What a nasty thing to do.

20
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:09,064
In order to do great things,
sacrifices must be made.

21
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,066
It's what's known as equivalent exchange.

22
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,070
There's no way you can call that
equivalent exchange!

23
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,246
Without even a transmutation circle...

24
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,624
You can't afford to be so intrigued!

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,261
What?! Impossible!

26
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,763
Any water in there should have boiled!

27
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,600
You ruined my coat, you know.

28
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,270
Automail...

29
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,903
The skill of a gifted alchemist,
one who doesn't use transmutation circles,

30
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,448
as well as an automail right arm.

31
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:05,954
You are the Fullmetal Alchemist,
Edward Elric.

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,713
- Not you?
- Oh, I'm his younger brother, Alphonse.

33
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,716
- This runt?
- Who's a puny runt?

34
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,807
To think that the man
they call the Fullmetal Alchemist

35
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,769
is just a little child.

36
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,061
Don't call me little!

37
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:36,401
Brother, I don't think he meant
your height just now.

38
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,487
Even if he didn't, he's going to pay.

39
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,991
That's the Fullmetal Alchemist,
Edward Elric, for you.

40
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,994
Thank you very much for your assistance.

41
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:51,500
- No, I'm his younger brother, Alphonse.
- Okay.

42
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,503
Sorry to keep you waiting, Al.
Now, let's get going.

43
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,506
Geez, you're always so impatient.

44
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,978
- Steam?
- Brother! He's loose!

45
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,981
Damn it! Trifle with us, will he?

46
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,986
Looks like you underestimated
your opponent, Fullmetal.

47
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,280
Who is that guy?

48
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,492
I thought I told you to listen
to the briefing.

49
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,494
But no, you had to go right after him--

50
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,997
Yeah, yeah, all right. I'm terribly sorry.

51
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,210
You should listen more carefully
when your elders speak.

52
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,503
Right, right.

53
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,757
Now then, his name is Isaac McDougal.

54
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,512
He's a former State Alchemist,
who they called Isaac the Freezer.

55
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,721
Former?

56
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,934
That's right. He took part
in the Ishvalan War of Extermination

57
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,520
as a member of the military.

58
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,776
After the war, he renounced
his State Alchemist title

59
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,321
and went on to join
the antiestablishment movement.

60
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,699
Taking him into custody
is a matter of top priority.

61
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,160
We may have to kill him,
depending on the situation.

62
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,496
I'm not about to kill anyone.

63
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,210
Suit yourself.
All we're after is your performance.

64
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,927
By the way, have you found any leads
on getting your bodies back to normal?

65
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,430
You never give me any time to!

66
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,434
Yo, Roy! Hell of an order you drew,

67
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,728
to take the Freezing Alchemist
into custody, huh?

68
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,022
Or is this your big chance
to be promoted to Central?

69
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,231
HERE COMES THE PEST

70
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,444
Oh? By any chance,
are you the Elric brothers?

71
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:47,490
Wow, it's an honor to meet
the youngest State Alchemist.

72
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:53,204
- I'm Maes Hughes, Lt. Colonel.
- I'm his younger brother, Alphonse.

73
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,000
What? You're the Fullmetal Alchemist?

74
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,210
Don't you call me little!

75
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,212
- Hughes.
- Yeah?

76
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,298
If you don't need anything, then go home.

77
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,217
I will go once my business is done.

78
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,596
You guys don't have
a place to stay yet, right?

79
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
So come home with me.

80
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,400
My wife, Gracia, and my daughter, Elicia.

81
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,029
Elicia...

82
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:34,037
- Papa, your beard hurts.
- It does? Skritchy skritchy!

83
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,541
<i>Look, these are our guests today,
</i><i>the Elric brothers.</i>

84
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,293
So big!

85
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,046
So little!

86
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,925
Elicia, I am Edward Elric,

87
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,844
and this is my younger brother,
Alphonse Elric.

88
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,056
Understand? Younger brother.

89
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,308
If you're the older brother,
how come you're so little?

90
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,311
Let me go, Al! Don't stop me!

91
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,438
Now, now, they're letting us stay here,
so behave yourself.

92
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,817
Let's have dinner right away.
Gracia's cooking is delicious.

93
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,324
- Okay, eat up.
- I graciously accept this meal.

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,413
Yum! It's delicious!

95
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,250
- Have plenty, okay?
- Sure!

96
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,336
Alphonse, you can't eat
while still wearing your armor, right?

97
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,756
Well, you see...

98
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,718
Al is in the middle
of his alchemy training right now.

99
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,763
Okay, Al, I'll eat enough
for both of us today, too.

100
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,473
Training! Training!

101
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,855
CENTRAL PRISON

102
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:46,109
That's the funniest joke
I've heard in a while.

103
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,238
The Freezing Alchemist and me, team up?

104
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,241
Me, the Crimson Alchemist?

105
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:59,247
Kimblee, together we'll get Bradley,
and bring down this rotten military.

106
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,877
You must have seen the hell
that took place in Ishval.

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,964
You must know what Bradley
made us do there.

108
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,259
That's why you killed
those officers, right?

109
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,555
Please, don't misunderstand.

110
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,642
I do not think in such
sophisticated terms.

111
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:25,273
I killed those guys because
I wanted to kill them, nothing more.

112
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:30,445
That's too bad, Kimblee.
It truly is too bad.

113
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,576
Good work.

114
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,173
- This is unusual. Can't sleep?
- Nah.

115
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,347
Do you want me to guess?

116
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,558
You were thinking about those two,
weren't you?

117
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:07,357
State Alchemists are the ones
who people call Dogs of the Military.

118
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,568
When I think of him
being called that at his age...

119
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,826
Brother, are you awake?

120
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:22,247
Mrs. Gracia's quiche
looked like Mom's, huh?

121
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,707
- Yeah, it was delicious.
- Really?

122
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,544
In that case, I'll have to add it
to the list of things to eat

123
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,837
once I get my body back.

124
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,340
Yeah, add it on, add it on.

125
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,301
<i>Brother...</i>

126
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,805
<i>I sure would like to get
</i><i>our old bodies back soon.</i>

127
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,306
<i>Yeah.</i>

128
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,021
One more.

129
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,985
One more and Bradley's on his way to hell.

130
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,490
<i>According to reports, Isaac sneaked
</i><i>into Central Prison last night.</i>

131
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,160
The situation doesn't leave us
a moment to spare.

132
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,244
Find him, no matter what.

133
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,249
Close off all roads
and look in every last spot.

134
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,793
Upon finding him,
you are free to shoot him dead.

135
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,962
That is an order from the Fuhrer.

136
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,466
I'm going out, too.

137
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,470
- Medic! Hurry!
- Report to headquarters, five men dead.

138
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,807
- How awful.
- Steam explosion.

139
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,726
When you rapidly raise
the temperature of water,

140
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,686
it expands with explosive force.

141
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,023
The human body is 70 percent water,
after all.

142
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,276
Let's hurry. We have to find him quickly.

143
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,697
All right.

144
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,829
<i>Impressive, being able to dodge
</i><i>my alchemy, Mr. Isaac.</i>

145
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,791
- That voice... Armstrong?
<i>- Indeed it is!</i>

146
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:58,801
The Strong Arm Alchemist,
Alex Louis Armstrong.

147
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,928
Take this!

148
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,808
High-pressure water
will slice through anything.

149
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,564
It is all for naught before my fist!

150
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,073
Major!

151
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,577
Look out!

152
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:32,126
- Water from his canteen? Thank you, Al.
- Let's get after him, Brother.

153
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,753
Let's go, Elric brothers!

154
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,879
- Right!
- Yeah!

155
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,806
It's been a long time, Freezing.

156
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,688
Roy Mustang... or rather,
the Flame Alchemist.

157
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,400
It's a shame, having to fight against
someone who was once a war buddy.

158
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,945
War buddy? I have no friends.

159
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,657
The only ones in Ishval
were the rotten military and their dogs!

160
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,335
Flame will never beat water!

161
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,845
Damn!

162
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,601
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- That's far enough!

163
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,438
I was wondering what you were doing
in this alley,

164
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,315
so I came back to see, and bingo!

165
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,611
It's no use trying to escape.

166
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,115
Escape? There's no need to.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,670
<i>An alchemic reaction like this,
</i><i>all at the same time...</i>

168
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,674
Impossible. It couldn't be.

169
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,635
A Philosopher's Stone!

170
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,187
- What? He used the moisture in the air...
- Edward Elric!

171
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,815
Dog of the Military, State Alchemist!

172
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,694
Do you know what this country
is trying to do?

173
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,072
Who cares? More importantly...

174
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,076
If you knew, you'd understand
what I am trying to do!

175
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,078
I told you, I don't know!

176
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,838
All right, Al! Nicely done!

177
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,674
- Brother, his alchemy!
- Yeah!

178
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,470
Hey, you! You have a Philosopher's Stone,
don't you?

179
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,971
What are you talking about?

180
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,224
If you won't tell me,
I'll force it out of you.

181
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,727
Is this any time to be talking nonsense?

182
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,241
Take a good look at the artistic alchemy.

183
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,243
He's all yours, Major!

184
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,579
This has been passed down
through the Armstrong family

185
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,624
for generations!

186
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,881
- What?
- What are you doing, Major?

187
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,967
Oh, I was just...

188
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,974
- The ice walls...
- They're connecting.

189
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,475
Don't tell me he's...

190
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,814
It's Central...
No, Central Command Center.

191
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,400
- He's going to freeze it over!
- He's going to freeze it over!

192
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,280
Major! Al and I will stop him!

193
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,242
- While we do the transmutation circles--
- ...must be destroyed! You got it!

194
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:59,500
King Bradley, now I will bury you
with my own ice!

195
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,668
Hold it!

196
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,055
You're such a pain!

197
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,815
Brother!

198
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,275
Too slow!

199
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,529
Al!

200
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,458
An empty suit of armor?

201
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:47,173
You mean, your soul
is bonded to the hollow.

202
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:53,429
You lost your arm
and your brother's body is hollow...

203
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,264
I get it! You guys...

204
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,060
Committed the taboo!

205
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:06,025
You performed human transmutation,
alchemy's greatest taboo!

206
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>Al!</i>

207
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,280
Alphonse!

208
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,075
Damn it, this wasn't supposed to happen.

209
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:19,163
Damn it all! He's been taken away!

210
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,793
Give him back! He's my brother.

211
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,798
Give him back! He's my only brother!

212
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,141
You've just taken your first step
into hell.

213
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,747
Give it up. There's no water
for you to use.

214
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,335
You've forgotten something.
What is 70 percent of the body made of?

215
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,590
Brother!

216
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,388
You guys don't understand
the shape this country is in!

217
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,403
- Brother! Brother!
- Al, we're going after him.

218
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,782
Mess around with me... Will he?

219
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,537
Did we get it?

220
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,040
Not again!

221
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,340
Don't underestimate my flames!

222
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,842
Good grief.

223
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,845
Please, only try to be useless
on rainy days, okay?

224
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,481
Bradley!

225
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,739
Say your prayers!

226
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,074
That's too bad.

227
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,703
Major! Now!

228
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:07,289
Acknowledged!

229
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,231
Fuhrer King Bradley...

230
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:37,820
Oh, good work, Fullmetal Alchemist.
I see...

231
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,449
To think that I'd be able
to give you a hand.

232
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,326
This will make a good story for my son.

233
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:52,543
What, you got a cold? Anyhow, I hear
you really outdid yourself, huh?

234
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,629
I just destroyed
the transmutation circles.

235
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,174
The Fuhrer is the one
who brought down the criminal.

236
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,594
And the Fuhrer is giving you credit
for the deed.

237
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,265
What's wrong, you upset?
Just graciously accept the compliment.

238
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:11,145
Haven't I always told you,
listen carefully when your elders speak?

239
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,859
It turns out...

240
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,321
We never did find out whether or not
he had a Philosopher's Stone.

241
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,616
Yeah, we'll just have to wait
for the military's report.

242
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,872
Edward Elric, when I heard you
were in the hospital, I dashed over!

243
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,837
Here, let me relieve your boredom
while you're in here.

244
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,884
<i>I'm sure the beauty of my muscles
</i><i>will warm your heart.</i>

245
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,011
<i>Don't be shy.
</i><i>You can touch them if you like.</i>

246
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,431
<i>Stop!</i>

247
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,896
Oh, Isaac is dead, is he?

248
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,066
Such a shame,
he would have been a good sacrifice.

249
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:03,280
So, what about the Philosopher's Stone?
Hmm, he overused it.

250
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,409
Gluttony, you shouldn't eat such things.

251
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,664
Yes, things are going well in Liore.

252
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,795
<i>It will begin, very soon.</i>
