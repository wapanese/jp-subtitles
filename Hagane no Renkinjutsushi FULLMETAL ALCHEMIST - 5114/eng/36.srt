1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,089
Donatus,

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:10,594
Poswell, Reinmeir, Gianni,

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,847
Collins, Toni, Willard,

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:18,644
Ripley, Mechthild, Mayo...

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,105
Forgive me,
but I had to use you years ago.

6
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,416
13 YEARS AGO

7
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,880
You ought to caress them.

8
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,424
They are your sons, right?

9
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,385
I don't want the monster to spread.

10
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,178
Oh, brother.

11
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,972
If you could catch it by doing that,

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,349
I would have caught it a long time ago.

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04,314
<i>Ever since I got this body,
</i><i>I've seen a lot of death.</i>

14
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:09,194
<i>But if I thought about it as one part
</i><i>of the flow of the larger world,</i>

15
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>it helped to alleviate
</i><i>the sorrow somewhat.</i>

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,993
<i>Every time I would encounter
</i><i>something beautiful, or wondrous,</i>

17
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,204
<i>it was okay that I accepted
</i><i>this body, and went on living.</i>

18
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,249
<i>I thought that for a long time.</i>

19
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,628
That is, until I met you, Trisha,
and had children.

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,382
I don't get any older,

21
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,928
but my children age
and grow before my eyes.

22
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,640
Suddenly, it terrifies me.

23
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:42,436
I realize that I really am a monster.

24
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,443
Dear! Dear, come here a minute!

25
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,695
What is it?

26
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,075
Hello, sir.

27
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,702
A photographer?

28
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,204
Yes. Fix yourself up.

29
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,332
We haven't yet taken a picture
with all of us, right?

30
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,417
This is awfully sudden.

31
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,720
Here, you hold Ed.

32
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,971
Okay.

33
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,643
We're ready. If you please.

34
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,645
Oh, boy.

35
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:33,403
Okay, look over here. Don't move, okay?

36
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:39,326
Someday, I'll be a wrinkly old
monster of a woman myself.

37
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,704
Even so, no matter what form I take,

38
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,083
I want to be able to take a photograph
of all of us together, smiling.

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,211
So let's always stay a family.

40
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:53,840
Don't go distancing yourself,
or keep aloof from the rest of us.

41
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,928
And don't put yourself down
with words like "monster."

42
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,181
Okay, I'm taking it.

43
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,436
Smile, dear.

44
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:24,079
<i>I had planned to accept this body,
</i><i>and live on and on,</i>

45
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,581
<i>but it's different now.</i>

46
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,046
<i>I want to be with Trisha
</i><i>and the children...</i>

47
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,550
<i>to grow old and die with them.</i>

48
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,806
That bastard.

49
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,440
That ought to do it.

50
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,113
What are you doing?

51
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,283
Fixing the swing.

52
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,743
That's so unlike you.

53
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,621
I've never been able
to do anything for them,

54
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,789
but I can do this much.

55
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,044
Trisha, I'm going away.

56
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,755
Wait here for me.

57
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:18,842
Okay.

58
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,682
Don't tell the children about my body.

59
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,310
Okay. Are you sure
you don't want to wake them?

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,814
If I see their faces...

61
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,400
You dummy, it's okay to cry.

62
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,079
Goodness,
what are you doing up so early?

63
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,998
Al said he had to go potty.

64
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,168
Oh. You took care of Al, didn't you?

65
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,295
Thanks, Ed.

66
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>A little while longer.</i>

67
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,263
Well?

68
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,808
It's no use. It just won't go through.

69
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,729
Now what? We can't contact those above us.

70
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,689
What do we do? Keep going?

71
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,736
There has to be an exit
somewhere to dump out the rubble.

72
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,906
Let's go on a little farther.
Smith, you go back and report.

73
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,823
Yes, sir.

74
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,287
What's the matter?

75
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,210
Fan out!

76
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,209
<i>Would you be interested in a legion
</i><i>of completely immortal soldiers?</i>

77
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,586
He took the bait.

78
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,175
Never dying, never decaying...
You're interested too, aren't you?

79
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,178
<i>I wanna cut him to ribbons!</i>

80
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,308
It's such an extraordinary question,
I'm not sure how to answer.

81
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,395
Are you interested, or not?

82
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,813
There are only two answers.

83
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,443
It is interesting.

84
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,654
When this day
when it's not just a dream comes,

85
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:54,159
can you tell me if not just me, but my men
as well, will share in this boon?

86
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,827
When the day comes, I can.

87
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,456
<i>Does that mean there are
</i><i>no guarantees until then?</i>

88
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,333
<i>If I buy into this,</i>

89
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,671
<i>I will be forced to help facilitate
</i><i>evil doings here at Briggs.</i>

90
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,050
<i>If I do not accept, I will be
</i><i>swapped out for some other pawn,</i>

91
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,844
<i>and probably demoted.</i>

92
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,973
<i>So then, which is the best answer?</i>

93
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,478
Excuse me.

94
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,230
What is it?

95
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,733
Begging your pardon, but the
underground tunnel advance team is--

96
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,737
What's this about the underground tunnel?

97
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,281
- It's all right, speak.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,742
<i>There is something the matter
</i><i>with the advance team.</i>

99
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,619
<i>All right, I'll be right there.</i>

100
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,620
<i>I'm coming too.</i>

101
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,164
All right, let's move.

102
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,123
Just a minute!

103
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,047
We'll need this, right?

104
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,181
What's going on, Buccaneer?

105
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,602
Sir, I am moving the Elric brothers
from the east cells to the west cells.

106
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,020
Who is this gentleman?

107
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,817
Mr. Solf J. Kimblee.
He is General Raven's guest.

108
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,821
<i>Kimblee... The Crimson Alchemist.</i>

109
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:17,742
By the Elric brothers,
you mean the Fullmetal Alchemist.

110
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,745
I see, just as your second name suggests.

111
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,206
Oh, this one?

112
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>It's been a long time since
</i><i>we've had this exchange.</i>

113
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,171
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Fullmetal Alchemist.

114
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,674
Hello.

115
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,973
- General.
- What happened?

116
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,643
We've lost contact with the party
that is searching the tunnel.

117
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,311
Immediately afterward, Smith's horse,

118
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,065
and what we presume is his arm,
are all that returned.

119
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,317
Just his arm?
Where's the rest of his body?

120
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,528
Missing, sir.

121
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,783
The horse he was riding is too wound up
to be of any use.

122
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,535
Henschel, organize a rescue party.

123
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,581
That won't do, General Armstrong.

124
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,332
This hole is too dangerous.

125
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,587
Where have you put that immortal
biological weapon you mentioned?

126
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,468
Put him back,
and close up the entrance, General.

127
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,848
- There are still people--
- I am speaking to the general.

128
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,558
That is the law up here, right?

129
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,603
Obey the strong, obey the power,

130
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,396
General Armstrong.

131
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,238
I am Raven, from Central.

132
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,991
I have heard about you
from His Excellency, the F端hrer.

133
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,409
Hello.

134
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,245
It appears that you have
kept your mouth shut.

135
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,205
That was the agreement.

136
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,999
You seem discontent.

137
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,834
It would be strange
for someone not to be discontent

138
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,337
when hostages were
taken on their account, right?

139
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,215
When can we be let out of this cell?

140
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,843
The agreement was that as long
as we don't interfere with you,

141
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,346
you would let us continue our journey.

142
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,432
I will let you out of here soon,
don't worry.

143
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:10,855
Is that underground tunnel
a part of your plan, as well?

144
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,941
If everyone else finds out...

145
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,984
You needn't worry about that, either.

146
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,236
General Armstrong said she was
going to put the Homunculus

147
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,114
back in the tunnel
and then close up the hole.

148
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,368
The general has come over to our side.

149
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,084
General! Aren't we going to search
for the missing advance team?

150
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,335
Quiet, Henschel.

151
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,254
They might still be alive,
and in need of help!

152
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,839
I said be quiet!

153
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,550
Be quiet and obey.

154
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,140
Obey the power, huh?

155
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:51,229
Even the impregnable "Northern Wall
of Briggs" yields to authority, does she?

156
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,940
Well, that is the smartest approach.

157
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,993
That's what I've heard so much about?

158
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,419
Good morning, Sloth. Did you sleep well?

159
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,588
Who are you? I'm still sleepy.

160
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:21,217
Hey, now, you still have work to do.

161
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,136
Pride told you so, didn't he?

162
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,139
Pride?

163
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:32,145
Such a bother but I have no choice.

164
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:41,029
What a bother. Why was it a bother again?

165
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,574
It's too much of a bother to remember.

166
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:55,293
Not to worry. He is a Chimera,
doing work for the Central forces.

167
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,797
He is working
to make this country even greater.

168
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,800
Although, it is still
a top-secret operation.

169
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:07,889
Now, close up this hole quickly,
men of Briggs.

170
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,683
You are comrades
that now share in this secret.

171
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,283
All the important parts
are written in ancient Ishvalan,

172
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,452
so that it can't be read.

173
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,287
Do we give up?

174
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,165
If Scar were here,
he might be able to read it.

175
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,750
After all, as an Ishvalan monk,

176
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,878
there's a chance
that he knows the ancient text.

177
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,051
Could something have happened
to Mr. Scar?

178
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,014
We've found her.
The girl with the black-and-white cat.

179
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,392
All right, let's go.

180
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,655
Mr. Scar! Mr. Yoki!

181
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,906
Did you find the research notes?

182
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,992
Yes, we sure did!

183
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,327
We're relocating.

184
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,789
The Briggs soldiers
know of this place. Move.

185
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,791
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

186
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,005
This will do.

187
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,801
We, the chosen ones,
will receive near-godly bodies,

188
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,553
and will rule the world.

189
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,806
Smith, wasn't it?

190
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,767
There was nothing we could do
about the advance team.

191
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,729
Are you saying that those who are lesser
will be sacrificed for the chosen ones?

192
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,732
Yes, it's survival of the fittest.

193
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,235
The weak will become
the foundation for the country,

194
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,822
while the strong will flourish above them.

195
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,282
Is that what happened in Ishval too?

196
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,493
Yes. They were part of the plan.

197
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,788
Weaker people have been destined
to perish from the start.

198
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,296
Is that right? By all means, allow me.

199
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,297
Yes.

200
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,968
Sorry to keep you waiting.

201
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,599
You sure are making frequent
telephone calls, aren't you?

202
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,936
Where is General Raven?
I must speak with him.

203
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,401
Gravely injured and near death,

204
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,988
you showed up here,
the same day, fully recovered.

205
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,573
What sort of magic did you use?

206
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,326
That is none of your business.

207
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,829
How did you, after being imprisoned
for killing those officers,

208
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,080
ever get released?

209
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:42,335
I told you, didn't I?
That is none of your business.

210
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,338
When was this plan set in motion?

211
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,633
I've heard that it was in place
when the country was created.

212
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,845
And now, in my lifetime,
it is to be completed.

213
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,349
I am grateful for your assistance,
General Armstrong.

214
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,478
I shall speak with those above us
about preparing a seat for you.

215
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,856
- That's all right.
- What?

216
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,740
Was Smith's arm the left one?
The right one?

217
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,867
What are you...?

218
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,747
Growing old truly is terrifying, isn't it,
General Raven?

219
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,334
Long ago, you were probably
a young, high-minded soldier,

220
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,253
who had an earnest love for his country.

221
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:30,299
You can't do this!
You were to be a chosen one!

222
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,801
You were to have a seat!

223
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,095
I don't need any new seat.

224
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,763
You're going to vacate the chair

225
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,891
that your moldy old ass
is occupying, right now!

226
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,811
Meddlesome old goat!

227
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,490
Immortality...
It was right before our eyes...

228
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,828
You're going to literally
become a foundation for the state here,

229
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,997
in this ground, General Raven.

230
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,042
I was going to be immortal...

231
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,797
Buccaneer, contact Miles.

232
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,090
Yes, sir.

233
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,925
The rest of you, carry on!

234
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:13,926
General...

235
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,222
Make that concrete nice and level.

236
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,223
Yes, sir.

237
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,020
You're riding me pretty hard, aren't you?

238
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:29,692
Is it because I was a State Alchemist
who served in the Ishvalan War?

239
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,987
What will it take for you to be content?

240
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,574
Do you want to know
how your countrymen died?

241
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,284
Shut up, Kimblee.

242
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,869
Do you want me to tell you?

243
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,871
I said shut up!

244
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,749
Major, may I have a moment?

245
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,755
I have a message from General Armstrong.

246
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,885
She says, "Operation complete.
No need to buy any more time."

247
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,886
Acknowledged.

248
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,515
Well, well, at last, I don't have
to talk to him anymore.

249
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,268
It may have been an act,
but it was still tough.

250
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,980
Kimblee...

251
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,983
Nobody can find General Raven.

252
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,819
Do you know where he might have gone?

253
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,446
He's missing?

254
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,073
What can you do?

255
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,491
This place isn't safe enough

256
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,035
for an outsider to be walking
around on their own.

257
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,204
If anything happens to the general--

258
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,164
I would welcome it.

259
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,167
If anything happens to General Raven,

260
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,837
I am free to act however I see fit.

261
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,716
I have permission
from the F端hrer to do so.

262
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,012
Could I ask you for a car to drive me
to the base of the mountain, Major Miles?

263
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,015
Do you understand me?

264
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:48,437
Right now, my actions are tantamount
to the F端hrer's actions.

265
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,818
Please wait, sir!

266
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,530
We have to search for Smith and the others
before we completely cover up the hole!

267
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,784
Fullmetal figured this might happen,

268
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,495
and made us this secret passage.

269
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,834
She killed him?

270
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,168
General Raven?

271
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,296
Okay, now you've been told.

272
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,925
Hey! When are you going
to let us out of here?

273
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,928
Who knows? Take it up with the general.

274
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,722
Damn it!

275
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,433
It won't do any good
to get worked up, Brother.

276
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,476
You should let yourself rest right now.

277
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,106
I can't just sit still,
while all of this is going on!

278
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,157
Hello there. Might I have a word
with the Fullmetal Alchemist?

279
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,705
Oh, dear, do you not care
to see me for me for some reason?

280
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,708
I have brought a visitor with me
for you two today.

281
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,168
Visitor?

282
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,717
- You idiot!
- Why did you come here?

283
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,847
Why? You have to switch your automail
for the north country, right?

284
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,183
And for that matter,
what are you doing in a cell?

285
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,726
Nobody asked you to come here!

286
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,188
What's with you? I was worried about you.

287
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,731
A military person contacted me.

288
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,024
The military?

289
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:22,490
Now, now, you two, His Excellency
the F端hrer was quite concerned.

290
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,252
Kimblee?

291
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,587
Yes.

292
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,879
I heard from a friend

293
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,507
who works as a nurse
at the foot of Briggs.

294
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,175
She said he was admitted
with serious injuries,

295
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,177
but after General Raven came to visit him,

296
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,763
he recovered right away,
and was discharged.

297
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,683
Raven and Kimblee...

298
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,019
That's all the information
I have for today.

299
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,815
Thanks. Let me know
if you hear anything else.

300
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,401
Come on by the parlor again sometime.

301
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,325
Looks like you got
the old heave-ho, young man.

302
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,328
Why don't you buy some flowers,
and go after her?

303
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,040
I'm better off without her. Thanks anyway.

304
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,876
There are some women who leave you,
and some who find you.

305
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,006
I have a message for you
from Olivier Mira Armstrong,

306
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,300
Colonel Roy Mustang.

307
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,680
How about I buy all of your flowers?
