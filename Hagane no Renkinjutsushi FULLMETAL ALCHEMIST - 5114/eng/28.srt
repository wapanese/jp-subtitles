1
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,900
This sure is a creepy place
we've come to, huh?

2
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:53,280
Father, I brought a sacrifice!

3
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,491
Father? This is all so sudden...

4
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,747
Who are you?

5
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,254
Dad?

6
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,751
- Envy?
- Envy?

7
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,127
This?

8
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,589
Brother!

9
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,219
Brother!

10
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,138
Al?

11
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,142
Al in armor? Which means...

12
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,232
- We made it back, huh?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,484
- Brother!
- Yow-w-w-w!

14
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,486
- Thank goodness you're safe!
- You're hurting me, Al!

15
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,613
The corner of your armor is poking me.

16
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,283
It's just...

17
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,912
Brother, you're alive...

18
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,668
Yeah. Sorry...

19
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,672
to worry you like that.

20
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,931
- I have to wonder, though, where are we?
- This is a surprise.

21
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,517
People, coming out of his belly.

22
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,855
Hohenheim?

23
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,650
A steel arm and leg... armor...

24
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,489
Are you the Elric brothers?

25
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:05,328
- You're... not him?
- You have me mistaken for someone?

26
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,874
Hold on... Hohen...

27
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,545
By any chance,
do you mean Van Hohenheim?

28
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,630
What is your connection to him?

29
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,884
He's our father.

30
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,018
Father? That is a surprise!
He went and had children?

31
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,443
But as I understood it,
your last name was "Elric."

32
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,612
"Elric" was our mother's name!

33
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:44,534
- I see. So, where is he now?
- I don't know!

34
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,912
Never mind him, who are you?

35
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,497
You look exactly like Hohenheim,
you know!

36
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,208
- He wouldn't be dead.
- Hey, listen to me!

37
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,794
- But for him to have children...
- Brother, this man is...

38
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,466
Are you injured?
And you don't have your left hand.

39
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:09,434
There, how is that? It's broken.

40
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,944
It-- it's better...

41
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,743
- Hey... ow-w-w!
- And some broken ribs, too.

42
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:36,962
You are both precious resources to me.
You have to look after yourselves.

43
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,675
He performed alchemy
without any motion at all.

44
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,469
What's more, he didn't thin out my arm.

45
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,805
In other words, no equivalent exchange!

46
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,807
Who are you?

47
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,810
This is impossible!
What have you got going on inside you?

48
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,815
I'll ask you the same thing. Who are you?

49
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,529
- You can eat him.
- Right!

50
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,865
Just-- just a minute!
He's a friend of ours!

51
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,826
Out of consideration for us
being your sacrifices,

52
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,202
can't you, you know...

53
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,454
It is not my affair.

54
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,834
- He is not anyone that I need.
- What?

55
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,297
Brother, the Homunculi call him "Father."

56
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,009
- He's the one who created them.
- What?

57
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,929
- He did fix up our bodies, though.
- I don't like him...

58
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
or his attitude...

59
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,060
He's just like those who laugh
at humans as being fools.

60
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,107
Do you think of bugs
crawling along the ground as fools?

61
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,777
When you see a worm struggling,
you feel no association with it,

62
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,740
because your levels
are so vastly different, right?

63
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,369
That's how I think about you humans.

64
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,375
You may have healed my injuries,

65
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,336
but we still have
irreconcilable differences!

66
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,796
You seem to be the root
of all these events.

67
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,134
I'm going to settle this, right now!
I don't give a damn about the small fry.

68
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,012
You're a fine one to talk
about small fry, pipsqueak!

69
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,598
Pipsqueak?

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,606
I got you, boss man!

71
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,622
Ling! What's going on?

72
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,836
How can he transmute
without making any motion at all?

73
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,174
This is a waste of time.

74
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,043
My alchemy isn't working!

75
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,713
Ed! Al!

76
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,220
- What has that bearded guy done?
- Why?

77
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,973
Why can't we use our alchemy?

78
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,353
Really, I can't get over you lower lives.

79
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,815
As soon as you gain a great power,
you get carried away with it,

80
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,026
not even knowing what it is.

81
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,156
Did you think you brought about
the prize you now have

82
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,827
all under your own power?
That's a laugh! You fools!

83
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,539
What is this?

84
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,584
You promised me that once we got back,
you'd tell me everything!

85
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,920
Huh? I don't remember promising anything

86
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,882
- to you worms!
- Why, you!

87
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,261
- You talk too much, Envy.
- Okay, okay.

88
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,515
You may not be such bad material.

89
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,729
I might be able to increase
the number of pawns I can use.

90
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,028
- That's... a Philosopher's Stone!
- What?

91
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,448
- You're planning to do that?
- "That" what?

92
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,658
Create a Homunculus.

93
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,163
A Philosopher's Stone is poured in.

94
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,459
If all goes as planned,
a human-based Homunculus is created.

95
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,091
Although, they usually are unable
to withstand the Stone's power,

96
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,385
- and end up dying.
- I won't let you do that!

97
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,016
- Let us go, Envy!
- Damn it! What's going on?

98
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,352
Why won't our alchemy work?

99
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,606
Hey, you, bearded guy! Stop!

100
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,277
He's got someone waiting for him!
Let me go!

101
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:21,162
You can't shoot like this, huh... human?

102
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,791
- Why, you...
- It's okay! Don't shoot!

103
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,418
Don't try to pull anything!

104
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,921
- This is what I want!
- What?

105
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,841
I came to this country
to find a Philosopher's Stone!

106
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,135
He's going to just give me one!

107
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,096
- I couldn't ask for anything more!
- What are you talking about?

108
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,598
Ho, this is interesting.

109
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,018
Then, as you wish, I shall give it to you.

110
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,729
No, stop!

111
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,197
Ling!

112
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:02,162
I... I told you... not to... interfere!

113
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,670
It's all right... just sit still...

114
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:17,051
I'm the man who will be emperor
of Xing, Ling Yao...

115
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,407
What's a little kid doing here?

116
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:44,871
No matter. Hand over your body.
I'm going to use it.

117
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,375
Fine with me. You can have my body.

118
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,964
- I told you, I'm accepting you.
- Wouldn't you ordinarily reject me?

119
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,675
I'm the man who will become
the emperor of Xing!

120
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,510
What good will I be

121
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,805
if I don't have a breast
large enough to accept 20 or 30 others?

122
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,226
You're decisive. I like that.

123
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,980
- Just don't go regretting this!
- Regret this?

124
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,025
If I went home empty-handed,
there's no way I could face my vassal,

125
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,986
who went so far as to cut off
her own arm for me!

126
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,866
I want power, to protect with...

127
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,872
Absolute power, to obtain things with!
I know the risks from the outset!

128
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:36,673
I like your avarice.
Now, let's see just how ready you are!

129
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:53,272
- Ling?
- You mean the owner of this body?

130
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,777
Sorry, Greed has taken over
this container.

131
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,782
- You're not Ling?
- You're Greed?

132
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,582
Are you... that Greed?

133
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,713
- Huh? Which one do you mean?
- You don't remember?

134
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,174
- The one from Dublith.
- And which Greed was that?

135
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:25,304
- The Greed before you.
- Ah, that makes sense.

136
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:30,226
Which means I'm a different Greed
from the one you guys knew.

137
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,145
What about Ling?

138
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,984
He's a fascinating kid.
He accepted me without any trouble.

139
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,281
You're lying! He's not the sort
to be taken over so easily!

140
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,743
Answer me, Ling! Ling!

141
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,468
- What's wrong?
- Ugh... I don't like him...

142
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,596
He's a person, and yet he isn't.

143
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,060
Indeed, many people here aren't people.

144
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,647
Shao May! Thank goodness!

145
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,109
Thank goodness! I was so worried!

146
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,613
Oh... If I had to guess,
I'd say this is a touching reunion?

147
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:34,290
You don't seem to be in cahoots
with the Homunculi. Fullmetal Alchemist...

148
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,461
- Where? Where is Edward?
- That's him.

149
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,674
- He isn't anywhere, is he?
- I told you, that's him.

150
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,178
The little one there
is the Fullmetal Alchemist.

151
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,657
You've toyed with the feelings
of a pure young maiden,

152
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,158
you grain-of-rice-sized boy!

153
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,993
What was that,
you grain-of-rice-sized girl?

154
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,372
- Brother, what did you do to that--
- That's the Ishvalan I didn't get to eat.

155
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,999
- I haven't done anything!
- An insubordinate, huh?

156
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,294
- We have to hurry and get out of this!
- Indeed, he is the one.

157
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,214
He interferes at every turn with this
destructive alchemy.

158
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,883
Get rid of him, Gluttony!

159
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,637
- He can't use his alchemy now!
- Okay!

160
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,020
- What?
- You'll pay for this!

161
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,148
You trampled the feelings
of a young maiden,

162
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,233
and kidnapped Shao May, to boot!

163
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,571
There's going to be hell to pay
for all of you!

164
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,702
Lucky!

165
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,917
- It just isn't working!
- Why not?

166
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,920
Why are you able to use alchemy here?

167
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,423
What do you mean?

168
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
Seriously, what's going on here?

169
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,512
- How come Scar and that girl--?
- I don't know.

170
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,891
I don't know, but...
this could be our chance

171
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,101
to salvage this situation. Scar!

172
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,607
Let me tell you the truth
about the Ishvalan Civil War!

173
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,027
- The truth?
- The child-shooting incident

174
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,031
that triggered the uprising
was carried out by Envy there,

175
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,325
who had changed himself
into a military officer!

176
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,330
These guys set up the whole thing!

177
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,968
It sounds like I need to get
some more details out of you.

178
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:03,648
Answer me!
Why did you have to destroy us?

179
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,653
Depending on how you answer,
I'll send you to God--

180
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,950
no, you will not get to be with God,
where my Ishvalan brothers sleep.

181
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,745
Consider yourselves
without rest or salvation!

182
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,381
Oh, awesome! Not bad for a human.

183
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,760
- Greed, dispose of the outsiders.
- Right, right.

184
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,769
I don't believe it, Ling!

185
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,773
It's Greed!

186
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:56,117
That is... Ling, of the Yao family?

187
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:01,831
A girl! Such tender flesh!

188
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,549
Hey, you. How can you still use alchemy?

189
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,680
You really are using it.

190
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,269
Bodily destruction... no, decomposition.

191
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,862
If I was one moment slower in escaping,
I would have been...

192
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,573
Mr. Scar!

193
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,040
Shao May, run!

194
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,000
You're mine!

195
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,170
Are you all right?

196
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,970
- I don't remember asking for your help.
- You can't possibly be that naive!

197
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,474
These guys show no mercy to anyone
who is of no use to them.

198
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,309
You have to get out of here, quickly!

199
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,814
There's too many of them.

200
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,113
I thought you guys ran away.

201
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,248
Scar, can you take this girl
and flee back to the surface?

202
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,377
You're letting me get away?

203
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,338
Me, the one who killed
that girl's doctor parents?

204
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,092
Yeah, I would like to beat you to death.

205
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,594
To tell you the truth,
I hate having to ask you for anything.

206
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,139
But right now,
getting this girl out of here comes first!

207
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,808
What are you going to do?

208
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,439
Apparently, we brothers
are precious human resources to them.

209
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,943
They won't kill us if we remain here.

210
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,072
I can't break out of here
while protecting the girl

211
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,032
in the state I'm in now.

212
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,035
Besides, I have no intention
of running away to the surface!

213
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,415
You're decomposing the water?

214
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,970
Jeez, if you're going to do
something like that, say so first!

215
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,179
What a reckless thing to do!

216
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,644
Igniting the hydrogen, huh? Not bad.

217
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,734
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- I don't know!

218
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,653
Gluttony, track his scent!

219
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:44,910
You don't have any regenerative
power left? You've died too much.

220
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,248
That was a pretty good kick.

221
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,625
You'll be even more entertaining
than I thought.

222
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,921
Dumb prince!

223
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,674
- Snap out of it!
- I'm Greed!

224
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,093
Who cares? Give Ling his body back!

225
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,721
I'm afraid I can't!

226
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,603
Play it cool, will you, you idiot?

227
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,690
What about your country?
What about Lan Fan?!

228
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,577
- Yow-ww-w!
- Daddy, sir, I caught him!

229
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,581
Upstairs. Take them to Wrath.

230
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,628
Man, you sure made a mess of things.

231
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:40,716
If you had behaved yourself,
we wouldn't have done anything to you.

232
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,052
Brother...

233
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,517
He's-- Ling is in there.

234
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,824
You've used up
your regenerative power, have you?

235
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,993
Not to worry, my son.

236
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,204
I will recreate you,
and leave your memories intact.

237
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,678
Chaotic humans, writhe in pain.
That is what proves you are alive.

238
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,097
And once you are done struggling,
kneel before me.
