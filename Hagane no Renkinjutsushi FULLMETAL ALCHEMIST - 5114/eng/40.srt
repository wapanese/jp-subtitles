1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,431
You're saying that General Armstrong
is linked to the disappearance

2
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,975
- of General Raven?
- Probably.

3
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,062
However, she wouldn't be so foolish
as to leave any evidence behind.

4
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,565
- Indeed.
- No matter.

5
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:51,653
Our job is to hold this fort
while that vixen is surrounded

6
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,866
by the pack of tigers in Central.

7
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,375
Well, well, General, sir...

8
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,795
To think that you'd be posted to Central.

9
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,799
- What connections do you have?
- Oh, it's all merit, you know?

10
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,802
That's rich, coming from such a greenhorn.

11
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,807
What brings you here today?

12
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,518
His Excellency, the FÃ¼hrer called me here.

13
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,188
I may not be able to go back north
for a while.

14
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,693
You can't go back? Well then,
by all means, let's have dinner sometime.

15
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:36,615
Your treat? I'm in, if you don't mind me
eating you into bankruptcy.

16
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,742
Never mind about dinner.

17
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,621
Oh, so you're a man
short on money and nerve.

18
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,540
How would you like some flowers, instead?

19
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,630
- There are many fine florists in Central.
- Are there?

20
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,137
- Enter.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,150
Now then, General Armstrong,

22
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:16,530
let me ask you
about General Raven going missing.

23
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,827
- What have you done?
<i>- I won't be able to hide it all.</i>

24
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,539
Excellency,
how is it that someone like you

25
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,792
could have someone
so thoughtless at your side?

26
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,422
Is that why you disposed of him?

27
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,674
You didn't need him, did you?

28
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,344
Having someone so talkative on your staff
is not good for you, Excellency.

29
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:45,434
- What did General Raven say to you?
- A legion of immortals...

30
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,604
The history of this country,
Your Excellency's true identity...

31
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,816
He told me all sorts of things
without me even asking.

32
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,197
And you responded to my summons,
having heard all of this?

33
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,285
Yes, sir. I came to take the seat
that fool was occupying.

34
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,040
That makes it all the more interesting!

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,879
Very well. I will give you a seat.

36
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,675
In return, my men will control
Fort Briggs. Agreed?

37
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,886
As you please, sir.

38
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,598
I have seen that my soldiers are hearty.

39
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
I am sure that Your Excellency
will find favor with them.

40
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,814
I am pleased. Struggle well, human.

41
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,655
<i>You can't steal a tiger's cubs
</i><i>without entering her den.</i>

42
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,409
I guess the general herself
entered the tiger's den, huh?

43
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,454
Yeah. This place is theirs, too.

44
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,457
However, they do not know one thing.

45
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,377
Although our master may be gone,
we are still one giant monolith,

46
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,464
acting together as with one will.

47
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,925
Such is Fort Briggs.

48
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,222
From here on, the bears and tigers
will turn on one another.

49
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,898
Is this spot taken?

50
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,651
Be my guest.

51
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,782
- How is your work going?
- See for yourself.

52
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,953
I have to work through meals,
or I'll never keep up.

53
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,790
- How about you?
- I'm keeping busy myself,

54
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,167
with so much to remember.

55
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,170
However, His Excellency works quickly,
so that helps.

56
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,672
Best of all, he doesn't slack off.

57
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,342
Sounds like this is going to be
a dull conversation.

58
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
Now that you mention it...

59
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,773
I heard that Scar was in the north.

60
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,276
The Elric brothers are also up north.

61
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,195
I see.

62
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,325
My former classmates Lucy and Ian
are up north right now,

63
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,620
- and tell me lots of things.
- Oh, yeah?

64
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,914
As I recall,
this spring, the north and the east

65
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,083
- will be conducting joint exercises.
- Yes.

66
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:20,380
Major Miles and Captain Buccaneer
outdid us many times, huh?

67
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,383
<i>Miles... Buccaneer...</i>

68
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,554
<i>And then York,
</i><i>Ida and Sugar spoke to her...</i>

69
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:34,728
Havoc, Oscar, Mike, Uni, Nora,

70
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,398
Charlie, then Uni and Lucy again...

71
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,737
<i>Then came Uni, and finally Sterling...</i>

72
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,742
"Selim Bradley is a homunculus."

73
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,166
<i>Impossible...
</i><i>But then, there's no such thing.</i>

74
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>Just what on earth
</i><i>is about to happen here in Central?</i>

75
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,726
<i>Young man...</i>

76
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,064
<i>Say, you there!</i>

77
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,983
- Oh, no!
- It's all right.

78
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,819
Over here, over here.

79
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,699
- I see.
- Hey, now.

80
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,704
How about acting surprised, or something?

81
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,040
Will you give me something
if I act surprised?

82
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,543
Hey, I like how you aren't scared.

83
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,381
- What's your name?
- No. 23.

84
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,718
Not your number, tell me your real name.

85
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,929
Don't have one. I'm a slave.

86
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,641
A slave? You mean a person not given
any rights or freedom,

87
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,186
but trafficked and deeded as a possession?

88
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,189
- Deeded?
- That's when property, rights,

89
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,608
and so on are transferred to another.

90
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,196
- You're not too smart, are you?
- Buzz off!

91
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,952
I have no idea how I was born
from someone like this.

92
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,205
You are the one who gave me blood, right?

93
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,503
Come to think of it, he did say
he would use it in an experiment.

94
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:28,216
Because you gave your blood,
I have been born into this world.

95
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,220
Thank you. Let's see...

96
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:37,767
"No. 23" is a bit brusque.
I will give you a name.

97
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:43,440
- Who do you think you are?
- You'll want a fine one, right? I know...

98
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,278
- Theo... Theophrastus Bombastus.
- Too long!

99
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,323
Oh, right, you're not too smart,
so you can't remember

100
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,452
- anything too long.
- Don't say I'm not smart!

101
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:01,207
Well then, Van...
How about Van Hohenheim?

102
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,754
Van Hohen, huh?
I can remember something like that.

103
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:10,050
It's spelled... oh, right.
Do you know how to read and write?

104
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,761
I can still work
without being able to do that.

105
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,596
Slave work.

106
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,350
Don't you want freedom and rights?

107
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,979
Do you intend to live out
your life as a slave

108
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,565
without obtaining the rights of man?

109
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,154
In that case, you're no different
than being inside a stuffy flask.

110
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,785
Let me give you some knowledge,
Van Hohenheim.

111
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,329
Hey...

112
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,291
What are you?

113
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,044
What do I call you?

114
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:52,133
Why don't you call me
the Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus?

115
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,192
<i>All things are made from the one
</i><i>and return to the one.</i>

116
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,695
In other words, one is all.

117
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,573
All is of the one.

118
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,951
All is within the one.

119
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,955
If all is not included in the one,
then all is nothing.

120
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:28,711
You pass.
You are now a fine alchemist, Hohenheim.

121
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,632
But still nothing beyond assistant level.

122
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,969
I'm nowhere near close
to your skill, Master.

123
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,891
- I'm grateful to you.
- For what?

124
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,937
Because of the knowledge you gave me,
I can now live as well as I do.

125
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,357
I'm also happy to be held
in Master's esteem.

126
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,526
Now, getting married

127
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,987
and having a family someday
is more than just a dream.

128
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,947
A family, huh?

129
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,160
Sure is inconvenient for you humans.
Unless you form communities,

130
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,954
and breed yourselves,
your species can't continue to exist.

131
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,248
Don't say "breed."

132
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:10,461
And while it might seem silly to you--
As far as humans go,

133
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:15,967
we find happiness in things
such as family and friendship.

134
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,927
Well, if you say so.

135
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,221
Okay then, what do you find happiness in?

136
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,809
Well, I don't want to ask too much,

137
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:29,939
but I think I would be happy
if I could leave this flask.

138
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,943
<i>Immortality...</i>

139
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,780
Why is it that one who has attained
the height of power and prosperity

140
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,950
- would move toward that?
- Watch your tongue!

141
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,453
You are in the presence of His Majesty!

142
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,706
If you continue your insolence,
I will smash your flask!

143
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,543
You would destroy a source of knowledge
to which you are ignorant?

144
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:57,550
Enough chatter. Immortality--
Is it possible or isn't it?

145
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:03,389
Impatience, owing to old age?
How lamentable, King of Xerxes.

146
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:10,647
Very well. I will tell you
the way to gain immortality.

147
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,904
<i>- What are you building?
</i><i>- Irrigation canals.</i>

148
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,574
<i>The king has ordered canals
</i><i>to be dug throughout the land.</i>

149
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,993
<i>That's the King of Xerxes for you.</i>

150
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,831
- He even thinks about us commoners.
- That he does.

151
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,591
- Remember! Leave no one alive!
- Yes, sir!

152
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,564
Hurry! Quickly!

153
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,276
Quickly, carve out the crests of blood!

154
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,034
The village to the north was attacked?

155
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,995
I heard they were killed to the last man.

156
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,913
Before that,
it was the village to the west.

157
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,000
- Who could be doing this?
- What a terrible tale.

158
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,335
Sure is tragic.

159
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,901
Your Majesty, your long-anticipated
transmutation circle is complete.

160
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,490
That took a long time. At last...

161
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,078
Now it is ready, right?

162
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,331
Yes. You can now become immortal.

163
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,809
Amazing.

164
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,812
The king is going to become immortal.

165
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,611
This is a moment of the ages.

166
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,172
This is immortality, is it?

167
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,929
What is this?

168
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:54,769
You said no harm would come
to those of us at the center!

169
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,570
What? What's going on? Hey, Homunculus!

170
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,826
The true center
of the transmutation circle is here,

171
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,662
- where you are standing.
- What?

172
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:17,500
I've used your blood, which is within me,
to open the doorway.

173
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,254
Hohenheim, my blood kin,

174
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:26,175
right now, you and I
are at the center of everything.

175
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,582
Your Majesty!

176
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,298
Master...

177
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,761
He's dead.

178
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,354
Is anyone there?

179
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,817
Willard... Mechthild...!

180
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:11,656
Reinmeir! Toni! Mayo!

181
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,295
Somebody... answer me.

182
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:31,425
It's no use. They've all had
their souls taken out of them.

183
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,011
Your Majesty!

184
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,974
- Are you all right?
- Well?

185
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,479
How does that body feel?

186
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,399
I'm over there...

187
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,737
I created a receptacle for myself
based on the information in your blood.

188
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,702
Well, well, I can finally walk
on my own two legs.

189
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,206
Are you Homunculus?

190
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,834
What is this? What have you done?

191
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,836
To thank you for your blood,

192
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,839
I've given you a name,
and I've given you knowledge.

193
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:14,093
And now, I've given you a body
that will live forever.

194
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:20,182
- Live forever?
- Focus your attention within yourself.

195
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,856
<i>You hear them, don't you?</i>

196
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,610
<i>The voices of all the people in the land</i>

197
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,196
<i>who were offered in exchange
</i><i>for your immortality?</i>

198
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,200
Although, I did take half of them.

199
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,414
I appreciate your cooperation, Hohenheim.

200
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,469
Mr. Hohenheim?

201
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,138
I knew it.

202
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,065
Wow, imagine,
you being Ed and Al's father...

203
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,109
And you, being my sons' teacher...

204
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,488
I'm sure they must have been
a handful for you.

205
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,948
Oh, no, don't let it concern you.

206
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,535
- Mrs. Izumi...?
- Izumi, are you all right?

207
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,082
- I'll get your medicine.
- May I have a look at her?

208
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,543
- I know a bit about medicine.
- Okay.

209
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:40,304
- I'm all right. This always happens.
- You are not all right.

210
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,890
Mr. Sig, please find us a car!

211
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,727
- Hurry!
- All right.

212
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,608
Mrs. Izumi...

213
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,321
you've seen the truth, haven't you?

214
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,323
What did you sacrifice?

215
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,618
Please be truthful with me.

216
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,875
My insides were taken away.

217
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,671
I was trying to bring my dead child
back to life.

218
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,882
I see.

219
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,887
I see.

220
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,849
Please excuse me...

221
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,746
Izumi! Hang on! Izumi!

222
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,083
- Take it easy, dear, I'm all right.
- Your belly has been run through!

223
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,088
- But my breathing is easier...
- Show me!

224
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,927
- There's no wound.
- That's impossible.

225
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,223
The organs that were taken away

226
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,226
are testament to your sin,
and cannot be brought back,

227
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,353
but I did rearrange the inside
of your belly somewhat,

228
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,105
and improved the flow of blood.

229
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:18,110
Mrs. Izumi, you must not fall just yet.

230
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,364
Hohenheim, who...

231
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,658
are you, exactly?

232
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,164
I am a Philosopher's Stone,

233
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:35,169
in the form of a man named Van Hohenheim.

234
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,970
<i>"The Sage's Stone,"</i>

235
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,389
<i>"The Celestial Stone,
</i><i>"The Grand Elixir"...</i>

236
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,392
<i>Just as the Philosopher's Stone
</i><i>is called by many names,</i>

237
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,686
<i>its form is not necessarily
</i><i>that of a stone.</i>

238
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,107
The one Dr. Marcoh had was semi-liquid.

239
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,362
The one Kimblee has is like a crystal,
and it's about this big.

240
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:29,700
You say it has tremendous energy,
so I thought it would be something larger.

241
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,495
I've never seen one larger
than pebble-sized.

242
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,625
<i>Then again, if you had
</i><i>a huge Philosopher's Stone,</i>

243
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,962
<i>it would mean using an incredible amount
</i><i>of people as material.</i>

244
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:45,716
If possible, I don't ever want to see one.
