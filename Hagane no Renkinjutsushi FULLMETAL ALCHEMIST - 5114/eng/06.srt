1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,670
<i>Alchemy is the science
</i><i>of understanding, decomposing,</i>

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,423
<i>and reconstructing matter.</i>

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:17,351
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,194
<i>Alchemists have a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

9
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,459
<i>Scar, a man who only goes
</i><i>after State Alchemists,</i>

10
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,337
<i>had attacked Edward Elric.</i>

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,549
<i>Under the assault from Scar,
</i><i>Ed was ready to die,</i>

12
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>but thanks to the intervention
</i><i>of Col. Mustang and company,</i>

13
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>he escaped with his life.</i>

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,099
<i>Once again realizing the joy
</i><i>of being alive,</i>

15
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>Ed and Al decided to return
</i><i>to their home of Resembool,</i>

16
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,982
<i>in order to restore their bodies.</i>

17
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,995
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,748
The folks at the Eastern
Command Center were all busy

19
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,084
and couldn't come,
so I'm seeing you off instead.

20
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,254
That's fine and all,
but why is the major here?

21
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,299
Isn't it obvious? What if Scar
were to attack you again or something?

22
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,010
You'd be in trouble
in the shape you're in, right?

23
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,223
The major means well.
Just accept it willingly.

24
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,102
- Children need not act so coy.
- Don't treat me like a child!

25
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,480
By the way,
you're sure Al got aboard, right?

26
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,606
Of course.

27
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,571
I thought he would be lonesome,
all by himself.

28
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,573
What do you think my brother is?

29
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,410
Oh, it's time.

30
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,915
Okay, be careful on your journey.

31
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,751
If you ever come by Central,
give me a holler.

32
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,371
Doctor Marcoh.

33
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,874
Doctor Marcoh, that's you, isn't it?

34
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:13,378
It's Alex Louis Armstrong, from Central.

35
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,965
Friend of yours?

36
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,801
He's a capable State Alchemist
from Central.

37
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:24,514
He was researching how to apply alchemy
to medical treatment,

38
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,976
but after the Ishvalan Civil War,
he went missing.

39
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,313
Let's get off, Major.

40
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:36,026
<i>A person like him might know something
</i><i>about transmuting living things.</i>

41
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,450
Do you, by any chance, know this person?

42
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,744
Major, you sure draw well.

43
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,746
The art of drawing likenesses

44
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,081
has been passed down among
the Armstrongs for generations.

45
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,834
- That looks like Dr. Mauro.
- Mauro?

46
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,171
During the civil war,
the town's doctors were all drafted,

47
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,592
which left us hard up. Dr. Mauro
really saved us when he came here.

48
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,012
He doesn't give up on any patients,
and sees them all.

49
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,096
We're glad to have him.

50
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,600
No sooner do you see this flash of light,
than you're cured.

51
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,104
This is the place.

52
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,025
Hello.

53
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,572
What are you here for?
Are you here to take me back there?

54
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,533
Please calm down, Doctor.

55
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,744
I don't ever want to go back there!
Please, anything but that!

56
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,162
It's not that. Hear me out--

57
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,248
Then you're here to silence me,
is that it?

58
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,584
- No, it's not that.
- You won't trick me.

59
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,757
- Please, I'm asking you, calm down!
- Al!

60
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,765
Imagine, changing your name and living
in hiding out here in the countryside.

61
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,435
I'd heard stories that
when you disappeared,

62
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,396
you took top-secret materials with you.

63
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,857
I couldn't take it anymore.

64
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,110
Never mind that it was ordered from above,

65
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,904
to have to dirty my hands
researching that thing.

66
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,406
That thing?

67
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,409
During the Ishvalan Civil War,

68
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,162
so many innocent people
lost their lives because of it.

69
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,669
I could give my whole life,
and still not atone for what I've done.

70
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:23,300
Even so, I decided to do all that I could,
so I became a doctor here.

71
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:30,056
Doctor, just what was it
that you were ordered to research?

72
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,809
The Philosopher's Stone.

73
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,858
What I took out of there
were my research materials

74
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,067
and the Stone itself.

75
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,945
You have a Stone? Here?

76
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,123
That's the Stone? But it's liquid.

77
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,841
"The Sage's Stone", "The Celestial Stone",

78
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,512
"The Grand Elixir",
"The Red Tincture", "The Fifth Element".

79
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,100
Just as the Philosopher's Stone
is called by many names,

80
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,270
its form is not necessarily
that of a stone.

81
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,357
However, this is an incomplete product.

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,110
There's no telling when it will reach
its limit and become unusable.

83
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:29,616
Even so, it demonstrated plenty of force
during the Ishvalan Civil War.

84
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,035
The same was true
of that false priest in Liore.

85
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,287
It may have been incomplete,

86
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,415
but his abilities
were definitely increased.

87
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,003
If something as potent as that
can be produced,

88
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,547
then depending on the research,
a complete product is not impossible.

89
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,637
Dr. Marcoh, can I see
your research materials?

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,056
Major, who exactly is this boy?

91
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,976
He is a State Alchemist.

92
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,230
A child like this?

93
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,942
<i>After the civil war,</i>

94
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,486
<i>there were so many alchemists
</i><i>who turned in their certifications,</i>

95
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,156
<i>because they could not bear
</i><i>to be human weapons.</i>

96
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,286
- And yet, you--
- I realize how foolish it is!

97
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,874
But even so, I have to keep lying here
until I achieve my goal,

98
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,793
even if it is on a bed of thorns.

99
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,969
I see. You've committed the taboo,
have you?

100
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,723
You surprise me.

101
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,393
Imagine, being able to transmute
a specific person's soul.

102
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:43,773
You just might be able to produce
a complete Philosopher's Stone.

103
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,484
- So then?
- But I cannot show you my materials.

104
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,071
- You can't mean--
- You must not seek after this thing.

105
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,991
- Not even to get our bodies back?
- No.

106
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,452
It is the devil's research.

107
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,538
If you learn about it,
you will go through hell.

108
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,623
I've already gone through hell!

109
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,670
<i>No. Please leave.</i>

110
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>I've already gone through hell!</i>

111
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,485
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

112
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,613
Incomplete though it may have been,

113
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,116
you could have at least taken the Stone
from him by force.

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,996
Yeah. I wanted it so bad I could taste it.
But...

115
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,958
We don't want to get
our bodies back so badly

116
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,753
that we would deprive this town
of its source of care.

117
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,633
We gained plenty just finding out
that a Philosopher's Stone can be made.

118
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,594
We'll look for some other way.

119
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,056
What about you, Major?

120
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,726
Are you okay with not reporting back
to Central about Dr. Marcoh?

121
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,524
All I met today was a simple
small-town doctor named Mauro.

122
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,276
Hey!

123
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,534
Dr. Marcoh.

124
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,786
This is where my materials are hidden.

125
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,248
If you're sure you won't regret
learning the truth,

126
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,541
then take a look at this.

127
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,672
Knowing you, you'll be able to find
the truth within the truth.

128
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,258
No, I've said too much.

129
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:39,472
I pray that the day will come
when you get your bodies back.

130
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,481
Brother, what does it say?

131
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,609
"National Central Library, First Branch".

132
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,947
I get it. To hide a tree,
place it in a forest, eh?

133
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,992
The volume of books
there is enormous, after all.

134
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,830
There are clues about the Stone there.

135
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,715
I've been looking for you, Marcoh.

136
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:27,186
<i>Winry! Winry!
</i><i>Our regular customer is here!</i>

137
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,526
- Yo, Granny. We're home.
- My word, what have you gotten into?

138
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,654
A lot has happened.
Can you set us up again?

139
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:42,493
- This is Major Armstrong.
- Pinako Rockbell.

140
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,831
You know, I don't see you
for a while, Ed,

141
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,125
and you've gone and grown smaller.

142
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:54,255
Hey! Usually in this situation,
you say "grown bigger"!

143
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,008
If you had grown bigger,
I would have said it.

144
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,885
What was that, you minimum hag?

145
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:06,017
I told you, when you come back
for maintenance, call first!

146
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,936
Winry, are you trying to kill me?

147
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,233
- Welcome back!
- Yeah!

148
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,486
Oh, no!

149
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,616
- Yeah, sorry. It's all smashed up.
- All smashed up?

150
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,370
This is the first-rate automail
I put my whole heart and soul into making.

151
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,914
Yeah, and now it's all
in tiny little pieces.

152
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:36,130
So, what, are you smashed up too, Al?
Just what sort of lives are you leading?

153
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,135
Geez, all you ever do is worry me.

154
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,805
I see.

155
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,433
And in order to get that information,

156
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,728
you want to go to Central
as soon as possible?

157
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,231
Yeah. We'd like you to put a rush on this.

158
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:58,111
It's not just the arm,
your leg needs adjusting, too.

159
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,365
- Oh, because he's grown so much, right?
- Shut up!

160
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,994
The leg aside, we'll have to build
the arm from scratch.

161
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:10,248
- Can you have it done in a week?
- Give us some credit.

162
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,501
Three days.

163
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,006
Make do with this spare for now.

164
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,011
Sure is hard to walk on a leg
I'm not used to.

165
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,138
We'll be finished before
you're used to it.

166
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,764
That being said,

167
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,226
between machining, assembly,
connecting, and finishing,

168
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,978
I'll be pulling nothing but all-nighters.

169
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,646
Sorry to ask so much of you.

170
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,858
You want to get to Central
as soon as possible, right?

171
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,110
Fine then. I'll overwork myself for you.

172
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,780
But in return, you're going to pay
a bundle in rush order fees.

173
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,211
- I am finished.
- Oh, thanks.

174
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,965
- I don't see Edward Elric around.
- Yeah.

175
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,677
<i>He said he was going to visit
</i><i>his mother's grave.</i>

176
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,686
<i>Major.</i>

177
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,440
<i>What kind of lives are those boys leading?</i>

178
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,528
They never send us a single letter.

179
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:27,241
They are alchemists who are well-known,
even in Central.

180
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,912
They also seem to find trouble
as a result of it.

181
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,166
Oh, but they're all right.
Those brothers are strong.

182
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,921
<i>Strong, huh? I sure hope so.</i>

183
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:47,261
Madam Pinako, are the two of them
like grandsons to you?

184
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,181
I've been watching over them
ever since they were born.

185
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,561
The boys' father was a drinking pal
of mine from long ago, you see.

186
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,982
He up and left the village,
leaving his wife and children behind.

187
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,694
I don't even know
whether or not he's alive now.

188
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:16,040
Come to think of it,
where are Miss Winry's parents?

189
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,544
They died in the Ishvalan Civil War.

190
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,842
<i>My son-- Her parents were surgeons.</i>

191
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,054
<i>They went off to the battlefield,
</i><i>what with the lack of doctors.</i>

192
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:35,351
- It was a terrible war.
- Indeed it was.

193
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,818
Oh, it's just about time to start supper.

194
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,904
You look like you eat a lot,
so it makes it worth cooking.

195
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,490
Oh, no, I couldn't let you
trouble yourself over me.

196
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,910
Food tastes better
when everyone eats together.

197
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,204
There's some spare bedding,
and the patient's bed is available

198
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,497
so you can use them.

199
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,419
<i>Those brothers don't have anywhere else
</i><i>to stay but here, either.</i>

200
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,380
<i>Having one more along makes no difference.</i>

201
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,882
What about their home?

202
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,181
<i>They don't have one.
</i><i>Those boys have no home to return to.</i>

203
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,602
<i>The day they left,
</i><i>after Ed got his state certification,</i>

204
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,563
<i>they burned their own house down.</i>

205
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>They probably did it
</i><i>so that they couldn't turn back,</i>

206
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,153
<i>without a house to come home to.</i>

207
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,830
Guess we should head back.
Everyone is waiting.

208
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,128
- I'm back--
- Edward Elric!

209
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,301
Such immaculate love,
to try to bring your mother back to life!

210
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,846
Such tremendous love,
to be willing to give up your own life

211
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,932
to transmute your brother's soul!

212
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,476
Such dreadful determination,
to burn down the home

213
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,562
that held so many memories for you,
to cut off any retreat!

214
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,233
Let me at least offer this embrace!

215
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,445
Stay back! Too stuffy! Stop!

216
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,509
You're working on it, thanks for
the hard work since the morning.

217
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,219
I've worked all night.

218
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,187
You're at it, you're at it.
Working hard so early in the morning.

219
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,273
Been up all night.

220
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,245
Don't bother me!

221
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,751
Working hard, so late into the night.

222
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,753
At this pace,
you must be about done, right?

223
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,880
I'll be up all night tonight, too.

224
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,301
They said it would take
three days to finish,

225
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,678
so just sit still and wait for them.

226
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,601
Sorry for the wait! It's done!

227
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,397
- Ready?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,190
- One.
- Two.

229
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,442
Three!

230
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,615
I hate that moment
when the nerves connect, every time.

231
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:40,661
But once we get a Philosopher's Stone,
I can kiss that pain goodbye!

232
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,748
I hate to lose our biggest source
of income.

233
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:49,086
Right. You don't have to overexert
yourselves to get back to normal.

234
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,173
Besides, isn't it nice?
The smell of the oil,

235
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,344
the hum of the bearings,
the rugged yet beautiful form,

236
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,554
whose design is based
on anatomical engineering.

237
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,516
How wonderful you are, automail!

238
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,646
- Crazy gearhead.
- Shut up, alchemy freak.

239
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,397
All right, we're done.

240
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,445
- Well?
- Yeah, feels good.

241
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,280
This time, I increased the percentage
of chrome

242
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,199
to try to make it less prone to rusting.

243
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,701
The tradeoff is that
its strength isn't as great,

244
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,078
so don't try anything crazy with--

245
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,622
- Hey, listen to me!
- Al, sorry to keep you waiting!

246
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,625
You can fix him right away?

247
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,252
You kind of have to know
the trick to it, though.

248
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,090
This seal on the inside of his back
is the medium

249
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:39,553
between Al's soul and the armor
so I have to be sure not to ruin it.

250
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,064
- All right, good as new!
- You wanna go right at it?

251
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,445
It's going to be quiet around here again.

252
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,989
It's almost time, huh?

253
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,910
We're going to Central
to get Dr. Marcoh's materials.

254
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,996
We leave first thing tomorrow morning.

255
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:21,846
He's sleeping with his tummy out again.
What am I going to do with him?

256
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,056
You're almost like his guardian, Al.

257
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,934
It's hard work having a brother
who takes so much time and effort.

258
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:33,441
- How old are you boys now?
- I'm 14, Brother is 15.

259
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,029
To think that someone the same age as me
and as tiny as him

260
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,950
is a "human weapon" is laughable, huh?

261
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,494
As vulnerable as he is when he's sleeping.

262
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,496
Thank you, both of you.

263
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,958
What's this? Why so formal?

264
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,877
I'm grateful to you, Granny and Winry,

265
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,506
for always welcoming us
like you were our real family.

266
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,469
He won't say it,
but Brother feels the same way.

267
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,636
Al.

268
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:09,059
We know that.
He doesn't have to say it for us to know.

269
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,395
Granny, Winry.

270
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,731
Thanks.

271
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,154
- Thanks for everything, Granny.
- Sure.

272
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,448
Where's Winry?

273
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,742
She has been working overnight
for several days in a row.

274
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,828
- Want me to wake her up?
- Oh, that's okay, that's okay.

275
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,832
She'd just nag me about making sure
to do maintenance and whatever. Bye.

276
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,085
Listen, boys.

277
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,045
AUTOMAIL ROCKBELL

278
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,589
Come on back once in a while
and have dinner with us.

279
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,844
You want us to come all this way
into the mountains just for dinner?

280
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,598
Ed, Al.

281
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,850
Come back soon.

282
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,022
Yeah.

283
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,417
I slept just about the entire day.

284
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,796
Really, whenever he comes here,
it's like a war hits this place.
