1
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,347
Ah, I'm worn out.

2
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,017
You were being spied on that whole time.

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,436
Mr. Fu and Lan Fan, wasn't it?

4
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,855
Hey, where is Young Lord?

5
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,821
- He's not here.
- Could he have gone missing again?

6
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,826
My word, he does this
as soon as I take my eyes off him!

7
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,831
Young Lord!
Where have you gone off to?

8
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,834
What if he's collapsed again?

9
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,171
Ah, that's a relief. Let's go.

10
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,882
Right!

11
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,678
Young Lord! Where are you?

12
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,941
There's something weird
about this country.

13
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,583
It's me. I came to check on you.

14
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,920
You're doing a fine job.

15
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,505
This is from the colonel.

16
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,510
Yo, it's the smoking dude.

17
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,346
Well? Have you beaten him even once?

18
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,766
Not even once.
And anyway, this game is boring.

19
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,478
Hey, if it's nighttime,
I can go out and cut someone up, right?

20
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,854
Of course, you can't.

21
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:12,192
Then, at least,
bring that lady Hawkeye here.

22
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,070
Yeah, I'll tell the lady.

23
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:20,075
How long do I have to keep watch
over this guy, anyway?

24
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,159
What did the colonel say?

25
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,997
He said, "Sorry to have assigned you
to this dangerous assignment.

26
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,752
Don't worry about your military duties.
We're treating it like sick leave.

27
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,047
But if anyone from the general public

28
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:39,261
or any military personnel other than us
sees you, you'll pay for it."

29
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,267
- Any news of a slightly brighter future?
- Yes.

30
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,643
What is it?

31
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,312
I've found myself a girlfriend!

32
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,898
She was really nice to me

33
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,734
when I was having trouble
with the move here.

34
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,111
She's a really fine girl, too.

35
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,489
Hey, would this girl be fun to cut up?

36
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,242
Please leave now.

37
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,788
Hey, you okay?

38
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,874
Food...

39
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,751
Aw, collapsed by the side of the road.

40
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,003
Where are you from?

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,922
What? You came from Xing?

42
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,008
What a faraway place to come from.

43
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,927
Now then, where's your entry visa?

44
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,515
Hey, make way, make way!

45
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,517
Illegal alien coming through!

46
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,771
Young Lord, where are you?

47
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,274
He's collapsed. I'm sure he's collapsed.

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,112
Now then, I guess we should drop by
the military offices first.

49
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,030
Yeah.

50
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,741
Well, I think maybe I'll go on ahead
to Mr. Hughes' house

51
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,951
and pay my respects.

52
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,079
I want to see Mrs. Gracia
and Elicia quickly.

53
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,500
Gotcha. We'll be right behind you.

54
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,251
Okay, see you later.

55
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,467
I wonder if Colonel Hughes has
put together any more information

56
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,219
about the Philosopher's Stone
for us since we left.

57
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,515
The FÃ¼hrer was pretty clear about it.

58
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,268
Let's first give him the information
that we've found out.

59
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,272
- The Homunculus.
- Yeah.

60
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,527
The colonel is
in the court-martial office, as I recall.

61
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,904
That way.

62
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,342
- Sheska? Sheska!
- Yes, ma'am?

63
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,095
You had the key to that room, right?

64
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,307
Yes, ma'am.
Ah, you mean number three, right?

65
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,685
It's still a mess
from when I was using it.

66
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,188
That's all right.
I just have to get the documents I need.

67
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,023
Really, you can't!

68
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,192
I'll tidy it up quickly,
if you could just wait a moment!

69
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,031
Okay, I'll come by later for them,
so take care of it before then.

70
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:05,949
Yes, ma'am!

71
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,884
Colonel? Colonel Mustang?

72
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,226
How long have I been asleep?

73
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,644
About ten minutes, I'd say.

74
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,151
There's no time left
before the council meeting.

75
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,363
Perhaps it's none of my business,

76
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,158
but maybe you shouldn't push yourself
so hard and you should get some rest.

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,285
Yeah, I'll be back later.

78
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,457
Was that Colonel Mustang just now?

79
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,629
Good morning, Captain Focker.

80
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,631
Good morning, Sheska.

81
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,675
By the way,
what was the colonel doing here?

82
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,303
Ah, well...

83
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,679
The storeroom is open.

84
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,682
I'm sorry! The truth is, I...

85
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,645
I bet the colonel twisted your arm, huh?

86
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,021
I won't tell anyone.

87
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,190
Thank you very much!

88
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,277
Then again, I wonder
what the colonel was looking into.

89
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,195
Do you know?

90
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,991
I don't know all the details,

91
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,577
but he asked me
if there were any materials

92
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,329
about the Fifth Laboratory.

93
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,707
Also, he asked
about the General Hughes case.

94
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,714
I got my job here through the general.

95
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,133
Ah, that's right.

96
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,137
There's a huge stack of work
to get to today.

97
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,891
Carry on.

98
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,185
Yes, sir.

99
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,953
Good morning, Sheska.

100
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,414
Sir?

101
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,082
Huh?

102
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,019
Hello.

103
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,603
Hey.

104
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,110
Have you lost some weight, sir?

105
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,363
Maybe.

106
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,699
Did you get injured?

107
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,452
Something happened down south.

108
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,288
But this is just a scratch.

109
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,622
I see.

110
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,418
I saw the Elric brothers.

111
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,296
They had gone to Dublith
to see their teacher

112
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,381
and I chanced upon them.

113
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,175
- Major...
- Sir?

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,428
Did you tell them about Hughes' death?

115
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,932
No, I couldn't bring myself to tell them.

116
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,937
- They're going to find out eventually.
- I know.

117
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,191
The Fifth Laboratory
and the Philosopher's Stones.

118
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,942
The Stones' ingredients are live humans.

119
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,363
He used to enjoy doing things for others.

120
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,700
He stuck his nose into what
the Elric brothers were investigating

121
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,703
and learned something
he would've been better off not knowing.

122
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,580
Am I wrong?

123
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,504
If the brothers find out that Hughes died

124
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,882
because of what they were involved with,
it will hurt them.

125
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,467
You're a good-hearted person.

126
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,595
You're well-informed.

127
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,971
I'm almost there.

128
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,974
Please be careful, sir.

129
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,480
There's no telling who might be listening.

130
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,817
Well, if you'll excuse me...

131
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,952
Huh? Lieutenant Hawkeye...

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,914
Oh, long time no see.

133
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,168
- Lieutenant, if you're here, then...
- Thanks for waiting.

134
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,337
Sure.

135
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,672
Oh, Fullmetal.

136
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,675
Colonel, what are you doing here?

137
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,302
I was assigned to Central last month.

138
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,557
What about you? What brings you here?

139
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,310
Well, just a little information gathering.

140
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,647
After that, we were thinking
of saying hello to Colonel Hughes.

141
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,275
How's the colonel doing?

142
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,280
- He's not here.
- Huh?

143
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,283
He retired out in the country.

144
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,369
He took his wife and kid

145
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,163
and said he was taking over
the family business.

146
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,707
So, he's not here.

147
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,043
He's not? That's too bad.

148
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,670
We were hoping to see him.

149
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,175
Fullmetal.

150
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,471
Don't get ahead of yourself
and do anything crazy.

151
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,932
Yeah...

152
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,112
You're going to treat him like a child?

153
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,907
There's no need for him to find out now.

154
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,493
The fewer obstacles those brothers have
to block their progress right now,

155
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,370
the better.

156
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,498
But they are going to find out someday.

157
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:55,673
I'm in no position
to call Major Armstrong a soft touch.

158
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,261
Are you sure this is a matter
that calls for a soft touch?

159
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,764
It's cruel.

160
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,100
The colonel isn't here.

161
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,396
Ah, that's right, Brother.
We have to tell Winry.

162
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,023
She went to Mr. Hughes' house.

163
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,524
You're right.

164
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,197
Lieutenant Ross!

165
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,742
I haven't seen you two in a while.
What's wrong?

166
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,244
We heard about Lt. Colonel Hughes.

167
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,499
Oh. That's rough, huh?

168
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,251
There was so much we wanted to tell him.

169
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,545
We wanted to say goodbye at least.

170
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,049
We weren't able to reach you.

171
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,303
It's okay. The military gave him
a proper send-off.

172
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,932
- Wow, that was nice of them.
- It's only natural.

173
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,521
Also, you might have heard,
they promoted him two ranks,

174
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,690
so he's not a lieutenant colonel,
he's a brigadier general.

175
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,692
Promoted him two ranks?

176
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,195
He retired to the countryside
and they promoted him?

177
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,202
Lieutenant Ross?

178
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,510
Here you go.

179
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,845
Thanks.

180
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,767
It can't be.

181
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,562
Why the colonel? Why?

182
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,903
Brother!

183
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,993
<i>General Hughes was killed by someone</i>

184
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,412
<i>right after you were discharged
</i><i>from the hospital, Edward.</i>

185
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,415
<i>We still haven't caught the culprit.</i>

186
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,627
<i>It's my fault.</i>

187
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>I'm the one who pulled
</i><i>Colonel Hughes into this!</i>

188
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,230
<i>Okay, be careful on your journey.</i>

189
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,192
If you ever come by Central,
give me a holler.

190
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,278
Alphonse, you can't eat
while still wearing your armor, right?

191
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,823
You guys don't have a place to stay, yes?

192
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,867
<i>So, come home with me.</i>

193
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,470
Papa!

194
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
What do we do?

195
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,907
Tell it like it is.

196
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,493
You go on back.

197
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,496
I'm the only one
who has to take the blame for this.

198
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,252
Brother, this isn't just your problem.
It's both of ours.

199
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,505
That's why I'm going, too.

200
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,675
Say, Al, what if--?

201
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,387
We made up our minds
to get our bodies back, no matter what.

202
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,308
But if people are going to die
because of us,

203
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,768
I don't want my body back.

204
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,195
- Winry is...
- Right.

205
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,907
Winry...

206
00:15:56,164 --> 00:16:02,420
There's something
that I have to tell Mrs. Gracia. May I?

207
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,630
- To me?
- Yes.

208
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,007
You too, Winry.

209
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,725
My husband learned something
about the Philosopher's Stone.

210
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,854
My husband's death
is a warning from those criminals,

211
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,482
telling you not to stick your noses in
any further, isn't it?

212
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,570
We dragged him into this.

213
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,155
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:34,744
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,501
That's just like him,
dying while trying to help others out.

216
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,755
He always came out worse
due to his meddlesome,

217
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,757
busybody ways, even back then.

218
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,595
But I don't think he ever had any regrets.

219
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,349
Not even in his dying moments.

220
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,352
We...

221
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,856
Don't say you're giving up, okay?

222
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,735
If you give up now,

223
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,738
my husband's death
will be utterly meaningless.

224
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,325
Even if the Philosopher's Stone
doesn't work out,

225
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,578
there might be some other way, right?

226
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,832
Mrs. Gracia...

227
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:28,422
Keep moving forward
in some way that you can accept.

228
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,471
Mama...

229
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,641
Mama, don't cry.

230
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,911
Winry, are you in there?

231
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:50,212
You haven't eaten, have you?
The dining room is closing soon.

232
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,964
Yeah.

233
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,301
You have to eat, to keep up your strength.

234
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,802
Yeah.

235
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,306
Okay, I'm going back to my room.

236
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,479
Apple pie?

237
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,233
I've practiced making it a few times.

238
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,237
I hate to say so myself,
but I've gotten pretty good at it.

239
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,742
Though I'm not nearly
as good as Mrs. Gracia.

240
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,496
Someday...

241
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,000
I was hoping to have Mr. Hughes
eat it someday.

242
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,147
You're saying the colonel
is snooping around the Hughes matter?

243
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,649
Yeah.

244
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,484
He may have discovered something.

245
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,112
Maybe.

246
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:57,988
What do we do?

247
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,492
We moved him to Central
thinking we could observe him better

248
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,494
where we could keep an eye on him.

249
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,956
Why can't he behave himself?

250
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,333
He's an important candidate
for sacrifice after all.

251
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,336
Haven't you gotten anything
out of your boyfriend?

252
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,340
Nothing. Either he was born an idiot
or he's just a hustler.

253
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,719
I'm going to gather more intelligence.

254
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,097
Come along, Gluttony.

255
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,103
Hey, Gluttony!
Don't leave the place a mess.

256
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,646
Geez, man.

257
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,692
Hey, Lust,

258
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,862
sure would be nice if the Flame Colonel
would behave himself, huh?

259
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,114
Yes.

260
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,367
You feel like making another play?

261
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,871
Have you got something?

262
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,876
When you've got a noisy dog,
you have to give it some food.

263
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,340
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross.

264
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,678
Henry Douglas, Provost Marshal's Office.

265
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,847
Did you need something from me?

266
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,100
You'll have to come with us. Your gun.

267
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,565
Can I ask what this is about?

268
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,319
Your name has come up
as a material witness

269
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,196
in the Maes Hughes murder case.

270
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,656
That's absurd!

271
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,160
You may tell your side later.
Come with us.

272
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,918
Lieutenant Maria Ross herself
is pleading not guilty.

273
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,379
Gather all the materials you can
pertaining to her.

274
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,799
Be quick, but do it secretly.

275
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,509
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,062
Ma'am, bundle these flowers for me.

277
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,315
Oh, my, you have a date, lover boy?

278
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,332
Been waiting long, Solaris?

279
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,086
No, I just got here.

280
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:23,467
I've missed you, Jean.
Tell me some more interesting stories.
