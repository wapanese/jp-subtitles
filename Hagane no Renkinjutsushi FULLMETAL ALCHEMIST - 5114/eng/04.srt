00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,338
<i>Alchemy is the science
</i><i>of understanding, decomposing,</i>

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,548
<i>and reconstructing matter.</i>

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,510
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

4
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:17,518
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:22,522
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:27,361
<i>Alchemy has a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,447
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,550
FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST

10
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>In the town of Liore,
</i><i>a priest of Letoism was using alchemy,</i>

11
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,254
<i>together with a Philosopher's Stone,
</i><i>to deceive the people.</i>

12
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,922
<i>Upon entering his church,</i>

13
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,634
<i>Ed and Al put a stop
</i><i>to the priest's sinister designs.</i>

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,679
<i>However,
</i><i>the Philosopher's Stone was a fake.</i>

15
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,308
<i>"Stand up and walk. Move forward."</i>

16
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,812
<i>Having lost hope,
</i><i>Ed's words stuck in Rose's heart.</i>

17
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:30,192
<i>They were words that Ed
</i><i>had directed at themselves as well.</i>

18
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,999
You are the Iron Blood Alchemist,
Basque Grand, right?

19
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,834
Who are you?

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,632
Alchemists who have turned their backs
on the ways of God shall perish.

21
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,513
So you're the murderous fiend
who only targets State Alchemists, right?

22
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,597
However,

23
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,643
you've picked the wrong opponent
to tangle with!

24
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,032
You're fast! Still...!

25
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,453
If that's how you want it...

26
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,168
That wasn't so hard.

27
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,887
What?

28
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,764
Perish!

29
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,112
<i>Another State Alchemist?</i>

30
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,365
He does have considerable skill.

31
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,367
Major, you watch yourself.

32
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,871
You could be the next one he comes after.

33
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,414
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,715
FÃ¼hrer, Your Excellency,
what are you doing here?

35
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,177
I got word of this.

36
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,765
Lt. Colonel Hughes,
are you in charge of this case?

37
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,685
- Yes, sir.
- If you need any personnel, just ask.

38
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,689
We have to crack down hard on traitors.

39
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,900
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,696
Lieutenant Breda...

41
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,452
Right. Sheesh, the Colonel
is letting his work pile up again, huh?

42
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,622
Hey, Havoc, give me a hand
with half of this, will you?

43
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,707
I've already got my hands full over here.

44
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,711
- Let's see, who is this?
- Lieutenant Yoki.

45
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,340
He's the crook
who was lining his own pockets

46
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,175
with the Youswell coal mine concessions.

47
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,137
The Elric brothers exposed his misdeeds,
and he's currently on the run.

48
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,390
Master Sergeant Fuery,
how is the radio coming?

49
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,521
The receiver has had it.
I'll have to change out the part.

50
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,567
Edward! Alphonse!

51
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,488
Welcome back, you two.
The Colonel is expecting you.

52
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,493
That Liore case was handled,
thanks to you.

53
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,744
Let me convey my gratitude.

54
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,997
No big deal. We didn't do it for you.

55
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,000
So, this Philosopher's Stone
was a dud, too?

56
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,426
The Stone was a fake,
but its power, at least, was incredible.

57
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,721
It transmuted this huge Chimera and all.

58
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,724
I wonder how he used the Stone
to do something like that.

59
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,018
We're not very familiar
with the field of live transmutation,

60
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,812
so we don't understand it all that well.

61
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,523
Still, it is kind of interesting, huh?

62
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,649
If we looked into it,

63
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,860
it might come in handy for us
getting our bodies back.

64
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,114
In that case, why don't you get some help
from a specialist?

65
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,452
The Sewing Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker.

66
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,247
He's a researcher, dealing with Chimera
transmutation. I'll introduce you to him.

67
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,708
You'd go to all that trouble, Colonel?

68
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,460
He's up to something!
He's definitely up to something!

69
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,590
Don't be so suspicious of me!
After the Liore case, this makes us even.

70
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,175
Being indebted to you would be repulsive.

71
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,847
Two years ago, Tucker
successfully transmuted a Chimera

72
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,765
that could understand
human speech,

73
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,934
and earned his qualification
as State Alchemist.

74
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:38,523
Understand human speech?
You mean, it talks? A Chimera?

75
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,692
Yeah, it spoke, supposedly.

76
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,694
It said just one thing.

77
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,238
"I want to die."

78
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,160
After that, it refused to eat anything,
and died.

79
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,583
What a huge house.

80
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,256
<i>Brother!</i>

81
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:10,680
- Lots of visitors!
- Nina, you have to keep the dog tied up.

82
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,852
Sorry about this.

83
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,272
Ever since my wife ran out on me,
the house has been like this.

84
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,950
Once again,
it's a pleasure to meet you, Edward.

85
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,827
I'm the Sewing Life Alchemist,
Shou Tucker.

86
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,581
He is interested
in transmuting living things.

87
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,084
He says he would love
to have a look at your research.

88
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,211
Sure, I don't mind.

89
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,255
- However...
- What?

90
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,467
If you want to see
what I have up my sleeve,

91
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,178
I'll have to see what you've got
up your sleeve, too.

92
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,181
That's what it is to be an alchemist.

93
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,559
Why are you interested
in transmuting living things?

94
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,355
- Oh, he's--
- Colonel...

95
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,446
You transmuted your mother?
An eleven-year-old child?

96
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,451
I see, so that's why
you're the Fullmetal Alchemist.

97
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,913
You've had a bitter experience, huh?

98
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,921
I don't know
if it will be of any use to you or not,

99
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,258
but why don't I have you look
at my laboratory?

100
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,224
Oh, how embarrassing.

101
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:40,061
I'm popularly regarded
as some authority on Chimeras,

102
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,857
but the truth is,
it hasn't been going all that well.

103
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,029
Oh, incredible!

104
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,406
This is my materials room.
Feel free to look around.

105
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:57,412
- All right, I'll start with this shelf.
- Then I'll start over there.

106
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:02,167
I'm going back to work.
I'll send someone by for you this evening.

107
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,922
They have incredible focus, don't they?

108
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,175
They've already shut out the voices
around them.

109
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,430
There are prodigies out there, huh?

110
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,874
Way up high! Way up high!

111
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,420
Al! What are you doing?

112
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,006
Nina looked like she wanted to play.

113
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,593
Hey, what are we here to do?

114
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,434
Alexander says he wants to play, too!

115
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,395
You've got some nerve.

116
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,691
They say that a lion uses all
of his strength to hunt even a rabbit.

117
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:13,696
So I, Edward Elric, will use my whole body
and soul to take you on,

118
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,699
you beast of a dog!

119
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,288
<i>Hey, chief! I'm here to pick you up.</i>

120
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,043
What are you doing?

121
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,755
Oh, you might call it a breather
from searching through data.

122
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,134
Did you find any good material?

123
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,595
Come on by tomorrow, too.

124
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,766
- You're going to come again?
- Let's play more tomorrow, okay, Nina?

125
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,939
Mr. Tucker,
I have a message from the Colonel.

126
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,651
He says "Don't forget,
Assessment Day is coming soon."

127
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,447
- Yes, I know.
- Okay.

128
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,705
Dad.

129
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,292
What's "assessment"?

130
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,505
<i>State Alchemists have to report</i>

131
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,341
<i>on the results of their research
</i><i>once a year.</i>

132
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,180
Last year, Dad didn't get
a very good evaluation.

133
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,685
If I fail this year,
I won't be a State Alchemist anymore.

134
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:31,774
You'll do fine, Dad!
You're always studying so much!

135
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,820
You're right. I have to try hard.

136
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,159
Or there will be nothing left.

137
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,167
<i>Your mother left two years ago?</i>

138
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,588
Dad said that she went back
to her parents' house.

139
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,090
I see. It must be lonesome
with just you and your father

140
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,176
living by yourselves in this big house.

141
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,511
It's fine.

142
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,474
Dad is nice to me,
and I have Alexander, too!

143
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:10,647
But lately, Dad has been in his lab
all the time.

144
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,190
I am a little bit lonely.

145
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,367
My shoulders are stiff.

146
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,744
You should get a little exercise, Brother.

147
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,456
That's a good idea. Hey, dog!

148
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,461
- Come exercise with me!
- Come on, Nina, you too.

149
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:41,219
- Wait up!
- Wait!

150
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,574
<i>Alexander, hang in there!</i>

151
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,578
<i>Don't forget,
</i><i>Assessment Day is coming soon.</i>

152
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,169
<i>Tell me,</i>

153
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,923
<i>what does it mean that he only targets
</i><i>State Alchemists?</i>

154
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,092
<i>If the military was his objective,</i>

155
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,927
<i>he could just attack soldiers
</i><i>indiscriminately.</i>

156
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,682
<i>Alchemists, with their special abilities
</i><i>are not opponents who are easily killed.</i>

157
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,685
<i>That goes double
</i><i>for those with state certification.</i>

158
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,855
Perhaps that certification is the cause?

159
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,109
The enormous pay
and various special privileges.

160
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,862
What's more, there must be many
who are envious of them.

161
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:45,908
"Alchemist, be thou for the people."

162
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,162
Alchemists, who are
supposed to be seekers of truth,

163
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,164
are changed into the military's
walking weapons

164
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,374
the moment they receive
state certification.

165
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,753
Ever since the Ishvalan Civil War,

166
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,922
there are any number of people
who would bear a grudge.

167
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,886
I have something to report, sir.

168
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:09,515
Yesterday, at 9:30,
a man with a large scar on his face

169
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,809
was witnessed on the grounds
of Central City Train Station

170
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,853
by multiple station employees.

171
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,190
The train station?
The bastard got away, did he?

172
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:24,197
Our life before I earned
state certification was terrible.

173
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,449
We were so poor.

174
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,038
My wife couldn't put up
with living like that, so she left us.

175
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,501
I have to pass this assessment,
no matter what.

176
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,547
I don't ever want to go back
to those days again.

177
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,051
It's all right, Dad! If they tell you no,

178
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,137
then me and Alexander will get mad
at the important people for you!

179
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,100
Nina, you sure are strong.

180
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,478
Nina, do you want to play
with Dad tomorrow?

181
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,398
- Really?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,899
Hooray!

183
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,779
Alexander!
Dad said he's going to play with us!

184
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,419
Hello, Mr. Tucker!
Thanks for having us again today!

185
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,254
Huh?

186
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,551
- Mr. Tucker?
- Hey, Nina!

187
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,682
- Mr. Tucker?
- Oh, you are home, aren't you?

188
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,766
Hey.

189
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,979
I did it. This is the finished product.

190
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,607
A Chimera that understands human speech.

191
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:49,365
Look there.
Listen to me. That person is Edward.

192
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,368
Ed... ward...?

193
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,288
Yes. Well done.

194
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,999
Amazing! It really does talk!

195
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,627
Yeah. Now I won't have to lose
my state certification.

196
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,548
Ed... ward...

197
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:14,348
Ed... ward. Ed... ward.

198
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,975
Big brother.

199
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,947
Mr. Tucker, when did you get
your state certification again?

200
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,201
Let's see, two years ago.

201
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,704
And when did your wife leave?

202
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,957
Two years ago.

203
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,794
Can I ask you one more question?

204
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,672
Where did Nina and Alexander go?

205
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,179
I hate kids like you,
who are quick to catch on.

206
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,390
Brother!

207
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,894
Yeah, that's it, all right!
You went and did it!

208
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,396
Two years ago, it was your wife!

209
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,400
And this time, you used your own daughter
and a dog to transmute a Chimera!

210
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,154
There are limits to what you can do
with animal experimentation, after all!

211
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,075
It's much easier to just use humans, huh?

212
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,161
What are you getting upset over?

213
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:21,666
Mankind's progress has been the result
of countless human experiments, right?

214
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,418
- If you're a scientist, then...
- Screw you!

215
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,171
Do you think you can get away
with something like this?

216
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:31,676
Toying around
with a person's life like this?

217
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,681
A person's life?
Yes, a person's life, indeed.

218
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,934
Fullmetal Alchemist,
your arm and leg, and your brother--

219
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,814
that was also the result
of toying with a person's life,

220
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,941
as you say, right?

221
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,942
No!

222
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,949
We are the same, you and me!

223
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,410
- No, we aren't!
- Yes, we are!

224
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,997
The possibility was right in front of us,
so we tried it!

225
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,332
Even though we knew that it was taboo!

226
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,877
No! I don't...

227
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,088
Alchemists don't...

228
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,591
do this sort of...

229
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,303
- I'm not... I'm not...
- Brother!

230
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,931
Any more, and he's going to die.

231
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,611
Dad.

232
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,617
Are you hurt? Dad, are you hurt?

233
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:50,254
I'm sorry. With our power,
we can't return you back to normal.

234
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,133
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

235
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,137
Let's play. Let's play.

236
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,143
I made it in time.
Now, I'll be a State Alchemist again.

237
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:20,493
A State Alchemist! The hell you are.
The hell you are!

238
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,954
Let's play.

239
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,876
Damn it!

240
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,050
<i>If ever there was an act of the devil
</i><i>in this world,</i>

241
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,595
<i>this case would definitely have to be it.</i>

242
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,889
<i>The devil, huh?</i>

243
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>Then again,
</i><i>State Alchemists must be willing to act,</i>

244
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,978
<i>and not refuse when ordered
</i><i>to take another's life.</i>

245
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,691
As far as dealing with others' lives,

246
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,152
Mr. Tucker's actions and our own positions
are not all that far apart.

247
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,990
And we chose this path,
knowing that fact full well.

248
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,746
Isn't that right, Fullmetal?

249
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,463
You will probably come across
other cases like this one later on.

250
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,883
You may have to get your own hands
dirty as well.

251
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,846
Are you going to come to a standstill
like this each time it happens?

252
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,183
Whether we get called
Dogs of the Military or cursed as devils,

253
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,645
Al and I are going to get our bodies back.

254
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:36,652
But even so,
we're not devils, let alone gods.

255
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,071
We're human.

256
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,826
We're human!

257
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,249
We can't even save one little girl.

258
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,586
We're just insignificant humans.

259
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,175
I wonder why nobody understands,

260
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,302
Nina.

261
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,602
Shou Tucker, right?

262
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:14,607
Who are you?
You're not with the military, are you?

263
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,111
How did you get in here?
There were military policemen out front.

264
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,823
Alchemists who have turned
their backs on the ways of God...

265
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,827
shall perish.

266
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,421
Dad...

267
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,927
Dad. Dad.

268
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,554
Poor thing.

269
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,433
Once you have taken this form,
there is no way to turn you back.

270
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,938
At least your passing will be in peace.

271
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:04,406
<i>God, two souls
</i><i>have just returned to you.</i>

272
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,742
<i>Please accept them into thy open bosom,</i>

273
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>and grant these poor souls</i>

274
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,875
<i>rest and salvation.</i>
