1
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,646
- Hey, where the hell are we going?
- Get in.

2
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,124
Is this...?

3
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,671
<i>The command center. What's going on here?</i>

4
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,343
Hey! You guys are filthy.

5
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:21,558
To think that the Homunculus stronghold
was deep beneath the command center.

6
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,560
Does that mean it's not just the Führer,

7
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,605
but the military itself
that has ties to them?

8
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,443
But then, it isn't all bad news.

9
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,117
- Really? My body is really in there?
- Yeah.

10
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:43,288
It told me, "You aren't my soul,
so I can't go with you."

11
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,000
You don't say. So I do have a body.

12
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,921
- All right... All right!
- All right.

13
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,926
That means we're yet another step
closer to our goal!

14
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,430
Hey, what is that black-and-white cat
doing here?

15
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,683
Oh, her?
Actually, inside here, I've got...

16
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:08,480
- What? The beansprout girl?
- Brother, your voice is too loud!

17
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,816
And for that matter,
hurry up and put on some shorts!

18
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,068
What are you doing in here? Hurry up!

19
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:29,751
- What did you bring her along for?
- I didn't have any choice, did I?

20
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,129
- She's wounded!
- Hey!

21
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:37,926
- Wrath will take it from here. In here.
- Wrath?

22
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,271
Wrath? The Führer, King Bradley?

23
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,358
Colonel!

24
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,904
- What happened?
- A lot has happened.

25
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,781
Sergeant Fuery was sent south,

26
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,368
Warrant Officer Falman north,
and Lieutenant Breda to the west.

27
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,372
Lieutenant Hawkeye
is now the Führer's personal assistant.

28
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,665
Wha--

29
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,379
What is this?
They're as good as hostages!

30
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,383
Have a seat.

31
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,390
<i>Right now, it's just us and the Führer
</i><i>in this room.</i>

32
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,018
<i>He only has one sword for a weapon.</i>

33
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,855
<i>Even so, he's confident
</i><i>that he could beat us.</i>

34
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,276
COUGH

35
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,362
Führer, sir...

36
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,910
earlier, when I was in the hospital,
you came to visit me.

37
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,620
You had us completely fooled.

38
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,833
Don't go sticking your noses in it.
Treat the whole military as the enemy.

39
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,628
That's what I ordered you to do.

40
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,423
You are important human resources for me.

41
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,009
You don't need to know any more than that.

42
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,554
If you just behave yourselves
until the time comes,

43
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,890
no harm will come to you.

44
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,102
When the time comes,
what happens to all of the other people,

45
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,771
the ones you haven't called "sacrifice"?

46
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:18,527
I told you, you don't need to know
anything more, Fullmetal Alchemist.

47
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,531
Fullmetal Alchemist, huh?

48
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,994
I chose the path of becoming a Dog of the
Military to get my original body back.

49
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,790
However,
the whole State Alchemist system itself

50
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,001
is probably just something
to select sacrifices with.

51
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,255
If you're going to be using me
for something even worse...

52
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,468
then I quit as a State Alchemist.

53
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,223
Your token as a dog is covered with blood.

54
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:53,645
I will upset your schemes,
no matter what they are.

55
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,022
I will spread the word
to the other alchemists, and then--

56
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,733
What was that girl's name again?

57
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,903
Ah yes, Winry Rockbell.

58
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:09,452
Born in Resembool, a childhood friend
of yours, and like family to you.

59
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,663
A skilled automail engineer.

60
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,290
She currently works in Rush Valley,

61
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,501
where she is well-favored
by both her customers and companions.

62
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,170
A nice, unassuming girl.

63
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,009
You keep away from her!
And everyone else around her!

64
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,886
So, what will it be?

65
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,100
If you don't want it, I will cut her down.

66
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,111
- Very well.
- Um...

67
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,989
We're all in agreement.

68
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,160
So, in exchange for us
acting as we always have under your watch,

69
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,372
please allow us to continue our journey,
our journey to get our original bodies.

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,042
If you please.

71
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,171
Makes no difference to me, as long
as you don't do anything uncalled-for.

72
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,131
What will you do, Colonel Mustang?

73
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,134
You're not going to tell me
you're quitting the military, are you?

74
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,763
Well, let's see. I may be a kept dog now,

75
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,806
but I couldn't bear
to become a beaten dog.

76
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,518
Moreover, right now,
I still have my ambitions,

77
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:20,315
so I can't take off this uniform,
or get rid of this.

78
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,319
Very well. You are all dismissed.

79
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,241
May I ask you one question,
Your Excellency?

80
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,663
- What is it, Colonel?
- Are you the one who killed Hughes?

81
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,460
- No, I'm not the one.
- Then, who was it?

82
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,963
I agreed to one question.

83
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,925
If you'll excuse me.

84
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,887
Just a moment, Alphonse.

85
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:05,694
- Was there something?
- No, you are dismissed.

86
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,829
- That was close!
- A sword just went over my head!

87
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh yeah, Colonel...

88
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,875
Give me whatever small change
you've got on you.

89
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,005
- What's this, all of a sudden?
- Just give it to me!

90
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,591
- Not much, huh?
- What are you, a shakedown artist?

91
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,927
- Well, whatever. Bye!
- Hey!

92
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,847
Sorry, Colonel, we'll report back later.

93
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,477
What the hell? Oh, no, the lieutenant!

94
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,110
Lieuten--

95
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,867
What is the matter, Colonel?
You look pale.

96
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,620
Do you know of any man who looks rosy
when he goes to a meeting spot

97
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,415
where a woman is waiting and finds
a muscle-bound mustache-head instead?

98
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,251
- Colonel.
- Lieutenant.

99
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,588
Are you all right? Excuse me.

100
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,382
Lieutenant Hawkeye,
reporting back after using the restroom.

101
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,719
I availed myself
of Major Armstrong's generosity,

102
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,929
and allowed him to relieve me
for a short while.

103
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,391
- Thank you very much, Major.
- Not at all.

104
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,935
You didn't run away?

105
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,606
Who was it that said not to give up,
no matter what happened?

106
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,612
Don't go telling me later that
you'd wished you'd run away, Lieutenant.

107
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,655
It's too late now.

108
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,204
<i>Yes, hello? Ed?</i>

109
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,539
What are you calling for out of the blue?

110
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,084
- You break your automail again?
<i>- No!</i>

111
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,836
Are you okay? You doing all right?

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,922
<i>Nothing out of the ordinary?</i>

113
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,508
<i>You aren't being followed
</i><i>by anyone suspicious, or anything?</i>

114
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,886
- Ed...
- What?

115
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>- You're creeping me out.
- What do you mean by that?</i>

116
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,936
I mean, Ed,
you barely ever call as it is,

117
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,188
and what's worse, you're worrying over me?

118
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,149
<i>Ugh, what's going on?
</i><i>Is it going to start snowing next?</i>

119
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,068
Look, you!
Do you have any idea how--

120
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,736
<i>Thanks.</i>

121
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,741
I'm glad you called. Thanks.

122
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,537
Sure. You're sure you're all right?

123
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,373
Yeah. Bye.

124
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,961
She's safe, for the time being.

125
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,382
It's that kind of desperation
that they're going to take advantage of.

126
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,677
- Ling!
- I told you, it's Greed.

127
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,096
What do you want?

128
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,392
- Your pal asked me for something.
- Ling did?

129
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,688
It's in Xingese. What does it say?

130
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,606
Dunno. Can't read it.

131
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,234
He said to give it to the girl
waiting for him.

132
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:56,030
Lan Fan-- You're not going to follow
after us and kill the girl, are you?

133
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,408
As if I'd do anything so petty.

134
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,535
Besides, I have no interest in fighting.

135
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,791
I live by the creed of never
telling a lie. Well, if you would...

136
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,047
- Hey, Ling!
- It's Greed.

137
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,225
<i>Who is he?</i>

138
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,397
<i>And why would he need to start
</i><i>a civil war, and ravage the country?</i>

139
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,818
Who's there?

140
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,364
Is there somebody there?

141
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,664
Are you injured?
Why don't you come on down?

142
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,083
I'd like to know what's happening
on the outside.

143
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,795
It's all right.
The guard won't be around for a while.

144
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,840
Besides, I'm a doctor.
I can take a look at your wound.

145
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,683
You're Ishvalan, aren't you?
That scar on your forehead...

146
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,310
Don't tell me you're Scar!

147
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,064
Who are you? What are you doing here?

148
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,322
Oh, God!

149
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,080
I am... I am an alchemist that took part
in the extermination of Ishval.

150
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,462
It's all right. She's in no mortal danger.

151
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,382
Once she gets a little rest,
she should recover.

152
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,051
- That's good.
- The hell it is!

153
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,470
You keep bringing patients here
without asking!

154
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,263
They're occupying my bed and sofa,

155
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,266
so where am I supposed
to sleep from now on, eh?

156
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,268
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

157
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,812
- Now I've got two young girls!
- Alphonse...

158
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,438
- In my house!
- Lan Fan! No!

159
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,400
- You should still be in bed.
- The Young Lord...

160
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,403
the Young Lord isn't with you?

161
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:03,282
It's okay, he's alive.
I brought a message from him.

162
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,788
I have obtained the Philosopher's Stone.

163
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,375
Lan Fan?

164
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,253
It says...

165
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,548
It says he has obtained
a Philosopher's Stone.

166
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,968
Now, our clan will be--

167
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:27,056
Yes, I have to return to my land,
and let everyone know about this!

168
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,059
Where is he? Where is the Young Lord?

169
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,980
What is it? Why won't you tell me?

170
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,357
Don't tell me something has happened
to the Young Lord.

171
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,610
Answer me, Alphonse!
Where is the Young Lord?

172
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,201
How are you feeling, Greed?

173
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,455
You're Wrath, are you? I feel fine.

174
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,417
Did you hear?
This body belongs to a Xingese prince.

175
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,211
He voluntarily accepted me,

176
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,089
because he wanted the power
to become the emperor.

177
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,425
Fascinating little chump.

178
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:08,347
That prince once asked me
what it was like to be a true king.

179
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,850
He said that a king
was to be for the people,

180
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,187
and that he could not be,
without his people.

181
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,442
The fool. He lacks desire,
and has lost everything, hasn't he?

182
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,029
Shut up!
Don't go looking down on humans.

183
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,616
There you have it.

184
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,287
He's just watching closely
for any opportunity to take over.

185
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,209
So he's even willing to take in
a monster like you, is he?

186
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,670
How great the avarice of humans.

187
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,136
The Führer is a Homunculus?

188
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:55,144
I only ever wanted to fight
for the weaker citizens of this country.

189
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:01,776
Many others think so,
believe in the military, and enlist.

190
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:07,156
- And yet, the military is...
- Why don't you quit the military?

191
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,660
With your character,
it would be hard on you to stay in.

192
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,542
This war is wrong, sir!

193
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,586
Are you going to disobey an order?

194
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,298
Very well!
Call in a replacement State Alchemist!

195
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,680
<i>In Ishval, I fled from the fighting.</i>

196
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,725
<i>I knew that the way
</i><i>the military operated was in error,</i>

197
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,605
<i>and I should have fought
</i><i>against that error.</i>

198
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,986
From then until now, not a day has gone by
that I haven't felt ashamed of myself

199
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,448
for not sticking to my convictions,
and running away.

200
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,326
If the military is once again
the battlefield,

201
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,955
how can I tuck my tail and run away?

202
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,669
Colonel, what are you going to do now?

203
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,715
I told the Führer that I still had my
ambitions, and that I would not give up.

204
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:11,929
Since the Führer has made it clear to me
that he is a Homunculus,

205
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,890
it implies that even if I were
to topple him,

206
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,642
there is still someone behind him.

207
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,563
I'm being tested. It's an honor, isn't it?

208
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,276
- You're surprisingly relaxed, sir.
- I don't know.

209
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,572
It's just that, as it was
when I was fighting that Homunculus Lust,

210
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,950
after having been called a weapon,
or a monster,

211
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,495
it's only when I'm fighting real monsters

212
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,999
that I truly feel that I'm just a human.

213
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:47,507
I see. The Young Lord voluntarily accepted
the Philosopher's Stone.

214
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,552
Sorry. If we had stopped him...

215
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,638
There's no need to apologize.

216
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,181
I'm just mad at myself,

217
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,433
because I was unable
to fulfill my role as bodyguard.

218
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,477
The Young Lord is...

219
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,440
the Young Lord is still inside
of this Greed person, right?

220
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:13,199
- Alphonse, I want an arm, right now.
- Right now? But...

221
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,619
Take me to an automail engineer. Please!

222
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,712
All right.
I'll refer you to one as soon as I can.

223
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,674
But before I do,
you have to get back your strength.

224
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,134
I'll get you something to eat
from Dr. Knocs...

225
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,096
Should you be out of bed yet?

226
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,140
- May Chang, isn't it?
- May?

227
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,191
- What?
- That's a Yao family watchdog for you.

228
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:51,612
- And you-- you're the Chang heiress.
- Indeed I am.

229
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,156
The 17th princess, May Chang.

230
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,786
If you're here in this country,
you must be after immortality.

231
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,539
You're the last ones
I'm going to let have it!

232
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,834
You're never even going to find it!

233
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,712
Just a minute!

234
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,590
I don't know what's going on,
but stop fighting!

235
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,509
- Don't butt into our national affairs!
- Don't butt into our national affairs!

236
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,262
Don't underestimate me
just because I'm injured!

237
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,265
I would say the exact same thing to you.

238
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,103
Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,649
You're my patients!
Now go lie quietly in your beds!

240
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,234
Do not butt into our national--

241
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,613
I don't care about your national affairs,
dumb ass!

242
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,451
Patients are the same in every country!

243
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,748
Are you planning to mess up
my house any further?

244
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:49,086
There could be an unknown pathogen
in this doctor's house

245
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,589
that could get out,
and kill everyone in it.

246
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,303
<i>It really is a mess in here.</i>

247
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,598
<i>I wonder if he has anyone
</i><i>who straightens up.</i>

248
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,976
Doctor, here.

249
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,773
Ah, so that's where that was.

250
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,279
- That's a family photo, isn't it?
- It's my estranged wife and son.

251
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,242
What? It's up to me
what I do with my own stuff, right?

252
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,000
Once you've straightened up,
go get some coffee or something.

253
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,713
Thanks so much for coming.

254
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,468
After all, the way things were,
I didn't know what I was going to do.

255
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,309
I just realized, I'm able to use alchemy.

256
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,359
Good work.
That takes care of all of the repairs.

257
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,195
Just what you'd expect
from a State Alchemist.

258
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,449
You're a cut above
the other alchemists around here.

259
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,704
As it happens, this morning,
there were some local alchemists

260
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,747
who were helping us out
with the recovery efforts,

261
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,125
but they ended up being useless.

262
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,877
They strolled on in here,
all full of confidence,

263
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,631
but when the time came,
they said their alchemy wasn't working.

264
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,093
<i>This morning?
</i><i>When we were down underground?</i>

265
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:23,305
Mr. Alchemist! Thank you!

266
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,643
<i>Thank you.</i>

267
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,193
<i>Can I really believe what Envy told me</i>

268
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:41,615
<i>about them only being energy forms,
</i><i>without body or mind?</i>

269
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>Snap out of it!
</i><i>Think about what lies ahead!</i>

270
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,416
<i>Earlier, it wasn't just Al and I.</i>

271
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,128
<i>Other alchemists couldn't use
</i><i>their alchemy, either.</i>

272
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:59,842
<i>But that beansprout girl and Scar
</i><i>were able to use theirs.</i>

273
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,968
<i>What does that mean?</i>

274
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,224
<i>Their alchemy is different from ours.</i>

275
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,435
<i>If I get the secret of it out of them,</i>

276
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,854
<i>then maybe we won't even need
</i><i>a Philosopher's Stone</i>

277
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:17,234
<i>to get Al's body back, and go up
</i><i>against that mustachioed bastard.</i>

278
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,992
<i>I have to give this back
</i><i>to the lieutenant.</i>

279
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,051
<i>I made Philosopher's Stones,</i>

280
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:10,848
<i>and deprived many Ishvalans
</i><i>of their lives.</i>

281
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,811
And now, they're about to make me
work with them on experiments

282
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,105
that are likely to cause
many more casualties.

283
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:23,485
So... so please, kill me! Here, now!

284
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,739
I will strike back at them with my death!

285
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,455
You appear as a god to me.

286
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,296
I still haven't heard
the whole story of Ishval.

287
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,717
What did you people do there?
Tell me everything, Marcoh!

288
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,763
Before this right arm of mine
destroys you!
