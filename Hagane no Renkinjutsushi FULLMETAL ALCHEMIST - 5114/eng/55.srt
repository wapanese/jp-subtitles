1
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:42,311
That's strange. I'm sure it was this way.

2
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:47,024
- No, that way?
- Are you lost, Fullmetal?

3
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,650
Los-- Shut up!

4
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,403
If I hadn't come back to make sure that
a certain nitwit wasn't goofing around,

5
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,530
this wouldn't be happening!

6
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,824
Nobody asked you to come back.

7
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,659
Get out of here!

8
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,913
If it weren't for me and Scar,
you definitely would have lost your way!

9
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,915
Don't you patronize me.

10
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,044
It was thanks to the lieutenant that
I was able to regain control back there.

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,462
What?

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,965
Keep it down. The enemy will find us.

13
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,597
Scar, I want to offer my thanks now,

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,141
while I can, for persuading the colonel.

15
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,480
I know that it probably

16
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,899
just upsets you Ishvalans

17
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,693
to have someone like me say thank you.

18
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,697
But you may have brought him back...

19
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,451
to who he once was.

20
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,751
Thank you.

21
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,634
Your words of gratitude are not needed.

22
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,564
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Copy that!

23
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,734
Hey! We can stop shooting! Cease fire!

24
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,159
<i>Attention, Central soldiers!</i>

25
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,496
<i>Briggs forces have taken
</i><i>the Operations Center!</i>

26
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,248
- Curse those rebels!
<i>- We have 13 men in our custody,</i>

27
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,209
<i>including General Cremin. Repeat.</i>

28
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,213
<i>Briggs forces have taken
</i><i>the Operations Center!</i>

29
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,342
All Central soldiers,
cease hostilities immediately.

30
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,345
We have General Cremin in custody.

31
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,682
So, the reason you were blasting away
with your tank

32
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,852
was to cover the sound of you
digging your hole with alchemy?

33
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,105
That's right.

34
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,238
What was that? I didn't copy!

35
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,575
- What? Are you sure?
- What is it?

36
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,494
The Operations Center
has fallen to Briggs forces!

37
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,831
They've apparently
captured General Cremin!

38
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>Operations Center, is Buccaneer there?</i>

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,502
Captain!

40
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,424
There are a large number of pale,
one-eyed, humanoid monsters on the loose!

41
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,052
<i>Not only are they hard to kill,
</i><i>they are man-eaters.</i>

42
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,681
No matter what happens,
do not open any of the gates!

43
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,518
<i>We cannot allow a single one
</i><i>of those things to get out into the city!</i>

44
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,605
Exterminate them within the walls
of the command center!

45
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,484
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,780
For the love of... What is Cremin doing?

47
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,657
From here on out, I am in command!

48
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,161
As of right now,
this is the Operations Center!

49
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,879
<i>The Fuhrer's chair.</i>

50
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:01,259
<i>If we get through this crisis,
</i><i>I will be...</i>

51
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,273
There are still more of them coming out?

52
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,572
General, what in the world
are these things?

53
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,492
They're called the Immortal Legion.

54
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,037
They were created by placing
human souls inside mannequins.

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,998
Soldiers who have no fear of death.

56
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,920
Someday, you recruits
will probably end up as one of these.

57
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,890
He's still moving?

58
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,600
How many times does he have to be killed?

59
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,727
In that case, once more!

60
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,612
What tenacity.

61
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,031
No!

62
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,374
- Major!
- General Armstrong!

63
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,376
Stay back!

64
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,505
We are the ones he is after!
Keep your distance!

65
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:34,644
Kill... the obstinate... woman general.

66
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,191
Pull!

67
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,204
Dig in!

68
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,461
Both of you, please run while you can!

69
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
This way, sirs, quickly!

70
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,133
Come, Major!

71
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,386
You would have me run away?

72
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,477
You would have me flee
from the battlefield once again?

73
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,064
There is no way
that I could do such a thing!

74
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,761
You're determined not to run. Nice.

75
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:57,560
You're a fine man. But then again,
my husband is a hundred times finer.

76
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,231
Who are you?

77
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,150
A female officer.

78
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,238
That must mean you're General Armstrong.

79
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,156
Your subordinate, the one with the mohawk,

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,867
asked me to come help you.

81
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,788
Who asked him?

82
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,209
What a bother...

83
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,179
Coming at you, dear!

84
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,681
Right!

85
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,363
- Who is that gentleman?
- My husband.

86
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,178
Valor a hundredfold!
Muscle a thousandfold!

87
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,545
Ow...

88
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,724
He's still moving?

89
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:15,281
I'm... dying... dying.

90
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,869
What is dying?

91
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,456
Too much bother... to think...

92
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,962
Too much bother... to live.

93
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,715
Too...

94
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,686
- Major!
- Major!

95
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,449
Those scrawny guys
are all that remain!

96
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,118
Give it all you've got
to exterminate them!

97
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,202
Yes, sir!

98
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,669
Sorry, I need a little breather.

99
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,838
Yes, ma'am.
Please let us take it from here!

100
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,596
I don't know who you are,
but I'm grateful for the help.

101
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,847
My pleasure.

102
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,851
You must be
a well-renowned martial artist.

103
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,939
Me? No, no.
Just a housewife and an alchemist.

104
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:34,611
You know the Elric brothers, right?
We're as close as family.

105
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,406
Then you must be Izumi Curtis.

106
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,367
- That's me.
- Are the Elric brothers here, too?

107
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,245
Yes, they should be here.

108
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:56,257
Now, then, shall we take care
of the remaining mannequin soldiers?

109
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,928
- Can you stand, sister?
- Of course I can.

110
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,932
Hold on, now. Sit back down.
With your injuries...

111
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,436
We adults can't very well
be caught lying down

112
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,607
while the youngsters are fighting.

113
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,692
What if we adults,
who carry the burden of this world,

114
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,613
failed to show the youngsters,

115
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,449
who will carry the burden of this world
after us, the way to live?

116
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,413
Well, then,
why don't we give you a hand, as well?

117
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh, thank you.

118
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,210
The two of you together
have the strength of a hundred men.

119
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,881
Oh, no, don't expect too much.

120
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,009
Apparently, I'm what
they call a "sacrifice."

121
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,514
After I've done a limited amount
of fighting, I'm flying the coop...

122
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,558
before the really bad guy catches me.

123
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,073
This is an emotional reunion.
Why so sullen?

124
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,080
You're no fun anymore.

125
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:16,170
<i>Long ago, you were full
</i><i>of feelings and interesting.</i>

126
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,592
Lust, greed, sloth,

127
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,764
gluttony, envy, wrath, pride.

128
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,767
They say that man has seven sins.

129
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,813
Sure, excessive appetites
will ruin a person.

130
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,025
But, at the same time,
each of those feelings are imperative

131
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,528
if one is to understand humanity.

132
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,198
Why did you sever yourself from them?

133
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,168
Sheesh. Watch it.

134
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,472
Listen to me!

135
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,850
You're kidding!

136
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,819
Cut it out. I'm not very good at fighting.

137
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,302
Answer me!
Why did you create the Homunculi,

138
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,305
keep them at your side,
and have them call you "Father"?

139
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,395
When you were still in your flask,

140
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,315
you even put down
the community of a family!

141
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,902
When, actually,

142
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,323
you wanted a family,
like humans have, didn't you?

143
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
<i>Where is he? Is he...</i>

144
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,011
<i>planning to stay withdrawn</i>

145
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,888
<i>until the nationwide
</i><i>transmutation circle is activated?</i>

146
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,942
I do not wish to become human.

147
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,736
I wish to become a perfect being.

148
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,159
I will have the Philosopher's Stone...

149
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,453
that is inside you!

150
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,306
Your expression has finally changed.

151
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,810
What did you do?

152
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,647
I just did what you wouldn't.

153
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,485
You probably don't understand.

154
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,989
You've cast aside something else important
besides your feelings.

155
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,866
Something important?

156
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,498
Don't think you're going
to win so easily. Not against us.

157
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,299
It's no use.
The tire is completely caught.

158
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,551
What are you doing, fuzzy-lip?

159
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,678
If we don't hurry,
the eclipse is going to start!

160
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,432
Shut up! Hurry and lift the car out!

161
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,768
Good grief.

162
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:07,360
Mr. Marcoh, please keep back.
Mr. Heinkel and I can handle this.

163
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,153
Yes, but...

164
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,864
We're fine. Let us take care of it.

165
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,908
Okay, then, here we go.

166
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,827
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

167
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,801
Turn yourselves in
to the Operations Center! Move it!

168
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,554
- Right!
- Thank you very much!

169
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,765
You know,

170
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,143
with these mannequin soldiers taking out
so many of the Central troops for us,

171
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,521
taking control is no sweat.

172
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,700
Let's keep on going
and take the main gate!

173
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,951
Yes, sir!

174
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,839
We're not even going to get a chance.

175
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,220
Why, you... Why, you...! How come?

176
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,851
I thought you were created
to obey our orders!

177
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,021
Does this mean
the good gentleman lied to us?

178
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,941
Stay back!

179
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,695
I'm not one of the ones
who were supposed to die here!

180
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,464
I don't know who you are, but well done!

181
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,301
Join my security detail,
and I will give you special--

182
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:04,310
I wonder if you might tell me more
about this "good gentleman"?

183
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,448
This place is a mess.

184
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,039
Are you going to take command here?

185
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,002
I can't fathom why anyone would sit

186
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,713
in a place where they would be
so easily shot at.

187
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,424
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am!

188
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,301
Sister!

189
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,515
Where does this passageway go?

190
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,017
It appears to lead downward
for quite a ways.

191
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,190
Is that the opening from which
the mannequin soldiers came?

192
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,360
If it is, it might link up underground.

193
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,280
Yes. Yes. Acknowledged.

194
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,951
Sir, Buccaneer Squad
has taken control of the main gate!

195
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>There was little resistance
</i><i>and our casualties are few.</i>

196
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,665
<i>We also control the main entrance!</i>

197
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,293
<i>They've secured tanks
</i><i>and are taking up positions.</i>

198
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,797
<i>Buccaneer Squad,
</i><i>maintain your current status.</i>

199
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,759
Please be absolutely sure
not to open the gates

200
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,512
until every last mannequin soldier
on the grounds has been expelled.

201
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,805
<i>Copy that.</i>

202
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>This is the west gate.
</i><i>Briggs' White Squad has taken control!</i>

203
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,354
<i>North Gate. Black Squad now has control!</i>

204
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,692
<i>Blue Squad controls the east gate!</i>

205
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,111
Yellow Squad has secured
the weapons depot.

206
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,696
You heard them, General Armstrong!

207
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,950
<i>Briggs forces now control nine-tenths
</i><i>of the Central Command Center.</i>

208
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,495
We are victorious!

209
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,961
We won!

210
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,183
The colonel didn't get here in time.

211
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,643
Hip hip hooray!

212
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,654
<i>Gentlemen, I'm back.</i>

213
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:29,663
Things have been quite astir
while I've been away, haven't they?

214
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,459
<i>As of now,
</i><i>I am personally taking command</i>

215
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,419
<i>and will oust these rebels.</i>

216
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,715
<i>All available Central forces,
</i><i>give me a hand.</i>

217
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,261
King Bradley!

218
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,764
He's alive?

219
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,059
Where is he? Where is he attacking from?

220
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,281
All salute His Excellency, the Fuhrer!
