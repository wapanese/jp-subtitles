1
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,389
Let me show you the Briggs way!

2
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,226
- The Briggs way?
- That's right.

3
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,270
Give me a hand, alchemist.

4
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,399
- Brother!
- You too!

5
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,277
Just a minute! We can't...

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,238
You are forced to help us under threat.

7
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,157
You've got no problem with that, right?

8
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,578
- Who's this?
- Our good buddy.

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,371
All right, help us out.

10
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,833
Hurry! Don't spill any!

11
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,669
- Buccaneer, Gate 8!
- Yes, sir!

12
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,300
Charge! Drive it into the elevator!

13
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,607
What a bother...

14
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,195
Push! Push us!

15
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,948
All right, it's working!

16
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,785
- Rotate turret right!
- Yes, ma'am.

17
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,125
- Miles! Send it!
- Yes, sir!

18
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,300
All right, it's gone!

19
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,562
Where am I?

20
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,821
Now! Do it!

21
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,244
All right!

22
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,664
So? What next?

23
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,417
- How will you get him outside the gate?
- Stinky.

24
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,015
Move it, little red runt!

25
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,364
- Hey! One more shot!
- We're out of ammo!

26
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,699
In that case...

27
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,912
Ouch.

28
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,589
All right!

29
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,384
That's cold-weather climate blended fuel.

30
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,845
It vaporizes regardless
of the extreme cold,

31
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,766
and its heat of evaporation saps
body temperature in an instant.

32
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,976
Plus, we've got this blizzard.

33
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,812
That will freeze it instantly,
right down to its brain.

34
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,984
So cold...

35
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:42,073
Body won't move...

36
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,372
What a both...

37
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,093
You can hibernate there until spring,
you big lummox.

38
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,430
- Buccaneer, take those two away.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,308
Just a minute!

40
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,977
Why? We helped you!

41
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,314
You were forced to help.
That works better for you, doesn't it?

42
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,441
What's more,

43
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,736
I'm not letting you go until you explain
to me what that monster is,

44
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,071
so bear that in mind.

45
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,581
It's cold.

46
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,001
"Clank"?

47
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,213
Good morning, Brother.

48
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:43,760
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Yo, did you sleep well?

49
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,720
I slept anyhow.

50
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,768
I heard you helped defend my pals.

51
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,605
- Thank you.
- That's 100 cens.

52
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,775
This isn't a thank you cup?

53
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,236
Any progress?

54
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,989
The advance party went
to investigate the hole.

55
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,283
They should be coming back soon.

56
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,787
- Also, Major Miles is at the hospital.
- Hospital?

57
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,749
He's visiting a soldier who was wounded,
fighting with Scar.

58
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,085
Scar is in the north?

59
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,296
Oh, here they are.

60
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,424
They're awake. Thanks for yesterday.

61
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,426
You saved our pals' lives.

62
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,265
You guys sure keep your pledges,
or at least care about each other.

63
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,642
We Briggs soldiers are monolithic.

64
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,395
You saved our pals, so you're our pal too.

65
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,439
Well, can you get
your pal out of here soon?

66
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,190
No, that's something we can't do.

67
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,194
You're monolithic, all right.

68
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,699
I hear they didn't find Scar's body
at the accident site.

69
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,703
There's the possibility that
he's holed up somewhere nearby, though.

70
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,204
Yes.

71
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,916
<i>Well, well, first the search
</i><i>for the black-and-white cat,</i>

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,710
<i>and right on cue, a search for Scar.</i>

73
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,004
Understood.

74
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,675
You leave Scar to us,
and focus on getting better.

75
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,719
Just a moment.

76
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,388
You people please stay out of this.

77
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,433
The Ishvalan is my quarry.

78
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,437
Unfortunately for you,
the soldiers of Briggs are not so lax

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,357
that they'd let a serial killer roam
around free.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,276
The law up here
is survival of the fittest.

81
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,324
If you get careless, you're dead. Got it?

82
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,202
You smart off to me again,
and you'll never leave the hospital.

83
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,458
The Briggs branch will be looking
after your case now.

84
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,294
Behave yourself.

85
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,593
Ishvalans sure are fascinating.

86
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,350
Kimblee, are you okay?

87
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,268
Well, you sure got here quickly,
General Raven.

88
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,690
I heard the news,
and came as quickly as I could.

89
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,150
I was worried about you.

90
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,779
It's these that you are worried about,
right sir?

91
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,411
Very good. Now, to work.

92
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,247
But, as you can see, I'm...

93
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,668
I brought a doctor
that can perform alchemy.

94
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,795
And we have the Stones.

95
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,131
You'll recover completely in no time.

96
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,185
Alkahestry is fairly difficult, huh?

97
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,106
I particularly don't understand
this "dragon pulse" business.

98
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,525
It has to do with the "chi" of the land.

99
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,693
The chi of the land?

100
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:53,533
To put it simply, it's a power that spouts
out of the mountaintops,

101
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,119
then enters the ground, and enriches it.

102
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,331
You might call it the rivers of power
that flow through the land.

103
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,544
When you understand how that power flows,
and where it enters and leaves...

104
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,469
It is a power that can be
applied to all things.

105
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,972
By all things, you mean bodies too?

106
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,348
Yes.

107
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:22,395
- Say, your back!
- Ouch, my leg!

108
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,897
Or here.

109
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,110
When you pressed on my neck,
why was there a jolt to my eyes?

110
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,238
Mr. Marcoh,
you should take care of yourself.

111
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,616
You've got power stagnating all over.

112
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,121
So that's it. This is the theory
of remote transmutation, is it?

113
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,376
Alchemists don't use the dragon's pulse,
do they?

114
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,380
No, we use the energy of the movement
of the earth's crust.

115
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,509
There is a great deal of energy released
in the ground

116
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,636
during seismic and volcanic activity.

117
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,640
The alchemy of this country uses that.

118
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,141
But that's not quite right.

119
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,772
Something has felt out of place
ever since I entered this country.

120
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,983
It became clearer
when I was under Central.

121
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,612
This energy flowing under my feet

122
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,615
doesn't feel like the energy
of the earth's crust in motion...

123
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:22,789
But more like a lot of people
squirming around.

124
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,839
It's huge.

125
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,550
A small platoon could make
their way through this hole.

126
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,594
It also traces a gentle curve,
and goes on for a long way.

127
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,848
However, there were no signs of anyone.

128
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,102
- Lower some horses down.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,979
Also, bring them here.

130
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,362
Awesome. It really is huge, huh?

131
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,658
To think that we let an intruder
get this far in without us noticing.

132
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,953
Have you ever let anyone else
get in before?

133
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,455
Not since I took command here.

134
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,499
But nearly 20 years ago,
there was an incident

135
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,420
where the mountain guard was attacked
in the middle of winter.

136
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,172
Apparently, a mysterious woman
stole food and equipment

137
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,508
repeatedly for an entire month.

138
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,178
<i>I survived a whole month
</i><i>at Briggs Mountain in the dead of winter!</i>

139
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,513
<i>That was her.</i>

140
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,768
This should be far enough.

141
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,811
Dismount.

142
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:33,693
Now then, you don't have to worry
about prying eyes in here.

143
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:38,031
Tell me everything you know.
And I mean everything this time.

144
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,951
Do not hold anything back.

145
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,955
When I asked you about that monster,
you said something.

146
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,457
"You'll have to guess."

147
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:53,463
In other words,
you believed that I would take the hint.

148
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,299
Under the circumstances,
you were leaving yourself open

149
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,302
to being cut down by me,
and yet that's what you said to me.

150
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,306
There's something
you're risking your own life to protect.

151
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,807
Perhaps a hostage.

152
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,313
I don't want any lies,
deception, or fakery.

153
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,981
Tell me the truth.

154
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,821
I need your help.

155
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,079
The Philosopher's Stone, Homunculi,

156
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,333
King Bradley, a man they call Father,

157
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,919
and the senior staff being dirty...

158
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,005
And there really are hostages involved.

159
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,259
Your childhood friend,
the automail engineer, and Mustang's men.

160
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,680
We've done a lot of joint training
with the Eastern Command Center,

161
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,557
so I know Hawkeye and Havoc.

162
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,102
I'd hate to lose them.

163
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,812
I'd like to do something.

164
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,607
What about Colonel Mustang?

165
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,777
Oh, couldn't care less.

166
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,281
I'd rather he did fall from power.
I'd be relieved of another rival.

167
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,909
Never mind him.

168
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,036
What do we do now?

169
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,123
What do you alchemists make
of this tunnel?

170
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:24,303
This tunnel probably wasn't dug here
from Drachma.

171
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,930
This is just my hypothesis,

172
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,809
but it appears to have been dug out
in an enormous circle.

173
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,727
Circle?

174
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,604
In alchemy,
a circle is an important factor

175
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,733
that controls the circulation of power.

176
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,819
There's also the equation.

177
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,364
Lieutenant Falman...

178
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,324
Do you know the major events
that happened in this country

179
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,452
that were accompanied by bloodshed?

180
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,369
Bloodshed?

181
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,373
Does that have anything to do with this?

182
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,632
July, 1588, the Riviere Incident.

183
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,634
Riviere...

184
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,432
October, 1661, the Cameron Uprising.

185
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:15,730
February, 1799, the Soapman Incident,
which happened in Fisk.

186
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,901
March, 1811, the Wellesley Incident.

187
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,988
October, 1835,
the First Southern Border War,

188
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,157
in what is currently South City.

189
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:32,914
Starting in March of 1911,
the Second Southern Border War in Fotcett.

190
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,041
What about Pendleton in the west?

191
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,959
The fight with the neighboring
country of Creta

192
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,170
has seen a lot of soldiers killed.

193
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:44,675
And, in 1914, the Liore insurrection.
Many casualties.

194
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,596
Insurrection? But why?

195
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,599
After I exposed the fake priest in Liore,

196
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,727
I reported it to the Eastern
Command Center right away, right?

197
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,604
It was the Central forces.

198
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,316
They came in,
and sent the Eastern forces away.

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,528
After that, Liore went to pieces.

200
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,613
It can't be... Damn!

201
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,241
Back to work, Fullmetal.

202
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,577
All right.

203
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,625
And now,
we connect all of these locations.

204
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,713
How can this be?

205
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,258
That looks just
like the transmutation circle

206
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,718
that was in the basement
of the Fifth Laboratory, doesn't it?

207
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,764
The Philosopher's Stone array
that uses human lives, huh?

208
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,267
If they create a Philosopher's Stone
with something this gigantic,

209
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,645
how many people are going
to be sacrificed?

210
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,858
I once asked Envy
if they were going to use this country

211
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,152
to create a Philosopher's Stone.

212
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,279
But then he laughed and said,

213
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,158
"So close, but you're on the right track."

214
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,244
<i>Earlier, I told Edward,</i>

215
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:58,332
<i>"Knowing you, you'll be able
</i><i>to find the truth within the truth."</i>

216
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:03,004
The "truth" being that the ingredients for
a Philosopher's Stone were live humans,

217
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,634
<i>the "truth within" being the existence
</i><i>of those who directed it to happen,</i>

218
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,386
<i>and the "truth within the truth"</i>

219
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,305
<i>being the Philosopher's Stone
</i><i>transmutation</i>

220
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,640
<i>that will use
</i><i>the entire nation's territory.</i>

221
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,226
But that's not the end of it.

222
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,647
Ultimately, what is it
that they are trying to do?

223
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,984
The same goes for the method
of gaining immortality that you're after.

224
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,863
That is why you must not seek
the Philosopher's Stone.

225
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,492
With my knowledge,
and your knowledge of alkahestry,

226
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,953
we will figure out these research notes,
no matter what.

227
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,913
Right!

228
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,463
The oldest one was in 1558.

229
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,174
Right after the founding of Amestris, huh?

230
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,009
They attacked the then-neighboring country
of Riviere,

231
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,095
without even declaring war...

232
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,430
Hold on a minute.

233
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:02,188
That means the military is involved
in all of these incidents.

234
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,359
They were coups d'etat, or civil wars,
just like with Liore.

235
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,154
Central forces come in,
and make the situation worse.

236
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,822
Since the founding of the country...

237
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,911
Our country started out as a small nation,

238
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,956
but it expanded as it took over
other small countries around it.

239
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,042
In order to create this circle?

240
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:29,590
So they're not about to use
this country to do something,

241
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,969
they created this country to do something?

242
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,972
My country...

243
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,018
Then, what about Mr. Hughes?

244
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,354
Yeah, he saw the Philosopher's Stone
transmutation circle

245
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,231
before he was killed.

246
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,609
And since he was serving
in the court-martial office,

247
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,737
he had all that he needed
to look into the military incidents.

248
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,324
He realized something was wrong
in this country right away.

249
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,203
Dog of the Military, State Alchemist!

250
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,708
Do you know
what this country is trying to do?

251
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,502
Did you think you brought
about the prosperity you now have

252
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,713
all under your own power?

253
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,717
If you knew, you'd understand
what I am trying to do!

254
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,763
I don't like this.

255
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,475
As far as I can see,
the next place to see blood...

256
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,896
The only place left is here,
around Briggs, isn't it?

257
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,401
What are those guys in Central
about to do to my citadel?

258
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,111
General!

259
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,155
Please return at once, sir.

260
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,074
Lt. General Raven from Central
is here to see you.

261
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,954
They're not even going to give me
a moment to consider this.

262
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,623
General Armstrong...

263
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,626
I'd like to ask you a favor.

264
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,131
Could you sneak some information
out of General Raven?

265
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,386
General Raven, sir...

266
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,680
I'm terribly sorry to have
to ask you to wait.

267
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,807
Nah, don't worry about it.

268
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,727
It's my fault for dropping in unannounced.

269
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,438
General Armstrong will return shortly.

270
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,522
- This way, please.
- Oh, right.

271
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,609
I've brought a guest.

272
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:16,113
Major Miles, would you mind showing him
around the fort?

273
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,867
It's a pleasure, Major Miles.

274
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,084
Winry's apple pie.

275
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,254
I said I wanted to eat it
when I got my body back.

276
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:37,635
But even thinking about that
much might be hopeless now.

277
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,596
You don't have to worry.
You'll have your fill.

278
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,140
Once we get our bodies back,

279
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:48,229
and make the folks who are having
their way with this country pay.

280
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,068
I'm terribly sorry
things are so chaotic, sir.

281
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,905
- We were attacked by the enemy.
- Attacked?

282
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,157
We somehow managed to fend it off,

283
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,536
but, well,
it was what you might call a monster.

284
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,789
Monster? What do you mean?

285
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,833
We killed it, but it wouldn't die, sir.

286
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,379
You don't say.

287
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,718
I suspect it is a biological weapon
from Drachma,

288
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,428
but the Elric brothers...

289
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:26,892
I happen to have the Fullmetal Alchemist
and his brother in my care.

290
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,812
They had the air of someone
who knew about this monster,

291
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,898
but they won't tell me anything.

292
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,735
Having a State Alchemist,
under direct control of the FÃ¼hrer,

293
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,654
spying for Drachma would
be a tremendous problem,

294
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,573
so I put them in one of my cells.

295
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,366
Would you like to question him?

296
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,745
Certainly.

297
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>- You say they won't tell you anything?
</i><i>- Yes, sir.</i>

298
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,500
<i>They told me their purpose in coming here</i>

299
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,085
<i>was to research living transmutation
</i><i>or something.</i>

300
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,506
Nothing could be more weaselly
or suspicious.

301
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,306
I thought I might get it out of them
by torturing them,

302
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,683
but I am a woman.

303
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:12,563
Just thinking of making those children
suffer pained my heart ever so.

304
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:16,901
The hell it did.
Even the queen's heart is made of ice.

305
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,239
Even you, known as the impregnable
"Northern Wall of Briggs,"

306
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,200
has a soft spot for children, huh?

307
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:30,998
Ordinarily, it wouldn't be surprising
for me to have a child or two at my age,

308
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,584
but I'm well past that now.

309
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,835
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

310
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,005
<i>- You must still be in great demand.
</i><i>- Oh, no, sir.</i>

311
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:45,304
I sure wish I didn't have to grow older.

312
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,352
That Drachman biological weapon,
now that had an outstanding body.

313
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,480
An immortal body.

314
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,607
It's like something from a dream,
isn't it?

315
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,571
What if I told you that the day
when it's not just a dream

316
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,240
isn't too far off?

317
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,582
Tell me, General...

318
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,088
Would you be interested in a legion
of completely immortal soldiers?

319
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>He took the bait.</i>
