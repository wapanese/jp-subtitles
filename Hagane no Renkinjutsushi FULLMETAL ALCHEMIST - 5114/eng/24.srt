1
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,641
Oh, no, not again.

2
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,686
You're an important candidate
for sacrifice.

3
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,901
We need to have you keep your strength up.
Right, Dr. Marcoh?

4
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,989
I've been thinking, all this time...

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,284
what is a sacrifice?

6
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,706
What is it you're trying to make me do?

7
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:09,921
What you're doing right now
is using this land and its people

8
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,674
to create a giant transmutation circle.

9
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,428
The purpose of which
is to create a Philosopher's Stone.

10
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,263
Am I wrong?

11
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,683
So close. But you're on the right track.

12
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,061
Right track?

13
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,480
So, what are you going to do?

14
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,566
If you don't cooperate,
we're going to wipe out that village.

15
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,488
I heard from Lust,

16
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,699
that in exchange for us
leaving the village alone,

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,950
you would work with us.

18
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,704
What will it be?

19
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,207
Work with us,
and destroy all of the country's people?

20
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:50,462
Or don't work with us,
and wipe out everyone in that village?

21
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,133
You're such a fool.

22
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,136
If you forsake the smaller part,
the greater will be saved.

23
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,972
If you think about it just a little,
you'll see that.

24
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,352
But then again,
that's just the way you humans are.

25
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,854
Your emotions come before logic.

26
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,524
That's the way a man I once killed was.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,068
Once I turned myself into his wife,

28
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,363
he couldn't do anything, and let his
reverse card slip away from him.

29
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:21,118
Lucky for us, you humans
are easy to take advantage of.

30
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,299
<i>You're having quite a bit of trouble
</i><i>with the humans, aren't you,</i>

31
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,051
<i>Wrath?</i>

32
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>Scar got away from you,
</i><i>and they even made off with Gluttony.</i>

33
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,809
<i>It's not like you.</i>

34
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,437
Yes, you're right.

35
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,442
<i>- You seem happy.
- I won't deny that.</i>

36
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,445
This is sort of enjoyable.

37
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,449
I've been alive for 60 years,

38
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,452
and now here I am,
at the top spot of this country.

39
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,372
All just as Father planned.

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,332
<i>And yet?</i>

41
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,795
Colonel Mustang, the Elric brothers,

42
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,215
and those folks from a foreign land...

43
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:23,221
As crafty as we are,
they've still got us scrambling around.

44
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,891
The younger generation's time

45
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,729
might be right around the corner, Pride.

46
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,234
<i>Wrath, you've been in contact with humans
</i><i>for too long.</i>

47
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,236
You may be right.

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,491
<i>I hope you won't forget
</i><i>what sort of beings we are.</i>

49
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,204
<i>I will refrain from informing Father
</i><i>of your remarks,</i>

50
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,748
<i>which could be taken as treasonous.</i>

51
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,250
<i>Anyway, about Gluttony...</i>

52
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,086
Not to worry.

53
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,088
According to the military police's
information,

54
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,257
I have a pretty good idea where he is.

55
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,764
What is this?

56
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,391
- Colonel! Where are you, Col--
- Stop, Lieutenant!

57
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,700
Colonel!

58
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,203
Lieutenant...

59
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,666
Don't provoke him! He's out to get me!

60
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,001
Mustang!

61
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,005
Lan Fan, we're getting out of here.

62
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,840
What has happened?

63
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,844
That monster was keeping
another monster inside his belly!

64
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,265
He's swallowing up everything around him!

65
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,853
<i>So alchemy can even produce
</i><i>something like this?</i>

66
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,231
We've got no choice but to bring him down.

67
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,234
But we went through so much
just to catch this Homunculus!

68
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,695
Our first priority is to survive.

69
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,240
Besides, he knows our names and faces.

70
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,826
There's no reason for us
to let him leave here alive.

71
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,926
- He swallowed the flame?
- What the...?

72
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,306
You're useless!

73
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,558
Well then, you try doing something!

74
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,145
For that matter, keep away!
You're the one he's after, Colonel!

75
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,274
Run that way! Spread out!

76
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,834
Damn, not now!

77
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,211
Move it, son!

78
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,389
Hurry, we can't stay here for long!

79
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,807
But Ed and the others are still--

80
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,560
Who cares? I'm just a civilian here!

81
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,314
I'm not about to die in the middle
of this cockamamie battle!

82
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,071
Damn it!

83
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,074
Why are they dragging their feet?

84
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,247
Roy Mustang!

85
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,383
Damn!

86
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,260
He fell for the dummy, huh?

87
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,972
Sounds like he's really ticked off now.

88
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,558
Come on, get going now,
you good-for-nothing.

89
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,354
Lieutenant, over here.
Please take care of Lan Fan.

90
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,524
You're telling me to turn tail and run,
under these circumstances?

91
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,443
- You're just going to slow us down!
- Leave!

92
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,446
Seriously, you're of no use here, Colonel.

93
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,200
Honestly, you boneheaded colonel.

94
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,245
Just go do your own job!

95
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,080
The head of the military
being a Homunculus

96
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,457
isn't something
you can leave alone, right?

97
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,460
The head of the military?

98
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,671
You don't mean, FÃ¼hrer Bradley is...?

99
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,173
We'll talk about it later. Get in!

100
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,428
The car is full, right? Go on.

101
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,972
You dumb ass!

102
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,933
We can't just go and leave you children
on the battlefield!

103
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,979
The people you're fighting
are the military's senior staff, right?

104
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,483
We have to get some information
out of that Gluttony guy.

105
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,694
We're staying here, and fighting him.

106
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,197
The fact that we're children
doesn't have anything to do with it.

107
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,325
We were the ones who brought up
this mission in the first place.

108
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,370
Thanks for all your help up to now.

109
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,248
Edward...

110
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,710
Take this with you.
You know how to use it, right?

111
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,632
That's something to kill people with.

112
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,886
It's something to protect your lives with.

113
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,394
Your hands are not hands that kill others.

114
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,023
Don't go dying, okay?

115
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:29,944
I'll keep it with me.

116
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,534
Look after Lan Fan.

117
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,913
Young Lord. Young Lord!

118
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,380
Let's go. Let's get going!

119
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,924
Damn kids!

120
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,260
This is how you die young!

121
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,354
Mustang.

122
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,816
Where is Roy Mustang?

123
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:12,987
How dare you kill Lust?
You'll pay for that!

124
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,950
Yeah, we said we'd fight,
but that thing is seriously freaky.

125
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,952
His personality is different too.

126
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,411
How are we going to catch him?

127
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,415
What is it?

128
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,586
A dog?

129
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,214
Stop, Gluttony!

130
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,801
It spoke?

131
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,886
Hey, long time no see.

132
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,022
Fullmetal pipsqueak.

133
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,863
Who are you calling a shrimpy,
flea-sized paramecium?!

134
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:01,161
Take it easy!
I'm just here to get Gluttony back.

135
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,745
I have no desire to tangle
with any pipsqueaks--

136
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,373
- That's the seventh time!
- What are you talking about?

137
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,751
You've called me a pipsqueak
two times just now,

138
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,962
plus five more times
under the Fifth Laboratory!

139
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,381
You can't tell me you've forgotten it!

140
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,551
What a pinpoint memory you've got there.

141
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,344
Hold it!

142
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,721
You're starting to become difficult.

143
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,725
Mustang was here! Gonna avenge Lust!

144
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,436
Swallow, swallow, swallow him up!

145
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,023
Not the colonel, nor the Elric brothers.

146
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,232
No way.

147
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,985
I've sensed it before too.

148
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,488
How many people are inside you,
Homunculus?

149
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,453
You're the kid who crossed swords
with Wrath, huh?

150
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,580
What do you mean, "kid"?

151
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,583
I am the twelfth son
of the Emperor of Xing, and my name is--

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,918
You can swallow him.

153
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,254
Wait! Wait! Wait!

154
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,216
I get it.

155
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,054
It looks like they can't take any action
against us brothers, huh?

156
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,013
In that case...

157
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,434
Ling, you take care of that one!

158
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,439
Very well, let's have a look, shall we,

159
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,442
at the skills that held their own
against Wrath?

160
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,071
Oh, Selim did?

161
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,032
They said it was the best one
in the class.

162
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,618
It's a paper about you.

163
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,620
May I read it?

164
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,247
Mind your manners. Not right now.

165
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:33,002
Where's the harm?
Go ahead and read it to me.

166
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,253
Yes, sir!

167
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,967
"My father is the FÃ¼hrer
of the nation of Amestris.

168
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,137
He works as hard as he can
for this country.

169
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,726
The people of this land
are always in my father's heart.

170
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,646
He deals with many different problems,

171
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,400
<i>so that everyone can live in peace.</i>

172
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,403
But no matter how busy he gets,

173
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,948
my father has never forgotten his family.

174
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,867
He loves me and my mother.

175
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,373
My father always listens to me
when I talk.

176
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,002
He always grants my requests.

177
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,797
That is why I love my father."

178
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,967
Thank you, Selim.

179
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,095
Not bad at all.

180
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,390
Thanks for your words of praise!

181
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,683
You fell for it.

182
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,772
What do you think?
This is a trick you humans can't do, huh?

183
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:39,068
Now then, do you want to be strangled
to death, or bitten to death?

184
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,903
Or shall I just carve you up?

185
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,115
Well, then...

186
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,634
That was a cheap trick,
blinding me like that...

187
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,972
Ever since I was little,
I was in constant danger of assassination.

188
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,892
I couldn't help
but learn a few dirty moves.

189
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:15,104
How about it? Will you come quietly?

190
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,316
I just want some information
on gaining immortality.

191
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,943
You don't like getting hurt, right?

192
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,236
You scum!

193
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,572
Don't you look down on me,
you mere human!

194
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,076
Don't you underrate humans, Homunculus!

195
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,496
All right, gotcha!

196
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,501
Geez, that was a close one.

197
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,252
Why, you...

198
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,546
I'm not allowed to eat you.

199
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,257
I wanted to eat
that closed-eyed guy earlier.

200
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,717
Caught you!

201
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,015
Hey, now, stay out of my way--

202
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,774
<i>Only human, all right.</i>

203
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,067
Now, Gluttony!

204
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,320
- Ling!
- What?

205
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,032
Damn, I can't let him swallow a sacrifice!

206
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,033
Brother!

207
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,269
Swallowed them.

208
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,689
Brother! Ling!

209
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,066
Hey, spit him out! Spit out Brother!

210
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,236
Can't. I swallowed him.

211
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,326
It can't be... it can't be... Brother.

212
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,753
I have the rooms
that the wife and kid used,

213
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,175
but the neighborhood will get suspicious
if I've got lights on all over the place.

214
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,885
You'll have to make do with my bed.

215
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,095
Young Lord, I must go to Young Lord.

216
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,263
Dumb fool!

217
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,266
What can you do in your condition?

218
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,411
He isn't home yet? I see.

219
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,788
Well then, I shall head directly
to the command center.

220
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,874
Yes, goodbye.

221
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,710
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,629
Where to?

223
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,924
I'm thinking of taking the occasion
to make it clear

224
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,717
who is friend and who is foe.

225
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,012
Jeez, what is it with all of you?

226
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,389
Your wounds aren't even healed yet,

227
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,391
and you're looking
to get into trouble again?

228
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,895
The FÃ¼hrer could be a Homunculus.

229
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,397
I can't just take it easy.

230
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,149
Besides...

231
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,653
We just left the children
back on the battlefield.

232
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,075
If I don't act now,
I'll be setting a bad example as an adult!

233
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,539
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

234
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,750
I was just thinking, if Edward found out
that you treated him like a child,

235
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,294
he'd probably get angry.

236
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,338
Just repeating what you said.

237
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,758
I have to admit,
this is unexpected, Colonel.

238
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,303
You taking such bold action as this...

239
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,558
Like hell, it's bold.
I'm just paving the way.

240
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,059
Besides...

241
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>Find as many people who understand you
</i><i>and support you as you can.</i>

242
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,695
Belated though it may be,
I'm thinking of heeding his warning.

243
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,919
So are these the gates of glory,
or the entrance to Hell?

244
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,839
Lieutenant, you wait here.

245
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,134
If anything happens to me,
then at least you'll get out of here.

246
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,303
- No, sir.
- That's an order.

247
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,054
I cannot obey it.

248
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,309
- You sure are stubborn.
- As you are well aware, sir.

249
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,231
All right. Wait here.
I promise, I'm coming back.

250
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,984
Yes, sir. Good hunting!

251
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,821
So you're Roy Mustang, are you?

252
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,948
I got a call from my wife a while ago.

253
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,034
Lieutenant General Raven, sir,

254
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,952
I've been so busy
since I transferred here,

255
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,954
so I apologize for not coming
to pay my respects earlier,

256
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,706
and only doing so now, so late at night.

257
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,208
No problem.

258
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,462
By the way,
how is that old fox Grumman doing?

259
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,964
The same as always, sir.

260
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,299
Check.

261
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,303
You've got me, sir.
That's 11 losses in a row for me.

262
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:03,059
Twelve, although you put up
a pretty good fight this time.

263
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,811
Once you were sure you had won,
you blew it.

264
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,814
You're saying
I didn't finish strong enough?

265
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:13,152
Yes. You're unable to act ruthlessly,
just like Raven.

266
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,571
General Raven? In Central?

267
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,367
He is exceptional, but too sentimental.

268
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,536
He is known to have gone
to help his wounded men himself,

269
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,247
throwing his line into disarray
in the process.

270
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,084
No matter how many pieces you've got,
it's never enough like that.

271
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,628
What an affront!

272
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,588
I was chosen to transfer to Central

273
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,590
because of the compassion
I had for my men!

274
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,052
That border-dwelling old coot
has no business saying anything!

275
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,055
Pardon me.

276
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,140
Not at all.

277
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,477
In fact, General Grumman said

278
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,355
that if the general became irritated
at that story,

279
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,984
that you were still a just man,
and would be there if I needed you.

280
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,615
That old fox got me again, did he?

281
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,206
It's time for my meeting.
Let's walk there together.

282
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,211
Have you gotten used to Central yet?

283
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,966
No, sir. I make every effort
to speak with the citizens, but...

284
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,469
You can't undervalue
the word on the street.

285
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,682
But most of it is just mindless drivel.

286
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,059
Scar was seen giving food to a cat,

287
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,478
or some people who are immortal
have appeared,

288
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,151
or that the FÃ¼hrer is a Homunculus.

289
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,657
You've got no sense of humor, do you?

290
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,243
Are you sure you were
one of Grumman's men?

291
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,871
I failed to pick up
any of that from him, sir.

292
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,373
Well, even that bit of gossip

293
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,375
will give us something to talk about
over tea.

294
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,503
I couldn't possibly attend
something like...

295
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,684
Go on, tell us that joke you told earlier.

296
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:14,482
Something about the FÃ¼hrer
being a Homunculus.

297
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,441
Please continue.

298
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,446
What's the matter, Colonel Mustang?

299
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,201
If I were a Homunculus, then so what?

300
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,704
Is that a problem?

301
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,505
<i>I get it, Hughes.</i>

302
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,715
<i>When you said the military was in trouble,</i>

303
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,176
<i>you didn't mean the danger
</i><i>was closing in on us,</i>

304
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,555
<i>you meant the military itself
</i><i>was the source of the trouble.</i>

305
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:52,269
<i>Fullmetal,
</i><i>it looks like this is the pit of Hell.</i>

306
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,735
Where am I?

307
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,281
Blood?

308
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:08,077
What is this? What is this place?

309
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,286
Al!

310
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,373
Hey, is anybody here?

311
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,134
Where is this place?
