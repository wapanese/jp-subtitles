1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,962
To think that you saw it
and made it back alive.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,924
You may be my pupils,
but that is really something.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,175
Nah...

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,137
Still, you will have to take
responsibility for what you've done.

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,140
You're expelled.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,645
- Teacher--
- Al.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,984
The trains are still running. Go home.

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,989
Thank you for all you've done.

9
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,544
If you're ever in the area, come see us.

10
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,255
But we're--

11
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,007
You idiots!

12
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,303
There's no teacher or pupil relationship
any longer,

13
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,931
which means that from now on,
you can interact with each other

14
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,433
as equal individuals.

15
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,018
What reason is there to be so aloof now?

16
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,270
Damn.

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,441
Al, what did we come to Dublith for?

18
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,361
Mr. Sig, we're heading on back.

19
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,780
Don't get yourselves killed.

20
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,704
Teacher!

21
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,458
How dare you show your faces again here?

22
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,253
Who are you calling "Teacher"?
I no longer consider you pupils!

23
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,130
- Get out of here now!
- Teacher!

24
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:56,385
We came here to find some leads
on getting our original bodies back.

25
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,387
- We can't leave here empty-handed.
- Get out!

26
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,763
No!

27
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,689
You imbeciles.

28
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,194
Al, you didn't see "the Truth," right?

29
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,489
Right. I have no idea what that means.

30
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,325
You may have lost your memory of it
out of shock.

31
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,036
Why don't we try getting your memory back?

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,955
Your whole body was taken away.

33
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,457
There's no way you wouldn't have seen it.

34
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,084
Right.

35
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,628
Teacher, it was just a part of our bodies
for you and me,

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,297
but considering the toll that Al paid,

37
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,842
he must be more closely acquainted
with the "Truth" than any of us.

38
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,594
Then, once my memories
of that time return,

39
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,305
I'll have a lead on getting my body back.

40
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,975
Still, the memories of that...

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,351
Yeah, that...

42
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,103
Huh? Is it something bad?

43
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,397
Not so much bad as awful.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232
Yeah, more like awful.

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,985
It might wreck your mind.

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,070
If it goes wrong, you'll be crippled.

47
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,492
Even so, if it means finding any leg,

48
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,286
I want to go for it.

49
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,957
All right.

50
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,419
Let me ask someone I know
about how to get your memory back.

51
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,924
But before I do, let's eat.
Give me a moment.

52
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,593
Right!

53
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,765
No doubt about it.
He's the one who transmuted a soul.

54
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,691
EAST CITY, EASTERN COMMAND CENTER

55
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,070
You'll be transferring
to Central next week, eh?

56
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,325
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,079
I'm going to miss you around here.
You kept things pretty colorful.

58
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,583
Oh, no, not as much as you did
when you were younger, General.

59
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:03,136
You worked as hard as you could
which allowed me to be at ease too.

60
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,556
And thanks to the work
that you allowed me to take on,

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,141
my insight has also been expanded.

62
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,022
Check.

63
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,443
I finally beat you, here at the end.

64
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,446
This win will be my parting gift to you.

65
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,865
General...

66
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,786
While you're giving out parting gifts,
there's something else I'd like.

67
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,288
Master Sergeant Kain Fuery.

68
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,208
Warrant Officer Vato Falman.

69
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,293
Second Lieutenant Heymans Breda.

70
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,295
Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc.

71
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,048
First Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye.

72
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,636
You five men will be transferring
to Central with me.

73
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,556
I won't hear any objections.
You're coming with me!

74
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,686
Colonel, I'm in a fix.

75
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,147
- I just recently got a new girlfriend.
- Break up with her.

76
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,942
NOT AGAIN!!

77
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:16,626
Your wounds haven't even closed up yet.

78
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,591
Master.

79
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,011
I'm glad that you are safe.

80
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,848
I understand you've been
going around killing State Alchemists.

81
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,892
I understand the animosity you feel.

82
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:39,733
It was a State Alchemist
that burned down our village.

83
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,612
But vengeance will only cultivate
more vengeance.

84
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,116
You must break this fruitless chain
and stop it.

85
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,995
You must abide by this.

86
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,457
We're coming in.

87
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,833
Oh, he really is here.

88
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,544
The Ishvalan with the X-shaped scar.

89
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,256
We'll split the reward with you evenly
as promised, Mr. Yoki.

90
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,259
Huh? Mr. Yoki is gone?

91
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,928
- Why, you--
- What do you think you're doing?

92
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,765
We took you in like family
when you had nowhere else to go.

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,016
Shut up!

94
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,185
Don't lump me in with you, Ishvalans!

95
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,649
I will rise up again!
I will rise, I will rise.

96
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,194
And I will take down
that detestable Edward Elric!

97
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,656
Now you two, get him if you please.

98
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,078
It appears that my presence here
will make trouble.

99
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,913
That's a reasonable fellow.

100
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,586
Why, you--! What the hell did you do?

101
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,632
I'll give you a moment to pray to God.

102
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,386
What God? Who needs--?

103
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,476
Wait. Stay back.

104
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,936
I was wrong!

105
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,233
Spare my life!
I will follow you from here on!

106
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,112
You're leaving?

107
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,823
Your brother would be grieved.

108
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,165
I can't turn back now.

109
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,365
He's here.

110
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,872
We've been expecting you, visitor.

111
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,253
"We know your secret.
Come to the Devil's Nest."

112
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,589
Are you people the ones
who know my secret?

113
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,133
Yeah, we know all sorts of things.

114
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,137
I'd like to know what my secret is too.

115
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,266
Then that makes this simple. Come with us.

116
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:22,395
But my teacher taught me
that I shouldn't go with strangers.

117
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,066
- Hey, how old are you?
- Fourteen.

118
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,652
Fourteen is old enough to think
and act for yourself, right?

119
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,906
You can't go around saying
"my teacher says such-and-such" forever.

120
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,658
Oh, right. I have to think for myself.

121
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,203
There you go. Now come with us--

122
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,499
After thinking it over for myself,

123
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,877
I've decided to hog-tie you guys
and ask you what my secret is.

124
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,713
So we'll end up doing this by force, eh?

125
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,888
Forgive the intrusion.

126
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,685
- You're going inside?
- Hey, be a good little boy!

127
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,856
Well, how does it feel having someone
inside you moving your body?

128
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,194
You can't completely stop me
from moving by doing this!

129
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,196
You're right.

130
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,949
But if I can slow your motion
even a little...

131
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,367
We can finish this.

132
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,792
- Are you hurt?
- I hit my head.

133
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,711
You're making this awfully hard.

134
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,632
Just what are you people?

135
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,761
They're Chimeras and they work for me.

136
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,606
Oh, incredible.

137
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,317
You really are hollow.

138
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,156
I'm Greed. Let's you and I be friends.

139
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,701
What are you people, really?

140
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,956
It's not true that you're Chimeras, right?

141
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,834
After all, there's no way
that Chimeras can talk.

142
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,461
There's no such thing as "no such thing."

143
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,423
In fact, the girl inside you is a Chimera

144
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,550
who was made by combining with a snake.

145
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,886
And the fellow behind me, here...

146
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,013
Roa, what were you again?

147
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,181
- A cow?
- Yeah.

148
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,102
There's also a lizard and a crocodile.

149
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,106
The man you went up against earlier
pees on one leg.

150
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,566
No, I don't!

151
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,610
A dog?

152
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,570
Yeah. It comes in pretty handy.

153
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,781
Impossible. It just isn't possible.

154
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,326
For one thing, who has ever made
a successful combination?

155
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,411
The military.

156
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,495
You mean...

157
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:50,585
In any event, there is an underworld,
one where the sun doesn't shine.

158
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,254
And by the way, I'm not a Chimera.

159
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,256
I'm a Homunculus.

160
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,091
Homunculus?

161
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,763
You know of them, right?
An artificially-created person.

162
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,932
That's what I am.

163
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,646
- A Homunculus?
- It's a man-made person.

164
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,565
It says in that book
that you're not supposed to make people.

165
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,858
You're lying.

166
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,569
I've never heard of anyone
successfully creating a Homunculus!

167
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,238
My, my.

168
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,823
Let me show you the proof.

169
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,540
How could you do that?

170
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,062
There, now I'm once dead.

171
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,939
It can't be...

172
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,901
Do you get it?
There's no such thing as "no such thing."

173
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,488
There's no better proof of that
than your very existence, is there?

174
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,075
- You, who exist only as a soul.
- How do you know that?

175
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,204
Most of what happens in the underworld
reaches my ears.

176
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,667
Now then, let's get down to business.

177
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,296
How does it feel to be just a soul,
having a body that will never die?

178
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,135
Transmuting an individual soul
and attaching it to something else...

179
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,680
Depending on how it's done,
you can gain immortality.

180
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,932
Am I wrong?

181
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,894
I am Greed. That's desire, you see.

182
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,314
I want money. I want women.

183
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,526
I want status, glory,
and everything else the world has!

184
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,987
And I want eternal life too!

185
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,906
But you are immortal, aren't you?

186
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,659
Well, I am put together pretty tough.

187
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,328
I've been alive for nearly 200 years.

188
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,998
But I'm not exactly immortal.

189
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:57,003
Well, I've told you my secret.
Now it's your turn.

190
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,546
Tell me the secret of your body.

191
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,423
You'd best start talking.

192
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:07,638
You don't want to be taken apart
limb from limb and examined, right?

193
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,932
It's no use.

194
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,561
I don't have any memories
from when I got this body

195
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,646
and I'm not the one
who did the transmutation.

196
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,356
I don't know anything.

197
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,903
Then, I can ask the person
who did the transmutation for you.

198
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,154
Well...

199
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,158
Where has Al gone off to?

200
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:34,248
I'd be willing to tell you
once you tell me your brother's secret.

201
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,506
Brother.

202
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,717
Who would have ever thought
you'd get abducted?

203
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,261
Brother, this man is a Homunculus!

204
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,179
A Homunculus?

205
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,473
Hey, don't go giving it away right off.

206
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,477
So he might have some hints
as to how to get our original bodies back.

207
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,859
An Ouroboros tattoo.

208
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,237
That's right.

209
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,405
It would have been easier

210
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,783
if I could have dealt with
just the little armor boy there.

211
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,994
If you're one of that bunch, ask them.

212
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,204
That bunch?

213
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,958
The folks with that tattoo
who were at the Fifth Laboratory.

214
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,545
We met some others there
who were souls bonded to armor.

215
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,881
Is that right? Well, it's kind of a lot.

216
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,135
I'm afraid I can't do that.

217
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,720
I have a proposal I'd like to discuss.

218
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,056
The two of you want
to get your bodies back.

219
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,141
Isn't that right?

220
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,478
I will teach you how to fabricate
a Homunculus.

221
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,108
In exchange, you teach me
how to transmute a soul.

222
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,194
That's an equivalent exchange.

223
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,576
Then again, is there really any need
to get your original body back?

224
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,495
I think the body you've got is nice.

225
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,039
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, no?

226
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,459
You don't get hungry,
you don't get sleepy,

227
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,918
and you don't get fatigued.

228
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,004
That's great, isn't it?

229
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:10,136
Stop spouting that ridiculous nonsense!

230
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,601
Handy? Great?

231
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,687
I can't sit here and listen
to you go off on your own

232
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,355
when you don't know what it's like!

233
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,859
The way to transmute a soul?

234
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,614
I don't see any reason
to share even one iota of it with you!

235
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,034
I pound on bad guys, beat them up,
make them spill their secrets!

236
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,869
Snatch them away!

237
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,371
In other words,
it's all for me and none for you!

238
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,125
I don't have any need
for equivalent exchange with bad guys!

239
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,510
So we end up doing this by force again.

240
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,723
- Don't kill him.
- Yeah, yeah.

241
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,437
You're a lot slower
than a certain condemned prisoner!

242
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,233
Next.

243
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,069
Roa, take the armor boy away.

244
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,238
- We'll take him apart and analyze him.
- Right.

245
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,740
Just a minute! Hold it!

246
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,879
No way, no way.

247
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,257
You can't even scratch the Ultimate Shield

248
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,051
with that steel sword of yours!

249
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,895
You left your noggin wide open!

250
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,232
Oh, that one hurt.

251
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,943
Any normal person
would be on his way to the hospital.

252
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,820
You're not normal at all?

253
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,030
Well, my body is normal enough.

254
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,783
All I have are slightly advanced
regenerative powers

255
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,535
and my Ultimate Shield.

256
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,330
You get it, right? You cannot beat me.

257
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,040
You'd be smarter to make a deal.

258
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,502
You're one of those guys, huh?

259
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,798
You don't mind if you get all beat up
but you can't bear to have a family member

260
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,551
get even a little hurt,
and you lose your cool.

261
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,511
How foolish.

262
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,014
Are you going to give yourself over
to your passion

263
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,057
and lose both the precious information
and your brother?

264
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,020
Once I've defeated you,
I'll get my brother back.

265
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,856
Your regenerative powers
aren't unlimited, are they?

266
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,650
As long as I keep pounding away
at the exposed parts of your body--

267
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,071
My apologies. I've been skimping on you.

268
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:38,451
This doesn't look too handsome
so I don't like showing it to people.

269
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:46,000
Didn't I tell you?
You can't lay a single scratch on me.

270
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,836
This was lying in the back alley
off of the road to the west.

271
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,839
Al has disappeared, and now Ed too.

272
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,008
Those idiots!

273
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,801
I ought to make them my pupils again

274
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,471
then beat into them
how they should take care of things!

275
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,722
I know something!

276
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,350
Earlier, a boy matching Ed's description

277
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,353
supposedly went into a bar
called the Devil's Nest.

278
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,201
Are you dead?

279
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,499
Good, that's better.
Children should be energetic.

280
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,088
No matter how much you try,
you cannot beat me!

281
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,260
Now then,
why don't you tell me your secret?

282
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,432
- Thanks.
- Huh?

283
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,227
The blood that had rushed to my head
has settled a bit

284
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,354
and my brain is starting to cool off.

285
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,234
That's my mechanic for you.
Even like this, it still works.

286
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,616
You're still going to put up a fight?

287
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,828
Would you go down and stay down?

288
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,884
I'm hardened, right? That was strange.

289
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
What was that for?

290
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,398
You've got a single-pattern style!
That's not gonna cut it!

291
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,905
What the hell did you do to my shield?

292
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,993
It's simple when you think about it.

293
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,286
You may be a Homunculus,

294
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,829
but if you have a normal body,

295
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,955
it means that a third

296
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,374
of your structural material
is made up of carbon.

297
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,878
Depending on the degree
to which the carbon atoms combine,

298
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,881
its hardness can change
from pencil lead up to diamond.

299
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,051
Once that is known,
the rest is all in the realm of alchemy.

300
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,013
Good.

301
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,015
That's more like it!
It's no fun otherwise!

302
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,186
And I just learned one other thing!

303
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,858
You can't harden yourself
and regenerate at the same time!

304
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,281
I thought you were just some reckless kid
rushing in here.

305
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,785
But then, how much more
can you attack me in your condition?

306
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,709
Hello, pardon me.

307
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,712
Teacher!

308
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,297
You imbecile!

309
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,676
What do you think you're doing,
not even putting the broom away?

310
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,136
Sorry about that!

311
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:49,099
It looks like you've shown
considerable hospitality to my boy there.

312
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,643
Teacher, he's--

313
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,269
I know.

314
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,897
Your voices were carrying out
into the hallway.

315
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,859
Hey now, give me a break here.

316
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,153
I have no interest in fighting a woman.

317
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,499
Why, you--

318
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,708
who the hell are you?

319
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,213
I'm just a passing...

320
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,509
housewife!
