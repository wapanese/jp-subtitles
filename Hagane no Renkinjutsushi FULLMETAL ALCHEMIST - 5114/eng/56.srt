1
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,241
Take it easy. I want to talk to you.

2
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,580
Just hear what I have to say.

3
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,833
Then you talk to me, too.

4
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,337
Yes... that's right.

5
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,506
You aren't alone.

6
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,416
Blond hair. He's from the west, isn't he?

7
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,462
Well, I suppose
we should at least bury him.

8
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,882
Whoa, he's alive!

9
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,801
- You've gotta be kidding!
- Stay with us!

10
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,885
Hey, are you all right?

11
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,596
Water! Bring water!

12
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,729
Don't drink it all at once.
Take little sips.

13
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:13,151
Do you understand what I'm saying?
We're merchants from Xing.

14
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,157
Where were you trying to go?

15
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:27,249
No place to return to, no place to go.

16
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:32,170
Ran away, too scared to stay in Xerxes.

17
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,424
I'll bet.

18
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop him.

19
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:47,185
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sergence.

20
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,578
Sergence, the master carpenter.

21
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,124
He often came to the palace to do repairs.
Do you remember?

22
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,753
His son, Dzur, respected his father,

23
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,255
and was working hard
to follow in his footsteps.

24
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,720
Kaya, the florist lady.
A kind, compassionate woman.

25
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,266
Sari, the stable hand,
sure did love his liquor.

26
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,310
I get where he's coming from.

27
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,939
Tami's boyhood dream
was to become a scholar.

28
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,318
Gidarouche was a cook.

29
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:42,324
He was once fired for feeding a traveler
who had no money for free.

30
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,534
Andal, my fellow slave,

31
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:49,581
saw me as his enemy
because I found favor with the master.

32
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:55,003
Suhl, the incorrigible criminal,
who was awaiting execution.

33
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,882
He said he wanted one last shot at you.

34
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,635
A shot at me?

35
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,264
They are the souls
who have now invaded you.

36
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,825
They are working with me

37
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,411
for the sole purpose of defeating you.

38
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,413
Your Philosopher's Stone
has individual wills.

39
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,874
Which are working with you?

40
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,710
Those mere energy forms?

41
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,965
You think that's impossible?

42
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,511
It's true, I thought dealing
with these raging souls one-on-one

43
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,222
was going to drive me crazy.

44
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,935
But I had plenty of time
to converse with them,

45
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,230
all thanks to this undying body
you gave me.

46
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,111
You conversed with them?

47
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,781
Yes. That is what you would not do.

48
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,911
I have completed conversing

49
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:16,626
with all 536,329 people who are inside me.

50
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,895
Why... you...

51
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,484
Go back to where you were born,

52
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,697
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus.

53
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,325
Forgive me, but we are going
to destroy your container.

54
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,207
Once your leather bag is torn through,

55
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,627
it will be as though
your flask were broken.

56
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,337
You will turn to dust.

57
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,886
Realize the pain of those with whom
you were so condescending!

58
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,670
You're the one being condescending,

59
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,965
aren't you, Hohenheim?

60
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,384
You can still live outside of your skin?

61
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,097
Don't go thinking that
you're the only ones who have advanced.

62
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,146
I told you I was going to become
the perfect being.

63
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,077
- What?
- A frontal assault?

64
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,039
Is there some reason why I should come in
through the back door,

65
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,333
when I'm entering my own castle?

66
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,461
Infantrymen, keep back!

67
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,175
- Wha...?
- Impossible!

68
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,340
Did we get him?

69
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,808
- Take over driving!
- Yes, sir!

70
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,528
Damn it! Where is he?

71
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,481
The bastard took out
a whole tank single-handedly.

72
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,287
Captain!

73
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,886
Captain Buccaneer!

74
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,433
What's the matter?
The master has returned.

75
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,893
Open the gate.

76
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,525
Open it, Falman.

77
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,825
I'm sorry, Colonel Mustang...

78
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,287
I... might be dying here.

79
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,794
Hey, you! Don't go trying to act brave
with such a pathetic look on your face.

80
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,801
You're not going to beat me out
when it comes to manly pride.

81
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,804
I can still fight!

82
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,808
What rubbish.

83
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,854
This is what people call foolhardiness.

84
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,314
You are correct.

85
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:34,360
Nothing good comes of giving in
to the heat of the moment.

86
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,448
And yet, for some reason,

87
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,995
I just can't bring myself
to leave them high and dry.

88
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,884
Damn. As soon as the Führer came back,
they regained their momentum.

89
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,720
If they get through us,
they'll take the main gate!

90
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,013
We have to hold, no matter what!

91
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,606
Yes... Yes.

92
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,774
Are you sure?

93
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,862
Mrs. Bradley, His Excellency,
the Führer is all right!

94
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,656
He is alive!

95
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,170
Thank goodness.

96
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,381
Are you all right?

97
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,093
Yes, I'm all right.

98
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:45,139
Thank goodness, he's still alive.

99
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,142
Is he at all hurt?

100
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,728
That we do not yet know.

101
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,815
His Excellency is sweeping out
the Briggs soldiers

102
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,192
at the Central Command Center.

103
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,069
We'll have to pin this on Briggs.

104
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,362
But...

105
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,489
It's in order to protect Colonel Mustang.

106
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,501
First, it's great to hear
that His Excellency is okay.

107
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:18,089
Yes. I do hope that Selim is safe as well.

108
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,967
If he is fighting Briggs' soldiers,

109
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,721
it would appear that General Armstrong
is leading this coup d'état.

110
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:30,601
Armstrong? Ah, the lady general
that recently came to Central.

111
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,519
The question is,

112
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,856
how much of the senior staff
is wrapped up in this?

113
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,945
He's alive?

114
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,781
I guess that's what you'd expect
of a Homunculus.

115
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:48,995
It looks like siding with the Führer
has backfired on us.

116
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,166
Imagine, having to paint
General Armstrong as the villain.

117
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,549
It's starting to get dangerous
around here too.

118
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,884
Yeah.

119
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,513
I wonder what will happen to us.

120
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,223
I don't know.

121
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,478
For now, since we've claimed
to be on the Führer's side,

122
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,940
it won't be that easy for them
to attack us.

123
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,818
But once Bradley
takes back full command...

124
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,742
- We could be crushed right away?
- Even with his wife here?

125
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,453
Do you think that bunch
has that sort of sentiment?

126
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,465
Long time no see.

127
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,593
You should have just fled and kept quiet.

128
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,847
Unfortunately, my avarice knows no bounds.

129
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,645
I want your life, too, Wrath.

130
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,660
Is he our backup?

131
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,539
Word all over town is that you died
in a train accident.

132
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,625
How did you survive it?

133
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,794
My eyes are too sharp for that.

134
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,800
I was able to evaluate in an instant

135
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,972
where among the rubble
to run to get out of there.

136
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,227
However, the years take their toll.

137
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,356
My body won't keep up like it used to.

138
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,861
His body isn't at its peak,
and he's still capable of this?

139
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,491
Ling Yao, right?

140
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,079
Yeah! Haven't seen you since I hid out
in that run-down apartment, huh?

141
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,165
Been a long time, Warrant Officer Falman.

142
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,041
I'm a lieutenant!

143
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,379
I owe you for the stay and the meal,
so I'll give you a hand.

144
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:09,802
Although the truth is, we both have
a personal grudge against him!

145
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,613
Moving into my blind spot?

146
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:35,203
My partner inside me
taught me how to fight you.

147
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,871
Did he?

148
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,624
Then I will do this.

149
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,259
- He's gaining the upper hand!
- This is bad, isn't it?

150
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,315
Fire! Fire! Fire!

151
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,567
You fools! Stay out of this!

152
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,911
Why, you!

153
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,499
Captain!

154
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,308
You've got some tough abs.

155
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,105
Now you can't use
your fancy swordsmanship.

156
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,607
Don't do anything crazy, you dumbass!

157
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,152
Then again... nicely done!

158
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,405
Well, well...

159
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,164
I may not be as accustomed
to these weapons, but still...

160
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,251
Now you've done it, old man!

161
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,022
His Excellency has returned?

162
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,151
Yes, sir. He is currently fighting
against an unidentified man.

163
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,659
Send in more forces at once.

164
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:43,623
We're going to drive out those
Briggs nobodies and save the Führer!

165
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,917
Replenish our weapons and troops.
Retake the main gate!

166
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,002
Yes, sir!

167
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,338
Go! Go! Go!

168
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,511
Oh, no!

169
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,057
The Central soldiers
are coming around again!

170
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,898
Sorry. I have my hands full
dealing with him.

171
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,108
You'll have to handle it.

172
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,820
Eh? Handle it? As outmanned as we are,
what are we supposed to do?

173
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,074
Just do something!

174
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,994
- Just do something?
- Captain, be strong!

175
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,832
I guess I've got no choice.

176
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:31,796
Hey! You guys get Captain Buccaneer
to a safe place!

177
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,714
- Yes, sir!
- Come on, we're going to move that!

178
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,050
Yes, sir!

179
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,571
Damn! For us to be pinned down
by just a couple of machine guns...

180
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,240
The high ground is against us!

181
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,829
Are there any forces
inside we can contact?

182
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,956
Have them force open the door
from the inside!

183
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,249
Yes, sir!

184
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,336
This is the 3rd Sovereign Battalion.
Central Command Center Garrison, come in.

185
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,964
<i>There are still mannequins
</i><i>at the East Gate.</i>

186
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,174
What? What are you talking about?

187
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,093
Give it here.

188
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,348
This is Gamelan of Sovereign Battalion.
We are at the main gate.

189
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,892
Can you open the command center gate
from within?

190
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,394
<i>Negative.</i>

191
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,147
<i>There are mannequin soldiers here,
</i><i>and we can't open the gate.</i>

192
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,150
Mannequin soldiers?
What are you talking about?

193
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,657
What happened? What's going on?

194
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,617
What's that? A new player?

195
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,717
What in the world is happening down there?

196
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,122
Not bad, old man.

197
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,209
Thank you! You saved me.

198
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:38,088
I didn't save you.
I saved the Young Lord's body.

199
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,173
Oh, I see.

200
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:43,552
Your sickening chi is emanating
from the Young Lord's body.

201
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,806
But then,
that's why I was able to find you.

202
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,143
So? Who is this man,
upon whom neither you nor I

203
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,814
could leave a scratch,
even with our skills?

204
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,899
King Bradley.

205
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,953
This is the first time
I've seen him for myself.

206
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,962
This is the man who took
my granddaughter's arm, is it?
