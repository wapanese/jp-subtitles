1
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,975
Who are those guys?

2
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:45,272
A few of Kimblee's men,
who were dispatched from Central,

3
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,066
under the pretext of being
Miss Rockbell's escorts.

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,570
What are you planning
to do here at Briggs, Kimblee?

5
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,994
If you were going up north,
you should have told me!

6
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,623
I couldn't help it. We were in a hurry.

7
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:07,836
You guys are always in a hurry!
And what were you doing in that cell?

8
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,297
It is a simple misunderstanding.

9
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,507
They will be out soon.

10
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,594
I will handle the arrangements afterward.

11
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:20,515
Thank you, Mr. Kimblee.
Please look after these two for me, okay?

12
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,516
Yes.

13
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,566
Hey, don't go trusting Kimblee too much.

14
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,152
Why not? He's a nice man, isn't he?

15
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,659
Miss Rockbell,

16
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,997
your parents were doctors
who lost their lives in Ishval, right?

17
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,917
- Yes.
- I knew it.

18
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,381
It was my squad that recovered
their bodies.

19
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,257
We were one step short
of reaching them in time,

20
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,595
and when we arrived,
it was already too late.

21
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,679
I see.

22
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,183
They followed the physician's code,

23
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,395
and stuck to their convictions,
right up to the end.

24
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,147
I sincerely respect them.

25
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,733
I would like to have met them
when they were still alive.

26
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,866
They were holding a photograph
of themselves

27
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,452
with their dear daughter,
ever so preciously.

28
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,872
You must have been a great
emotional support to them.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,338
It is an honor to meet you,
Winry Rockbell.

30
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,218
Do you know what he did in Ishval--?

31
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:49,980
<i>All I know about Ishval
</i><i>is what the lieutenant said to me.</i>

32
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,649
<i>What the lieutenant said...</i>

33
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,529
You love Winry, don't you?

34
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,712
<i>Calm down! Think about something else!
</i><i>Think about something else!</i>

35
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,257
Hydrogen, helium, lithium,
beryllium, carbon...

36
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,717
- Nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine...
- Ed...?

37
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,721
Aluminum, silicon, phosphorus,
chromium, manganese, iron,

38
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,931
cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc...

39
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,225
Why did I have to go
and fall for a weirdo like him?

40
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,936
Huh? Did you say something?

41
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,855
Nothing at all!

42
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,319
Why, you! I told you,
warn me before you connect the nerves!

43
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,322
Right, right. Now for the leg.

44
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:51,249
Oh, it's so light!
Is the strength of this still okay?

45
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,503
Overall, the strength
is lower than before,

46
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,506
but the key areas are reinforced.

47
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,345
What are you doing out of your cell?

48
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:08,975
Who knows? Maybe it's the power
of being a State Alchemist.

49
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,561
You're finally switching
to a cold-weather climate model?

50
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,854
What about you?

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,360
This is the one
that I'm most comfortable with!

52
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:23,740
Wow! The M-light combat automail!

53
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,202
Huh? The claw tips have been reinforced?

54
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,745
Are those diamond stock, by any chance?

55
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,668
Yeah! It's a refitted M, the Mad Bear G!

56
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,214
Hey, Ed, you want something like this too?

57
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,132
No, thanks!

58
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,843
Hey, who is this cute little girl?

59
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,887
My mechanic.

60
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,854
KILL!!!

61
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,733
What did you do that for?

62
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,986
This is turning my stomach.

63
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,737
That was brutal.

64
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,283
I've never seen a northern model!
It's so thrilling.

65
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,993
Oh, yeah?

66
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,246
- In that case, want to see my workplace?
- I do, I do! I want to see it!

67
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,498
- Hey!
- What?

68
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,166
Nothing.

69
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,753
Just don't get too carried away,
and wander around this place too much.

70
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,507
There's all sorts of dangerous stuff
inside the fort.

71
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,261
All right.

72
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,763
If you'd be so kind!

73
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,765
This one is kind of rare.

74
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,560
Wow, incredible!
That's a Crocodile, right?

75
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,521
As enthusiastic about her work
as her parents, I see.

76
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,814
I'm impressed you knew that!

77
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,983
The earmark of this is its design
with respect to the coefficient

78
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,942
of expansion of its material...

79
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,529
Now then, your automail swap
has been completed without incident.

80
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,782
Let's get down to business,

81
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,785
Fullmetal Alchemist.

82
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,543
Excuse me. Why haven't you let me out?

83
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,045
Mr. Kimblee's orders.

84
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:05,008
We were told to only let
the Fullmetal Alchemist out for now.

85
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,844
- You just stay here and behave yourself.
<i>- Kimblee's men...</i>

86
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,806
<i>He's covering all the bases,
</i><i>not letting us work together.</i>

87
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,516
<i>Not to mention bringing Winry along,</i>

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>to emphasize that "she is in our hands."</i>

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,524
<i>That just shows how wary they are of us.</i>

90
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,029
<i>I can't rush into anything.
</i><i>I have to wait for my chance.</i>

91
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,077
The provisions the advance team
took with them were for three days.

92
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,079
A week has already gone by.

93
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,664
That's cutting it pretty close.

94
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm concerned
about their mental state too.

95
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,085
If you spend a week
in the dark like this...

96
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,796
Let's have faith in their mental strength.

97
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:49,135
General, we can't even guess
what might happen in this hole.

98
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,474
If we're not back in hours,
please seal up the hole.

99
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,434
All right, I will.

100
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,110
I'm telling you all, right now,

101
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,572
that the incident with General Raven
is something I did all on my own.

102
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,201
None of you saw anything,
nor heard anything.

103
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:17,956
If any of this ever comes out,
put all of the blame on me.

104
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,208
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,183
Let's go.

106
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,320
I see. Things appear to be getting
pretty unruly up north too.

107
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,700
Yeah. From here on,
you need to take the initiative.

108
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,494
The Briggs crowd is skilled at defense.

109
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,455
The "first-strike victory" strategy works

110
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,999
when you excel
at both offense and defense.

111
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,586
Thus, it would be best if they teamed
with the Eastern forces,

112
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,089
which are skilled at attacking,
or so Madam Olivier believes.

113
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,092
It's an honor to be chosen
as her tag team partner.

114
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:16,222
No, it's the strength of the Eastern
forces that Madam Olivier wants.

115
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,059
She said you could just
as well get lost, Mustang.

116
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,602
Oh, is that so?

117
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,521
If I might ask,

118
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,732
what would you do
if I sold this information

119
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,359
to the FÃ¼hrer, to save my own neck?

120
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,280
She said, "Not possible.
Mustang is not that kind of man."

121
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,617
That will be 35,000 cens.

122
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm honored.

123
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,085
Ma'am, who are you?

124
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,629
Just an old florist woman,

125
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,881
who has served the Armstrong
family for generations.

126
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,138
<i>Hughes,</i>

127
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,974
the people who understand and support us

128
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:05,814
are ultimately our old war buddies,
whom we've fought alongside, aren't they?

129
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,023
Now then...

130
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,651
- What's with him?
- What a weirdo.

131
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,028
- What do I do with these flowers?
- Oh, no, he's looking at us!

132
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,909
This is awful.

133
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,871
It looks like Smith's arm.

134
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,165
Even this metal was cut through cleanly.

135
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,501
Watch yourselves.
The enemy might be out there.

136
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,511
There's someone there!

137
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:41,891
You're all right.

138
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,476
It's me. Do you recognize me?

139
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,271
Lieutenant Henschel?

140
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,275
Thank goodness you're alive.

141
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,277
Is it just you? Any others?

142
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,573
The others...
The others were all torn to pieces!

143
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,201
We have to...
We have to get out of here, quick!

144
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,162
- It's coming!
- It?

145
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,000
No lights! The shadow...
The shadow is coming!

146
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,418
Take it easy! Hey!

147
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,212
The light...

148
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,964
Hey, snap out of it!

149
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,924
The shadow is coming!

150
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,473
- Can you stand?
- Let's go.

151
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,225
Carry them as best you can.

152
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,731
<i>I apologize for coming so late.</i>

153
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
I came to deliver these urgent
documents to His Excellency.

154
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:38,531
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
He is not home at the moment.

155
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,659
I would like for him
to look these over by tomorrow.

156
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,202
By tomorrow, you say?

157
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,705
All right. I will take them from you.

158
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,707
Well then, if you'd be so k--

159
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,045
Selim, are you still up?

160
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,547
Yes. I heard someone at the door,

161
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,467
and thought that maybe
Father had come home.

162
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,136
This is Lieutenant Hawkeye.

163
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,513
Good evening, Miss Hawkeye.

164
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,806
Pleased to meet you.

165
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,184
Are you still working this late?

166
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,604
Yes. I came to deliver some
documents to His Excellency.

167
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,524
I'm terribly sorry to have awakened you.

168
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,069
Come, Master Selim.

169
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,864
You must retire,
or you will oversleep tomorrow.

170
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:20,865
Okay.

171
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,537
Such a sharp son you have.

172
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,917
Isn't he? I'm so proud of our son.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,002
If he were our biological son,
you might call me a doting mother,

174
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,463
but since he is adopted,
I can be unreserved in my pride.

175
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,549
Though, since he's the boy
of a distant relative on the Bradley side,

176
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:43,346
perhaps his good traits come
from my husband's lineage.

177
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,722
He's not one
of your distant relatives?

178
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,224
No.

179
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,400
<i>According to what the colonel said,</i>

180
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,487
<i>King Bradley was raised as a test
</i><i>subject from the time he was a baby,</i>

181
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,697
<i>and has no family.</i>

182
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>He doesn't have a single relative.</i>

183
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,619
<i>Besides which, there was
</i><i>that sensation a moment ago.</i>

184
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,205
<i>- That boy is...
- You've figured it out?</i>

185
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,669
I don't know what I'm going to do
with my stepmother.

186
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,754
She loves to talk.

187
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:21,259
Earlier, just for a moment,
I sensed an odd bloodlust.

188
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,219
I've felt it before, somewhere...

189
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,596
However, now I remember it clearly.

190
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,182
It's the same sensation
as when the Homunculus, Gluttony,

191
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,101
surprised me from behind.

192
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,104
Selim Bradley...

193
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,607
Just who exactly are you?

194
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,652
You've got a lot of guts,
asking my true identity,

195
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,987
under these circumstances,

196
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,323
Lieutenant Hawkeye.

197
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,369
You also show keen judgment
in not drawing your gun.

198
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,288
You would be unable to beat me.

199
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,501
Are you a Homunculus, like Gluttony?

200
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,547
No, I sense a pressure coming from you
that Gluttony couldn't hold a candle to.

201
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,511
It offends me that you would even
consider us to be on the same level.

202
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:11,976
My name is Pride, the First Homunculus.

203
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:23,279
The First Homunculus,
that's what you called yourself, right?

204
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,114
What does that mean?

205
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,367
Just what I said.

206
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,702
You tried to extract
even a little information, didn't you?

207
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,246
You really are gutsy, aren't you?

208
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,792
Are you sure you won't become one of us?

209
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,795
One of you?
You just want more pawns, right?

210
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,799
I see. That is too bad. Well, then...

211
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,392
I'd rather you didn't make
such empty threats.

212
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,811
There is no purpose
in killing your hostage, right?

213
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,731
How well you understand things.

214
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,235
However, Lieutenant Hawkeye,

215
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:09,450
I will always be watching you,
from your shadow.

216
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,003
<i>Business, you say?</i>

217
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,507
Yes, as a State Alchemist.

218
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,679
There are three directives
from the FÃ¼hrer.

219
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,016
Number one:
To search for Scar. Just find him.

220
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,436
<i>Disposing of him is my job.</i>

221
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,478
<i>Number two:</i>

222
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:42,400
<i>Likewise, search for Dr. Marcoh,
</i><i>who has potentially fled with Scar.</i>

223
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,527
Dr. Marcoh is with Scar?

224
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,738
Again, after you find them,
the rest will be my task.

225
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,990
And number three:

226
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,910
To carve out a crest of blood here
at Briggs.

227
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,872
Carve out a crest of blood?

228
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,874
Like what happened in Ishval.

229
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,461
Kill people, and etch the land
with hatred and sorrow.

230
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,422
There's no way I could...

231
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,058
You became a dog of the military
without the resolve to kill others?

232
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,810
No, the resolve not to kill others.

233
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,688
The resolve not to kill others.

234
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,734
There'd be veracity
if you adhere to that, as well.

235
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,321
Are you working with them,
aware of what they're trying to do?

236
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:34,410
- They're going to--
- I want to see how the world changes.

237
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,038
Resolve and resolve, will and will.

238
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,414
Life and life.

239
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,249
Humans and Homunculi.

240
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,251
Which one will win?

241
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,213
What will the world choose?

242
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:50,301
If humans perish under the Homunculi,
who call themselves "evolved humans,"

243
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,845
that would be a historic moment.

244
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,598
I just want to see it through.

245
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,894
How can you, a human,
take sides with the Homunculi?

246
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:04,941
Because they let me use my alchemy
without any reservation.

247
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,901
You're off your rocker.

248
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,445
I know that I'm a heretic.

249
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,698
However, if someone like me survives,

250
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,952
it means that the world
will have chosen me.

251
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:21,123
I stake my survival, indeed,
my very existence, on this battle.

252
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,168
There is no life worth living
as much as this one.

253
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,172
I don't get it.

254
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,384
Oh, that's a shame.

255
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,972
I thought that all alchemists
were self-centered.

256
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:42,061
Well then, I shall speak to the part
that is at your self-center.

257
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,774
You want this so badly, you can taste it.

258
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,778
If you accept this job,
I will give it to you.

259
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,531
<i>A Philosopher's Stone!</i>

260
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,165
Let me talk to Al and Winry.

261
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,376
Miss Winry too?

262
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,004
I haven't told her anything.

263
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,300
Regardless of the job,
I don't want to betray her by lying.

264
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,052
Very well.

265
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,806
I will accompany you,
to make sure you do not tell her too much.

266
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,818
Winry, you are in a hostage
situation right now.

267
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,738
How so?

268
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,574
What is he talking about? Is this a joke?

269
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,410
Listen to me.

270
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,873
I am being ordered from higher up
to go to work as a human weapon.

271
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:48,586
As such, I may have to assist
in a mass murder.

272
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,338
You have to refuse!

273
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,301
That's why I'm...

274
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,183
Oh, no. I'm serving to shackle you.

275
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,353
I won't cry!

276
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,437
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,441
I'm upset at myself
for being so happy-go-lucky.

278
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,152
How did this...?

279
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,947
All you guys wanted to do
was get your original bodies back.

280
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:22,370
About that, if I help with the operation,
I can get a Philosopher's Stone.

281
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,789
A Stone? But...

282
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,040
Kimblee has it.

283
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,958
Not that!
The ingredients for a Stone are--

284
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,460
I know!

285
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,598
- You do whatever you want to.
- Yeah.

286
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,400
That settles it. I'll take the job.

287
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,027
Let me search for Scar first.

288
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,530
Why is that?

289
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,408
Scar killed Winry's parents.

290
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,743
I want to avenge them.

291
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,162
I see. Very well.

292
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,790
Also, I'm taking Al with me.

293
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,125
Him being the way he is,

294
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,086
Scar's bodily destruction
won't work on him.

295
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,589
Oh, that is handy.

296
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,882
Al, are you sure?

297
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:23,889
A Philosopher's Stone is made
by sacrificing many lives.

298
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,230
It's all right.

299
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,316
Brother doesn't intend to use it.

300
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,777
Right now,
we're investigating the possibility

301
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,072
of using Xingese alkahestry
to get our bodies back.

302
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:45,244
There's a girl who uses alkahestry
that appears to be working with Scar.

303
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,997
Then, he's going to act like
he's going after Scar

304
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,165
to get to this girl?

305
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,418
- Probably.
- I see.

306
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,424
In that case, I have to come up
with a better-sounding excuse too.

307
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,191
We'll head to the place
Scar was last spotted first.

308
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,567
Very good.

309
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,319
Hey, there! Let me squeeze in!

310
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,743
Al! Move over a little more that way!

311
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,205
What are you doing here?

312
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,375
Miss Winry, please wait at the fort.

313
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,629
- We aren't here for the fun of it.
- I know!

314
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,881
But I just switched his automail, right?

315
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,759
We don't want him
to have any malfunctions,

316
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,761
and if I don't come along
to perform maintenance,

317
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,932
it would tarnish the Rockbell name
if anything were to happen.

318
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,563
You're as earnest about your work
as ever, huh? Workaholic!

319
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,942
You bet I am! We've been a highly-trusted
operation since my great-granddad!

320
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,527
All right, very well.

321
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,029
- I know, you're a family of gearheads!
- I will permit you to accompany us.

322
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,323
"Gearheads" is fine!

323
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,794
There's no telling what will happen.

324
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah.

325
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,133
<i>But I've had enough
</i><i>of just waiting around.</i>
