1
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,783
- It hurts!
- Save us!

2
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,161
- I'm hungry!
- It hurts!

3
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,080
- Big Brother!
- It hurts!

4
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,834
You say that the multiple-body tests
aren't done yet?

5
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,837
This is your test and it was successful!

6
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,344
Undying, obedient, mighty soldiers
who will fight however we order them to.

7
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:19,097
The Immortal Legion is born.

8
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,933
Papa?

9
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,686
Yes, I am your father.

10
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,813
Now, listen very closely
to what I'm about to say.

11
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,484
There are multiple renegade elements

12
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,322
that are trying to take
this command center.

13
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,657
Papa.

14
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,950
You men are to--

15
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,523
- It hurts.
- It hurts.

16
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,733
- It hurts!
- It hurts!

17
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:16,405
- It hurts!
- It hurts!

18
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,169
That sure is a huge doorway.

19
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,672
The air here seems nasty somehow.

20
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,924
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,428
- It's just like Al told me.
- Huh?

22
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,638
Who is this?

23
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,892
Number 66, Barry the Chopper.

24
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,271
He was Slicer's partner.

25
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:08,206
Come on! Come on!

26
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,713
Damn it, how do you open this?

27
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,759
Step aside.

28
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,808
Oh, it opened?

29
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,742
Tell the Central soldiers
that are fighting with Mustang

30
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,535
and the Briggs soldiers to pull back.

31
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,417
Whoa, are you going to open fire?

32
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,133
Your subordinates aren't
all that disciplined, are they?

33
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,764
Pull them back now.

34
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,309
The Briggs soldiers will not hesitate
to continue fighting them.

35
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,604
Do you want to lose
every last soldier you have?

36
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,285
Close the north, south, east,
and west gates

37
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,870
of the Central Command Center!

38
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:34,042
Don't let a single one of Mustang's
soldiers or the Briggs soldiers inside!

39
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:39,297
Oh, it seems you have some guts after all,
however rotten they might be.

40
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,049
Don't be too full of yourself, woman!

41
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,554
We will crush all of you
Briggs Mountain monkeys!

42
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,398
What?

43
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,901
Oh, over there.

44
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:08,368
No, he told me to kill you.

45
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,870
What a pain.

46
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:15,083
Ha! Another seat opens up ahead of me!

47
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,627
You have my thanks, Homunculus!

48
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,130
Now, I don't have to sully this sword

49
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,716
that was passed down through
the Armstrong family for generations

50
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,926
with his despicable blood!

51
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,603
You bastard!

52
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,951
They don't die?

53
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,663
It hurts.

54
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,582
Mama.

55
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,335
- So hungry.
- It hurts.

56
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,087
- It hurts!
- It hurts!

57
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,006
Big brother!

58
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,384
It can't be.

59
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,891
These mannequins have human souls
possessing them?

60
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:17,187
Damn it, they just keep coming!
What are these things?

61
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,398
How should I know? And why won't they die?

62
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,819
This is bad.
If these things get outside...

63
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,745
- Did something happen?
- Beats me.

64
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,123
Word is that Colonel Mustang
is leading a coup d'Ã©tat.

65
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,542
What a dangerous affair.

66
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,378
There, there, don't cry.

67
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,591
What do we do?

68
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,970
Damn you!

69
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,099
No! They're going to get out!

70
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,070
Sorry, I blocked the exit.

71
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,446
Don't worry about it.

72
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,574
If you hadn't done it,
I would have busted the exit open.

73
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,077
Now, we can brace ourselve for the worst.

74
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,581
Okay, then,
now that our outside concerns are gone,

75
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,251
this is our chance to show our stuff!

76
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,049
- Mama!
- It hurts!

77
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,511
- It hurts.
- Help me!

78
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,763
How could they create these things?

79
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,558
We have to go through them

80
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,768
if we want to reach the bearded bastard!

81
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,358
This a real pain in the ass!

82
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,239
Mustang is fleeing in an ice cream truck!

83
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,574
Seal off the main roads!

84
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,659
It's disguised as a civilian truck,

85
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,953
but it's loaded with weapons
and ammunition!

86
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,455
Look sharp!

87
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,258
<i>A bear! A bear with a mohawk!</i>

88
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,971
Transmission was cut.

89
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,308
A bear with a mohawk?

90
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,310
That's Captain Buccaneer,
from the Northern forces.

91
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,230
Colonel, it looks like it's going
to be hard to get into town.

92
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,442
You're right.

93
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,741
An ice cream truck, huh?

94
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,289
I wonder if the guys are doing all right.

95
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,588
It sure is aggravating
not being able to fight with them.

96
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,300
Who knew that just sitting around
could make you so restless?

97
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,724
I've been hearing that sound
ever since yesterday.

98
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,935
Hey, Alphonse! What's that sound?

99
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,438
Selim is playing around with my head.

100
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,281
Whatever he may be on the inside,
he's still just a kid.

101
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,793
Stop him, Alphonse!

102
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,462
Stop him from making that sound!

103
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,173
That's dot-and-dash,
a military communications code!

104
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,432
He's signaling this location--

105
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:08,710
Hey, thank you very much
for coming to get me, Kimblee.

106
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,465
Good grief,
please don't give me extra work.

107
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,261
Please forgive me.

108
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,097
I won't let my guard down again.

109
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,577
What is this? You tricked me, Envy!

110
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,204
I didn't lie to you!

111
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,790
Immortality is farther inside!

112
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,099
Damn you, you twit!

113
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,954
I made it!

114
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,081
I've come back to life!

115
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:27,974
Thanks for bringing me this far, squirt!

116
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,941
What are soldiers doing
in a place like this?

117
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,651
Are they here to serve
notices of eviction?

118
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,613
What do we do now?
We don't have anywhere else to go.

119
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,786
What is this? You don't suppose
they caught wind of where we are, do you?

120
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,039
Not good. Alphonse is...

121
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,707
Hold on, Doc!

122
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,711
What if they discover
that you're Doctor Marcoh?

123
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,214
But we can't just sit here and watch.

124
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,842
Take it easy.

125
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,344
If you get taken prisoner or anything,

126
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,389
it's just going to make it
that much harder on Alphonse!

127
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,936
We can't afford to move carelessly.
Just sit still, okay?

128
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:34,415
You're alone?
I heard that Gluttony was here, too.

129
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,460
I ended up consuming him.

130
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,669
You ate him?

131
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,421
Your own kind?

132
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,801
He is not my kind. We are a collective.

133
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,262
We are both born from the same father.

134
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,849
All we've done
is go back to being one form.

135
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,935
Is that how it is?

136
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,521
Mr. Heinkel!

137
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,113
Oh, you're still alive, are you?

138
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,698
That's a Chimera for you.

139
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,951
Your life force is strong.

140
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,495
Mr. Heinkel!

141
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,916
Damn it!

142
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,793
Let me go!

143
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,795
You're not getting away.

144
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,797
Why, you...!

145
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,808
Stop your useless struggling.

146
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,409
Don't run away.

147
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,838
What?

148
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,216
I should have known that wouldn't work.

149
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,344
That's far enough, General Armstrong.

150
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,225
We have orders to shoot you, a traitor!

151
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,937
Aim!

152
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,189
Fire!

153
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,445
You idiot.
This isn't the time to be divided.

154
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,088
Take a little damage, would you?

155
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,760
Got you.

156
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,724
This time, I won't mess up.

157
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,398
Kill the woman general.

158
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,704
Big Sister!

159
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,041
Are you all right?

160
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,005
Who do you think you're talking to, Alex?

161
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:34,345
I'm glad you're all right!
By the way, what might that be?

162
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,849
A Homunculus.
Bullets have no effect against him.

163
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,771
-Cannon-class fire is just barely enough.
-What?

164
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,775
That's my field of specialty, you know?

165
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:54,407
What do you say you leave this to Alex,
your younger brother?

166
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,410
Come, monster!

167
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,040
What a pain.

168
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,509
Don't worry about me.

169
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,513
Get out of here. Quickly!

170
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,349
- No way!
- Don't talk back to me.

171
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,518
At this rate, we'll both be beaten.

172
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,396
If you leave me behind,

173
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,274
you might be able
to save yourself, at least.

174
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,650
I said, I'm not going!

175
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,614
Now, think about something useful instead,
like staying alive!

176
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,698
You dumbass!

177
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,537
Look at our situation!
We're facing Kimblee and Pride!

178
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,001
Now, leave me here and get going.

179
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,089
Don't give up! I swear, I'll save you!

180
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,386
Damn it!

181
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,097
Move it, legs!

182
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:06,646
We can't afford to be beaten here!

183
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,734
Mr. Heinkel, grab on!

184
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,944
Don't give up!

185
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:17,365
You brothers really take the cake.

186
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,035
How is it that you can try
to help someone else

187
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,829
when you're falling to pieces yourself?

188
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,250
I made a promise.

189
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,337
I promised my brother

190
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,758
that I wasn't going to let
anyone else die, no matter what.

191
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:48,771
Right, I guess it was Kimblee
who said that to survive was to win.

192
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,485
Which reminds me,
I've got something nice here.

193
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,077
Mr. Heinkel, why do you have that?

194
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,249
I picked it up when Kimblee
abandoned us at that mine up north.

195
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,627
A Philosopher's Stone.

196
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,089
With this, we just might win.

197
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,173
But...

198
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,384
Yeah, I know.

199
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,970
These are made using human lives, right?

200
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,143
Your brother also told me
that you'd rather not use one of these

201
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,854
to get your original bodies back.

202
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,980
In that case...

203
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,315
In that case,

204
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,528
use it not for your own sake,
but to save the world.

205
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,741
I'm asking you this because, even though
they've turned into this stone,

206
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,661
you still recognize them
as being people's lives.

207
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,373
I can tell.

208
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,669
No matter their appearance,

209
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,173
they want to fight to protect
what's important to them.

210
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,719
Let those guys fight, as well.

211
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,602
All right.

212
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,189
Give them hell.

213
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,816
Alphonse!

214
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,989
Let's fight, together.

215
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,578
What an annoying dust cloud.

216
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,081
- Shall I blow it away with a blast wave?
- No.

217
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:35,211
Those two are still inside the dust cloud.

218
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,962
He can't escape with those legs--

219
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,484
Well, well.

220
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,027
I don't think he's running away.

221
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,746
Good!

222
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:18,254
Very good, Alphonse Elric!
