1
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,029
Here's that expression again, May.

2
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,324
That word must also mean "gold", huh?

3
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,034
What are you doing?

4
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,039
We're checking to see
if there is a hidden code.

5
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,373
Code?

6
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,461
In order to make sure regular people
can't decode their notes easily,

7
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,590
alchemists use metaphor and allegory
to conceal their content.

8
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,592
However, in the case
of these research notes,

9
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,302
there doesn't seem to be any of that.

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,931
So, because of all the phrases
that mean "gold" and "immortality,"

11
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,393
we thought we might change our way
of investigating them.

12
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,564
- So have you figured anything out?
- Nothing.

13
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,110
- Where am I?
-Al!

14
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,071
- Al!
- Thank goodness!

15
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,449
I didn't know what I would do
if you didn't regain consciousness.

16
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,869
Sorry. I must have worried you.

17
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,624
By the way, why have I been taken apart?

18
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,627
<i>So there you have it.</i>

19
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,048
You were too big for us
to move with one of us carrying you.

20
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,467
So we dismantled you.

21
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,596
Sorry. I guess I put you all out.

22
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,099
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

23
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,143
Once, before coming here.

24
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,733
Well, it can't be very convenient
for you to be taken apart.

25
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,152
Let's put you back together.

26
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,279
Yes, please do.

27
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,074
Would you hold onto this for a bit?

28
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,452
Let's see.

29
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,624
- This part goes...
- That's his right arm, right?

30
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,545
Right. Can't have him matching up
the wrong way, after all.

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,298
In pieces...

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,009
Matching up...

33
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,523
May!

34
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:56,361
How could you pull it apart like that?

35
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,576
By changing the way it matches up...

36
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,538
I was thinking,
what if I tried overlapping the parts

37
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,166
of the phrases that mean
"gold" and "immortality"?

38
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,676
"Golden man."
This phrase was over there.

39
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,263
"Immortality..." overlaps here.

40
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,434
"Perfect person..."
There it is, there it is.

41
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,644
Give me those pages, Marcoh.

42
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,480
That one connects over here.

43
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,484
- Is there a "golden person"?
- Yes, there is. Right here.

44
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,822
This is the last one.

45
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,705
I wonder if...

46
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,798
Is that...?

47
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,554
The countrywide transmutation circle.

48
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,516
What good does it do, finding this now?

49
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,810
What does this mean?

50
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,312
Does this mean that the research notes
are no help at all?

51
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,356
You've gotta be kidding me!

52
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,567
What's gonna happen to us?
No, the whole country?

53
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,446
I'm sorry. I was naive to think

54
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,490
that the way to take
this critical situation

55
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,827
and turn it around would be found
in someone else's research.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,501
Brother, is this what you wanted
to tell me?

57
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:40,757
Brother, knowing you, didn't you arrive
at anything beyond this?

58
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,635
There's still something here.

59
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,181
We didn't realize
that we needed to pull it apart.

60
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,516
If there was still something...

61
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,519
still something hidden,
it wouldn't surprise me.

62
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,700
Hey, what are you thinking?

63
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,910
It's not my fault it's so cold!

64
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,996
And even without it,
I'm sensitive to the cold.

65
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,080
Who cares?

66
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,876
You can't even tell which side
is face-up or down anymore.

67
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,717
- You've flipped these over like crazy.
- That might be it!

68
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,387
Take the critical situation
and turn it around.

69
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,471
Face-up and face-down!

70
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,225
Take what we just had
and flip the pages upside-down!

71
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,693
Well?

72
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
That was it.

73
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,158
This is a new Amestrisian countrywide

74
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,163
transmutation circle
that incorporates alkahestry.

75
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,598
There doesn't seem to be any trace
of anyone passing through here.

76
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:16,227
Perhaps I've come the wrong way.
I guess I'll go back.

77
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,181
So that's it.

78
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,185
This place must have been used
to remove the rubble

79
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,188
from the tunnel that Sloth is digging.

80
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,820
You are the Crimson Alchemist, right?

81
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,615
Pleased to meet you. I am Pride.

82
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,702
Did you need something from me?

83
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:19,290
- How is the Scar matter coming?
- I am pursuing him now.

84
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,750
Deal with him later.

85
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,713
Carve out the crest of blood
at Briggs first.

86
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,717
Forgive me for saying so,
but the monolithic nature and strength

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,386
of Briggs' soldiers
are quite considerable.

88
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,182
- It is not going to be an easy task.
- Make use of their strength.

89
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,899
The tunnel that Sloth
is digging is almost complete.

90
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:51,656
Very well. I will carve out
the crest of blood for you

91
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,743
at Fort Briggs.

92
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,883
- We've been expecting you.
- We've been expecting you.

93
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,509
Any change to report?

94
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,431
Not especially. Never mind us.
I heard that Kimblee went missing.

95
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,724
Is that true?

96
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,645
Yeah. There was an explosion,
big enough to collapse the tunnels.

97
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,565
Kimblee and several others are missing.

98
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,360
We did a thorough search, but ultimately,
no one's body turned up.

99
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,282
Were the "several others"
Briggs' soldiers?

100
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,621
No, they were Kimblee's two men...

101
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,999
and the Fullmetal Alchemist.

102
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,299
<i>I see. Chief Fullmetal?</i>

103
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,677
<i>- I hope he's all right.
- Yeah.</i>

104
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,138
How are things in the west?

105
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,057
What can I tell you?

106
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,560
The border war at Pendleton
was a real mess.

107
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,230
The way they were fighting,
I can only guess

108
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,357
they were intentionally
racking up the KIAs.

109
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,112
The military seems to be taking
the initiative in making this bloody

110
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,572
so they can create the transmutation
circle, just like you said.

111
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,244
<i>Have you gotten any word
</i><i>from Sergeant Fuery, in the south?</i>

112
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,080
A little while ago, by phone.

113
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,125
He said they were exchanging fire
with the Aerugo forces,

114
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,043
down in southern Fotcett.

115
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:48,022
Run, Thomas! Don't let up! Thomas!

116
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,864
Damn it!

117
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,618
I'm gonna survive!
I'm gonna survive, no matter what!

118
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,374
Is that right?

119
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,671
<i>That's how it is for us redheaded
</i><i>stepchildren from Mustang's old squad.</i>

120
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,340
<i>Are you in touch with the colonel?</i>

121
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:18,887
Yes, we're using a messenger
with ties to the Armstrong family.

122
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,518
Okay. Sounds like it's rough up north too
so watch yourself.

123
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,479
<i>Yes, you could say it's rough.</i>

124
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,236
Their men are up here, working steadily
to turn this country into a hell on earth,

125
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,281
and there isn't a single thing
we can do about it.

126
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,962
I've connected...

127
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,594
Can I stop working now, Pride?

128
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,643
It's almost time.

129
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,979
The day is nearly at hand.

130
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,124
Everyone! Time to eat! Please line up!

131
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,132
Rose, I'd like to have meat pie sometime.

132
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,551
I'll make some,
once I get the ingredients.

133
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,762
I can't wait.

134
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:50,269
I haven't worked, but would you give me
some for these children?

135
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,023
Of course. Have some as well, ma'am.

136
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,279
It looks so good.

137
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,156
Rose, a heaping helping, if you please.

138
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,327
I can't do that.
Everyone gets an equal portion.

139
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,163
Excuse me...

140
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,835
May I have some too, please?

141
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:23,720
Wow, you saved me.
Thanks, that was delicious.

142
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,681
Where did you come from?

143
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,768
I didn't come from anywhere.
I wander around here and there.

144
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,689
What did you come
all the way out here for?

145
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,234
You do know about the disturbance
that took place here, right?

146
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,531
There isn't anything in this town anymore
because of it.

147
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,578
Despite there being such delicious food?

148
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,751
I'm flattered that you would say so,

149
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,504
but this is about the extent
of what I can do.

150
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,798
I wouldn't say that.

151
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:06,554
A hot meal and a young lady's smile
give strength to everyone.

152
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,311
Right.

153
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,689
I hate to ask after imposing
so much already,

154
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,691
but I'm looking for a church.

155
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,610
Church?

156
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,615
Yes. The home of Letoism,
which was the cause of the disturbance.

157
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,793
It's just what you see.

158
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,878
You go in there now,
and there's nothing left.

159
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,340
Would there happen to be a passage
that leads underground?

160
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,676
Yes, there is.

161
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,683
What's this?

162
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,729
Toxic water.
It happened before anyone realized it.

163
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,115
It's all set up so that no normal person
can go any farther, is it?

164
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,199
- Let me see.
- Wait!

165
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,700
You'll die if you go in there.

166
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,837
It's a miracle.

167
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,299
No, it isn't. It's alchemy, isn't it?

168
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,596
I'm going to go a little farther in.
Would you wait there for me?

169
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,367
It's huge.

170
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,663
They went all-out in making this.

171
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,628
Found it right off the bat.

172
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,108
Oh, my, didn't even slow you down.

173
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,693
In that case...

174
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,988
let me try to contain you.

175
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,662
Oh, dear.

176
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,544
I don't know what to do now.

177
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,981
What's the matter?
Aren't you coming after me?

178
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,238
Your appearance... You're Van Hohenheim?

179
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,742
It would seem that your receptacle
only comes this far.

180
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,248
If you leave here, you'll die, right?

181
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,586
You'll die if you transgress
some fixed line, won't you?

182
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,005
Just like the flask, way back when.

183
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,761
It looks to me like you can only act
within the heart of Central

184
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,388
and in these tunnels.

185
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,681
How about it?

186
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,560
Did I guess it right?

187
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,272
What's the matter?

188
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,233
Why don't you say something,
you shrinking violet?

189
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,154
Are you angry?

190
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,617
Anger does not exist within me.

191
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,496
And it isn't just anger.

192
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,709
I left all of my unnecessary emotions
within my father.

193
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,503
My name is Pride.

194
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,258
Pride. I see. The Arrogant.

195
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,264
They say that man
is possessed of seven sins.

196
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,141
Lust,

197
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,018
greed,

198
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,894
sloth,

199
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,771
gluttony,

200
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,648
envy,

201
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,151
wrath,

202
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,655
and pride.

203
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:40,703
So that makes you, "Pride,"
the first one he cut loose from himself.

204
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,417
To think that he would take the care
to cut you loose

205
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,672
with an appearance similar
to when he was in the flask.

206
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,508
That is the very form
of his proud, arrogant self.

207
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,929
It's the essence of your father.

208
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,182
Would you like to come
to where my father is?

209
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,893
Don't be in such a hurry.
I will be coming, invited or not.

210
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,063
Give him a message.

211
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,608
Tell him Slave No. 23
will be coming to see him soon.

212
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:17,114
Tell him to sit back in his chair
in Central and wait for me.

213
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,498
Yes, I am waiting for you,
Van Hohenheim.

214
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,928
He's coming back!

215
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,016
Did you find something?

216
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,979
Regular people shouldn't go near there.
It's too dangerous.

217
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,524
Please tell everyone not to go in there.

218
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,032
What did you do in there?

219
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,830
Made a declaration of war.

220
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,252
You're relieved.

221
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,339
We've been waiting for you.
This snowstorm has been terrible.

222
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:19,802
Now then, I think I'll go
get some lousy coffee.

223
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,470
Good work--

224
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,273
- Hey...!
- That couldn't possibly be...

225
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,069
It's Drachma!

226
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>Drachma has declared an outbreak
</i><i>of hostilities from the north!</i>

227
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,912
<i>All personnel, prepare for combat!</i>

228
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>Repeat, Drachma has declared
</i><i>an outbreak of hostilities from the north!</i>

229
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,961
<i>All personnel, prepare for combat!</i>

230
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:10,102
Lucky for us,
the Northern Wall of Briggs isn't in.

231
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,729
Mr. Kimblee?

232
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:17,777
Additionally, many of our own men
are inside the fort.

233
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,446
Once the fighting starts,
they'll turn on them,

234
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,240
and then there will be chaos
inside the fort.

235
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:30,039
After not being able to cross Briggs
for so long,

236
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,500
today is the day that Drachma
will capture it!

237
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,128
Now, to decree war.

238
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,799
What do you say we launch
our fireworks in style?

239
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,676
All cannons, prepare to fire!

240
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,562
Fire!

241
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,912
Yeah. My name is Zampano.
I'm one of Kimblee's men.

242
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:38,167
Dr. Marcoh is hiding in the slums
of Asbeck Village.

243
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,295
<i>You were right to tell me this, Zampano.</i>

244
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,797
I will guarantee your safety.

245
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,762
Marcoh!

246
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,557
This is starting to get interesting.
