1
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>The Promised Day which was to come.</i>

2
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>There were those who moved forward
</i><i>their preparations</i>

3
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>for this day that would shape
</i><i>their destiny.</i>

4
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,273
<i>And so, time moves on, until the spring.</i>

5
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,985
<i>The Promised Day was about to arrive.</i>

6
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,953
Is this a festival?

7
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,041
It's the Spring Sheep Festival,
a Resembool institution.

8
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,045
Sorry to interrupt you on a day like this.
We'd like to replenish our water.

9
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,255
Sure thing. Take as much as you'd like.

10
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,424
All right. Unload the tanks!

11
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,159
Looks like no one's home.

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,119
We're here, miss.

13
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,512
It smells like home.

14
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,312
There's automail all over the place.

15
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,940
Don't touch any of the pieces
in progress, okay?

16
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,246
It's so dusty in here.

17
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,971
What's wrong?

18
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,182
Edward Elric?

19
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,226
Intruders!

20
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,442
- What are you guys doing?
- Ling?

21
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,778
You guys are Kimblee's men!

22
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,657
You guys are from Briggs.

23
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,118
You've pursued us all the way here?

24
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,747
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Lower your guns!

25
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,500
- You lower yours first!
- Ed, what in the world is going on here?

26
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,878
- It's a really long story.
- Where did you guys come from?

27
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,422
Is Kimblee with you?
And what are you doing in my room?

28
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,424
Kimblee's got nothing to do with us!
I like looking outside while I eat.

29
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,592
- Hear us out!
- You expect us to believe you?

30
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,844
Whatever. Just put your guns down!

31
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,971
Don't shout!

32
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,931
Shut that dog up.

33
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,102
This is a girl's bedroom! Get out!

34
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,074
I was worried.

35
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:48,079
Yeah... I'm glad you're okay too.
Isn't Al with you?

36
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,462
Ed, Al is at the train station
together with Mr. Miles.

37
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,007
They're leaving before long.
If you hurry, you might make it in time.

38
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,641
What's wrong? Aren't you going?

39
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,438
We're wanted men in Central.

40
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,691
It wouldn't be good if anyone saw us.

41
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,401
Yeah, but...

42
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,668
The sheep festival? That takes me back.

43
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,422
- We're just about ready to leave.
- Right.

44
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,845
I sure hope the next time
you come back here,

45
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,931
you'll have your original body.

46
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,517
Right.

47
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,950
Winry?

48
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,456
Welcome home.

49
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,461
I'm back. Sorry to have worried you.

50
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,383
I see we have some more
foul characters about.

51
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,052
We're terribly sorry
for all the commotion.

52
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,763
We are soldiers from Briggs.

53
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,974
We've been assigned to escort Miss Winry.

54
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,353
Ling, it's you, right?

55
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,939
Are you one of this guy's friends?

56
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,944
I'm Greed. Pleased to meet you.

57
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,664
And so, these guys are now working for me.

58
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,541
Why did you come here?

59
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,753
To get ourselves ready.
His automail needs maintenance.

60
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,674
- I want him in tip-top condition.
- Have a look at him later.

61
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,471
You're the one who made his automail,
so I can't do any of the fine tuning.

62
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,433
Okay.

63
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:22,192
Is that right?
Liore is getting back on its feet.

64
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,153
Good. That's been bothering me.

65
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,910
So, how come Al is with Major Miles?

66
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,789
The folks from Briggs
are going to be doing something

67
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,582
at some training ground in the east.

68
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,586
Al thought he might be able
to help out there, so he volunteered.

69
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,755
I see.

70
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:48,843
Ed, your father went to Central
a little before we left.

71
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,596
I hear he's in some slum named Kanama,

72
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,516
so go see him
and get the full story from him.

73
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,064
The Promised Day is almost here, right?

74
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,445
I heard about it from Greed.

75
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,532
The day is a chance for us
to get back to normal,

76
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,785
but it also could mean a huge tragedy
for the country.

77
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,291
- Listen...
- What?

78
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,671
Take Granny and Den,
and run away to some foreign country.

79
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,341
What do you mean, run away?

80
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,468
What good is having
only those close to you get away?

81
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,930
Can't you do anything to stop the country
from getting messed up?

82
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,140
I'm gonna stop it!

83
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,059
I'm going to stop it,
but there is that one chance in a million!

84
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,311
Don't give me one in a million,
or even a billion!

85
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,816
Those guys are about to do
something awful, right?

86
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,318
So slam the door shut on it,
and protect the country!

87
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,154
And then, Ed,

88
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,490
both you and Al come home
with your original bodies!

89
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,826
I'll do anything to make that happen!

90
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,460
You make it sound so simple.

91
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,088
What is this?
It's not like you to get discouraged.

92
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,677
- Hey, Ed!
- The girl doesn't know when to shut up.

93
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,678
Ed!

94
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,230
Nice girl you have there.

95
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,484
She wants to have it all.

96
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,197
Nothing good comes from wanting
something too badly.

97
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,034
Look here, I wanted someone
who was dead, and this is what I got.

98
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,243
Are you sure?

99
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,163
"I want to see someone who died,"

100
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,875
"I want money," "I want women,"

101
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,086
and "I want to defend the world,"

102
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,256
are all things that the heart wants,
or in other words, desires.

103
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,095
If I had to say it,
greed is neither good nor bad.

104
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,014
You humans get tripped up

105
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,226
because you presume to assign
value ratings to greed.

106
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,654
<i>You're leaving at this hour?</i>

107
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,783
We planned to leave today,
even if we hadn't run into you.

108
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,871
Thanks for servicing my automail.

109
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,670
If you happen to see Hohenheim,
give him the message from Trisha.

110
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,047
Okay, okay.

111
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,260
- Ed, I...
- You make sure you keep yourself hidden.

112
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,515
We're going to put an end to all of this
on the Promised Day,

113
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,269
and then come back home.
So bake us some apple pie and wait for us.

114
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,993
I put in a good day's work today.

115
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:04,330
Then again, are you sure
we should be doing this?

116
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,623
The Promised Day is almost here.

117
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,836
What else are we supposed to do?
Mr. Marcoh and Scar haven't come yet.

118
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,172
For Pete's sake, where are those two,
and what are they doing?

119
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,929
- Doc!
- Oh, it's you guys!

120
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,473
Don't "Oh, it's you guys" us!

121
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,434
Where have you been
traipsing around all this time?

122
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,772
All right... Let's head off for Central.

123
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,778
You know, it feels kind of funny,
doesn't it?

124
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:40,575
Imagine, us former soldiers
working together with an Ishvalan.

125
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:46,372
Yeah, yeah, for us,
Amestris is the land we were born in.

126
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,540
Our families are here.

127
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,461
But now, Scar, who rebelled
against this country,

128
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,131
is now taking action to save this country.
Think of it.

129
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,885
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not saving the country.

130
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,053
I'm changing it.

131
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,394
I'm acting to make this country
which rejected the Ishvalan people,

132
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,979
acknowledge our presence.

133
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:14,984
In order to change the world,
you must first be changed yourself.

134
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,489
That is how it is, Amestrisians.

135
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,700
- Ishvalans?
- But how?

136
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,746
We haven't just been "traipsing around"
for all these months.

137
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,125
These are friends
who share the same purpose.

138
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,101
I look forward to this again
this year, sir.

139
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:53,731
Well, happily, our exercises
are being held here this time around.

140
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,651
Having joint exercises in the north
is quite a pain.

141
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,952
- Everything is in place.
- We are all set up as well.

142
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,580
However, there is one small problem...

143
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,125
Problem?

144
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,716
Of all things,
Bradley has come to watch us.

145
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,013
<i>The Promised Day is so close,</i>

146
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:29,475
<i>I was ready for them to send
</i><i>someone to watch us, but...</i>

147
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,022
Well, I guess we'll just have
to do something about it.

148
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,208
Not again.

149
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,340
The intervals where I'm being
pulled over there

150
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,551
are gradually getting shorter.

151
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:08,306
We have to hurry.
If I don't get back to my body soon...

152
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,571
I smell him! I smell him!

153
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,991
That's the smell
of the Fullmetal Alchemist's brother!

154
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,994
You're running away?

155
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>This is bad!
</i><i>I can't fight him very well in my shape!</i>

156
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,480
What is this?

157
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,904
Not now of all times...!

158
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,880
You're going to take it easy
until the Promised Day,

159
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,466
Alphonse Elric.

160
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,609
Hello there, General.

161
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,573
I've got no tea to serve
to the likes of you.

162
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,706
I may be able to invite you out
to dinner soon.

163
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,250
You've decided to deliver
on your promise from earlier?

164
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,048
I must say, you have a large mansion.

165
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,259
Just what you'd expect
of the Armstrong family.

166
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,805
You could fit a company,
no, a whole battalion in there.

167
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,269
If anything were to happen to me,

168
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,648
I could let you have the entire mansion.

169
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,817
It won't fit inside a casket after all.

170
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,112
You're not going to leave it
to your brother?

171
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,450
If it came down to giving it
to you or him,

172
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,661
I'd still rather give it to you,
but only by a whisker.

173
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,539
I'm honored.

174
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,923
Belated though it may be, congratulations
on becoming head of the Armstrong family.

175
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,929
Hyacinths.

176
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,978
"Selim Bradley is a Homunculus."

177
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,484
Do you know what hyacinths represent
in the language of flowers?

178
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,945
No.

179
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,365
Ladylike appeal.

180
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,369
You mind your own business!

181
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,582
Well then, I must be going, sir.

182
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,128
Little punk...!

183
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,890
THE DAY BEFORE THE PROMISED DAY

184
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,235
This is so stifling.

185
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,362
What do you say we avail ourselves
of the commotion

186
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,365
and blow the building Bradley is in
away with our cannons?

187
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,909
- Sir, please don't do that.
- Major Miles...

188
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,415
You still can't figure out
where Alphonse Elric is?

189
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,793
No, sir. The search is still ongoing.

190
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,713
But you don't think the other side
caught him, do you?

191
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,843
And here, the Promised Day
is tomorrow too.

192
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,346
Your Excellency...

193
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,724
General Hakuro.

194
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,394
Excellency, there is something
I would like to inform you

195
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,729
concerning General Grumman.

196
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,898
He's going to use the Eastern forces
to stage a coup d'état?

197
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,234
If so, it's what I would expect of him.

198
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,739
No, sir, the north and east
joint exercise is a decoy.

199
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,783
Excellency, with Central
under lighter guard

200
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,702
while you are here in the east,

201
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,746
the Ishvalan remnants
will carry out terrorist acts there.

202
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,499
Then General Grumman
plans to invade Central

203
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,210
under the excuse
of putting down the terrorists.

204
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,463
And working in concert
with Colonel Mustang,

205
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,756
he will take advantage of the confusion

206
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,383
and take control
of the Central Command Center.

207
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,104
Just as General Hakuro's
intelligence suggests,

208
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,522
for the last few days,

209
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,234
Ishvalans have been moving
into the areas around Central.

210
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,122
I am returning to Central.
You take over here.

211
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,499
Yes, sir.

212
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,133
That miserable Mustang! How outrageous!

213
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,970
And here, after we've defanged him
by stripping him of any usable pawns too!

214
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,485
- We've stopped.
- What's going on?

215
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,825
- Sheep.
- And us, in a hurry.

216
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,253
- Hey, only the engine has started moving.
- What?

217
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,256
What's going on? Hey, stop them!

218
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,360
We've cleared off the sheep
from the tracks.

219
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,196
We're headed to Central as planned.

220
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,367
- Let's go. The colonel is waiting for us!
- Yes!

221
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,077
Damn it!

222
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,208
They played you like a fiddle,
General Hakuro.

223
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,547
The train that His Excellency was in
has been blown up!

224
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,816
Tomorrow, everything goes into motion.
Let's do what we have to.

225
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,319
Lieutenant Breda, Sergeant Fuery.

226
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,572
Knock it off
with that "Lieutenant" business.

227
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,741
Right now, I'm just an ordinary deserter.

228
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,910
Aw, the way ahead is as murky as can be.

229
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,499
Once this is all over,
we'll get the colonel to answer for us.

230
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,514
- The Führer?
- Imagine, King Bradley, dead...!

231
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:14,768
- We still don't know that it's true!
- What's going on with the search?

232
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,562
The troops haven't reached the site yet!

233
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,105
As soon as their head is gone,
they're like this.

234
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,190
- Get them moving!
- Don't yell at me!

235
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,775
Besides, that's not my job!

236
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,111
- What a squawking rabble.
- Yeah, but...

237
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,238
- Is this any time to talk like that?
- Our commander-in-chief is missing!

238
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,949
- We know that!
- This could be my chance to act.

239
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,083
It is an honor to have you come here.

240
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,004
Calm down, everyone.

241
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,596
I am still here, in Central.
