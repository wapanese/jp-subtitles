1
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,982
- Ed!
- Damn you!

2
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,655
Ling!

3
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,159
You bastard!

4
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,495
Kill me...

5
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:08,045
Help me, please... Kill me, please...

6
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,928
- I want to die...
- Mommy...

7
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,014
- Come over here.
- I don't want to be with you.

8
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,069
Don't just stand there, you idiot!

9
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,072
What are you waiting for?

10
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,323
There was someone...

11
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:41,161
There was someone inside him.
They wanted help.

12
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,330
No, there isn't! It was a monster!

13
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,624
But...

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,169
Come to your senses! Those are monsters!

15
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,421
- Kill me!
- How do you like this power?

16
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,341
- Mama!
- Give me back my child!

17
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,551
Shut up! Stop!

18
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,762
- Dad!
- How do you like this power?

19
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,555
- I want to die!
- Help!

20
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,557
- I said stop!
- Big Brother...

21
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,560
Let's play.

22
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,231
Let's play.

23
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,694
I'm done playing around.

24
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,128
Damn it...

25
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,636
- Come over here.
- Help me.

26
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,805
- You can't fathom our pain.
- Let's die together.

27
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,306
Ed! Wake up!

28
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,852
- Open your eyes!
- Come over here with us.

29
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,603
Ed!

30
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,651
Ed!

31
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,116
All right, all right!
Okay, this way! Okay!

32
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,868
Ah, this little thing?

33
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,122
I saw her over by that rundown factory
a little while ago.

34
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,125
She was with this guy in a huge
suit of armor, who was walking by.

35
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,337
Armor? He could be the one from yesterday!

36
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,426
That suit of armor!
He won't get away with this!

37
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,678
How could he kidnap Shao May?

38
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,805
That ogre! That devil! That loincloth!

39
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,566
- There she is! Shao M--
- Wait.

40
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,070
The fat one...

41
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,449
I remember them calling him a Homunculus.

42
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,075
Homunculus?

43
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,537
They possess a regenerative power
that makes them near immortal.

44
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,999
- We can't take him on too carelessly.
- Immortal?

45
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,460
I couldn't ask for anything more.
Let's go after him!

46
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,963
I told you,
he won't be easy to bring down.

47
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,847
<i>What are those two doing together?</i>

48
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,189
What's wrong?

49
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,566
This place is strange.

50
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,528
Something has felt out of place
ever since I entered this country,

51
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,030
but this...

52
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:28,495
There are a lot of things
crawling around under our feet.

53
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,966
What's the matter? Are you cold?

54
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,093
Are you okay?

55
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,514
This way.

56
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,862
To think there's someplace
like this under Central...

57
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,582
What is this?

58
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,296
- That is the work of the gatekeepers.
- Gatekeepers?

59
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,382
They won't kill you if you're with me.

60
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,015
There's something there...

61
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,439
- Is it still farther ahead?
- Still farther ahead.

62
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,774
You said he's your Father, right?

63
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,193
He will know where the people
you swallowed went, right?

64
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,447
Father knows everything.

65
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,700
Brother...

66
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,996
You're still alive, right, Brother?

67
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,391
What's that?

68
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,104
A red stone?

69
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,815
That's right.

70
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,611
Envy has a Philosopher's Stone
for his core.

71
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:31,201
For all the searching I've done,
there's one, right here.

72
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,008
Let me out, Envy! It stinks in here!

73
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,011
We might be able to get out of here!

74
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,890
Work with me, Envy!

75
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,120
What on earth are these?

76
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,622
They're called Chimeras.

77
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,317
There's no end to them.

78
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,445
No way.

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,742
There really is something underneath us.

80
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,703
- Chimeras?
- No.

81
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,665
Are these people?

82
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,878
Father made all of us.

83
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,089
Me, and Lust, and Envy...

84
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,438
There is a disturbance.

85
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,941
Somebody is coming.

86
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,074
<i>I do not remember my parents' faces,
</i><i>their names...</i>

87
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,868
<i>I don't even remember my own name.</i>

88
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,912
<i>I don't know if,
</i><i>before I was given this name,</i>

89
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>I was abandoned, or sold.</i>

90
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,797
Who will be the one to take charge
of this country?

91
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,174
Will it be you?

92
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,678
<i>"Prospective FÃ¼hrers."
</i><i>That's what they called us.</i>

93
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,431
<i>They gathered us all to one place,</i>

94
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,683
<i>where we were given education
</i><i>in various matters.</i>

95
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,562
<i>From kingcraft and humanics</i>

96
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,067
<i>to hand-to-hand combat,
</i><i>marksmanship and swordsmanship.</i>

97
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,168
Don't worry about it.

98
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,797
He was just a pawn
to allow you to reach your goal.

99
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,051
<i>I would be the person
</i><i>who would run this country.</i>

100
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,305
<i>That's what I believed,
</i><i>and I endured all training.</i>

101
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>This one was no good either.</i>

102
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,359
Next.

103
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,824
Lie down there.

104
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,621
What is this?

105
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,126
Just make yourself comfortable.
It will be over soon.

106
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,464
What are you planning to do?
Those bodies...

107
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,013
You are the twelfth one.

108
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:26,269
Will you be the one who accepts my wrath?

109
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,066
<i>A Philosopher's Stone
</i><i>is a high-energy body</i>

110
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,571
<i>that includes the souls of many people.</i>

111
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,616
<i>When placed in a human body,
</i><i>it is met with rejection,</i>

112
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,118
<i>as it attempts to take over that body.</i>

113
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,539
<i>This was repeated until,</i>

114
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,126
<i>as a result of the destruction
</i><i>and mending caused by the Stone,</i>

115
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,297
<i>the original body either died,
</i><i>or it overcame the Philosopher's Stone.</i>

116
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,175
<i>Eventually...</i>

117
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,553
- Outstanding!
- It is a new type of man!

118
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,721
Congratulations!

119
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,184
You have been chosen as the leader
who will guide this country.

120
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,228
He will prepare everything
that you need.

121
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,649
As of today, your name will be...

122
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,984
King Bradley.

123
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:23,034
All that remained was a single soul,
and the feeling of wrath.

124
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,997
Was the soul made someone else's
by the Philosopher's Stone,

125
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,125
or was it the one I originally had?

126
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,211
I no longer know.

127
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,218
If you were originally human

128
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:46,057
can't you live as a human, and not
as a Homunculus, Your Excellency?

129
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,771
Go back to being human? Impossible.

130
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,066
This body transcends a human one.

131
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,069
It is a far superior form.

132
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,074
Just as you humans are proud
of being human,

133
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,078
we have our pride as Homunculi.

134
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,959
That woman died with pride, didn't she?

135
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,380
- Ouch!
- A little first aid.

136
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,007
Thanks.

137
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,594
I've collected everything
there was in the area.

138
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,598
Is all of this from Xerxes?

139
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:32,895
Yeah. It's a part of the mural
from the temple that was in the ruins.

140
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>When I first saw that mural,</i>

141
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,153
<i>I thought it was the same one I saw
</i><i>in the basement of the Fifth Laboratory,</i>

142
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,905
<i>the transmutation circle used
</i><i>for Philosopher's Stones.</i>

143
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,615
But it's different.

144
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,870
The sun represents the soul,
and the moon represents the mind.

145
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,290
Then there's the stone
depicted on the mural.

146
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,875
This represents the body.

147
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,171
Hey, now, keep it simple,
so that I can understand it.

148
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,798
In other words,
what was depicted over there

149
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,134
was a human transmutation circle.

150
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,511
Human transmutation?

151
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,889
You mean, the kind for bringing people
back to life.

152
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,890
No.

153
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>The basis of alchemy
</i><i>is equivalent exchange.</i>

154
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,771
<i>You cannot create something
</i><i>by transmuting a soul</i>

155
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,898
<i>that does not exist in this world.</i>

156
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,900
<i>I've made sure of that.</i>

157
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,155
So, I got this sudden inspiration
as to how to get out of here.

158
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:29,535
What if I were to re-transmute myself,
a living person?

159
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,039
- Re-transmute?
- Yeah.

160
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,501
Using this transmutation circle,
I'll decompose myself,

161
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,045
then reconstruct myself
the way I was before.

162
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,048
That's human transmutation too.
I'm sure it will open the doorway.

163
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,302
If Gluttony is a false Doorway of Truth,

164
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,137
then if we pass through the right doorway,

165
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,807
I'll bet we come out in the right space.

166
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,312
I'll open the doorway,
and you two will jump through it.

167
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,608
- What happens if it doesn't work?
- A rebound.

168
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,319
The failed technique bounces back
onto the alchemist that performed it.

169
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,406
In this case, me.

170
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,326
I'm a complete outsider
when it comes to alchemy.

171
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,620
- It's up to you.
- All right.

172
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,707
Oh, Envy,
there's something I wanted to ask you.

173
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:25,716
The large mural I saw in Xerxes
was more or less like this.

174
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,011
What bothers me is this symbol.

175
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,140
The writing that represents God
is upside-down.

176
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:37,687
Then there's the two-headed dragon.
This indicates a "perfect being."

177
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,649
In other words, this says
"I will strike God down to earth,

178
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,402
and become the perfect being."

179
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,238
Quite a brazen thing to think.

180
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,657
If all they were doing was thinking it,
that's one thing.

181
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,658
The problem is...

182
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,203
this missing part here.

183
00:15:55,121 --> 00:16:00,334
The image of the lion swallowing the sun.
That indicates the Philosopher's Stone.

184
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,795
The ingredients
for the Philosopher's Stone

185
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,464
are live humans.

186
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,592
- Isn't that right, Envy?
- Yeah, that's right.

187
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,512
<i>How did a country as prosperous as Xerxes
</i><i>fall overnight?</i>

188
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,222
<i>Where did its people go?</i>

189
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,313
<i>The reason part of the ruins are in here
</i><i>was to get rid of the evidence, wasn't it?</i>

190
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,232
You guys

191
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,987
turned the population of Xerxes
into a Philosopher's Stone, huh?

192
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,713
Who did it?
Who was the one who transmuted them?

193
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,257
Who turned an entire population
into a Philosopher's Stone,

194
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,468
and after gaining such mighty power,

195
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,554
tried to become something
even greater than God?

196
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,806
Is it the "Father" that you speak of?

197
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,769
He's using you Homunculi to try
to recreate the same destruction

198
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,857
that befell Xerxes in this country too,
isn't he?

199
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,568
If we get out of here, I'll tell you.

200
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:14,700
Enough beating around the bush,
Fullmetal Alchemist.

201
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:19,872
In order to open the doorway,
you require a "toll," right?

202
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,834
Use this.

203
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,713
- Help me!
- Kill me!

204
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,340
- Don't look!
- Give me your body!

205
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,344
These are all people from Xerxes,
aren't they?

206
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,723
They are beings whose bodies and minds
crumbled away long ago,

207
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,351
and who now exist only
as energy to be consumed.

208
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,355
They don't even remember
what their original forms were.

209
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,858
Pity? What a worthless emotion.

210
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,403
You want to believe
that they are human,

211
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,363
because you want to recognize
your brother,

212
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,490
who is in a similar situation,
as being human.

213
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,368
Would you hesitate
to feed coal into a fire,

214
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,247
because you felt sorry for the tree
that perished long ago?

215
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,251
These people can never go back
to being human.

216
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:11,257
Use logic, not emotion,
to delineate what a human is, alchemist.

217
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,556
All right.

218
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,893
Ling, if anything happens to me,

219
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,771
tell those on the outside
what this group is scheming.

220
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,901
Whatever happens to Amestris
is none of my concern.

221
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:31,861
Look, you!

222
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,116
There are people you love
waiting for you in this nation, right?

223
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,578
Get out of here alive,
and tell them yourself.

224
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,087
I'm sorry. I will use you with care.

225
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,967
Here goes!

226
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,015
<i>That pose when he puts
</i><i>his hands together...</i>

227
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,476
<i>I thought it looked familiar.</i>

228
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>It's almost as if he's praying to God,
</i><i>isn't it?</i>

229
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,533
Long time no see, huh?

230
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,537
To think that I would be
opening you up again like this...

231
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,539
Ling! Jump in!

232
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,544
I'm trusting in you, alchemist!

233
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,425
It's just like when I was swallowed
by Gluttony!

234
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,936
Thank you.

235
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,147
Thank you...

236
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,622
<i>Body and soul are connected by the mind.</i>

237
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:11,377
<i>Part of my body
</i><i>is before the Doorway of Truth.</i>

238
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,381
<i>I leave everything
</i><i>to wherever my mind leads,</i>

239
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,799
<i>and go into the doorway.</i>

240
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:23,139
Huh?
You're not here to get your body back?

241
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:28,477
- Your Father is inside here, right?
- Yes, he is.

242
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,231
There's a lead to finding Brother
in here...

243
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,831
All right, I'm here.

244
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,839
Why are there two doorways?

245
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,158
Al!

246
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,369
Al! Come here!

247
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,872
Hurry, over here! Al!

248
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,626
- Al!
- I can't.

249
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,379
You aren't my soul.

250
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,632
I can't go with you.

251
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:05,991
Alphonse!

252
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,829
Alphonse!

253
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,664
Alphonse!

254
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,667
Someday, I swear, I'll come back for you!

255
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,669
Just you wait!

256
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,632
Just you wait!
