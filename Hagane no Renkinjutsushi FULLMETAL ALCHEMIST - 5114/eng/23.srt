1
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,400
Smoke bomb and a grenade.

2
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,196
Such a reckless child.
Can you follow their scent?

3
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,915
Officer...

4
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,420
Please take her someplace safe.

5
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:13,425
Winry, Al is still fighting,
so I have to go.

6
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,221
I'm sorry. I'll tell you everything
once we get back.

7
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,363
<i>Why is waiting the only thing I can do?</i>

8
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>We have a girl in custody
</i><i>on Saint Louis Street in Sector eight.</i>

9
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,745
<i>She appears to be a friend
</i><i>of the Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

10
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,205
<i>Escort her to the Central Command Center.</i>

11
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>Repeat, Saint Louis Street, Sector eight.
</i><i>We have a girl in custody.</i>

12
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,586
<i>- She appears to be a friend...
- It's just about time.</i>

13
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,338
<i>Escort her to the Central Command Center.</i>

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,256
- Go back them up.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,971
There's a vacant house
outside of town we can use.

16
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,056
We'll meet up here.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,433
- Don't let anyone follow you.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,396
If anything develops, I will contact you.

19
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,605
Yeah.

20
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,321
- And do not go out into the field, sir.
- I know.

21
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,871
He's relentless!

22
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,128
There are fewer people this way.

23
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,756
Are we pinned in?

24
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,346
Scar, huh?

25
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,853
You dispose of him.
I'll finish things here.

26
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,863
- My left arm...
- What's wrong?

27
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,868
Young Lord,
I am no longer of any use to you.

28
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,202
What are you talking about?

29
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,541
If you keep concerning yourself with me,
Young Lord, then you will fall as well.

30
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,419
There is no king without his people.

31
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,631
But without their king,
the people will have nowhere to go.

32
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:21,219
Young Lord, you must live,
for the sake of our clan.

33
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,471
I'm not leaving you.

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,933
There are any number of things
that can be left behind,

35
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,477
for the greater good.

36
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,065
Lan Fan! What do you think
you're doing? Stop!

37
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,083
You're hollow inside that armor, right?

38
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,837
You poor boy. You have the ill fortune
of being put in that body,

39
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,340
and you still place faith in alchemy?

40
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,225
There are a lot of things
that are inconvenient about this body.

41
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,436
But inconvenient
does not equal ill-fortuned!

42
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,647
There's no reason
for anyone to take pity on me!

43
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,401
Brother saved my life with alchemy.

44
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:24,282
To disavow who I am now
would be to disavow Brother, and alchemy.

45
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:29,663
I believe in the possibilities of alchemy.
I want to believe!

46
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,206
Is that right?

47
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,886
- Brother! Where's Winry?
- She's all right.

48
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:52,519
- I'm pathetic. I made her cry again.
- Brother, you're always so thoughtless!

49
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,401
- She saw you engaged in bloody combat.
- Yeah.

50
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,280
Now then, let's get back to the fight.

51
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,283
I found you!

52
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,288
Ishvalan!

53
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,207
- You're...
- That tattoo!

54
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,292
A Homunculus!

55
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,783
Ling?

56
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,080
Run!

57
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,143
- Sturdy wire!
- Right!

58
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,650
Your overactive regenerative ability
is working against you, huh?

59
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,818
Your own flesh,
swelling out from the inside,

60
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,154
is what's holding you tight.

61
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,409
I've caught you, Homunculus!

62
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,797
Nicely played.

63
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,187
I've outwitted you, you monster!

64
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,899
What? A Homunculus?

65
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,743
Put him in! We're getting out of here!

66
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,175
- Hold on, Hawk--
- Shh!

67
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,889
- Just a minute--
- Al!

68
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,145
The MPs are watching.
Pretend we don't know her!

69
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,731
- They're getting away! Catch Scar!
- Yes, sir!

70
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,693
The colonel may be a creep,
but we can trust him.

71
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,028
Right now, we should be...

72
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,790
We're going to catch Scar, Al!

73
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,336
For killing the Rockbells,
and all the other stuff!

74
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,547
You're going to answer for your crimes--

75
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,601
Are you all right, servant?

76
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,480
What are you doing to the manservant
of Mr. Yoki, who saved my life?

77
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,856
You beansprout boy!

78
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,983
What did you call me, you beansprout girl?

79
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,569
Who is that child?

80
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,988
Little girl, move away!
It's dangerous there!

81
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,035
We're outnumbered. It's time to retreat.

82
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:59,808
- What kind of alchemy was that?
- She transmuted from a distance?

83
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,434
This way.

84
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,814
Damn, I can't see!

85
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,149
Scar!

86
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:17,659
I've heard about you, Ling Yao.
We're on our way straight to a safe house.

87
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,703
Wait! I have a friend. Pick her up!

88
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,081
We can't. We don't have time!

89
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:28,253
Please! She's about to die!
She's waiting for me to come get her!

90
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,339
Make it quick!

91
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,771
<i>I'm sure that woman is Mustang's.</i>

92
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>Now you've done it, you young punk.</i>

93
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>Was that the look in my eyes too?</i>

94
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,799
<i>No matter how far I go,
</i><i>hatred only leads to more hatred.</i>

95
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:23,391
- I think I've stopped the bleeding.
- Thanks.

96
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,398
Sir! The MPs are getting close!
We should get out of here!

97
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,277
He's injured.
He can't have gotten too far away yet!

98
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,404
Comb the area for him!

99
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,489
Sir! Quickly! Quickly!

100
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,284
Shao May, we're getting...

101
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,203
Huh?

102
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,206
I found her.

103
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,546
Look, you! Why did you pick
that thing up during this crisis?

104
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,799
But she was all alone
in all that confusion!

105
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,761
You're always, always
picking up stray cats

106
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,555
and secretly keeping them
inside your body! Get rid of it!

107
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,223
Brother, you're inhuman!

108
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,393
Look how gentle she is.

109
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,732
It's all right. Take it easy.

110
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,331
- This way, please.
- Thanks.

111
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,668
You stay in here.

112
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,260
Winry!

113
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,517
Hey there, Fullmetal Alchemist.

114
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,020
- Fç«¯hrer Bradley...
- Why are you...?

115
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,150
I heard that your childhood friend
was in our protection.

116
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,195
She's the friend
of one of our most important personnel.

117
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,198
We have to be sure
to treat her courteously.

118
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:10,456
- Well then, miss, if you'll excuse me...
- Sure. Thank you.

119
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,297
She's a good, honest girl.
Take good care of her.

120
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,474
Ed.

121
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:35,231
You promised. Tell me everything
about Mom and Dad.

122
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,497
<i>I see, they did all they could for others,
</i><i>right up to the end.</i>

123
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,547
<i>Still, I do wish they would have
</i><i>come back home alive.</i>

124
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,887
<i>All I can do is wait.</i>

125
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:25,823
Perfect timing. Miss Rockbell,
there is a telephone call for you.

126
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,908
For me?

127
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,412
Hello?

128
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,289
Mr. Garfiel!

129
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:39,295
Sorry about this, Winry.
I tried to get by on my own...

130
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,672
Isn't Winry back yet?

131
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,008
Look at this.
Winry's the only one who can fix this.

132
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,303
...but all of your customers are so fussy!

133
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:52,433
<i>- Hurry back home, Winry!
</i><i>- Miss Winry?</i>

134
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,851
Tetsu?

135
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,605
Miss, come back soon.
My leg comes away in better shape

136
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,067
when you work on it,
compared to when Mr. Garfiel does.

137
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,820
Winry, please hurry up
and make an outer covering

138
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,239
for that leg you made a model of for me.

139
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,574
- And get to my arm, too.
- No way, I was first!

140
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:13,079
<i>- I sure miss you!
</i><i>- You dumbass, Winry belongs to all of us!</i>

141
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:18,084
<i>- That's the truth!
- Sorry. I'll be right there.</i>

142
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,215
Just wait there. I'll do my best.
I'll do my best.

143
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,634
Thanks.

144
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,105
Thanks for stopping me back there.

145
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,235
I have people who are waiting for me.

146
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,405
I was this close
to not being able to face them again.

147
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,159
Winry...

148
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,913
Ed, don't forget to take care
of your automail.

149
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,206
Right.

150
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,750
I'll send you
some good polishing oil soon, Al.

151
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,174
- Don't go dying, okay?
- Yeah.

152
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,552
The next time...

153
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,933
What? I can't hear you.

154
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,523
Brother? Wait! Bye, Winry!

155
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,529
Geez. Hey, Ed! What did you say?

156
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,703
The next time I make you cry,
they'll be tears of joy!

157
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,332
I'll make sure that Al and I
are both back to normal,

158
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,085
and make you cry with happiness!
Don't you forget it!

159
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,145
Give me an arm and a leg. One year!

160
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,815
There's no turning back for us now, huh?

161
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,738
<i>What are you crying for?</i>

162
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,135
<i>So that's it. I've...</i>

163
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,721
<i>been falling for him.</i>

164
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,856
- Colonel...
- Get in.

165
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,493
I've got a badly injured person.
I need a doctor.

166
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,247
Gone out on another limb, huh?
You little punk.

167
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:07,253
I know you have a family.
If this is a problem, you can decline.

168
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,756
Wait here. I'll get my instruments.

169
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,800
You're sure?

170
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:18,764
My wife and I broke up
soon after I got back from Ishval.

171
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,687
She walked through the sewers
with her arm cut off?

172
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't blame me if she gets lockjaw.

173
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,320
I haven't dealt with anything
but corpses lately,

174
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,113
so my touch may be a little rough.

175
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,247
- I'm sorry...
- Don't misunderstand.

176
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,501
I'm the one who propositioned you.

177
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,671
It was in both our interests,
so I worked together with you, that's all.

178
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,382
I left the country knowing
that if I was going to seek immortality,

179
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,260
I would have to be ready
to make certain sacrifices.

180
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,309
No, I wasn't prepared for this.

181
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,065
Lan Fan was more ready than I was.

182
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,283
- Are you all right?
- Is there anything we can do?

183
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,789
Your trap wasn't all that bad.

184
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,296
But I'm useless now.
I need a replacement arm.

185
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,552
Yeah! I can set you up
with a great automail mechanic!

186
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,064
State Military Colonel Roy Mustang.

187
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,195
Ling Yao,
twelfth son of the Emperor of Xing.

188
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,614
I'm grateful to you
for providing a doctor.

189
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,660
Not at all. Thank you for helping out
with the Maria Ross incident.

190
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,996
As well as this one.

191
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,336
Hey, what is that?

192
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,215
A Homunculus, named "Gluttony."

193
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,471
Apparently, these guys have connections
to a portion of the military senior staff.

194
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,975
Just a portion? Far from it.

195
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,647
There's a possibility
that King Bradley is a Homunculus, too.

196
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:38,320
There was an Uroboros tattoo
on the eye under his patch!

197
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,781
He came after us, together with Gluttony!

198
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,408
It can't be!

199
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,785
The head of our country is a Homunculus?

200
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,287
Then again...

201
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,126
Bradley doesn't have the same sort
of inhuman presence as Gluttony.

202
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,295
His is the same presence
as a regular person.

203
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,758
But then... For one thing,
if the Fç«¯hrer is a Homunculus,

204
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,718
how is it that he has a son?

205
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,929
It said in that book that Homunculi
had no reproductive abilities.

206
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:10,478
No, his son Selim was adopted.
He is not the Fç«¯hrer's blood offspring.

207
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,277
Whether monster or human, either way,

208
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,322
this makes it easier for me
to drag the Fç«¯hrer out of his seat.

209
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,825
First, we get some information
out of this one.

210
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,079
I'll take his Philosopher's Stone, too.
It may be useful in treating my man.

211
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,333
Hey, now, Lan Fan lost her arm
to obtain him.

212
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,628
He's a lead to gaining immortality!
We're taking him back to Xing!

213
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,838
- Just a minute!
- We've been looking for a way

214
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,257
to get our original bodies
back for a long time, ourselves!

215
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,218
There's no way
I'm letting you run away with him!

216
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,012
That's right, Ling!
You are an illegal alien!

217
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,847
I can't keep up with all of this anymore.

218
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,724
Think you can move
around the country with Gluttony...

219
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,518
- I'm going back home.
- ...without some help from us?

220
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,520
Mustang...

221
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,651
Colonel Mustang killed Lust.
Colonel Mustang killed Lust.

222
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,245
Roy Mustang!

223
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,591
What?
