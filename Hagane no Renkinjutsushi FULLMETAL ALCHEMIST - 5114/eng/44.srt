1
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,722
Long time no see, Al.

2
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:44,730
I heard from Pinako
about your body and whatnot.

3
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,741
Ah, here he is.

4
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,703
Mr. Ho, could you give us a hand
for a bit?

5
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,206
Sure. Well, we'll catch up later.

6
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:16,386
The radio that you guys fixed
has been working fine ever since.

7
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,890
It's not even picking up static now.

8
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,020
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,731
It's all because we stuck our noses into
Cornello's business that everything...

10
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,815
Don't worry about it.

11
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,735
It's because you revealed
his underhandedness

12
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,362
that the town has regained its senses.

13
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,864
Sure, we had some violence and stuff,
but look at us now.

14
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,948
Sounds good, doesn't it?

15
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:46,458
The whole town is involved
in our reconstruction.

16
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,586
With all of our hard feelings left behind.

17
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,468
I'll be back in a while too.
Rose, can you take care of Winry?

18
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,390
Well, why don't we help too?

19
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,810
- Let's go, Yoki.
- What about supper?

20
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,480
It will taste better
if we work before we eat, right?

21
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,692
- Come on, you.
- Hey, let me go! Oh, the food!

22
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,155
That was your son back there?

23
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,949
Oh, dear,
maybe we shouldn't have called you.

24
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,160
You've been apart a long time, right?
Are you sure you should leave him alone?

25
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,164
Oh, I left home many years ago so...

26
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,167
He probably doesn't trust me
as his father,

27
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,711
and I have no idea
what to talk to him about.

28
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,046
Dad!

29
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,178
Well... I'll work too.

30
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,016
I'll carry that.

31
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,647
Here.

32
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,533
- Miss Winry, how is the water?
- Terrific!

33
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,538
I can't remember
the last time I had a bath.

34
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,082
I'll leave a change of clothes
here for you, okay?

35
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,292
Thank you very much.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,630
Miss Rose is such a nice person.

37
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,469
I have to say, it's great
how you're an automail artisan

38
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,221
and so independent, as young as you are.

39
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,931
Are you the one who made Ed's leg?

40
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,935
Yeah. I guess you could say
it was out of our childhood friendship.

41
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:34,649
That's amazing. So you're the one
who made the leg that Ed stands on.

42
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,736
Then in a roundabout way,
you got me to stand up again.

43
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,489
So, Miss Winry, I am in your debt as well.

44
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,162
I believed in a miracle cure

45
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,956
that was supposed to bring
my dead boyfriend back to life,

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,501
and fell into Letoism.

47
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,421
It was then that Ed and Al
came to this town,

48
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,423
and exposed the priest's trickery.

49
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,803
Everything I had clung to up to then
vanished, and I lost hope.

50
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,387
Then Ed got angry at me.

51
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:13,063
He told me to stand up
and walk on my own legs.

52
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm sorry! He's always like that.
I wonder why he can't be a little nicer.

53
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:26,326
He was being nice. That was Ed's kindness.

54
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,702
You understand it too, right?

55
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,294
Because of him, our eyes were opened.
Both mine, and the whole town's.

56
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,842
We're all trying to get back
on our feet on our own,

57
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,636
without relying on miracles.

58
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,430
And it's because of Ed and Al.

59
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,143
<i>Ed...</i>

60
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,441
Tagging along with the military guys
is one thing,

61
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,027
but it looks like I've found
a hell of a place to get lost in.

62
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,572
Mr. Greed...

63
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:33,268
Ethics is something that varies over time
and among individuals.

64
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,354
That is not where the reason lies.

65
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,231
It is to prevent the individual

66
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,234
from possessing
a powerful military force, General.

67
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,405
They aren't people.

68
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,365
- Are they dummies?
- That's right.

69
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,410
Receptacles shaped like people

70
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,121
to which souls are bonded
and soldiers created.

71
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,626
The greatest of soldiers
who will fight as we command them to.

72
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,961
An immortal legion, as it were.

73
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,716
- May I ask you a question?
- What is it?

74
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,094
Where do you procure the souls
that are to be bonded to them?

75
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,221
From those whose lands
we have ravaged or will ravage?

76
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:16,728
The battlefield is a hunting ground

77
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:22,484
from which we obtain
large numbers of souls.

78
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,950
Central is scary, awful, and appalling!

79
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,036
There's no way Mr. Greed
would be in a place like this.

80
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,961
An underground tunnel?

81
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,965
I want to check to see
if it runs under this town.

82
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,968
If it doesn't... No, I'm sure it does.
I'm going to--

83
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,637
Hold on a minute.
Let's go someplace where we won't be seen.

84
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,600
You're saying you came to Liore

85
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,144
to prevent the countrywide
transmutation circle from activating?

86
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,898
And when I saw you here, Dad,
I was surprised.

87
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,150
But at the same time, I feel lucky.

88
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,404
We saw someone who looked
just like you, Dad,

89
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,488
underground in Central.

90
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,117
I doubt you two have nothing to do
with each other.

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,286
I'll bet you know who he is. Don't you?

92
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,997
Are you sure you want to know, Alphonse?

93
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,043
What if I'm someone on their side?

94
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,338
As gabby as you're being,

95
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,883
it didn't occur to you
that I might leak it all to them?

96
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,439
Thanks for trusting me. I'm quite glad.

97
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,946
<i>Even this boy can see me as his father,
</i><i>and trust me.</i>

98
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,824
<i>Now then,</i>

99
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,287
<i>I suppose I should also trust my sons
</i><i>and tell them everything.</i>

100
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,707
This is going to take a long time
to explain.

101
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,335
I'd like to have Edward here
to hear it too.

102
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,422
Actually, Brother...

103
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,134
has gone missing.

104
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,312
Next, please.

105
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,525
I would like to withdraw some funds

106
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,279
from State Alchemist Edward Elric's
research expense account.

107
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,200
- And are you he?
- I am his representative.

108
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,285
I have a letter of attorney
and his signature.

109
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,289
Thank you very much.

110
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,545
This is Banks Bank, northern branch.

111
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,047
We have just had a cash withdrawal

112
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,924
from State Alchemist
Edward Elric's account.

113
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,425
The man claims to be his representative.

114
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,431
<i>Yes, I would describe him
</i><i>as a large, brawny man...</i>

115
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,142
Here, this is for his medical expenses.

116
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,565
All right. I accept payment.

117
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,568
Oh, my, what a rip-off artist.

118
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,695
What are you talking about?

119
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,697
When you factor in the hush money,
it's reasonable.

120
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,534
Well, I guess it does help

121
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,661
that you're not asking
any questions about us.

122
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,745
Darius!

123
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,793
They're onto us, huh?

124
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,843
Yes, coming!
Ah, soldier, are you not feeling well?

125
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,219
We're looking for someone.

126
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,807
You just have the one patient?
Have you admitted anyone else?

127
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,725
There's one more inside--

128
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,944
- Are you the only patient here?
- Yes, that's right.

129
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,445
Do you need something?

130
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,448
You're the man who was at the bank,
aren't you?

131
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,201
Don't move!

132
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,791
Halt! Are you with this clinic?

133
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,127
Slowly bring your hands out
from under your covers!

134
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,424
Have you seen a stranger
enter or leave the clinic recently?

135
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,428
He's described as...

136
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,264
Well? Put your hands up!

137
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,935
...wearing a red coat, having blond,
braided hair, and being short.

138
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,273
What's going on?

139
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:36,070
- Harris! Snap to!
- Who got you? Hey, Harris--

140
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,458
Cohen! Harris!
What happened? Answer me!

141
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,934
You took them all by yourself.

142
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,730
Don't overexert yourself.
You still haven't recovered, have you?

143
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,066
Don't treat me like I'm an invalid.

144
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,947
I'm up and revving at full throttle now!

145
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,786
<i>Thanks for everything, Doc.</i>

146
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,039
Never mind the thanks.
Just hurry up and go.

147
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,625
We can't afford any more trouble.

148
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>They're searching for a red coat
</i><i>and the braid, huh?</i>

149
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,385
<i>Looks like I'll be better off
</i><i>in this getup for a while.</i>

150
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,388
Freeze! Drop your weapons!

151
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,223
Fresh troops, huh?

152
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,351
Place your hands over your heads!
Do it now!

153
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,895
You there, it's too dangerous there!
Get away from them!

154
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,695
- Don't you move!
- You want us to blow this kid's head off?

155
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,334
- I'll get us some wheels!
- Okay!

156
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,843
Mr. Gorilla, they're after us!

157
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,179
- Don't call me a gorilla!
- They're catching up!

158
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,974
They're from the northern forces!
We'll never outrun them on snowy roads!

159
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,607
- That was close.
- Hey, how's it look behind us?

160
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,029
- It's no use! They're gonna catch us!
- Damn it!

161
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,989
Turn right here! Cut through there!

162
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,824
- What?
- Just do it!

163
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,326
I don't know what you're up to--

164
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,329
Once we're in there,
turn us around, quick!

165
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,416
Don't let them get away!

166
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,926
Where did they go?

167
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,013
I bet they turned at that corner!

168
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,147
We managed to give them the slip.

169
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,692
Hey, next time, transmute us
into something a little more plain.

170
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,695
What do you mean?
This looks cool as hell, doesn't it?

171
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,531
Just change it, okay? Please, change it.

172
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,369
What, you've got a problem
with my sense of style?

173
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,870
- It's too much!
- It's too much!

174
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,754
- Once again, we've got no place to go.
- Yeah.

175
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>I've gotten held up something awful,</i>

176
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,552
<i>all because I dropped my guard
</i><i>around that Kimblee bastard.</i>

177
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,431
<i>I wonder if Al was able
</i><i>to safely rendezvous</i>

178
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,808
<i>with Winry and the others.</i>

179
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,560
Hey, Fullmetal, are you listening?

180
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,189
What do we do now?

181
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,318
Right now, I need some information,
no matter what it is.

182
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,278
I have to get together
with Al and the others.

183
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,324
- So, where are they?
- Where should we go to meet up with them?

184
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:17,041
<i>If I were Al, where would I go?
</i><i>Think... Think...</i>

185
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,174
Are you listening?

186
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:33,724
So, Dad, you were a slave
and you're a Philosopher's Stone?

187
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,101
Right.

188
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:42,650
You really don't believe me, huh?
Well, I can understand that.

189
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,777
If someone was told
my story out of the blue

190
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,405
and they bought it,
they'd have to be touched in the head.

191
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,036
If so, I guess I must be
touched in the head.

192
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,500
- You accept it? That was fast.
- To tell you the truth, I'm stunned too.

193
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,964
Then again, maybe it's because
I'm in this body and all.

194
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,264
Say, what does it feel like to never die?

195
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,057
How does it feel?

196
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,269
There's a lot about this body
that comes in handy.

197
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,608
But I hate how those dear to me
always die ahead of me.

198
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,444
Like Mom...

199
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:37,538
Say, Dad, if you're a Philosopher's Stone,
then you don't have a regular body, right?

200
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,540
So then, does that mean that we're...

201
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,418
Not exactly regular people?

202
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,256
It's all right.

203
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,177
The Philosopher's Stone
may be fused to my soul,

204
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,014
but ultimately, at my core,
I'm still the person that I am.

205
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,435
However, that guy in Central...

206
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,981
He's like a guy in a leather bag,
patterned after me.

207
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,901
- Leather bag?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:11,155
So, if we can destroy that leather bag,
we should be able to defeat him.

209
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:15,117
Defeat him... Oh, yeah!

210
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,996
They're about to use this country

211
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,457
to recreate what happened in Xerxes,
aren't they?

212
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,961
We have to stop them right away
or it will be disastrous!

213
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,465
Not bad. You've already figured
this much out, have you?

214
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,468
This is a
reverse transmutation circle, huh?

215
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,556
The quickest way is to destroy
the underground tunnel.

216
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,475
- It goes under here, so that's why--
- No, don't.

217
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,020
There's a real monster
of a Homunculus named Pride

218
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,480
lying in wait underground.

219
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,984
But if we don't act soon,
their transmutation circle will be...

220
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:53,489
- It could already be completed.
- Then that's all the more reason.

221
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:59,245
- It's not yet That Day.
- That Day?

222
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,584
Alphonse, don't just look downward.
Look up as well.

223
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,379
Do so, and something will come into sight.

224
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:13,384
Up? The sky? The Sun God Leto?

225
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,722
He is awaiting the "Coming Day."

226
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,855
What? What did I do?

227
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,578
Good. I love it when they're energetic.

228
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:46,751
Standing guard underground is so dull.
Folks like you are more than welcome.

229
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,756
The Ultimate Shield?

230
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,634
Not to mention that speech pattern
and way of laughing...

231
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,511
Damn it. Imitate Mr. Greed, will you?

232
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,223
That's right. I am Greed.
I'm impressed you knew that.

233
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,101
The Avaricious?

234
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,605
That's right.
Everything in the world is mine.

235
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,108
I want money, I want women,
I want status, and glory--

236
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,611
And everything else the world has!

237
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,325
- It can't be. But then again...
- Who are you?

238
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:26,415
Mr. Greed? Is it you?
How is it that you look like that?

239
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,626
I asked you, who are you?

240
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:34,465
It's me! Bido from Dublith!
Have you forgotten your friend's face?

241
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,594
Dublith? Oh, I see, I see.

242
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,429
You remember me?

243
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,309
Sorry.
That was probably the previous Greed.

244
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:50,523
- You mean...
- I don't know you.

245
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:55,653
Mr. Greed... we're friends...

246
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:03,661
My job is to eliminate intruders.
I'm sorry. I really am.

247
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,789
What?

248
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,470
Hey, hey, hey!

249
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,474
You really have sunk to a new low, Greed.

250
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,479
What's the idea,
killing one of your own friends?

251
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,357
He wasn't my... friend...

252
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,280
Then what are these memories?

253
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,407
Are you telling me
that what that Bido guy said

254
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,867
was cooked up too?

255
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,537
Those are the last Greed's memories!
Not mine!

256
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,789
Then why are you suffering so much?

257
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,961
Get a hold of yourself.

258
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,923
Steady on your feet, or my soul
is going to take my body back again.

259
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:03,804
The last Greed's soul
had his memories wiped clean!

260
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:09,059
- I've forgotten my whole past!
- There's no way you can forget it!

261
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,355
Friends are connected by their souls!

262
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,775
You can't just rinse out something

263
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,068
that has been deeply instilled
into your soul!

264
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,738
Look!

265
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,740
Their souls are crying out, aren't they?

266
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,329
You've cast away your soul family
and abandoned them!

267
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:35,211
Greed, is that what you call the avarice
that has to have everything?

268
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,188
How about this one?

269
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,692
I read it when I was just about your age.

270
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,195
It's the story of an adventurer
who travels the world.

271
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:28,949
What is it?

272
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,460
Who is it?
