00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,921
<i>Alchemy is the science
</i><i>of understanding, decomposing,</i>

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,423
<i>and reconstructing matter.</i>

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>However, it is not an all-powerful art.</i>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>It is impossible to create something
</i><i>out of nothing.</i>

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>If one wishes to obtain something,
</i><i>something of equal value must be paid.</i>

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>This equivalent exchange
</i><i>is the basis of alchemy.</i>

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:27,110
<i>Alchemists have a taboo,
</i><i>and it is human transmutation.</i>

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>It is that which no one must commit.</i>

9
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,300
FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST

10
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:06,001
<i>God's children,
</i><i>who live upon this land, pray in faith</i>

11
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,545
<i>and ye shall be saved.</i>

12
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,882
<i>- The Sun God Leto illuminates footsteps.
- You guys street performers or something?</i>

13
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,595
Where do you get the idea
we're street performers?

14
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,598
- You're not, then?
- Thanks for lunch.

15
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:24,061
<i>- I am the Emissary of...
- Hey, excuse me, sir!</i>

16
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,146
Sorry, sorry. We'll fix it.

17
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,358
- You'll fix it?
- Yeah, just watch.

18
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,737
Okay, here goes!

19
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,826
Does that take care of it?

20
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,289
This is a surprise!
You guys can perform miraculous works.

21
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,542
- What do you mean by that?
- We're alchemists.

22
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,253
I've never seen alchemy before.

23
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,547
Ever heard of the Elric brothers?

24
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,299
Elric?

25
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:58,804
- Yeah! I've heard that name.
- The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.

26
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,682
Wow, so you're the gifted alchemist
we've heard about?

27
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,311
Indeed, with this armor you're wearing
your second name would be "Fullmetal?"

28
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,731
Not me.

29
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,944
The pipsqueak over there?

30
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,696
Who's a tiny bean sprout?

31
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,702
<i>- Pray in faith, and thy entreaties...
- So, what's with this broadcast?</i>

32
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,622
That's Father Cornello.

33
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,586
<i>He appeared in this town several years ago
</i><i>and preached to us the ways of God.</i>

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,924
<i>He gives immortality to the living
</i><i>and resurrection to the dead.</i>

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,844
<i>His miraculous works are proof of it.</i>

36
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,890
"Resurrection to the dead?"
Sounds fishy to me.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,240
Is that it? What do you think?

38
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,744
No two ways about it,
that metamorphic reaction is alchemy.

39
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,747
But he's ignoring equivalent exchange.

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,251
The law is that only one volume of mass
can come from the same volume of mass.

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,379
He's changing vegetable into mineral, too.

42
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,759
- Brother, could it be...
- Yeah, it could be.

43
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,761
Bingo!

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,398
God, please grant me my wish.

45
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,028
- Please bring him.
- Huh, so this is Leto, is it?

46
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,201
- Are you interested in Letoism?
- No, unfortunately, I'm areligious.

47
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,537
Well, that won't do.

48
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:52,417
To believe in and worship God
and live with gratitude and hope,

49
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,920
it's such a marvelous thing.

50
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:59,132
If you believe,
I'm sure you will grow taller.

51
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,677
- Hey, what was that for?
- She didn't mean any harm.

52
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:08,391
"Resurrection to the dead."
Do you honestly believe that?

53
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,893
Yes.

54
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:19,945
Water, 35 liters. Carbon, 20 kilograms.
Ammonia, 4 liters. Lime, 1.5 kilogram.

55
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:26,368
Phosphorus, 800 grams. Salt, 250 grams.
Saltpeter, 100 grams, and various others.

56
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,452
Huh?

57
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,000
That's the material makeup
of a human body, calculated for one adult.

58
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,546
With our science now, we know
that much, but there has never been

59
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,632
one reported case of a successful
human transmutation actually taking place.

60
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,926
Are you telling me
that what can't be done by science

61
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,219
can be done through prayer?

62
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,974
Pray in faith and thy entreaties
shall be accorded thee.

63
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,143
Incidentally, if you go to the market,

64
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,730
you can buy all of these components
with the change a small child might carry.

65
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,608
Humans can be made cheap.

66
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,860
People aren't things!

67
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,488
Your words are blasphemy
against the Creator.

68
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,282
You're going to incur Heaven's wrath.

69
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,578
Alchemists are scientists, you see.

70
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,623
We don't believe in creators
and God and such.

71
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,752
We lay bare the creative principles
of this world, and pursue truth.

72
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,047
<i>It's ironic that we scientists,
</i><i>who do not need God,</i>

73
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:25,260
<i>are in a certain sense
</i><i>the closest ones to being gods.</i>

74
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:30,015
Are you saying you're on the same level
as God? Such hubris!

75
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,475
Hubris, huh?

76
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,478
Now that you mention it,
it was in some myth somewhere.

77
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,939
There was a hero,
who got too close to the sun,

78
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:42,027
and his wings made of hardened wax
were torn off and he was thrust to earth.

79
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,029
Brother.

80
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,326
Miss, do you think that Leto
will even save a scientist,

81
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,536
such as myself,
who thinks what I just said?

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,041
Of course! He will accept
your repentance at any time.

83
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,545
<i>Father, there are some people here
</i><i>who wish to see you.</i>

84
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,173
A child, and someone in a suit of armor.

85
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,675
They gave their names
as the Elric brothers.

86
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,386
I'm busy. Have them leave--

87
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,514
No, wait.
Did you say the Elric brothers?

88
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,685
- Yes, that's what they called themselves.
- This is bad.

89
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,356
He's the Fullmetal Alchemist,
Edward Elric.

90
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,817
- The man in the armor?
- Yeah, probably.

91
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,029
What would a State Alchemist
be doing here?

92
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,323
Don't tell me they know about our plan.

93
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,327
Dog of the Military.
Looks like your nose is pretty sharp.

94
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>This way, please.</i>

95
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,834
The Father is quite busy,
and cannot make very much time,

96
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,336
but you are in luck.

97
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,590
Sorry. We'll keep this as brief as we can.

98
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,051
Yes, indeed.
Let's bring an end to this quickly.

99
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,848
Assistant Pastor, what are you doing?

100
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:58,103
Rose, these people are heathens
who seek to ensnare the Father.

101
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,271
- They are wicked.
- Oh, no!

102
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,275
Like you said, let's end this quickly!

103
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,496
- Strike!
- Such a racket!

104
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,002
Welcome to our sacred order,
Fullmetal Alchemist.

105
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
Father Cornello.

106
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,048
It looks like we had some
rather disrespectful fellows here.

107
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,009
I apologize for their rudeness.

108
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,595
It's no apology,
looking down on us from up there.

109
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,597
Have you come to receive our doctrine?

110
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,225
I would like you to teach it to me,
by all means.

111
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,062
Like how you use cheap alchemy
to deceive your believers.

112
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,565
Now, what could you mean by that?

113
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,068
I won't have you equating
my miraculous works with alchemy.

114
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,573
What do you say?
Can alchemy bring this about?

115
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,784
That's the thing about it.

116
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,830
How is it that you're able to transmute
while ignoring the laws?

117
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,332
Like I said, it isn't alchemy.

118
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,918
That's when I started thinking,

119
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,839
if he were an alchemist,
using an enchanted amplifier of legend

120
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:12,677
said to be able to make the impossible
possible, then maybe he could do that.

121
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,514
- You mean...
- Yes, exactly. The Philosopher's Stone.

122
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,516
That's what that ring of yours is,
isn't it?

123
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,522
- I've been looking for that.
- This is just an ordinary ring.

124
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,692
I have been permitted by God
to perform miraculous works.

125
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,778
Are you still dissembling?

126
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,448
It looks like I'm just going to have
to grab you, and beat it out of you.

127
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,494
You appear to be
quite the incorrigible heathen.

128
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,454
- Rose.
- Yes?

129
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,457
Pick up that gun lying on the floor there.

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,709
Huh? Okay.

131
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,215
Now shoot the Fullmetal Alchemist with it.

132
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,094
No. I can't.

133
00:09:54,177 --> 00:10:00,183
My word is God's word.
This is the will of God.

134
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,102
Rose, shoot him.

135
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,856
What's the matter?

136
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,609
When you lost your boyfriend
in an accident last year,

137
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,697
who was it that saved you
from the very depths of despair?

138
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,951
You, Father Cornello.

139
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:23,706
That's right. I saved you.
And what did I promise you?

140
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,709
That you would bring him back to life!

141
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,256
I'm not him!

142
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,011
I'm the Fullmetal Alchemist, dammit!

143
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,139
You mean you're the one?

144
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,270
I'm sorry. I have no choice but to do it.

145
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,022
- He's a swindler.
- You're wrong!

146
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,401
Father Cornello is going to bring him back
with his miraculous works!

147
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,902
Then shoot.

148
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,202
Al!

149
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:09,961
That will do. God is pleased.
Now, shoot the other one, too.

150
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,964
What an awful thing
to make your believer do.

151
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:13,882
What?

152
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,384
What's going on?

153
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,888
- Nothing to it.
- This is what's going on.

154
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,392
An empty suit of armor!

155
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:29,147
This is indeed proof
that these people are wicked!

156
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,649
They should be purged!

157
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,157
Is this the first time
you've ever seen a Chimera?

158
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,828
You even made this
with your Philosopher's Stone?

159
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,333
This could be trouble,
taking him on unarmed.

160
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,800
No transmutation circle!

161
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,096
I guess the State Alchemist title
is not just for show, then. However...

162
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,271
Well? How do you like the taste
of claws that can cut through iron?

163
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,274
Gotcha!

164
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,739
Unfortunately for you,
this was specially made.

165
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,823
Bite him to death!

166
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,665
What's wrong, pussycat?
Get a good taste of it!

167
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,880
Your arm.

168
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,882
A brother who is just an armor.

169
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,635
I get it. So that's what's going on.

170
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,975
Fullmetal Alchemist,
you went and did it, didn't you?

171
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:51,980
Come on down here, third-string!
Let me show you how outclassed you are!

172
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,487
Come on down here, third-string!
Let me show you how outclassed you are!

173
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,867
Rose, these people have performed
human transmutation,

174
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,995
the greatest taboo for any alchemist!

175
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,957
They tried to bring someone dead
back to life.

176
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,754
The hero gets too close to the sun,
his wings are torn off,

177
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,798
and is thrust back to earth.

178
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,508
Oh, no.

179
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:25,596
This is what someone who trespasses
in God or whoever's domain looks like.

180
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,267
Rose, are you prepared
to become like this?

181
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,814
Edward Elric, to think that you became
a State Alchemist like that!

182
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,024
It's laughable!

183
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,443
Shut up!
You're just a third-rate phony

184
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,278
that can't do anything
without a Philosopher's Stone.

185
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,532
Father, we want you to hand over
the Stone before you get hurt.

186
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:49,537
Ridiculous! You fools, who would tread
upon God's domain!

187
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,291
This time, I will send you
back to God for good.

188
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,258
Nah, God probably hates me, after all.

189
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,635
If I went there,
I think he'd just send me back.

190
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,601
Al!

191
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,485
What are you doing? After them!

192
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,653
They are heathens
who are trying to harm the order!

193
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,738
Seize them!

194
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,368
Stop!

195
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,120
Hey, boy, what are you going to do
empty-handed?

196
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,290
Surrender, before you get hurt.

197
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,965
Don't get careless,
just because he's a child!

198
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,635
Coming through!

199
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,641
<i>Do you see now, Rose?</i>

200
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,187
Cornello shot at us,
even though you were there with us.

201
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,064
That was because you were...

202
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,569
Is it true what he said back there?

203
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:09,826
All we wanted to do was see
our mom's smiling face again.

204
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:16,457
<i>But our transmutation failed.
</i><i>It didn't even have a human form.</i>

205
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,338
We were made to realize our mistake.

206
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,174
People do not come back from the dead,
including our mom.

207
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,927
That's not true. I mean...

208
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,139
The basis of alchemy
is equivalent exchange.

209
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,891
The price of our human transmutation
was enormous.

210
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,896
Brother's left leg,
and my whole body was taken away.

211
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,944
Do you see it?
Brother drew it with his own blood.

212
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,908
His left leg had been taken away.
He had to have been in pain.

213
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:56,372
But Brother transmuted my soul
in exchange for his right arm,

214
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,708
and bonded me to this suit of armor.

215
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,005
I want to restore Brother's body
back to the way it was.

216
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,717
Brother wants to get me back
to normal, too.

217
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,388
We might even lose our lives as a result.

218
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,435
That's the karmic nature
of the path we chose.

219
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,897
- But Father Cornello can--
- Rose!

220
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,819
Father Cornello can do it,
even if you weren't able to.

221
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:27,904
He can!

222
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,950
Kid. Say your prayers!

223
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,953
Mister, let's speak frankly here.

224
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,373
I just want to know
the secrets of that Stone.

225
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,210
Or should I request
that the military be called in

226
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,961
to investigate the Stone?

227
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
Very well.

228
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,886
What are you trying to do
with the Philosopher's Stone?

229
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,805
If you have it, you don't need
any rinky-dink religious order, right?

230
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,392
The order would gladly give
their lives for my sake

231
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,188
and provides me with more believers!

232
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,692
They will be the ultimate legion,
not even afraid to die, just you watch!

233
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,195
In just a few more years,

234
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,240
I'm going to set out
to rip this country apart

235
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,493
using the Philosopher's Stone
and my idiotic believers!

236
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,746
I'll even share the leftovers with you!

237
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,251
What's so funny?

238
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,879
Like I said, you're third-string.

239
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,013
You don't mean...!

240
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,767
There are no miraculous works.

241
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,228
It was all done with the power
of the Philosopher's Stone.

242
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,230
<i>Why, you...!</i>

243
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,234
<i>- When did you flip that switch?
</i><i>- Right at the start.</i>

244
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,238
<i>- It's all out of the bag now.
</i><i>- How could you do that?</i>

245
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,241
You little brat!

246
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,742
Too slow!

247
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,497
Like I said, you're outclassed.

248
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,960
I am unrivaled!

249
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,512
It's a rebound!

250
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:22,768
I'm not giving up yet! I am... I am...

251
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,772
the Emissary of God!

252
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,502
My word is the word of God!

253
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,756
My fist is the fist of God!

254
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,216
Fist of God, my foot!

255
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,471
If you want it that much, you can have it!

256
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,076
Shut up!
Let me see the Philosopher's Stone!

257
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,793
It broke. How can that be?

258
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,128
How does a Philosopher's Stone,

259
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,506
which is supposed to be
a perfect material, break?

260
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,050
I don't know.
I don't know anything about this!

261
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,637
Spare me! Please! I was wrong!

262
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,347
It's a fake?

263
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,267
I can't do anything without the Stone.
Spare me!

264
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:49,313
We've come this far,
thinking we could finally get back...

265
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,816
And it's a fake.

266
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,694
What about me?

267
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,364
Go on, go wherever the hell you like!

268
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,740
Right!

269
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,664
- What about the Philosopher's Stone?
- It was just a big knockoff.

270
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,212
I thought we were finally going
to get you your body back, too.

271
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,005
Give me the Philosopher's Stone!

272
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,633
Rose.

273
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,973
Like I said, it was just a big knockoff.
What's more, it broke all on its own.

274
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,434
Liar! You want to keep it
all for yourself, don't you?

275
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,314
For your bodies-- yeah,
and to use on your mother one more time.

276
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,399
Shut up!

277
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,154
Dead people
do not come back to life, ever!

278
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,157
Ever!

279
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,414
He said he would come back.
He said if I prayed, it would come true.

280
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,167
That a miracle would happen.

281
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,547
What am I supposed to live my life
clinging to now?

282
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,841
Tell me!

283
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,682
You have to figure that out for yourself.

284
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,520
Stand up and walk. Move forward.

285
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,315
You've got two fine legs there, don't you?

286
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,903
You don't need to cling to anything.

287
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,829
- What's going on here?
- Send out the Father!

288
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,041
- Have you been deceiving us?
- Open up!

289
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,379
That kid has destroyed my ambitions.

290
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,715
Indeed, it's all ruined.

291
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,927
We should have just incited
a little rebellion.

292
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,303
You...!

293
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,723
Say, Lust, can I eat this old man?

294
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:52,228
No, Gluttony. If you eat him,
it will upset your stomach.

295
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,272
Everyone is treating me like a fool!

296
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,197
We're done with you.

297
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,913
And here things were getting heated up.

298
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,082
Now we'll have to start over
from the beginning again.

299
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,584
Father is going to be angry with us.

300
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,797
Now then, I wonder what means
we should take next.
