1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,466
<i>The power of one person
</i><i>does not amount to much.</i>

2
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,817
<i>As such, I will do all I can,</i>

3
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>however little that may be,</i>

4
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>to protect those who are dear to me.</i>

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,663
<i>Those below me
</i><i>will protect those below them.</i>

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,542
We tiny humans
should be able to do that much, at least.

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,293
Geometric progression, huh?

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,380
Which means...

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,007
in order for you
to protect the whole country,

10
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,010
you'll have to be standing
at the top of the pyramid.

11
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,599
I'll bet it feels awfully good
to be there, Hughes.

12
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,521
But I won't be able to climb
that high all by myself.

13
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,524
I'm sure of that much.

14
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,651
What are you swaggering on about?

15
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,407
This could be interesting.
I'll take a piece of that action.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,995
I want to see how your naÃ¯ve idealism
changes this country.

17
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,753
Colonel... Colonel.

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,259
If you're tired, why don't you go
to the nap room?

19
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,970
Sorry.

20
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,139
I want to gather up
all the unfinished paperwork

21
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,309
before we transfer to Central.

22
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,519
I haven't slept much lately.

23
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604
You seemed to be having a dream.

24
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,984
Oh, it was just
an insignificant old memory.

25
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,665
So, I don't remember anything
after this one kicked me.

26
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,377
Guardians who were only souls,
a precious sacrifice,

27
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
and him letting you live...

28
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,258
Uroboros tattoos, a Philosopher's Stone
transmutation circle,

29
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,929
and Mr. Marcoh saying
they used Stones in Ishval...

30
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,558
There are too many mysteries here
for just a simple experiment.

31
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:49,354
And there's no way to investigate any
what with the lab being a pile of rubble.

32
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,356
"Hmm..."

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,361
It sounds like they're talking
about something pretty thorny.

34
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,531
I don't want to stick my nose
into anything any more dangerous,

35
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,907
so I'm not listening!

36
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,326
Ah, you there,

37
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,330
is this where
the Fullmetal Alchemist's room is?

38
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,999
Yes, this is--

39
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,086
If I root around in the criminal lists
at the court-martial office,

40
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,839
something might turn up.

41
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,760
I shall look into those who
were working under Dr. Marcoh

42
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,596
in researching the Stone.

43
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,559
Excuse me.

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,399
Fuhrer King Bradley!

45
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,944
Ah, keep your voice down. As you were.

46
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,447
Your Excellency, what are you doing here?

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,909
What, you ask? Visiting a sick friend.

48
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,535
Do you like melons?

49
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,746
Yeah, thanks.

50
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,830
I mean...

51
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,126
I understand you've been checking up
on the senior staff members,

52
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,295
Major Armstrong.

53
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,090
Sir? Well, sir, how did you...?

54
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,343
Don't underestimate
my information network.

55
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,597
And Edward Elric...

56
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,433
the Philosopher's Stone?

57
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:14,314
What have you found out?
Depending on how much you've learned.

58
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,243
Just kidding!

59
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,037
- You don't have to be so defensive!
- Huh?

60
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:34,417
I know that there is some unrest
among the ranks.

61
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,462
I think that something
must be done about it.

62
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,381
Ah, that's just...

63
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,510
A list of those who were researching
the Philosopher's Stone.

64
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:48,139
- All of these men have gone missing.
- Sir?

65
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,018
They disappeared several days
before the Fifth Laboratory collapsed.

66
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,938
The enemy is always a step ahead of us.

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,566
And even with my information network,

68
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,194
as it currently stands,
I have no handle on the enemy's size,

69
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,322
their objectives,
or how far they've penetrated us.

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,327
In other words,
it's quite dangerous to be poking around.

71
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,662
Yes.

72
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:15,792
Lt. Colonel Hughes,
Major Armstrong, Elric brothers,

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,962
I've determined you
to be men that I can trust.

74
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,549
I will not permit you to stick your noses

75
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,760
any further into this matter,
nor speak of it to anyone!

76
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,097
Under the present circumstances,
when we can't tell friend from foe,

77
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,974
you cannot trust anyone!

78
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,438
Consider everyone in the military
to be the enemy, and act discreetly!

79
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,689
However...

80
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,360
when the time comes,
I will have much work for you to do,

81
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,570
so see that you are ready.

82
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,196
Yes, sir!

83
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,575
Excellency!
Where is His Excellency, the Fuhrer?

84
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,203
Uh-oh, my pesky subordinates
have come after me.

85
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,751
I secretly slipped out of work, you see.

86
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,544
Well, farewell!

87
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,509
Ed! Huh?

88
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,096
What's wrong, everyone?

89
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,433
Nothing, a storm just passed through.

90
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,772
I bought the tickets you asked me to.

91
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,690
The train tomorrow at noon is okay, right?

92
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,068
Yeah. Thank you.

93
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,405
My, you sure are on the go.
You haven't even completely healed.

94
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,282
You expect me to stay

95
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,826
in this disinfectant-reeking place
forever?

96
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,080
Where are you going now? Dublith?

97
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,583
Yeah. I talked it over with Al,

98
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,378
and we're going to go see our teacher.

99
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,839
I sure am scared, Brother!

100
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,884
I'm sure she's gonna kill us!

101
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,055
Don't wimp out, little brother!
I'm scared too!

102
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,683
Who is this teacher of yours?

103
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,353
Still quite a distance beyond Dublith.

104
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,521
Whereabouts?

105
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,274
Let's see, here.
Right in the middle of the southern area.

106
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,365
What?

107
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,784
Here! Here! Just before Dublith!

108
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,122
The holy land of automail, Rush Valley!

109
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,790
I've always wanted to go there!

110
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,168
Take me! Take me! Take me!

111
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,379
Go there on your own.

112
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,966
- But who will pay my traveling expenses?
- Are you trying to mooch off of me?

113
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,177
Now, now, where's the harm?
It's on our way, and all.

114
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,180
- If you insist.
- Hooray!

115
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,934
I'll go call Grandma!

116
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,481
She'd make a fine wife.

117
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,691
Don't tell me!

118
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,112
Though, not as fine as my own wife!

119
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,115
Okay, Papa's heading out now!

120
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,243
Papa, are you coming home early today?

121
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,748
Hmm, I'm not sure.
Papa has a lot of work to do.

122
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,959
But I'll come home as soon as I can.

123
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:08,173
- That tickles!
- You're going to be late.

124
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,967
Winry, you're leaving today, right?

125
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,637
I won't be able to come see you off,
so take care.

126
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,642
Mr. Hughes, thanks so much for everything.

127
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,730
Whenever you're in Central,
be sure to come visit us.

128
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,690
Consider our home as your home.

129
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,985
- Also, give my regards to the guys, okay?
- Right.

130
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,529
Papa, work hard!

131
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,198
Come home safe!

132
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,586
What made you suddenly decide
to go see your teacher?

133
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,838
There are two reasons.

134
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,758
Lately,
we've been on a real losing streak.

135
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,844
Huh? You're going there
because you want to improve your fighting?

136
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,721
What are you, fighting fools?

137
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,100
No, dumbass, it's not as simple as that!

138
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,728
It's not just the fighting,
it's what's inside us, you might say.

139
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,064
- Right?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,358
Anyhow, we feel like
if we go see our teacher,

141
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,693
it will help to strengthen us somehow.

142
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,029
I want to get even stronger.

143
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,035
What's the second reason?

144
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,788
To ask our teacher
about the Philosopher's Stone.

145
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,375
The truth within the truth.

146
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,086
We never did end up
figuring out what it was.

147
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,672
Our teacher might know something about it

148
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,467
We can't afford
to be concerned about appearances.

149
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,596
We have to be ready
for Teacher to kill us, and ask her...

150
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,559
ask her... ask her...

151
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,228
Our lives sure have been short, huh?

152
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,606
I wish I could have at least found
a girlfriend.

153
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,817
What kind of teacher do you have?

154
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,945
The Liore insurgency?

155
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,407
Yes, where that new religion
"Letoism" or whatever

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,701
was suckering the people.

157
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,911
Sounds like it's finally under control.

158
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,498
Between Ishval and these insurgencies,

159
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,709
the eastern area
is having a rough time of it, huh?

160
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,294
It's not just the eastern area.

161
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,214
There are uprisings and border
skirmishes in the north and west too.

162
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,050
The bodies are piling up all over,
are they?

163
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,553
The government might just
be overthrown before too long.

164
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,145
Colonel, where are you going?

165
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,646
I'm running over to the archive room.

166
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,194
Liore...

167
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,781
Uprisings all over...
The Philosopher's Stone...

168
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,617
Ingredients are humans...

169
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,621
What we did in Ishval...

170
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:51,002
Hey, now,
who was it that came up with this?

171
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,795
I have to tell the Fuhrer, quickly...

172
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,593
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

173
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,931
Or perhaps I should say, "farewell."

174
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,194
Cool tattoo you've got there.

175
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,988
You've learned too much,
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

176
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,756
Damn!

177
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,724
"Damn"? That's what I was going to say.

178
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,938
Oh, my, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

179
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,190
Here to call and brag
about your family some more--

180
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,025
Colonel, you're bleeding!

181
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,028
It's nothing! I need the phone!

182
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,407
The prefectural office...

183
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,166
Sorry to have bothered you.

184
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,584
Eh? Colonel!

185
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,379
<i>Yes, Eastern Command Center.</i>

186
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,340
Put me through to Colonel Roy Mustang.

187
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,427
<i>We have a rule against connecting anyone
</i><i>from an outside line.</i>

188
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,679
This is Lt. Colonel Hughes, in Central!

189
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,556
I'm calling from outside
because it's an emergency!

190
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,849
<i>Your code, please.</i>

191
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,768
Ah, geez, what a pain!

192
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:36,983
Uncle, Sugar, Oliver, Eight, Zero, Zero!

193
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,777
<i>Code verified. Just a moment, please.</i>

194
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,280
Hurry it up! The military is in trouble!

195
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,122
Would you mind putting
the receiver down, Lt. Colonel?

196
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,500
Come on, put it down.

197
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,670
Lieutenant Ross?

198
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,881
No, it isn't. Who are you?

199
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,718
I'm 2nd Lieutenant Maria Ross.
Have you forgotten?

200
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,054
No, you're not.

201
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,224
Lieutenant Ross has a mole
under her left eye!

202
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,146
Oh, is that right? How careless of me.

203
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,025
Is this better?

204
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,655
What is this?
It's like I'm dreaming or something.

205
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,576
It's awfully unfortunate for you
that your mind works so fast,

206
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,660
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

207
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,538
Hey, now, have a heart.

208
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,918
I have a wife and daughter
waiting for me at home.

209
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,045
I can't go dying here!

210
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,426
Nice rendering, huh?

211
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,387
You son of a bitch!

212
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,231
<i>Call from Lt. Colonel Hughes
</i><i>in Central, on a public line.</i>

213
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,942
Again? Put him through.

214
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm here. If you're bragging
about your daughter, I'm not listening.

215
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,991
Hughes?

216
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,869
Hughes... Hey, Hughes!

217
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,004
You humans really are such fools.

218
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,298
You risk your lives
over the most pointless things.

219
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:37,478
Elicia... Gracia... I'm sorry.

220
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,067
I promised I'd be home early.

221
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,368
Oh, this is good!

222
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,579
This apple pie is the best!

223
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,874
Mrs. Gracia is a very good cook.

224
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,375
I know.

225
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,462
The quiche she made for us before
was also awfully delicious.

226
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:08,009
I put it on the list of things
I want to eat when I get my body back.

227
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,262
She taught me how to make it,
so once you get your body back, Al,

228
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,346
I'll make it for you.

229
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,848
All right!

230
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,728
Mr. Hughes and Mrs. Gracia
were both really great people.

231
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,690
Colonel Hughes is a doting father,
a busybody,

232
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,734
and annoying to be around.

233
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,237
He did always come by your hospital room
to give you a hard time, huh, Brother?

234
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,031
Seriously.

235
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
He said he was busy with work,

236
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,371
but he would always come to visit me.

237
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,082
Next time we're there,
we ought to thank him somehow.

238
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,042
Yeah.

239
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,286
Mama, why are they burying Papa?

240
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,914
Elicia...

241
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,627
If they do that,
Papa won't be able to do his work.

242
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,795
Elici--

243
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,801
Papa said he had a lot of work to do.

244
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,803
No!

245
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,805
Don't bury him!

246
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,598
Papa!

247
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,312
<i>Promoted two grades
</i><i>for dying in the line of duty...</i>

248
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>Brigadier General Hughes, huh?</i>

249
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,317
What good does it do

250
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,946
to have someone who said they'd support me
from below get above me...

251
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,241
you idiot?

252
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,701
Colonel...

253
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,208
Alchemists are nasty creatures,
aren't they, Lieutenant?

254
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,921
There's a part of me
that was just frantically piecing together

255
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,465
the theories
of human transmutation in my head.

256
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,596
I think I can now understand
what those boys felt

257
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,097
when they tried to transmute their mother.

258
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,602
Are you all right?

259
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,479
Yes, I'm all right.

260
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,483
Oh, no, it's started to rain.

261
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,696
No, there's no rain--

262
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,242
Yes, it's raining.

263
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,205
Yes, you're right.

264
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,917
Let's go back. It's chilly out here.

265
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,423
He left, saying he was going
to the archive room.

266
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,051
That was the last time I saw the colonel.

267
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,513
Did he get into a fight with someone?

268
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,265
Probably.

269
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,059
There were traces of blood

270
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,810
leading from inside the room
out into the hallway.

271
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,730
And the next place he went was...

272
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,860
The colonel was hurt,
and was about to place a call,

273
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:17,365
but then he didn't call anyone,
and just left.

274
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,079
<i>He picked up on something
</i><i>in the court-martial office,</i>

275
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,122
<i>and even though
</i><i>he could have called from inside,</i>

276
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,751
<i>he deliberately went outside
</i><i>to try to contact me.</i>

277
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,088
<i>The Eastern Command Center
</i><i>switchboard operator</i>

278
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,883
<i>heard Hughes say
</i><i>"The military is in trouble!"</i>

279
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,845
<i>What was it?
</i><i>What was he trying to tell me?</i>

280
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,516
Colonel...

281
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,727
I've brought Major Armstrong.

282
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,898
We have some suspects

283
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,360
as to those who murdered
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

284
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,278
Then why aren't you out there
catching them right now?

285
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,658
We have some suspects,
but we don't know who they are.

286
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,662
What do you mean? Explain yourself.

287
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,664
I cannot.

288
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,209
I am a colonel,
and I'm telling you to explain it!

289
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,670
Are you going to disobey
a superior officer?

290
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,255
I cannot tell you.

291
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,138
All right.
I'm sorry to have called you out.

292
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,265
- You're free to go.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,939
Come to think of it,
I forgot to mention something.

294
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,693
The Elric brothers were here
up until just a few days ago.

295
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,945
The Elric brothers?

296
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,322
Yes, the Elric brothers.

297
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,702
Did they find what they were looking for?

298
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:49,999
No. After all,
it is an item of legendary proportions.

299
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,084
I see. Thanks.

300
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,923
Not much information
to be gathered from that, is there?

301
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,844
Man, I tell you,
the major is far too unsuspecting.

302
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,264
He said "those who killed Hughes,"

303
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,225
which would mean
there is more than one person involved.

304
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,103
It could be that there are people
working as a group.

305
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,440
The fact
that he wouldn't tell me anything,

306
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,902
even though as a colonel I ordered him to,

307
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,156
means that there is someone
above me who has forbidden him to talk.

308
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,492
Someone to do with the senior staff,
I'll bet.

309
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,371
And what the Elric brothers
are looking for,

310
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,373
which is to say, the Philosopher's Stone.

311
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,586
So how is an organization having to do
with the senior military staff

312
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,591
connected to the Philosopher's Stone
and Lt. Colonel Hughes?

313
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,843
I don't know yet.

314
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,846
But once I transfer to Central,

315
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,515
I'm going to make sure
to investigate the senior staff,

316
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,142
and smoke out whoever killed Hughes.

317
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,729
It's not like you to mix
public and private affairs.

318
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,981
There's nothing "public" or "private"
about it.

319
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,442
All of this, whether taking
the position of Fuhrer

320
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,736
or avenging Hughes,
I do of my own personal volition!

321
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,075
I'm going to stick it to the senior staff.
Are you coming?

322
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,786
After all this time, you have to ask?
