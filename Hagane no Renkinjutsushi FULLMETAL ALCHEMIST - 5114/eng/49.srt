1
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:38,682
<i>Ed fights alongside Lan Fan, now back,
</i><i>against the Homunculus Pride.</i>

2
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>As the difficult battle carries on,</i>

3
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,147
<i>Ed successfully works out a plan
</i><i>to safely get Al back from him.</i>

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,235
<i>However, Pride takes in
</i><i>his partner, Gluttony,</i>

5
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>and obtains his abilities.</i>

6
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,870
<i>Elsewhere, Mustang joins up
</i><i>with Hawkeye and the others.</i>

7
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>They kidnap the FÃ¼hrer's wife,
</i><i>and hold her hostage.</i>

8
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,465
Al, wake up.

9
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,176
Hey, Al! Can you hear me?

10
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,053
Alphonse!

11
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,265
That smell...

12
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,727
Edward Elric!

13
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,899
If I capture you, Hohenheim will be forced
to come forward.

14
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,962
Ed!

15
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,020
- Young Lord!
- Afraid not.

16
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,647
I'm Greed.

17
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,734
Why, you...
Give the Young Lord back his body!

18
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,529
That's something I'm afraid I can't do.

19
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,364
Here he comes!

20
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,456
Are you all right?

21
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,716
Who asked you to help?

22
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,387
Shut up! Your arm
still isn't at its best yet, right?

23
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,471
That's none of your affair!

24
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,349
Right now, you just worry about yourself.

25
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,519
We're going to need your help
down the road.

26
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,652
- Keep going!
- Sorry, I couldn't bag him.

27
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,863
Don't worry about it.

28
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,741
Can't fault you
for not being able to defeat him.

29
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,703
He's a monster, even by my standards.

30
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,377
<i>Wake up...</i>

31
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,588
Alphonse!

32
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,093
Dad?

33
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,095
Yo.

34
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,811
If you're here, Dad, then is this Kanama?

35
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:30,729
That's right.

36
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,524
How did...? When did I...?

37
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,985
Oh, right! Pride!

38
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,365
Dad, the Homunculus Pride
came inside my body.

39
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,534
I heard all about it from Mr. Gorius here.

40
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,619
That's "Darius."

41
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,621
Rats.

42
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,541
It was like he was interfering
and it felt icky.

43
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:57,881
Those guys are almost like clones
of a clone of me.

44
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,219
As my son, it might be easy for them
to interfere with your blood seal.

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,431
Old man Fu.

46
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,979
Would you see to caring for this man?

47
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,066
What's the situation like over there?

48
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,070
- Are you Edward's father?
- Yes, I am.

49
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,784
The shadow monster
devoured the one named Gluttony,

50
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,952
and he's beyond our control.

51
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,207
Greed and Edward are fighting him,
but the situation is not good.

52
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,794
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

53
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>Everyone is in this mess
</i><i>because Pride caught me.</i>

54
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,843
The fires have created
too many light sources

55
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,929
and I've run out of flash bombs.

56
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,848
The same tricks won't work any longer.

57
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,226
This is bad.

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,310
The way things are headed,

59
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,438
the people in the slums are going
to be caught in the middle of this.

60
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,233
Dad...

61
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,778
You're a big-time alchemist, right?

62
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,782
Yeah, I'm not half bad.

63
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,161
I have a favor to ask,
and I'm counting on your skills.

64
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,875
There.

65
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,879
The view is much better now.

66
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,138
It won't do any good
to hide behind anything.

67
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,931
Your smell gives you away.

68
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,060
Damn! Hey, you still alive?

69
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,520
More or less.

70
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,566
Is this any time to be worried
about others, Greed?

71
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,902
I wonder how much longer it will be
before you are dead?

72
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,405
You monster...

73
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:51,036
That's a rather rude thing to say
about your brother, Greed.

74
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,412
May I eat you now?

75
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,166
You eat me
and you'll upset your stomach, brother.

76
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,299
You're finally making an appearance...

77
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,384
Hohenheim.

78
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,138
Heroes always arrive late, you know.

79
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,768
Hero? Are you saying
you mean to defeat me?

80
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,188
No, I couldn't do that.

81
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,191
You really are a fright, after all.

82
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:34,412
<i>What is he thinking?
</i><i>Is he after something?</i>

83
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,638
<i>Here he comes!</i>

84
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,437
Oh, what a pathetic strategy.

85
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,233
You don't know when to give up.

86
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,074
Al!

87
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,666
To think that you would come back here
to be my hostage.

88
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,169
What a curious boy your son is.

89
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,299
Don't you put...

90
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,927
my son down.

91
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,073
Hohenheim!

92
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:06,963
Amazing.

93
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,091
He confined him.

94
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,604
What is this?
You trapped Al in there, too, you know?

95
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,981
What are you thinking?

96
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,649
It wasn't my idea.

97
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,152
Al suggested we do this.

98
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,035
It worked!
You can't use your abilities like this.

99
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:42,123
Is this any time to be laughing?
You can't get out of here, either.

100
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,959
The instant you open up a crack
trying to leave,

101
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,294
I'll use my shadows to--

102
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,296
I never meant to leave here
in the first place.

103
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,551
What do you say
we have a test of endurance, Selim--

104
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,805
Or rather, the Homunculus Pride?

105
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,683
My body is just fine with having
no oxygen, or light, or food.

106
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,729
All day today, until the Promised Day,

107
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,941
you are going to stay put right here,
together with me.

108
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,695
<i>It's too difficult to try
</i><i>to defeat Pride right now.</i>

109
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,823
However, the way things were going,

110
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,158
there would be too much damage done
to the surrounding area.

111
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,952
So instead of fighting him,

112
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,704
we used me as a decoy,
and pinned him down.

113
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,959
Now we've bought ourselves some time
to put together some countermeasures.

114
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,877
So without even discussing it with me--

115
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,841
He said, "If we tell Brother,
he'll definitely be against it."

116
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:41,015
This is what came of him
thinking up a way for everyone to survive.

117
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,642
Try to understand.

118
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,981
Now, let's get these fires out.

119
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,654
<i>Al!</i>

120
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,990
Brother!

121
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,244
Al!

122
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,622
<i>I'm sorry.
</i><i>Here we were finally reunited, too.</i>

123
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,211
But then, I was the reason
why all of this happened to begin with.

124
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,507
<i>Besides, I only have to put up
</i><i>with this for one day.</i>

125
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,593
<i>I'll be fine, Brother.</i>

126
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,894
Lust is gone, Envy is gone,
and Gluttony is out of commission.

127
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,607
Wrath is at the training ground
in the east, and Pride is stuck here!

128
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,239
Right now, the only ones here in Central
are Daddy and Sloth.

129
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,492
Greed, what are you thinking?

130
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:43,995
I told you.

131
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,415
I'm going to be king of the whole world.

132
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,592
Doesn't it seem like lately,
there are more Ishvalans in Central?

133
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,927
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,845
There seem to be quite a few of them

135
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,389
around those abandoned buildings
in the west.

136
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,476
Speaking of Ishvalans,
I wonder how that X-scarred fellow

137
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,437
who was here before is doing now.

138
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:16,235
- Hey, it's the X-scarred fellow.
- Speak of the devil, here he is.

139
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,489
I'm looking for the Kanama slums.

140
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,620
Kanama is in the woods,
on the outskirts to the south.

141
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,997
Oh, yeah? Thanks.

142
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,918
Come to think of it,
isn't that girl with you?

143
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,296
You know, the girl who had
that black-and-white cat with her.

144
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,091
She came back here a little while ago.

145
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,469
- What?
- She didn't go back to her home country.

146
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,263
What is she doing?

147
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,433
Hey, you guys have finally done it!

148
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,435
What do you mean?

149
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,898
You're the ones who blew up Bradley
in his train out east, right?

150
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:54,983
Blew up?

151
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,028
- You mean you weren't?
- It's news to us.

152
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,407
Oh, and here I was sure you grouped up
with the other Ishvalans

153
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,951
and pulled it off.

154
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,662
Yeah, that business about them
pulling terrorist acts

155
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,747
is just hot air, that's all.

156
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,001
They have not come together
to do anything like that.

157
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,378
They're important friends

158
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,132
who are trying to change the country
without terrorism.

159
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,114
There are limits as to how devoted
one should be to his work.

160
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,201
The new suit I went and had made
has gotten dirty.

161
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,914
The main event doesn't start
until after the sun goes up, either.

162
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,507
It's no use.

163
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,262
I doubt my dad made it such that a chi
could do anything about it.

164
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,355
This is what happens
when you deride humans so much.

165
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,110
You guys don't understand
a single thing about us humans.

166
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,447
You shouldn't think that everything
is going to go your way.

167
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,619
That plan of yours, for example.
The way I see it, it was perfectly sloppy.

168
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,746
Sloppy?

169
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,876
Yeah. It sounded
like there were sacrifices to it

170
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,754
and you were going to use us
to try to do something.

171
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,966
But if we were to run away
to some foreign country,

172
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,595
at that point, your plans
would have gone up in smoke.

173
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,686
It's true, there are humans
that only think about themselves.

174
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,271
However...

175
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,317
Yes, Wrath's wife, for example.

176
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,031
<i>Once, in town, there was an incident
</i><i>where I was nearly hit by a car.</i>

177
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:13,287
<i>When it happened,
</i><i>she risked her life to try to save me.</i>

178
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,126
<i>Even though she didn't know
</i><i>I was a Homunculus,</i>

179
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,630
<i>I was unexpectedly thrown for a loop
</i><i>by her rashness.</i>

180
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:30,847
I have a father, but I did not have
what you would call a mother,

181
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,892
so to be honest,
I have been most intrigued by her.

182
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,603
I wondered if this was what
having a mother was like.

183
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:43,526
Wrath's wife...
You mean Mrs. Bradley, right?

184
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,153
Yes, that's right.

185
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,782
I can't believe
you tricked that nice woman.

186
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,369
It's true,
I was just playing house with her.

187
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,916
However, living life with her
was enjoyable,

188
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,043
and I did like it.

189
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,921
- So then...!
- There are humans...

190
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,218
There are humans, like Wrath's wife,

191
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:14,182
who will throw away their own lives
to protect what is dear to them.

192
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:20,313
And then there are you guys,
that were chosen to be sacrifices,

193
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,274
who have even stronger spirits.

194
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,819
There's no way you could have abandoned
this country and escaped.

195
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,780
In fact, you came back here
just to fight me.

196
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,787
So in no way were our plans sloppy.

197
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:49,926
Colonel...

198
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,180
It's almost time.

199
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,016
Yeah.

200
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,193
Let's go, Lieutenant.

201
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,833
What is this?

202
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:30,007
What in the world happened?
And what's with that mountain?

203
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,386
Well, if it isn't Jerso and Zampano!

204
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,971
Darius!

205
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:41,352
Are you here under orders from Kimblee
to kill all of us?

206
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,813
What are you talking about?

207
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,731
We quit being Kimblee's servants
a long time ago.

208
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,234
So you say, then you'll wait for us
to lower our guard

209
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,736
- so you can kill us, right?
- As if I would do that!

210
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,989
I don't trust you.

211
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,617
I'll bet Heinkel is hiding nearby,
about to attack us, isn't he?

212
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,827
Dr. Marcoh!

213
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,037
- Get over it already, you idiot.
- Edward.

214
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,539
You wanna go at it, you swine?

215
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,749
- And Scar is with you, huh?
- What did you say?

216
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,168
I hate to ask when you just got here,

217
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,546
- but we have to get set up.
- Shut up!

218
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,883
Hey, you! Piggy, tubby, and gorilla,
stop fighting!

219
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,802
Why, you! You want a fight, do you?

220
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,685
Oh, so you really have quit
as Kimblee's men.

221
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:27,523
Working under him,
it was obvious that we were expendable.

222
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,816
I know what you mean.

223
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,695
And, as a result,
we've ended up as fugitives,

224
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,196
but it sure feels good.

225
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,949
Yeah. What's more...

226
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:41,203
these guys aren't going
to run out on us.

227
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,212
It's finally gonna start,
once the sun comes up.

228
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,422
Yeah.

229
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,800
I sure hope everyone lives
through this all right.

230
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,721
Looks like they're done talking.

231
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,225
Where did the old guy go?

232
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,270
He went to go check out the city.

233
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,649
- By himself?
- Yeah.

234
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,194
He said he was the only one among us
whose face hasn't been shown to the enemy

235
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,655
so it would be better for all of us
that way.

236
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:20,451
He said he would also get a handle
on Colonel Mustang's movements.

237
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,247
He's probably also wondering
what Lin is up to.

238
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,708
Ah, that makes sense.

239
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,378
Is your meeting with Scar
and the others over?

240
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,337
Yeah.

241
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,091
We've set up our mission.

242
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,843
You have, huh? Then it's almost time.

243
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,354
Your younger brother
is a real piece of work.

244
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,107
Staying in the darkness
with that monster like that.

245
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,819
If it were me, I'd be flipping out.

246
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,865
Al's really giving it his all, huh?

247
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,118
The rest...

248
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,912
is up to us to do.

249
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,434
<i>The Promised Day has started.</i>

250
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:03,531
Brother! Brother! Hey, Brother Denny!

251
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,949
Pipe down!

252
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,284
What is it?

253
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,871
Hurry and get up. It's about to start.

254
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,374
What's about to start?

255
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,750
The eclipse!

256
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,001
Eclipse?

257
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,173
Okay, look,
what time do you think this is?

258
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,468
It's not yet time
for the eclipse to start.

259
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,012
Hey, don't look at the sun!
You'll ruin your eyes!

260
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,848
I know that much, at least.

261
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,478
Brother, come here, come here!
There's smoke rising from the city!

262
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,282
Don't you guys go outside today!

263
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,417
<i>Cedi Squad in the western sector
</i><i>has discovered and engaged</i>

264
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,585
<i>Mustang's group in Sector C75.</i>

265
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,589
However, they have taken
the FÃ¼hrer's wife as a hostage,

266
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,674
so we're having trouble handling him.

267
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,594
- No matter. Attack.
- Sir?

268
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,476
All we need is to keep Roy Mustang alive.
The wife has no practical value.

269
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,731
Have his men eliminated.

270
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,613
Don't move!

271
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,122
Are you going to shoot?

272
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,130
You're free to shoot everyone
but Colonel Mustang!
