1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:17,684
Where are you, Mr. Kimblee?

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,022
This isn't what we agreed to.

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:27,027
You said that if we attacked,
there would be turncoats at Briggs!

4
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,244
Cease fire!

5
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,249
- An overwhelming victory, huh?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,460
It's like...

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,175
A crest of blood.

8
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,072
<i>I told you.</i>

9
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,117
In alkahestry,
you read the dragon's pulse.

10
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,537
And I'm telling you,
I don't know what that means.

11
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,998
You have to sharpen your senses.

12
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,459
And go! There, I sense it.

13
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,295
- I told you, I can't!
- Yes, you can!

14
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,172
<i>Explain it to me more academically!</i>

15
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,590
<i>- You have to go whoomph!
- They sure are lively.</i>

16
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,593
<i>- I don't know what you mean!
- Sorry to have to hide out here.</i>

17
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,347
Don't worry about it.
We're getting something out of it, too.

18
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,477
My hair! Stop that!

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,646
The children have someone else
to play with.

20
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,774
Help me!

21
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,904
Tell Zampano that I'm going off
to the mountains to get some firewood.

22
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,907
Damn it!

23
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,119
What a terrible predicament!

24
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,037
Everyone else is working,

25
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,416
so where did that bastard Zampano
go off to?

26
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,005
Hey!

27
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,720
This way. I'll take you there.

28
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,432
Please do, Zampano.

29
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,942
I understand you've found out about Selim.

30
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,695
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,782
- And my own true identity, as well.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,037
As one of this country's people,

33
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:11,293
how do you feel about its leader
and his son being Homunculi?

34
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,048
I think it's sad that the family
in whom I've trusted is fictitious.

35
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,800
You're a make-believe family.

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,850
Pretending to be the humans
that you sneer at as fools.

37
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,313
It's true, my "son" was given to me
from someone higher up.

38
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,984
Everything, from my position as Fuhrer
to all of my men were given to me.

39
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,069
You might say I'm a make-believe
potentate.

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,074
However, my wife, at least,
is someone I chose.

41
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,040
- Is the tea ready yet?
- Oh, yes, sir.

42
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,757
Delicious.

43
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,807
Oh, yeah, Doctor?

44
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,101
You were one of the bigwigs
at the Fifth Laboratory?

45
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,731
I was no bigwig.
I just had some men working under me.

46
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,402
I wonder how they are doing now.

47
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,113
Hey!

48
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,747
- Who is that gentleman?
- A drifter that I met this morning.

49
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,874
He says he wants to get examined
by you, Doctor.

50
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,459
That's enough, Zampano.

51
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,712
You can stop with the third-rate acting.

52
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
Good day to you, Doctor.

53
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,929
What might you be doing
in a place like this?

54
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,558
You maggot.

55
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,269
Trying to put one over on me
was wishful thinking.

56
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,606
What is this?

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,609
Zampano!

58
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,739
I can stop
with the third-rate acting, right?

59
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:09,202
Our goal from the outset
was to lure you here.

60
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,580
As nasty as you are,

61
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,873
I knew that if you found out
I was still alive,

62
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,751
you'd come after me all on your own.

63
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,796
What can you three pieces of trash
do to me?

64
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,465
No matter how many of you gang up,
trash is still trash!

65
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,889
They're like landmines.
Alchemy evolves day by day.

66
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,102
There's no such thing
as this kind of alchemy.

67
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,610
Damn it! If these are landmines,

68
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,156
then if I trace your footsteps,
I won't set them off.

69
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,119
How?

70
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,874
They only respond to Homunculi.

71
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,584
Thanks to the snow,

72
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,378
you can't tell what's waiting
in store for you.

73
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,716
Well? How does it feel
to be made a mockery of

74
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,344
by someone you treated like scum
and trash?

75
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,767
We've got him fooled, don't we?
It's just remote transmutation.

76
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,938
Why, you...

77
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,610
Scum should do what scum is told to do.

78
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,656
Don't act so cocky,
you worthless piece of crap!

79
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,674
Doctor!

80
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,724
- That was a close one.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,229
As tubby as he is, he's fast!

82
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,232
Don't sell us pieces of crap short!

83
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,193
Damn it!

84
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,908
You think this two-bit attack
is going to work?

85
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,869
No, huh?

86
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,623
Well then, how do you like this?

87
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,470
Did he get him?

88
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,601
I caught you.

89
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,894
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

90
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,898
Don't you move. I'll snap him like a twig.

91
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,360
Now then, I'll have to give you
your punishment.

92
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:53,742
I told you, Doctor. You try anything
and I'll wipe out the whole village.

93
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,745
I won't let you do that.

94
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,377
You're still resisting?
You really are an idiot.

95
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,721
All right. I'm going to lay waste
to that slum.

96
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,348
Stop!

97
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,351
But simply crushing them
won't be much fun.

98
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,979
Maybe I'll take them back to Central

99
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,815
and use them as ingredients
for Philosopher's Stones.

100
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,275
Why, you!

101
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,195
Are you still having those things
made there?

102
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,615
Let the researchers there-- Let my men go!

103
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,784
Huh? No can do.

104
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:40,288
<i>After all, we've turned them all
</i><i>into a Philosopher's Stone.</i>

105
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,084
What? Not my men, too...

106
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,130
Huh? You mean I didn't tell you?

107
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,927
But Doctor, there's no need
to mourn them now, is there?

108
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,807
I mean, you've made so many
Philosopher's Stones, haven't you?

109
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,726
And used people's lives to do it.

110
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:16,282
Yes. I've sacrificed many people's lives
to make Philosopher's Stones.

111
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,910
I know better than anyone else
in the country

112
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,120
how to make Philosopher's Stones.

113
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,289
And knowing how to make them

114
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,543
means I know how
to destroy them, as well!

115
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,154
What is that?

116
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,573
It's coming from the hill
where the Doctor and the others are.

117
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,172
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

118
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,302
No! This can't...

119
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,470
This can't...

120
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:31,149
No, this can't...
This can't be happening to me, Envy.

121
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,905
There's no way you lower creatures
can beat me.

122
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,324
No. Not the Chimeras, too.

123
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:44,078
Don't look at me.
Don't... Don't look at me.

124
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,749
Don't you look down on me, humans!

125
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,799
Don't look at me, you worms, you filth.
Don't look.

126
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:02,639
This is the guy that was manipulating us?

127
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,063
We beat him, Marcoh.

128
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,863
Oh, they're coming back.

129
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,702
Dr. Marcoh! You're hurt! What happened?

130
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,164
What's that?

131
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:37,090
You were up to something that amazing
without us knowing about it?

132
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,260
That's what you get
for going against us humans,

133
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,387
you little... you little...

134
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,933
Dr. Marcoh,
why would you do something so rash?

135
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,561
Up to now, I've always done
whatever I was told to do.

136
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,857
But this time,
I wanted to settle things myself.

137
00:12:54,941 --> 00:13:00,571
To think and decide for myself.
Like your parents did.

138
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,997
- Still, don't be so reckless, okay?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,541
Hey! Ouch!

140
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:18,798
- Mr. Yoki?
- Help me.

141
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,677
I've taken this guy's body.

142
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,100
Stop this, you monster!
I can't move my body!

143
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,601
No, you can't!

144
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,147
Now, everyone,
if you want me to spare his life...

145
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,942
Nah, do whatever you like.
He's not one of us, after all.

146
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,363
Mr. Yoki, it's been nice knowing you,
even for this short time.

147
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,240
I won't forget about you.

148
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,830
Scar, sir,
you'll take my side, right? Right?

149
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,836
Don't you look away from me!

150
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,755
- Sir, I had faith in you, at least.
- Why?

151
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,548
- I had faith in you.
- He's one of you, isn't he?

152
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,759
Save your breath, Envy.

153
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,304
We've taken the gloves off now.

154
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,766
If you get in our way,
we'll destroy you and that man together!

155
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,143
Damn it!

156
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,979
- He came off.
- Really?

157
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,939
Nice performance.

158
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,361
Bluffing isn't my strong suit.

159
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,823
Damn it all! You guys are not my friends!

160
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,117
I'm through with you!
I'm severing our relationship!

161
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,747
Damn.

162
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,501
Well, I think it's about time
we asked you about your plans.

163
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,252
I don't know anything.

164
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,924
What was that? Spit it out!
Spit it out, you little worm!

165
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,593
Go! Let him have it, Zampano!

166
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,641
After I tell you,
you're just gonna kill me, aren't you?

167
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,686
- You expect me to talk, you fool?
- Damn you!

168
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,107
Come to think of it,
isn't the Fullmetal pipsqueak here?

169
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,777
Brother? He should be back
at Briggs right now.

170
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,073
I heard he's gone missing.

171
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,077
What? What are you talking about? Tell me!

172
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,705
Apparently, the mine shaft
in Baschool caved in.

173
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,833
I wonder if he's still alive.

174
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,794
That's not true.

175
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,639
What do we do? Head back to Baschool?

176
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,476
No. Knowing brother, at a time like this,

177
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,770
I'm sure he would trust
that the other was all right,

178
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,064
and decide to move forward.

179
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,984
That's why we're moving on, too.

180
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,237
There's still hope.

181
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,408
I will go my separate way for now.

182
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,495
There's something
I was thinking a little earlier.

183
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,915
I'm not out to just hold a grudge
against this country for rejecting Ishval.

184
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,667
But to change it...

185
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,381
For that purpose, Marcoh,
I will need your assistance.

186
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,011
All right. I will go with you.

187
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,265
In order to change this country...

188
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,393
Actually, there's a town
I'd kind of like to go to, as well.

189
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,020
Oh, and where is that?

190
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,355
A town called Liore.

191
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,526
If my guess is correct,
that tunnel will be there, too.

192
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,154
<i>- I'm thinking, it'd be the fastest way...
- May, take this.</i>

193
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,614
<i>- ...to destroy it.
- And go back to your land.</i>

194
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,032
<i>- That would buy us some time.
- Hold on, sir!</i>

195
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,367
<i>- And let us figure out how to set up...
- It's what's left of a Homunculus...</i>

196
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,827
<i>- the reverse transmutation circle.
</i><i>- that doesn't die when you kill it.</i>

197
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,205
<i>- By "reverse transmutation circle"...
</i><i>- It may be enough to save your clan.</i>

198
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,915
<i>- You mean that diagram...
- But if I go home...</i>

199
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>- we found earlier, right?
- who will teach you about alkahestry?</i>

200
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,377
Is this any time to be concerned
about someone else's country?

201
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,672
Is that the resolve you had
when you came to this country?

202
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,466
If you lose the power struggle,

203
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,469
are you going to apologize to those
who have entrusted their fate to you

204
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,429
by telling them you
weren't able to save them

205
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,890
because you were involved
in some other country's affairs?

206
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,020
Go on. This country's problems

207
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,939
will be dealt with
by this country's people.

208
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,122
Thank you very much.

209
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,712
May, take care.

210
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,966
Once I get through the basics
of alkahestry,

211
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,676
I'll come to you to learn some more.

212
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,804
Oh, Al.

213
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,516
Al, I...

214
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:49,860
Thank you so much, everyone! Goodbye!

215
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,864
Take care!

216
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,327
There she goes.

217
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,872
- Well then, we should be going, too.
- Yeah.

218
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,099
Mr. Greed.

219
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,861
It's no use. Izumi Curtis went on a trip
with her husband

220
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,655
and no one knows
when they are returning.

221
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,740
There's nothing we can do.

222
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:41,037
For now, I guess we go back
to Fuhrer Bradley and report in.

223
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,496
Bradley.

224
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,713
You're coming with me, Greed.

225
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,091
Let's get him to provide us
with replacements.

226
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,010
Yeah.

227
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:01,474
If I follow them,
I'll find Mr. Greed, but...

228
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,998
Would you mind moving your foot, sister?

229
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:31,420
- Address me as General while we're here.
- Yes, ma'am!

230
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,840
Same old gutless mug as ever, I see.

231
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,803
I hear the fight against Drachma earlier
was a complete victory.

232
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,554
Of course it was!

233
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,850
The countrywide transmutation circle
is about to be finished, isn't it?

234
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,976
I don't care.

235
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,940
Right now, we should be keeping
the peace and security of this country.

236
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,901
If there is a foe that threatens that,
even for a moment,

237
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,114
we must bring them
to overwhelming and utter defeat!

238
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,158
My word, how ferocious.

239
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,787
If you keep this up, you'll never have
anyone ask for your hand--

240
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,456
You are short on fighting spirit!

241
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,795
You scum. I'm going to catch
your cowardice by being around you.

242
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,800
Oh, here you are, General.
Is this your brother?

243
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,387
I hate to think of him as my brother, sir.

244
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,306
Not some coward
who would desert from Ishval.

245
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,186
Come with me.
There's something I'd like to show you.

246
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,569
Do you know the three grand restrictions
of State Alchemy?

247
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,488
As I recall,
they are "do not oppose the military,"

248
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,367
"do not create gold,"
and "do not fashion people."

249
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,577
That is correct.

250
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,955
"Do not oppose the military"
should go without saying.

251
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,584
"Do not create gold" is there
to avoid financial disorder.

252
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,879
But what about "do not fashion people"?

253
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,591
Why does the state prohibit
the creation of people?

254
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,260
Because it is unethical, I suppose.

255
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,262
I've heard that even among alchemists,

256
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,850
it is implicitly forbidden
as sacrilege against God.

257
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,728
That's not why.

258
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:16,984
Ethics is something that varies over time
and among individuals.

259
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,239
That is not where the reason lies.

260
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,451
It is to prevent the individual

261
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,245
from possessing
a powerful military force, General.

262
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,505
This is awful.

263
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,258
Is there anywhere we can get
something to eat here?

264
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,511
Let's see. I know it's around here...

265
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,932
Rose! How have you been?

266
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,228
How are you, Al?
What ? Are you traveling again?

267
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,065
- Oh, you know her?
- Well, yeah, somewhat.

268
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,611
Al, where's Ed? Isn't he with you?

269
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,363
Ah, Brother isn't here today.

270
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,368
That's too bad. I really miss him.

271
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,166
- Oh.
- What?

272
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,626
Oh, I was just wondering

273
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,586
what that subtle expression
on your face was.

274
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,379
Don't go talking crazy!

275
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:47,968
Hey, Rose, I'm finished washing the pots.
Do you have anything else for me to...
