1
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,727
Here.

2
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,191
- Drink up.
- Pinako.

3
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,611
Mind if I join you?

4
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,758
This is nice, once in a while.

5
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,351
You think we're taking it too easy,
don't you?

6
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,482
Where's the harm?
At a time like this, at least.

7
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:33,695
Otherwise, this country is filled
with fighting all year round.

8
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:43,997
What with Ishval and all,
this country is always at war.

9
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>No matter how many times they repeat it,
</i><i>they never learn.</i>

10
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,672
<i>Humans are foolish, miserable creatures.</i>

11
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,697
Between Ishval and these insurgencies,

12
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,783
the Eastern Area is having
a rough time of it, huh?

13
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,535
It's not just the Eastern Area.

14
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,496
There are uprisings and border skirmishes
in the north and west too.

15
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,834
<i>Even now, there are unending
</i><i>skirmishes near the borders</i>

16
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>of Aerugo to the south,
</i><i>and Creta to the west.</i>

17
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,756
We face the huge country
of Drachma to the north.

18
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,343
The bodies are piling up all over,
are they?

19
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,762
The government might just be overthrown
before too long.

20
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,265
What a restless country.

21
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,892
I'd say things started becoming
more militaristic

22
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>once the current FÃ¼hrer,
</i><i>Bradley, came to power.</i>

23
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,197
Hey! Let's dance.

24
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,451
Oh, you're quite popular,
aren't you, Hohenheim?

25
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:08,206
- You can go dance by yourself.
- It's no fun dancing by myself!

26
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,503
This old codger can't do anything fancy,
like dancing.

27
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,339
There, go dance
with those children over there.

28
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,848
It was about at that age...

29
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:30,228
when those boys started thinking
about doing human transmutation.

30
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,366
<i>As their father,
</i><i>you should have said something to them.</i>

31
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,537
Whatever I could have said to them,

32
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,374
it wouldn't change the reality
of what they have to atone for.

33
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,254
- That's pretty harsh.
- A sin is a sin.

34
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>Damn it all!</i>

35
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,511
It's been taken away!

36
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:09,059
Help! Someone! Mom! Mom...

37
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:28,245
No... this is wrong. This isn't--

38
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,413
this isn't what we wanted!

39
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,042
Al... Alphonse...

40
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,754
Alphonse! Alphonse!

41
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,589
This is my fault...

42
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,216
Alphonse!

43
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,679
Damn it! Damn it!

44
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,932
Give him back! He's my brother!

45
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,309
Take my leg! Take my arm!

46
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,562
Take my heart! You can have it!

47
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:59,234
So, give him back! He's my only brother!

48
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,413
The celestial stone
that destroyed Xerxes in one night.

49
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,918
If only I had that, I might be able
to get your body back, Al.

50
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:22,090
Doctor, just what was it
that you were ordered to research?

51
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,843
The Philosopher's Stone.

52
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,432
You must not seek this thing.
It is the devil's research!

53
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,434
If you learn about it,
you will pass through.

54
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:38,148
This is the devil's research,
which shouldn't be pursued.

55
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,899
Curse you, Dr. Marcoh.

56
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,029
The ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone

57
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,489
are live humans!

58
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,518
So weak, huh?

59
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,190
They're afraid of the dark
and won't confront it,

60
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:25,320
instead trying to forget about it
and run away temporarily like that.

61
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,324
Humans are very weak creatures.

62
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,579
Well, what do you say
we make the most use of them,

63
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,457
as our valued resources?

64
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,961
Hohenheim?

65
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,765
Knowing you, you'll be able to find
the truth within the truth.

66
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,479
What is this?

67
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,107
Is it possible that this is
for transmuting a Philosopher's Stone?

68
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,195
Let's have a look at what you've got.

69
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,534
Your prosthetic arm just saved your life.

70
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,871
However, my trusty sword
will pierce even steel!

71
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,694
- My brother...
- I hate to say it, but we've lost.

72
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,822
You're not going to tell me
you're actually three brothers, are you?

73
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,032
- No, no.
- No, no.

74
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:59,914
- Kid, hurry up and destroy us.
- Don't ask me to become a murderer.

75
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,125
With bodies like these,
are we even people?

76
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,506
If I don't consider you to be people,

77
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,676
then that would mean I don't consider
my brother to be a person.

78
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,349
My brother is human.
You guys are also human.

79
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,895
That's why I don't want to kill you.

80
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,067
Brother?

81
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,819
We two, as brothers, have been stealing,

82
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,323
destroying, and killing
for as long as we can remember.

83
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,658
And now, to be treated as humans
for the first time

84
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,912
after taking the forms we have...

85
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,955
it's hilarious!

86
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,834
Kid, as a parting gift,
I will tell you everything.

87
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,836
The ones who made
the Philosopher's Stone,

88
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,048
and ordered us to protect this place--

89
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,760
That was a close one.

90
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,474
No, 48, we can't have you
speaking out of turn.

91
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,898
Pipe down, you halfwit!

92
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,400
You were just about to kill
one of our precious sacrifices.

93
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,610
Do you understand?

94
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:18,576
Who are you people? What plan?
What do you mean, "sacrifice"?

95
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,830
You are a sacrifice after all.

96
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,834
Right! I'm a sacrifice.

97
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,336
<i>What does that mean, "sacrifice"?</i>

98
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:34,259
<i>Their teacher would make good material
</i><i>for a sacrifice as well.</i>

99
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:41,141
I'm sorry. You were a candidate
for sacrifice, but you must die now.

100
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:48,439
I've been thinking all this time...

101
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,820
what is a sacrifice?
What is it you're trying to make me do?

102
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,738
Liore...

103
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,160
Uprisings all over...
the Philosopher's Stone...

104
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,744
ingredients are humans...

105
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,123
what we did in Ishval...

106
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,837
Hey, now, who was it
that came up with this?

107
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,217
What you're doing right now
is using this land and its people

108
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,845
to create a giant transmutation circle?

109
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,391
<i>The purpose of which is to create
</i><i>a Philosopher's Stone.</i>

110
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

111
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,657
<i>You actually knew about this, didn't you?</i>

112
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,827
Hohenheim...

113
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,164
why didn't you tell anyone?

114
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,875
Hohenheim!

115
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,672
Even if I'd told someone,
would it have changed anything?

116
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,639
I've been watching for a long time

117
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,436
as humanity keeps repeating
the same mistakes over and over.

118
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:15,234
How helpless they are each time
and can do nothing but run away.

119
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,160
Humans are very fragile.

120
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:30,124
I told you,
the Philosopher's Stone is my core.

121
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,126
<i>I'm a Homunculus.</i>

122
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:37,882
You know of them, right?
An artificially created person.

123
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,093
That's what I am.

124
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,889
We're all going to die here anyway.

125
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,267
Let me show you something neat
before you pass on.

126
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,863
Can I eat you?

127
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,036
Mustang!

128
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,334
<i>That monster was keeping
</i><i>another monster inside his belly!</i>

129
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>He's swallowing up everything around him!</i>

130
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,633
<i>So alchemy can even produce
</i><i>something like this?</i>

131
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,138
Who are you, old man?

132
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:39,110
Just as you have your Ultimate Shield,
I have my Ultimate Eye.

133
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,294
<i>I get it, Hughes.</i>

134
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,796
<i>When you said the military was in trouble,</i>

135
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,384
<i>you didn't mean the danger
</i><i>was closing in on us.</i>

136
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,678
<i>You meant the military itself
</i><i>was the source of the trouble.</i>

137
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:15,188
- Father? You have a dad?
- Yes.

138
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,400
- The person who made the Homunculi?
- Yes, he made us.

139
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:29,410
<i>People have neither an Ultimate Spear,
</i><i>nor an Ultimate Shield.</i>

140
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,750
Nonetheless, they get snared
by the most trivial things,

141
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,919
and are unable to bounce back.

142
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,677
What do you think folks like that
can do against the Homunculi?

143
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,263
Still, we won't give up.

144
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,185
Like hell we'll give up!

145
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,195
<i>That's something else about humans, huh?</i>

146
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,824
How did you get here with your wound?

147
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,450
I burned it closed.

148
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,286
I nearly passed out
two or three times too.

149
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,544
No matter how much you try,
you cannot beat me!

150
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,800
Now then,
why don't you tell me your secret?

151
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,096
Thanks.

152
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,516
The blood that had rushed
to my head has settled a bit,

153
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,226
and my brain is starting to cool off.

154
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,861
You're still going to put up a fight?
Would you go down and stay down?

155
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:57,331
There are a lot of things
that are inconvenient about this body.

156
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,625
But inconvenient
does not equal ill-fortuned!

157
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,752
There's no reason for anyone
to take pity on me!

158
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,549
Brother saved my life with alchemy.

159
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:12,555
To disavow who I am now would be
to disavow Brother, and alchemy.

160
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:17,310
I believe in the possibilities of alchemy.
I want to believe!

161
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,895
He's a State Alchemist!

162
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,030
Get down!

163
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,164
Stay with me. Don't you die.

164
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,465
Damn, I can't stop the bleeding.

165
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
Somebody!

166
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,689
Live! You must not die!

167
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,568
Lan Fan! Get out of here!

168
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,613
Lan Fan!

169
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,534
- My left arm...
- What's wrong?

170
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,955
Young Lord...
I am no longer of any use to you.

171
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,624
Lan Fan!

172
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:23,960
Stop!

173
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,463
Nicely played.

174
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,138
<i>Whether we're trampled or beaten down,</i>

175
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,224
<i>time and again, we keep going on.</i>

176
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,685
And then, someday...

177
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,107
- It's just struggling in vain.
- You never can tell unless you try!

178
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,901
It's better than knowing and not acting.

179
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:56,284
Are you sure you're okay with Ed, Al,
and everyone else disappearing?

180
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,375
What are you getting so desperate about?

181
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,631
Even if you do take action
on behalf of those humans,

182
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,260
they'll just end up dying
on their own, won't they?

183
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,598
We're just going to wind up with nothing.

184
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,643
So then, don't you think it's smart
to take only what's important

185
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,564
and flee to somewhere else right away?

186
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,190
Wha--

187
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,779
Pangs of conscience? Worthless sentiment?

188
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,866
Hohenheim?

189
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:44,415
Whatever you think,
nobody is going to accept you now.

190
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,087
Look at your own face!

191
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,346
<i>Humans are nothing but a resource.</i>

192
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,849
<i>If you leave them to themselves,
</i><i>they'll proliferate on their own.</i>

193
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,103
<i>Where is the need for you
</i><i>to take any action?</i>

194
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,608
<i>What will change if you do? This reality?</i>

195
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,112
<i>How weak humans are?</i>

196
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,127
We will change.

197
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,632
We can change. I'm sure of it.

198
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,760
Sure, we may be weak,

199
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,973
but it's for that reason that we try hard
to grow stronger.

200
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,143
You may consider our steps to be futile,

201
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,190
but each step we take,
we are most surely building something.

202
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,528
<i>Those below me
</i><i>will protect those below them.</i>

203
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,198
We tiny humans should be able to do
that much, at least.

204
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,327
No... I wasn't prepared for this.

205
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,332
We don't have to act so brave.
Lan Fan was more ready than I was.

206
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:13,379
I'm sick of people dying before my eyes.
I've had enough!

207
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,549
The graffiti flower that someone
was drawing on the wall trembles

208
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,718
I won't let anyone get killed anymore!
I'll protect them!

209
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,929
I'm not about to run away!

210
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,015
We'll send that Truth bastard flying,
and pull your body out of there!

211
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,434
Al!

212
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,687
Al! Come here!

213
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,189
Hurry, over here! Al!

214
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,194
Alphonse!

215
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,867
Alphonse! Alphonse!

216
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,369
Just you wait!

217
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,998
So I'm sure we can change.

218
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,375
Because we are weak. Because we die.

219
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,380
We struggle to live,
and we become stronger.

220
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,885
And if your mind still isn't made up...

221
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,180
try to remember...

222
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,477
the days we spent together in Resembool.

223
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,651
It was a dream?

224
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,839
Thanks for your help.
