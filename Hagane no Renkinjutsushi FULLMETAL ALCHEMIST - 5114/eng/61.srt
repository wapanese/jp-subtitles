1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,255
The sun is a he.
It represents masculinity.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,217
The moon is a she.
It represents femininity.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,305
When the sun and the moon intersect,
it means both genders in one.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,350
In other words,
it represents a perfect being.

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,104
I wonder if by "perfect being,"
it means immortality.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,607
Or something even more incredible?

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,859
Even more incredible?

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,738
Like say, God or something.

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,536
Yes, come to me!

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,998
I will continue to be bound
by you no longer!

11
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:46,129
I shall drag you down to the earth,
and make you a part of me!

12
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,020
Is everyone all right? What happened?

13
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,606
Well done, my sacrifices.

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,530
You actually did it!

15
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,574
Yeah.

16
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,619
I have acquired... God.

17
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,955
God?! How can that be?

18
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,460
It's possible, given a large enough
amount of energy.

19
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,212
Energy... a Philosopher's Stone?!

20
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,590
It can't be...

21
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,551
you mean, everyone was turned
into a Philosopher's Stone?

22
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,220
Just how many people were sacrificed...?

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,975
The population of this country
is about 50 million.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,234
You bastard!

25
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,073
Damn!

26
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,241
Your alchemy is bound.

27
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,619
Farewell, gentlemen.

28
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,455
What are you doing?

29
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,500
Now that I have obtained God,

30
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,962
it is even possible for me
to create suns in the palm of my hand.

31
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,680
Shall I turn it loose in here?

32
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,687
From the moment
that you obtained God or whatever,

33
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,066
we had already started
turning the tables on you.

34
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:21,868
Over many long years,
I calculated and calculated,

35
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:26,498
<i>arranging the Philosopher's Stones,
</i><i>the friends inside me,</i>

36
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,709
<i>in preparation for this day.</i>

37
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,676
<i>The time has come.</i>

38
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,430
<i>He has done that which must not be done.</i>

39
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,517
<i>There are no longer bodies
</i><i>for us to return to.</i>

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>However, the people of Amestris
</i><i>do have bodies to go back to.</i>

41
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:55,694
<i>Yes. Let's return their souls
</i><i>back to their bodies.</i>

42
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,947
<i>It is what Hohenheim asked of us.</i>

43
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:05,954
You just drove in Philosopher's Stones?
But they are merely points.

44
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,582
Without a circle, they will not activate.

45
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,459
That is a fundamental of alchemy.

46
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,253
But we do have a circle.

47
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,255
Something with such enormous power,

48
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:20,969
it would activate on its own,
even if something were to happen to me!

49
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,476
<i>The shadow of the moon,
</i><i>cast upon the Earth by the eclipse!</i>

50
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,730
<i>We're going on ahead, Hohenheim.</i>

51
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,741
You would block me,
no matter what, Hohenheim?

52
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:48,747
That is the reason I came here,
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus!

53
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,922
- Winry, are you all right?
- What was that just now?

54
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,468
Did we all lose consciousness?

55
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,972
- Ms. Pinako, you too?
- So it would seem.

56
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,141
But that was...

57
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,435
How would you even describe it?
It was like...

58
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,066
It felt like we were inside
a vortex of anguish.

59
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,030
Did it work?

60
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,576
The souls of the people of Amestris
have each returned to their own bodies.

61
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,122
And with just the souls
of the Xerxesians that he already had,

62
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,709
I doubt he can keep
what he calls God suppressed.

63
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,509
I can always create
another Philosopher's Stone.

64
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,054
Using a hundred million
or even a billion!

65
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,933
There is no shortage of the energy
that humans are!

66
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,533
May!

67
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,911
Reading the flow of power in the ground

68
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,538
and making use of it
is an alkahestrist's stock in trade.

69
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,583
What's more, the greater the power
the other side has,

70
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,253
the greater my own power becomes.

71
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,255
Mister, dead ahead!

72
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,266
Damn. I don't have what it takes
to cancel out his energy!

73
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,356
Please hang in there, mister.
My defensive array is crumbling!

74
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,444
It's no use!

75
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,118
- Dad, hang in there!
- Come on, you bastard! Stay focused!

76
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,373
What can I say?

77
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:22,794
I'm just a foolish old man,
but now I want to show off what I've got!

78
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,631
If this doesn't end soon,

79
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,717
the Philosopher's Stone
inside Dad will run out!

80
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,720
Aren't you done yet, Scar?

81
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,223
Ishvalan!

82
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,852
I thought that alchemy,
the construction of matter,

83
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:44,107
was blasphemy against Ishvala,
the creator of all things!

84
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,156
Have you abandoned your god?

85
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,247
Is that all that your god is...

86
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,128
to you people?

87
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,212
Nay!

88
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,675
During the Ishvalan Civil War...

89
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
when you were steeped in despair...

90
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,689
you must have thought,
somewhere in your heart,

91
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,693
that there was no god
anywhere in this world!

92
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:10,819
I never believed in fate or God,
but I suppose it can be said of this

93
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,364
that Providence has taken
no favor with me.

94
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,791
The heavens have sent me
a rather dashing visitor.

95
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:32,090
Here to avenge your grandfather?
Very well.

96
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,385
- Any last words?
- None.

97
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,306
Such a sad life, King Bradley.

98
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,812
Didn't you love anybody?
Your friends? Your wife?

99
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,439
My wife?

100
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,776
Are you saying
you have nothing to say to her?

101
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,695
When she finds out
that you are a Homunculus...

102
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,073
Do not befoul yourself
with such trivial words

103
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,076
as "sad" and "love," young lady.

104
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:05,832
Do not mock me.
She is the woman that I chose.

105
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,961
There is no need
for any last words between us.

106
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,215
That is what it is to be the wife
of a king.

107
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,014
While engaging yourself
in pointless questions,

108
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,018
you've missed your chance
at vengeance, young lady.

109
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:36,154
My life was lived on the rails
that were laid down for me,

110
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:42,952
but thanks to you humans,
it was, to some degree,

111
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:48,458
a good life, one worth living.

112
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,095
I'm sensing life.

113
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,057
It's a Philosopher's Stone.

114
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,476
This?

115
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,396
Are you all right?

116
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,945
- Take me over there.
- The transmutation circle is broken.

117
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:23,076
No matter!
Over there is where the center is.

118
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,160
All right.

119
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,210
<i>Brother...</i>

120
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,799
<i>To tell you the truth,
</i><i>the hatred inside me is not gone,</i>

121
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:42,720
<i>and yet I am about to help Amestris,
</i><i>the object of my hatred.</i>

122
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,725
<i>Brother, you spoke of positive streams
</i><i>and negative streams...</i>

123
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,980
<i>but as I paradoxically carry
</i><i>both of them...</i>

124
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,111
<i>I wonder which way I will flow.</i>

125
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,168
Here it comes!

126
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:34,063
Take that! The seat that you
so arrogantly reclined in is now rubble!

127
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,234
You've been so self-indulgent,
you bastard.

128
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,989
I'm gonna kick your ass,
right along with that damn truth!

129
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,955
Was that alkahestry just now?

130
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,500
No, it's what my brother came up with.

131
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,213
My brother researched alchemy.

132
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:03,843
As he expanded beyond it,
he began to research alkahestry too.

133
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,848
<i>Alkahestry is an art that uses
</i><i>the flow of chi through the Earth.</i>

134
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,729
<i>The alchemy of this country
</i><i>uses tectonic energy.</i>

135
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,066
<i>However, my brother realized something.</i>

136
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,070
<i>Alchemists weren't able to use it
</i><i>to full measure.</i>

137
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,948
There was an inhibiting component

138
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,909
between the alchemist
and the tectonic energy.

139
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,913
I felt it when I entered this country...

140
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:36,084
a sensation like people
were crawling around under the ground.

141
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,668
Yes.

142
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,796
<i>That was probably
</i><i>the Philosopher's Stone</i>

143
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,508
<i>that stretches out underground
</i><i>throughout the land.</i>

144
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,968
Take that! And that!

145
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:57,146
Mister, you created a transmutation circle
that returned everyone's souls?

146
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,608
Yeah, and it worked.

147
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,653
The reverse transmutation circle
which Scar activated

148
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,572
is there to correct
the alchemy of this country.

149
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,660
After all of Scar's brother's
long research,

150
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>he was skeptical
</i><i>about this country's alchemy...</i>

151
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,917
<i>and went on to discover the existence
</i><i>of the nationwide transmutation circle.</i>

152
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,797
<i>And so, using it as a base,
</i><i>he superscribed it in alkahestry</i>

153
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,924
<i>and developed
</i><i>a reverse transmutation circle</i>

154
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,927
<i>that would render
</i><i>the Philosopher's Stone ineffective.</i>

155
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,848
<i>Now we can use the tectonic energy</i>

156
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,934
<i>inhibited by the Philosopher's Stone
</i><i>to its full extent.</i>

157
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,157
Keep pouring it on!
Make him use his Philosopher's Stone!

158
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,367
At some point, he will run out of energy!

159
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,411
But when?

160
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,289
I don't know!
I don't know, but you have to keep it up!

161
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,748
Take this!

162
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,095
That takes me back.

163
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,639
If it isn't the tub
I took a bath in earlier!

164
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,101
You have one too, Daddy, sir.

165
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,769
Move it, Greed!

166
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,827
Don't move!

167
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,830
Take it nice and easy.

168
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,628
- Lieutenant Hawkeye?
- Major.

169
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,009
What the...?

170
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,228
That rat.
He went to go make a Philosopher's Stone.

171
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,151
- After him!
- Right!

172
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,488
And we'll get you to a safe place
while we're at it.

173
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,864
Sorry.

174
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,367
I didn't expect to be so useless
at such a critical time.

175
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,535
Brother!

176
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,204
Al! Go on ahead!

177
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,500
He appears to want something from me.

178
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,383
Al, let's go!
Don't you let yourself get beaten, Ed!

179
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,759
Right!

180
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,516
Dear!

181
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,601
Izumi!

182
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,855
This is no time to relax.
Look after the colonel.

183
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,107
Right.

184
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,442
Colonel!

185
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,531
There's someone up there
that we have to eliminate, so we're off.

186
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,994
- Are you injured, Colonel?
- My eyes have had it.

187
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,874
Lieutenant, what is the status
of your injuries?

188
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,254
You're doing it again!
Please, worry about yourself. Your eyes...

189
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,007
Can you still fight?

190
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,886
Yes, sir!

191
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,356
- Young Lord!
- It's Greed.

192
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,568
Sheesh, you tagged along all the way here?

193
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,571
Wrath...

194
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,576
Oh... he's dead.

195
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,916
He looks so content. Pisses me off.

196
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,630
Greed, it's pathetic
that you would throw away your honor

197
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,714
as a Homunculus.

198
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,302
Why are you guys so obedient
to that father of yours?

199
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,889
What a senseless question to ask.

200
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,808
It's only natural that we would obey
our own father, isn't it?

201
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,811
You're the one who's senseless.

202
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,105
"Only natural," you say?

203
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,859
You're just a mindless punk
who doesn't try to think for himself!

204
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:20,076
I don't get it.
Why are you his willing lapdog?

205
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:26,165
You've been worn as ragged as you now are,
and you don't even care.

206
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,003
So what?

207
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,297
Please don't go applying

208
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:37,259
your human sensibilities
onto us Homunculi!

209
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,687
This container won't last much longer.

210
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,650
However, since you, like my father,
are of Hohenheim's blood,

211
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,485
we are virtually brothers.

212
00:19:55,361 --> 00:20:00,616
Edward Elric, give your container,
your body, to me!

213
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,411
What?

214
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,792
You cannot have it.

215
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,963
Indeed, you cannot have it,
Homunculus Pride.

216
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,924
Kimblee! It can't be!

217
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,301
There's no way
you could maintain your individuality

218
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,929
among this tempest of souls!

219
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,808
Tempest? Please, don't make me laugh.

220
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,854
These voices of bitterness
are like a lullaby to me.

221
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,191
Why are you interfering, Kimblee?

222
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,072
Yes, well, if you had kept your honor
as a Homunculus as you fought,

223
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,324
I would have done nothing.

224
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:46,829
You speak of your pride
or honor as a Homunculus,

225
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,082
but the moment any danger befalls you,

226
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,002
you try to escape
into the container of a human,

227
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,213
the lower life form
that you look down on.

228
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,466
Quite unbecoming of you.

229
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,517
<i>He's going to kill me!</i>

230
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,647
You do not understand Edward Elric.

231
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,282
Selim!

232
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,535
Impossible. He's turned himself
into a Philosopher's Stone,

233
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,621
and now he's forcing his way inside me?

234
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,626
I've caught you, Selim!

235
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,252
Stop.

236
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,088
Stop.

237
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,637
Please stop!

238
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,448
So that's your real body, huh?

239
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:11,664
Once this is all over,
I'll have to go apologize to Mrs. Bradley.

240
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,210
You wait right there, Selim, you fool!

241
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,007
Mama.

242
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,635
Mama.
