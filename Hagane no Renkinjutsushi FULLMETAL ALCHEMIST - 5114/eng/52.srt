1
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,765
- A Philosopher's Stone.
- Where did he get one of those?

2
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,147
Dust in our eyes again?

3
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,692
I won't fall for that again.

4
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,075
A flash bomb.

5
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,328
It was a decoy!

6
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,041
That's a Philosopher's Stone for you.

7
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,794
From one trick to the next...

8
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:05,977
Indeed, the power of a Philosopher's Stone
is something to behold.

9
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,107
I've used one myself, so I would know.

10
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,068
Which is why I'm puzzled.

11
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:19,157
Why do you not use that power
to get your own body back?

12
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,789
With the stone, it would be an easy matter
for you to flee from us.

13
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,041
And once you've gotten away,
you could use the stone,

14
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,460
and the two of you could return
to your original bodies.

15
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,965
Then your journey would end, wouldn't it?

16
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,217
If I did that, I couldn't save everyone.

17
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,595
So it's to fulfill
your earnest wish, then.

18
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:45,934
In order to obtain something,
you have to discard something else.

19
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,477
Tell me.

20
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,355
Why are there only two choices?

21
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,944
It's not right that I can only choose

22
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,615
between "return to our original bodies"
and "save everyone."

23
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:07,914
Why isn't "return to our original bodies
and save everyone" among our choices?

24
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,252
What about the Law of Equivalent Exchange?

25
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,257
I think that seeking possibilities
without being bound by laws

26
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,135
is necessary for mankind to advance.

27
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,806
I see. So you're saying
that if it comes to pass,

28
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,935
it will be acknowledged
as a new law by the world.

29
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,188
Is that right?

30
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,737
In that case,
there is one other possibility.

31
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,238
"You don't get back your bodies

32
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:45,494
and you don't save everyone"
must be one of the choices.

33
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,259
I'm not through yet!

34
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,108
Good. Under his skin, he's vulnerable.

35
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:26,201
I'm dying. What a bother.

36
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,997
Dying is a bother.

37
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,544
What a bother.

38
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,343
- Fighting all-out is an ultra-bother.
- What?

39
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,723
General Armstrong,
throw down your weapon and--

40
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,561
What is that huge thing?

41
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,786
What was that?

42
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,206
I missed.

43
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,509
What speed.

44
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,846
- Sloth the Indolent.
- Sister.

45
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,557
He grazed me slightly.

46
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,146
- Did you see him just now?
- Only the blur.

47
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,815
For him to move with that speed
as heavy as he is...

48
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,568
No way, that's below the belt.

49
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:47,449
Yes, I am the fastest Homunculus.

50
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,288
Alex!

51
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,293
He's too fast
to be able to control himself.

52
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,795
Oh, no--

53
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,303
Finally hit you.

54
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,732
Mm, I love that sound.

55
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,109
Is there anything that strikes
a more beautiful note

56
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,112
than the sound of two strong wills
colliding with each other?

57
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:35,497
- Alphonse Elric is still close by.
- Indeed, he is.

58
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,292
It will take more than that to kill him.

59
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,508
There!

60
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:59,396
Dust in our eyes again?
How artless. It won't work.

61
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,367
I told you, I can tell where you are
by your smell.

62
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,869
Checkmate.

63
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,205
I'm not so sure.

64
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,375
This is the part where we humans
show off how tenacious we are.

65
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,214
Even with a Philosopher's Stone,

66
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,966
there's no way you can win
all on your own.

67
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,718
I'm not alone!

68
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,180
Where is the stone?

69
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,144
<i>It can't be.</i>

70
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,356
<i>The purpose of this smokescreen</i>

71
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,608
<i>was to let him know
</i><i>the direction of the wind?</i>

72
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:51,239
<i>He's set something up downwind
</i><i>where my sense of smell won't work.</i>

73
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,035
<i>An attack from behind?</i>

74
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,922
<i>Impossible. How can he be mobile
</i><i>with those injuries?</i>

75
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,472
Doctor Marcoh!

76
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,525
It was an ice cream truck, right?

77
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,111
Yeah, don't let it get past you.

78
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,616
Alchemy really is handy, isn't it?

79
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,119
Changing the outer appearance
of the vehicle is no trouble at all.

80
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,043
We can't get in here, either.

81
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,880
North, south, east, and west,
the command center's gates are all closed.

82
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,675
What do we do? Force our way in?

83
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,598
No, leave the overt, heavy-handed stuff to
the Briggs fellows.

84
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,810
- We'll take a more covert route.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,686
We'll split up here.

86
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,897
You guys accompany the missus

87
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,608
- and head for you-know-where.
- Roger that.

88
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,418
It's a good thing I'm so beefy.

89
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,342
That's the Philosopher's Stone for you,
I guess you could say.

90
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,182
The legs! Go for the legs!

91
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,782
What?

92
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:48,750
- Alex?
- Oh, it's just dislocated. You, sister?

93
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,211
Just some fractures.

94
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,234
Sister!

95
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,123
Kill you quick and then sleep.

96
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,971
You stopped?

97
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:54,732
<i>He's reluctant to stab through Kimblee.
</i><i>But that's not like him.</i>

98
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,152
I see.

99
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,281
The humanity you speak of is tenacious.

100
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,910
However, you still cannot win.

101
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,291
Not as long as our father is over there.

102
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,216
But then, before we get to that,

103
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,512
you must do something
about the situation you're in now.

104
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,942
Who's that?

105
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,660
I got you. I got you!

106
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,415
- Yoki?
- All right, way to go, fuzzy-lip.

107
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,085
I never expected you to show up.

108
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,005
No way am I letting you guys
be the only ones to play hero!

109
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,549
Let me have a chance
to show off too, damn it!

110
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,176
How about that?

111
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,554
I, Yoki, just landed a shot
on the strongest Homunculus!

112
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,015
I popped him good!

113
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,350
Where did you get the car?

114
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,895
<i>It's the one Kimblee rode here in.</i>

115
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,149
<i>The guys who were driving it
</i><i>are taking a little time-out.</i>

116
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,652
Nice going, Doctor Marcoh.

117
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,991
Move it!

118
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,259
Shut up and drive! Floor it!

119
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,722
I don't feel like fighting
that monster head-on.

120
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,891
Head for the city limits.

121
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,061
We'll join up with Ed
and clobber that "Father" guy

122
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,771
before that thing catches us.

123
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,660
Those brave, stalwart humans
sure are easy to dupe.

124
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,297
Good. You're still alive.

125
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,472
Your suit has taken on a nice color,
hasn't it, Kimblee?

126
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,393
They're called the kings of beasts
and rightly so.

127
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,312
He followed the law
of survival of the fittest

128
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,108
and easily bit right through
your windpipe.

129
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:50,199
Sure enough, humans are beings
of little consequence in this world.

130
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,130
You were always saying
how you wanted to see

131
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,174
what the world would choose, huh?

132
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:14,182
And so, for you to perish in a place
such as this must be fairly humiliating.

133
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,608
But not to worry.

134
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:31,365
You will go on living, inside of me.

135
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,513
What just happened?

136
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,726
Alex.

137
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,150
I knew he was going to come
charging in all on his own,

138
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,902
so all I had to do was wait for him.

139
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,993
Sister, can you stand up?

140
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,709
Come to think of it,
there are orders out to shoot me.

141
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,420
What? We can't have that.

142
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,507
I will be the one to inherit
the Armstrong household,

143
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,552
so I can't have you die
until the paperwork is in place.

144
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,932
You need not worry about that.
If I die, the mansion goes to Mustang.

145
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,935
You made that promise
without even consulting the family?

146
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:45,439
He's still one smidgen more preferable
than a good-for-nothing like you.

147
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,943
Is that any attitude to have
towards someone who came to save you?

148
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,488
What is this?

149
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,122
- An enemy attack?
- It can't be Mustang's squad.

150
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,702
What are they?

151
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,373
- They won't die when we shoot them!
- Are they Briggs soldiers?

152
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,708
You idiots!

153
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:51,422
Don't you compare my robust men
to those puny tenderfoots.

154
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,549
They're probably the same as this guy.

155
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:59,138
The one who gave you your orders
must have sent them out.

156
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,433
We don't know anything about this!

157
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:07,813
Apparently, they don't care
whether or not you knew.

158
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:20,326
What will it be? My brother and I can deal
with these monsters.

159
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,744
But...

160
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,772
Well, what will it be?

161
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,193
Are you going to shoot us
then fall prey to these monsters?

162
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,154
Or are you going to work with us
and shoot the monsters?

163
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,658
Make up your own minds!

164
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,163
Why, you--!

165
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,878
Not again!

166
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,852
It's no use.

167
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,981
These mannequin soldiers have been infused
with Philosopher's Stones.

168
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,108
You can't kill them that easily.

169
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,323
See? That's what you get
for running away from me.

170
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,456
I've absorbed some more
and grown even stronger now, haven't I?

171
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,628
You don't get it.

172
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,965
When those mannequins come
in large numbers, that spells trouble,

173
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,217
but running away from you is simple.

174
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,261
Silence!

175
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,771
<i>These mannequins have been infused
</i><i>with Philosopher's Stones.</i>

176
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,439
<i>That's why they don't die.</i>

177
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,650
<i>Their immortality comes
</i><i>from the Philosopher's Stones, all right.</i>

178
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,364
<i>To save my clan, immortality will be mine.</i>

179
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,666
- It hurts.
- It hurts.

180
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:38,172
They're still coming?
There's no end to them!

181
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,307
- I'm gonna run out of quills!
- My saliva is starting to go dry, too.

182
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,316
Damn it!

183
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,695
- Oh, crap!
- Ed!

184
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,917
Things are always rowdy wherever you are.

185
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:23,133
Would it be okay
if I lend you a hand, Fullmetal?
