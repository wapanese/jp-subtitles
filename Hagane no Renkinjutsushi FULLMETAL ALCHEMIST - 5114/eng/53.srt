1
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,633
What in the world is going on?

2
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,302
- What is happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,637
Rumor has it that Colonel Mustang
is up to something.

4
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,973
- Are you sure?
- It's just what I've heard.

5
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,018
Hey! The radio! Turn on the radio!

6
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,188
- To Radio Capital!
- Radio Capital?

7
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:50,611
- Yeah. Something amazing is going on!
- That station is so boring.

8
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:54,823
Just do it! Hurry before the military
shuts down their broadcast!

9
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,663
<i>Is that what you were saying,
</i><i>Mrs. Bradley?</i>

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,081
Mrs. Bradley?

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:10,088
<i>Yes, the Central forces...
</i><i>attempted to kill me.</i>

12
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:17,721
You mean, they pointed guns at your head
and demonstrated intent to shoot you?

13
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,556
That is right.

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,978
They said, "You're free to shoot her,
along with Colonel Mustang's men."

15
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,191
<i>Fuhrer Bradley has gone east
</i><i>to conduct an inspection</i>

16
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,735
<i>and is not currently in Central.</i>

17
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,445
<i>Yes.</i>

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,698
<i>So then, somebody centrally located
</i><i>was waiting for His Excellency to leave</i>

19
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,994
<i>- so they could stage a coup d'état?
</i><i>- That I do not know.</i>

20
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,790
- Is that really Mrs. Bradley?
- I've heard her voice before.

21
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,084
<i>- Be that as it may, Mrs. Bradley...
- It's really her.</i>

22
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>...under the circumstances,</i>

23
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,587
<i>it's a good thing your son
</i><i>is somewhere other than Central.</i>

24
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>I have not been able to contact my son.</i>

25
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,093
<i>- You haven't? That's just--
- You're kidding.</i>

26
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,597
- Poor thing.
- I wonder if little Selim is all right.

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,307
<i>Please try to keep your composure,
</i><i>Mrs. Bradley.</i>

28
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,517
A coup d'état?

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,604
<i>- Thank goodness that you are safe.
- Can anyone run this country?</i>

30
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,942
<i>Truly, if Colonel Mustang
</i><i>had not saved me,</i>

31
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,194
<i>I don't know what would have become of me.</i>

32
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,823
<i>I see. So Colonel Mustang
</i><i>saw this coup d'état coming?</i>

33
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,658
Mustang?

34
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,537
<i>So, then, could you please tell us...</i>

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,665
- the exact circumstances of your rescue?
- Yes.

36
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,334
You haven't told her...

37
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,129
- ...that Selim is a Homunculus yet?
- When the guns were pointed at me...

38
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,256
- We couldn't tell her.
- ...I closed my eyes and prayed to God.

39
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,175
- She doesn't know the Fuhrer is missing.
- When I heard the gunshots,

40
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,679
I thought it was all over for me...
but then--

41
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,435
The madam hasn't been told this yet,
but the truth is, yesterday,

42
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,062
the train that the Fuhrer
was aboard in the east

43
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,565
was blown up by someone.

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,276
His Excellency is now missing.

45
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,198
Mrs. Bradley!

46
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,951
Are you all right?

47
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,705
Mrs. Bradley does not appear
to be feeling well right now,

48
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,708
having been overwhelmed
by all that is happening.

49
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,589
Still, what do you mean
His Excellency, the Fuhrer, is missing?

50
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,846
Colonel Mustang has harbored suspicions
about the senior staff.

51
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,641
Since before all this,
they suspected they would do something.

52
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,477
Now, with the bombing
of the Fuhrer's train

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,272
and permission being given
to fire on Mrs. Bradley,

54
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,566
matters have become clear.

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,571
There is a faction among the senior staff
attempting to eliminate His Excellency.

56
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,242
You fool! Shut down
that broadcast immediately!

57
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,828
You know what will happen
if you don't do so!

58
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,081
It doesn't matter what you say, I can't.

59
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:55,086
They have taken hostages
and they're pointing guns at us, too.

60
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,838
We can't move a muscle here.

61
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:02,344
There are so many perpetrators here.
We can't do anything.

62
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,348
Give me Mustang!
I will speak to him directly!

63
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,726
The... colonel?

64
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,444
Don't shoot me!

65
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,697
Forgive me, I beg you!

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,211
- So, how was I?
- Perfect.

67
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,214
All right, don't stop broadcasting!

68
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,340
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

69
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,218
I'm not about to let this story
get away from us!

70
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,887
<i>Now, continuing on, here is a message</i>

71
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,390
<i>from one of Colonel Mustang's men
</i><i>who helped rescue Mrs. Bradley.</i>

72
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,101
So Colonel Mustang
isn't staging a coup d'état?

73
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>Those of us who support Colonel Mustang
</i><i>may not be all that powerful,</i>

74
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>but we will carry on,</i>

75
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,358
<i>- His Excellency...
- That voice.</i>

76
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,695
...the Fuhrer's will, and we are prepared
to use all our strength

77
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,489
to bring down those cowardly men
in the name of justice.

78
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,245
<i>Thank you very much. Now, then,
</i><i>I would like to sum up all the events...</i>

79
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,455
Oh, Mustang.

80
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,624
<i>- ...that have transpired up to now.
- You're using Bradley's absence</i>

81
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,752
and using the Fuhrer's influence
any way that you like?

82
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,798
And in the name of justice.

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,510
I sure do hope the people will buy it.

84
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,013
You sure sounded like a pro.

85
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,809
And way to work in an ambiguous,
frivolous little word like "justice."

86
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,521
It's all right.
Everyone loves justice after all.

87
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,774
Yeah. Whoever invokes it first
comes out on top.

88
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,153
What exactly is going on?

89
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,489
Apparently, this isn't the doing
of Mustang and company.

90
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:51,536
- Are you sure?
- Roy Mustang is telling the truth.

91
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,539
We just got here from the east,

92
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:59,085
and there's a big fuss back there
about the Fuhrer's train being bombed.

93
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,340
You folks in Central
don't know about that yet?

94
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,384
The nation's top man is missing.

95
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,595
So why don't it's citizens know
anything about it?

96
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,515
- Then it really is a coup d'état?
- Who's behind this?

97
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,644
If Radio Capital were to get raided
and Mrs. Bradley were to die,

98
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,395
then there's no doubt
that the senior staff is behind this.

99
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,149
- Selim! What about Selim?
- I'm sure he's been taken prisoner.

100
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,109
I sure hope he hasn't been killed.

101
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,242
What is the garrison doing?

102
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,997
Sir, the enemy apparently possesses
far more weapons than expected

103
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,124
and are putting up a difficult fight.

104
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,878
Weapons? There's only a limited amount
they can carry, right?

105
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,798
Transmission from the garrison!

106
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,342
Go ahead, sir.

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,804
You're late checking in!
What's happening there? Over!

108
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,516
<i>The Briggs guys even have one of those--</i>

109
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,394
Hey!

110
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,023
Is everything all right?

111
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,985
This gate isn't going
to fall to them, right?

112
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,069
Of course not!

113
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,990
Sheesh, ridiculous.

114
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,033
As long as they don't bring in
a tank or something, we're--

115
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,038
What?

116
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,294
Would it be okay
if I lend you a hand, Fullmetal?

117
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,671
Colonel?

118
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,552
It would appear that you have
some more new friends.

119
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,888
Scar?

120
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,853
You know, this place
takes me back, Lieutenant.

121
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,731
I remember seeing your tearful face here.

122
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,151
I'd like to see
those honest tears again sometime.

123
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,822
I thought you hated moisture.
It renders you useless.

124
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,493
Save the chit-chat for later! Fight!

125
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,537
Don't you order me around.

126
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,457
Acknowledged. We just need
to beat these white guys, right?

127
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,084
That won't work, Lieutenant!

128
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,087
You can't beat these guys using bullets.

129
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,882
Not again.
It's all we've been dealing with.

130
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,885
Are they Homunculi?

131
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,513
<i>No, they aren't self-repairing.</i>

132
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,351
<i>But they won't die either. Is it the power
</i><i>of the Philosopher's Stone?</i>

133
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,477
They are the enemy, Fullmetal.

134
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,363
Why, you--! Stop scampering around!

135
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,492
<i>It would seem
</i><i>that he doesn't want me to go this way.</i>

136
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,203
<i>The presence is stronger
</i><i>that way, too. I knew it.</i>

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,441
May?

138
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,946
Envy!

139
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,323
You guys...

140
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,997
Fool! Why didn't you go back
to your home country?

141
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,419
But... I mean... I mean...

142
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:14,632
- Never mind! Don't cry!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Scar!

143
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,762
Geez. This is why you humans
turn my stomach.

144
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,771
I have to admit though,
you've really done a number here.

145
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:34,861
The Fullmetal Alchemist,
the Flame Alchemist, not to mention Scar.

146
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,281
And the filthy Chimeras,
who I owe for up north, are here with you.

147
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,493
Now, then, which one of you
will I deal with first?

148
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,287
You're Envy, are you?

149
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,790
The Homunculus who can change
his shape, as I recall.

150
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,214
So you know.
Pleased to meet you, Colonel Mustang.

151
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,759
Are you sure about this, Scar?

152
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,137
This is one of the State Alchemists
that turned Ishval into such a hellhole.

153
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,640
You're right.

154
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,854
You're acting chummy? You're no fun.

155
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,607
Let me see you guys act
more rumbly-grumbly.

156
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,528
It's so much more fun when you maggots
are shouting at each other.

157
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,034
We don't have time
to entertain your boorish interests.

158
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,788
Boorish? Then let me ask you this.

159
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,583
You humans love
watching others' misfortune

160
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,544
and watching fools run around
in circles, don't you?

161
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,048
Isn't that why you're always at war
with each other?

162
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,971
Indeed. It is delightful to watch fools
get worked up into a frenzy.

163
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:51,229
And watching fools who are Homunculi
go into a frenzy is especially enjoyable.

164
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,859
I have answered your question.

165
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,237
Now, why don't you answer mine?

166
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,366
Who was it that killed Maes Hughes?

167
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,120
Answer me, Homunculus.

168
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,629
It was Maria Ross.
The one you burned to death.

169
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,882
No. It wasn't her.

170
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,388
Then you burned an innocent girl alive.

171
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:31,060
Nice work. You're awful.
So how did you break it to her family?

172
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,437
Did you cry when you apologized?

173
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,190
Or did you keep quiet because you were
too afraid of them getting mad at you?

174
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,443
Would you quit working your mouth,
you idiot?

175
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,575
I have become sick and tired
of asking you Homunculi this question.

176
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,580
Now, tell me the truth right now,
you idiot!

177
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,334
Who was it that killed Hughes?

178
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,145
Congratulations, Colonel Mustang.

179
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,314
You've finally arrived at your answer.

180
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:27,492
I doubt a moron like you
would be able to take Hughes.

181
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,661
Moron?

182
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,915
A moron...

183
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,750
is what you call someone...

184
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,006
like Hughes
for falling for a trick like this.

185
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,054
Your face has gone pale!

186
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,264
I like that expression.

187
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,851
The look on Hughes' face
when I killed him was terrific, too.

188
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,646
The look on his face...

189
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:01,401
The despair of being shot dead
by someone with his beloved wife's face.

190
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,862
It was terrific!

191
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,324
That settles it.

192
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:15,081
You're the one who killed Hughes.
All I needed to know was that fact.

193
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,293
You don't have to say anything else, Envy.

194
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,464
I'll start by burning out...

195
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,968
the base of your tongue.

196
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,567
Scar, Fullmetal, let me take this one.

197
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,571
He is my quarry.

198
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,911
All right. Then we'll leave this to you
and go on ahead.

199
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,415
Who says you're allowed to go?

200
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,210
I have to pay you back in full
for what you did up north--

201
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,426
Are you sure you can afford to talk
to anyone else while facing me?

202
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,682
I would say that nimble tongue of yours
has gotten nice and greasy.

203
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,935
It burns so well, doesn't it, Envy?

204
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,855
Lieutenant, are you sure
just the two of you will be--?

205
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,939
Go on, Edward.

206
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,442
We can manage.

207
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:29,113
- But...
- Go, Edward Elric.

208
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,116
You have something else you have to do.

209
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,329
- Come on, let's go, Ed.
- Hold on!

210
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,753
Damn it.

211
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,256
The colonel will be fine.

212
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,761
That Homunculus will be
a pushover for him.

213
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,139
That's not what I'm worried about.

214
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,224
What do you mean?

215
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,814
Yes, you've been pursuing the one
who killed Hughes for a long time.

216
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,694
Such a beautiful friendship!

217
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,701
Stay back, Lieutenant.

218
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:31,509
In deference to your beautiful friendship,
I will fight you all-out.

219
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,596
I can't really pull my punches
in this body,

220
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,014
so it's not my fault what might hap--

221
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,147
How does it feel, having the fluid
inside your eyeballs boil?

222
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,149
I'll bet it hurts beyond imagination.

223
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,820
Damn you!

224
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,783
I'm surprised you'd intentionally
make my target bigger for me.

225
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,787
Did you think being bigger
would let you beat me? Idiot.

226
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,833
Get up, monster.
Hurry and regenerate yourself.

227
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,294
I'm going to let you relive that pain
over and over until you die.

228
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:12,300
<i>Yeah, that's right.
</i><i>He's the man who burned Lust to death.</i>

229
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,725
- Hold it!
- Colonel!

230
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,977
Lieutenant, you wait here!

231
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,021
I'm going to take care of him myself!

232
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,073
This way. It's probably this way.

233
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,493
- Creepy.
- These things are like veins.

234
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:44,206
It almost feels
like I've been having heartburn.

235
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,250
I'll bet you are.

236
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:50,463
There's a powerful mass of chi deeper in.

237
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,673
Mass of chi?

238
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,801
If I said it feels like
an incredible number of people writhing,

239
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,637
would that make sense to you?

240
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,849
I don't know what it is,
but I do know that it feels creepy.

241
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,230
I sure wouldn't want to run
into the enemy here.

242
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,152
Scar, do you have a minute?

243
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,656
Is this about the Flame Alchemist?

244
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,788
Having once lost myself,

245
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,666
burning in the flames of revenge,
I understand it all too well.

246
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:32,296
The way he's going,
he's going to burn his own heart up

247
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,674
in the flames of hatred.

248
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,026
- Where are you, Envy?
- Damn.

249
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,656
If you don't come out, I'm gonna hit you
with an even bigger explosion!

250
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,910
Yo, Roy.

251
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,832
You're only human! You'll get mixed up!

252
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,089
You'd burn up your best friend
without any hesitation?

253
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,593
Hughes is dead. He's gone.

254
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,973
Your actions have only poured
more fuel on the fire!

255
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,981
Damn it! Don't get so carried away!

256
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:39,447
Not again! My eyes! My eyes!

257
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,951
You fool. Did you think I wouldn't use
heavy firepower right next to me?

258
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,121
Unfortunately for you,
I can do pinpoint aiming.

259
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,124
Don't you sell my technique short!

260
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,384
Colonel, I'm disobeying your orders.

261
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,688
He got away again.

262
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,603
You've disobeyed orders, Lieutenant.

263
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,315
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
just sit there and wait.

264
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,818
Where's Envy?

265
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,071
I lost sight of him.
It's almost like a maze in here.

266
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,033
Do not leave my side, Lieutenant.

267
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,494
Now that you're here,
you're going to help me out.
