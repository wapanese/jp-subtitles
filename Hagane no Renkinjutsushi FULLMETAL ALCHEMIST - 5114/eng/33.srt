1
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,303
<i>Ed and Al, who are searching for May,</i>

2
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,847
<i>the young girl from the country of Xing,</i>

3
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,100
<i>in order to find out
</i><i>the secrets of Alkahestry,</i>

4
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,852
<i>obtain information
</i><i>that she is headed north.</i>

5
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:48,233
<i>Meanwhile,
</i><i>Scar has left Central and was headed west</i>

6
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,779
<i>with the Crimson Alchemist, Kimblee,
</i><i>in pursuit.</i>

7
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:59,077
<i>However, under the cover of night,
</i><i>Scar has suddenly gone into hiding.</i>

8
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,791
<i>If he was going to jump from the train,</i>

9
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,336
<i>he'd do it around here,
</i><i>where there are curves.</i>

10
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,755
<i>The engine would have to slow down
</i><i>after all.</i>

11
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:15,802
The question is,
which way did he head from here?

12
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,265
- Any word on any Scar sightings?
- Nothing definite.

13
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,979
That is odd. All the way here,
he made a big show of his movements.

14
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,397
I have something to report, sir.

15
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,566
There was a small boat stolen
from along a river

16
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,777
about 200 meters to the south.

17
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,986
Was it Scar?

18
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,405
There aren't any eyewitness reports
as of yet.

19
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,574
- Look into it!
- Yes, sir!

20
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,034
I have something to report!

21
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:44,247
An old man who lives nearby spotted
a suspicious pair of men headed west.

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,582
Now he's headed west?

23
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,793
Take some soldiers at once,
and detain those two!

24
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,919
Yes, sir!

25
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,383
- Is something the matter?
- No, it's just...

26
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,678
there is a mountain road
heading north on this map.

27
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,972
What is this, here?

28
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,058
It was a logging road
through to the North Area,

29
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,726
but there were too many rockslides,

30
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,687
and it is currently closed to any traffic.

31
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,939
Is there something about it?

32
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,209
There are several other places further on

33
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,379
where giant rockslides have closed
the road, like they have here.

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,350
The water's flow has been altered here.

35
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,019
So it would seem.
Does that mean something?

36
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,651
To an alchemist skilled in destruction,

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,405
clearing an obstacle of this size
is a simple matter.

38
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,908
- Sir?
- As is destroying the mountain face...

39
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,746
to once again block the road
with a rockslide.

40
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,124
Transmutation marks?

41
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,878
Send the soldiers north.

42
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,560
Snow!

43
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,950
Brother!

44
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,707
Brother, you're so unbalanced.

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,752
Shut up!
I just slipped a little, that's all!

46
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,840
Still, all this snow is amazing, huh?

47
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:03,637
Yeah, you barely ever see this
in Resembool.

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,971
Hey, yeah, Al!

49
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,558
Do you remember that heavy snow
we had in Resembool when we were little?

50
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,893
Heavy snow...

51
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,981
I remember, I remember!

52
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,942
<i>We all had a snowball fight!</i>

53
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,654
<i>- And we made a snowman too.
</i><i>- That's right!</i>

54
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>When I was little,</i>

55
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,954
<i>I had no idea we would ever come
</i><i>this far north.</i>

56
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,082
Yeah, and here we are.

57
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,302
So, what do we do?

58
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:48,098
There's still some time
before the train to Briggs leaves.

59
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,433
Go have something tasty to eat.

60
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,769
I'm not really that hungry.

61
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,897
Let's go have a look anyhow.

62
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,608
- You're going to fall again if you run!
- Oh, shut up!

63
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,573
- Attention, North Area units...
- The express still hadn't arrived.

64
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,992
- Descriptions of Scar are in document...
- ...as of three hours ago.

65
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,660
Any new information?

66
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,997
We are searching as fast as we can,
but unfortunately, no.

67
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,086
A man fitting Scar's description was seen
at the switchyard one station ahead of us!

68
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,546
You're sure about this?

69
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,258
Positive, he was spotted
getting aboard a military train

70
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,343
that is bound for Briggs.

71
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,012
Was there anyone with him?

72
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,558
A middle-aged man with black hair,
just like in the report.

73
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,727
I will have the train stopped at once.

74
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,438
That will not be necessary.

75
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,982
We can't have him jumping
from the train again after all.

76
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,780
Now then...

77
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,242
From here on, the job is mine.

78
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,287
See that you people stay out of my way.

79
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,923
Get some sleep now.

80
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,636
You won't be able to sleep
in the northern cold, even if you want to.

81
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,898
I'm jumping over, please match our speed.

82
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:02,816
Roger!

83
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,843
Dr. Marcoh...

84
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,723
I have come to get you.
You cannot run any longer.

85
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,517
Are you alone? Where is Scar?

86
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,146
You don't know when to give up.

87
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,774
I told you, you cannot get away, Dr. Mar--

88
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,863
Who are you?

89
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,043
You're the Ishvalan
I've heard so much about, aren't you?

90
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,785
How am I supposed to stick around
with those monsters?

91
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,495
If I'm going to jump, now's the time!

92
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,250
I can't!

93
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,892
Solf J. Kimblee, the Crimson Alchemist.

94
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,852
Do you remember me?

95
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:09,359
Yes, I remember you well.
You were in the Kanda District of Ishval.

96
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,822
Was that your family
who was around you back then?

97
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,744
There was a fellow there
who looked just like you, wearing glasses.

98
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,581
He was losing a great deal of blood
from his left side,

99
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,958
and appeared to be in terrible agony.

100
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,140
<i>This is bad.
</i><i>I've just barely gotten out of jail,</i>

101
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,058
<i>and my movements are still rusty,</i>

102
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,854
<i>while he has been fighting continuously,
</i><i>even after the end of the civil war.</i>

103
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,565
<i>Physically, I am at a disadvantage.</i>

104
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,527
<i>But since all he can do is destroy...</i>

105
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,954
His left side, right?

106
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,958
I won't give you any time to pray to God.

107
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,129
It's a shame...

108
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,758
That's twice now that I've failed
to stop the same Ishvalan...

109
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:35,194
It is deeply humiliating
that I would have to run away.

110
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,073
We will settle this next time,
for sure, Ishvalan!

111
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,920
Kimblee!

112
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,759
Damn it, I can't see!
What was that sound a moment ago?

113
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,103
The rear cars are gone!

114
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,400
This is bad!
The military gave us orders not to stop!

115
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:19,113
It's no use! If we derail,
the question of liability will be on us!

116
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,422
Hey!

117
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,341
What happened to you? Hey!

118
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,472
- Who said you could stop?
- What?

119
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,976
Keep us going! Head north!

120
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,983
Yes, good. Death is closing in.

121
00:12:55,066 --> 00:13:00,238
Those who forge death
are also pursued by death.

122
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,992
They are always side-by-side with death.

123
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:09,247
It is the work that puts the soul at risk
that possesses beauty.

124
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,461
What worth there is in performing it
on my battlefield!

125
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,139
I wonder
if Mr. Scar and Mr. Yoki are all right.

126
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,058
Judging by the fact
that no one has come after us,

127
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,812
they seem to have been successful
in drawing the MPs' attention.

128
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,313
I do hope they are safe.

129
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,027
- Mr. Marcoh?
- It's nothing.

130
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,197
The northern wind is bracing
against my still-healing skin.

131
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,657
I'm sorry.

132
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,578
I wish I could have healed your face,
so that it looked better.

133
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:54,459
No, this is the face that fits me.
I am content with it.

134
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,004
May, look at that.

135
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,884
The Briggs mountain range.

136
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,218
These mountains mark the border

137
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,764
with the large country of Drachma
to the north.

138
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,060
We should be getting close
to the location that Scar showed us.

139
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:12,977
Let's see.

140
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,565
It's right over there.

141
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,004
What? They're not at the hotel?

142
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:44,175
<i>- Yes, they left yesterday.
- Do you know where they went?</i>

143
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,011
<i>As I recall,
</i><i>they said they were going north.</i>

144
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,264
They did? Thank you very much.

145
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,477
That dummy!

146
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,314
What's the matter?
Are the brothers doing well?

147
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,608
They said they were heading north
from there.

148
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,194
Oh, my, well then...

149
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,114
...they're gonna die.

150
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,953
Brother, are you catching a cold?

151
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,373
Oh, I'm so cold. That's Briggs for you.

152
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,127
We're here, boys!

153
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,340
If you follow this mountain road...

154
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,218
- ...you'll get to Fort Briggs.
- Thanks.

155
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,137
Oh, and you there...

156
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,851
- Yes, you. Is that automail?
- No.

157
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,186
Oh, okay. In that case, you're all right.

158
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,983
- What was that about?
- Beats me.

159
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,320
Beyond that fence is military property,

160
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,073
so if you leave the road,
you'll end up dead.

161
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,450
Huh?

162
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,953
- Ready to go?
- Yes.

163
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,596
They say that the weather
in the mountains is highly variable,

164
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,764
but I didn't think
it changed this quickly.

165
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,768
What do we do, Brother?
We've completely lost sight of the road.

166
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,022
Relax. Our teacher, Izumi,
said that she got tossed out here

167
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,733
at Briggs Mountain for a whole month
during her training period,

168
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,193
and she made it out alive.

169
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,486
No way!

170
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,280
There's no way she could have
survived in this for a whole month!

171
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,908
But she said she killed some bears!

172
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,828
When the bears around Briggs rear up,
they're taller than six feet!

173
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,080
There's no way she could have killed them!

174
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,473
That's no bear!

175
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,352
Al!

176
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,817
Hey, wait!
That's a military uniform, isn't it?

177
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,905
You have automail too? The ordinary sort.

178
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,742
What about you?
You've got that tacky-looking thing on!

179
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,913
You're a fool not to see
the beauty of this mechanism!

180
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:23,501
The Combat Automail M1913-A Crocodile!

181
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,672
Surrender peacefully,
unless you want to get torn to pieces,

182
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,840
you miserable Drachman spy!

183
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,719
Spy? What are you talking about? I'm--

184
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,096
Why, you...

185
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,433
Don't you hear me, you big lunk?

186
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,562
Why does that hurt like that?

187
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,773
I can't move my automail very well!

188
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,317
Gotcha!

189
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,237
Brother!

190
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,322
You bastard!

191
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,827
- Listen to what I'm telling you!
- You're still resisting me?

192
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,290
You're kidding!

193
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,375
Wait! Wait! Wait!

194
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,795
Your good-for-nothing automail
is all mine!

195
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:12,091
Why, you... It's your arm that's mine!

196
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,555
Did you do something?

197
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,641
Whoa, hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

198
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,895
Why didn't my alchemy work?
Isn't this iron?

199
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,188
Brother!

200
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,026
Thank you, Al!

201
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,824
- Are you okay?
- Why, you...

202
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,578
I won't get to die in the snow,
because Winry is gonna kill me first!

203
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:45,374
Not bad, kid.
You did pretty well with normal automail.

204
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,460
But it ends now.

205
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,305
The Briggs Mountain Guards?

206
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,100
Hey, are we getting guns stuck
in our faces again?

207
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,525
- Brother!
- A wall?

208
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,903
What's going on here, Captain Buccaneer?

209
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:19,659
I am terribly sorry for the disturbance,
General Armstrong, sir!

210
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,084
Armstrong?

211
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,754
That's who Major Armstrong said
he would introduce to us?

212
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:38,469
Olivier Mira Armstrong,
Major Armstrong's older sister?

213
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,638
But...

214
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,311
<i>- She doesn't look like him.
</i><i>- She's not huge.</i>

215
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,813
Who are you?

216
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:53,609
The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!

217
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,362
I am here by referral
of Major Armstrong of Central

218
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,198
to meet the general in charge here!

219
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,660
But first, I would like you
to call off your guards!

220
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,120
Frisk them.

221
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,499
- Hey! I'm not a shady character!
- I don't know that.

222
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,086
Anyone can claim to be someone famous.

223
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,881
- Whoa, he's hollow!
- Why, you...

224
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,968
What's this?

225
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,594
General!

226
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:24,598
That's a letter of introduction
from Major Alex Louis Armstrong!

227
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,352
If you read that,
you will see that you can trust us!

228
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,773
This is from Alex all right.

229
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,903
What? You're not going to read it?

230
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,157
Letters of introduction
are meaningless to me.

231
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,035
I don't care
about anyone else's appraisals.

232
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,538
I judge people with my own eyes.

233
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,346
Awesome!

234
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,977
It's huge! What is this?

235
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,188
Enter, Fullmetal Alchemist.

236
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,065
Awesome! It's so tall! And huge!

237
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,028
Start walking already, dirtbags,

238
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,947
before I yank out that antenna
on top of your head!

239
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,830
I'll warn you upfront,
I'm not going to treat you like children.

240
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:36,003
This is the mountain fortress, Briggs.
It's a world of survival of the fittest.

241
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,771
There it is!

242
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,617
So this is Scar's brother's
research notebook.

243
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,872
A fusion of Xingese alkahestry
and Amestrisian alchemy, right?

244
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,541
Could the secret of gaining immortality
be written in here?

245
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,376
I sure hope it is.

246
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:47,259
Will this book bring hope,
or will it bring despair?

247
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,349
Well, let me start deciphering it.
