1
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:41,268
- So that's Roy Mustang.
- The Flame Alchemist, huh?

2
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,565
I wonder what connections
he used to be selected at his age.

3
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,153
When your rise is this rapid,
your fall will be rapid as well.

4
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,909
Come in.

5
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,245
Excuse me.

6
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,585
Colonel Roy Mustang.

7
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,631
Ah, Colonel Mustang. I'm terribly sorry.

8
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,176
His Excellency the F端hrer is not in.

9
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,260
Where is he?

10
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,138
He went to the south
to conduct an inspection.

11
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,431
The south?

12
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,568
I don't like the smell of this.

13
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,528
Still, it brings back memories.

14
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Here, I've come on an inspection
</i><i>and I make quite the discovery.</i>

15
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,040
<i>Move in!</i>

16
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,053
A kid and a housewife, huh? That's right.

17
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,181
But I wouldn't quite feel comfortable
fighting you.

18
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,975
I'll be running away.

19
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,269
Why, you--

20
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,690
Teacher, hang on!

21
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,027
Running away. How cowardly.

22
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,154
Teacher...

23
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,410
Teacher! Teacher!

24
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,795
Behave yourself!

25
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,631
No way!

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,262
Mr. Greed!

27
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,681
Martel, are you safe?

28
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,768
What happened?
Roa and the others haven't come back.

29
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,646
Yeah, things have gotten
a little more complicated.

30
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,273
We have to come up with a way out.

31
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,442
I can't have that.

32
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,321
Who are you, old man?

33
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,950
The F端hrer! Why are you here?

34
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,785
King Bradley?

35
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,791
What is the highest man
in the country doing here?

36
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,294
How old are you?

37
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,670
Huh?

38
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,006
I will be turning 60 this year.

39
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,633
As you grow older,

40
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,261
your body stops moving
the way you want it to.

41
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:26,141
I'd like to finish this job right away
and get back home.

42
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,478
Retire, old man.

43
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,154
Hey, now, what kind of old man are you?

44
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,079
Mr. Greed?

45
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,007
Did you see that?

46
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,592
That is the statuary technique

47
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,303
that has been passed down
in the Armstrong family for generations!

48
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,520
Well, then, I'll take this more seriously.

49
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,408
Most peculiar.

50
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,465
We've secured the boy and the woman!

51
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,759
Now exterminate those monsters!

52
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,512
Those are the F端hrer's orders!

53
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,951
It has been a long time
since the blood danced within my veins.

54
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,746
Impressive, Mr. Armstrong.

55
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,459
I also participated in the Ishvalan War
of Extermination.

56
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,296
A former comrade, huh?

57
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,592
Then that's all the more reason
to avoid meaningless bloodshed.

58
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,302
Surrender.

59
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,053
Even when you're about to kill me?

60
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,888
Major!

61
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,355
Roa!

62
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,239
You bastard!

63
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:57,459
I have neither the Ultimate Shield
such as yourself,

64
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,421
nor the Ultimate Spear
which can pierce anything.

65
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,801
Do you know how I survived flying bullets
on the battlefield,

66
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:12,807
rendered such distinguished service,
and am now in my current position?

67
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,601
You're...

68
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,611
Just as you have your Ultimate Shield,

69
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,406
I have my Ultimate Eye.

70
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,205
Now then, Greed,

71
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,709
how many more times
can you be killed before you die?

72
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,381
Where is Mr. Greed?

73
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,799
I don't know.

74
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,551
It's too dark for me to see.

75
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,986
- Mr. Greed!
- No!

76
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,153
Why, you--

77
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,030
- Open up!
- No!

78
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,158
- Let me out!
- I said no and I mean it!

79
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,871
You've died 15 times now, is it?
How many more times will it take?

80
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,624
Why, you--

81
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,376
Ah, damn.

82
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,838
The F端hrer himself?

83
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,048
You can turn tail and run if you want.

84
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,887
I'd like to do just that
but a dog's loyalty is a powerful thing.

85
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,642
Get her out of here.

86
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,354
We're counting on you.

87
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,108
Roa! Dolcetto!

88
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,906
Hey, get out of the way! Let me out!

89
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,158
No.

90
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,369
I don't have time to mess
with you right now!

91
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,662
Open up, I tell you!

92
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,956
No, you can't come out!

93
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,125
Just open up!

94
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,628
Are you telling me to just sit here
and watch my friends die?

95
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:10,133
I can't let you out. Those two asked.

96
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,969
Dolcetto!

97
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,061
Roa!

98
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,856
Please.

99
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,777
You can't come out.

100
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,573
Hey, now, Mr. Bradley.

101
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,619
How could you do that to my men?

102
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,206
Become attached to your pawns, have you?
What nonsense.

103
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,916
Attached?

104
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,502
You fool, who do you take me for?

105
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,213
I am Greed the Avaricious.

106
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,594
Money, women, subordinates,
all of them are my possessions!

107
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,098
As such, I cannot just abandon
my possessions.

108
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,101
For my avarice runs deep.

109
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,396
Avarice? You grow even more nonsensical.

110
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,122
Lie down there for a moment.

111
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,668
- We have to get away.
- Hold it there.

112
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,629
You are Edward's younger brother, yes?

113
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,299
Are you injured? Let me give you a hand.

114
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,136
Oh, sure. I mean, no, I'm all right.

115
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,972
I can get home by myself.

116
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,979
No, Miss Martel!

117
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,233
No, Miss Martel!

118
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,611
Bradley!

119
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,500
Al!

120
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,945
Mom!

121
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,282
Mom! Mom!

122
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,130
Al, hey, snap out of it!

123
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,257
Hey! Answer me!

124
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,550
Al!

125
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,053
Brother.

126
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,221
Are you all right?

127
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,975
What about you, brother?
You're covered in blood.

128
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,362
We took the liberty of opening you up
and pulling her out.

129
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,864
I wasn't able to save her.

130
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,120
It wasn't your fault, Al.

131
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,498
Come on, let's go home.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,710
Al.

133
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,841
Just a moment.

134
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,845
There is something that I must ask you.

135
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:49,435
Did you know the mastermind here?
A man named Greed.

136
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,770
No.

137
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,940
Did you get any important information
out of him?

138
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,025
No.

139
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,027
Nothing that would be of any benefit
to the military.

140
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,906
Don't misunderstand.
I don't mean for the military.

141
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,660
If you have arranged a deal with him,

142
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,538
then depending on what it is...

143
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,251
Have you taken up
with those who would do harm

144
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,211
to the heart of the military?

145
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,754
No.

146
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,673
Any other questions?

147
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,345
Your steel arm and your brother's armor,

148
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,849
are they somehow related?

149
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,856
Such an honest boy.

150
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,151
We're pulling out.

151
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,072
You take good care
of that brother of yours.

152
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,372
<i>Thank you for what you've done
</i><i>for the Elric brothers.</i>

153
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,374
Not at all.

154
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,002
One of the duties of the military

155
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,046
is to protect our State Alchemists.

156
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,881
What do you say?

157
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,300
Would you like to be protected as well?

158
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,304
As a State Alchemist?

159
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,097
Indeed.

160
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,686
As you can see,
I am just a frail housewife.

161
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,107
Is the country so hard-pressed

162
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,360
that it needs the help of someone like me?

163
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,364
That was pretty harsh, huh?

164
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,994
I will be back.

165
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,627
When I do, perhaps,
you'll have had a change of heart.

166
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,057
Greed had an Ouroboros tattoo on his hand.

167
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,476
Ouroboros...

168
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,188
Remember?
I told Colonel Hughes about them too.

169
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,399
Those guys are involved
with the Philosopher's Stone.

170
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,568
Hughes.

171
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,283
Edward Elric,

172
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,663
do not do anything too rash.

173
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,709
Yeah.

174
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,672
Well, then...

175
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,718
Brother.

176
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:35,977
Listen, my memories of when my body
was carried over have returned.

177
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,396
What was it like?

178
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,400
It was sort of awful.

179
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,697
But I didn't find out anything
about human transmutation.

180
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,866
Oh.

181
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,454
Ultimately, it got us nowhere, huh?

182
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,123
No, that's not true.

183
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,084
The F端hrer mentioned something before.

184
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,379
He said that there was unrest
in the ranks.

185
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,631
Yeah, and that the Philosopher's Stone

186
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,177
and the guys
with the Ouroboros tattoos were involved.

187
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,888
As such, he said he wanted
to get some information on them.

188
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,017
<i>Greed had an Ouroboros tattoo too.</i>

189
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,396
So why did they have to kill everyone?

190
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,858
If he wanted to get anything on them,

191
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,902
he could have captured them
and extracted what he wanted, right?

192
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,862
Yeah.

193
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,656
What's more,
with only that many people to deal with,

194
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,493
it's strange that the F端hrer
would show up.

195
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,911
Yeah.

196
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,663
All of this is kind of hard to swallow.

197
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,668
I guess we'll stick with the military
for a while.

198
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,596
Welcome back, F端hrer.

199
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,556
How did your inspection in the south go?

200
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,895
The Fullmetal Alchemist's brother
and perhaps their teacher

201
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,066
would make good material
for a sacrifice as well.

202
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,278
And there was one other thing.
An unexpected catch.

203
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,532
My, this takes me back.

204
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,284
It's the face of someone
who left here a century ago.

205
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,454
Wake up, Greed.

206
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,543
Oh, my, the gang's all here.

207
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,462
Serves you right, Ultimate Shield.

208
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:31,842
And you're the same old fine woman
as Ultimate Spear,

209
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,220
Lust the Lascivious.

210
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,975
Gluttony the Voracious,
you haven't slimmed down one bit, huh?

211
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,231
Envy the Jealous,
are you in that tasteless getup again?

212
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,859
Where is Sloth the Indolent?

213
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,237
He's always absent.

214
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,864
Still at work.

215
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:01,998
None of you have really changed
in a hundred years, huh?

216
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,167
So then, who is this?

217
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,670
Wrath the Furious.

218
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,465
Wrath? You're King Bradley, right?

219
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,550
Yes.

220
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,553
Our brother,
who, as the human King Bradley,

221
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:20,182
has been prepared by Father
for the final endgame.

222
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,979
A Homunculus that ages? Is that possible?

223
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,067
There's no such thing as "no such thing."

224
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,529
That was your favorite phrase.
Have you forgotten it?

225
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,531
Or are you just going senile?

226
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,408
You shut your mouth, ugly.

227
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,162
Oh, I like that look in your eye.

228
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,663
That's more like it.

229
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,041
Show us your true self
for old times' sake,

230
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,876
"Cobbled-together Envy."

231
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,044
Damn you.

232
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,464
I'll crush you just like you want me to.

233
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,467
Stop it, both of you.

234
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:04,143
No more carrying on
ugly brotherly quarrels in front of me.

235
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,896
Hey there, Daddy, sir.

236
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,230
I don't see you for a little while,

237
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,316
and you've gone and aged quite a bit,
haven't you?

238
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:17,114
Greed, my son,
with whom I have shared my soul,

239
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,825
why have you betrayed me, your father?

240
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,078
Why, you ask?

241
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,207
You know why better than anyone,
don't you, Daddy, sir?

242
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,209
I am Greed the Avaricious.

243
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,837
That is how you created me
and that is exactly how I have lived.

244
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:37,093
If I had stayed with you,
my desire would have gone unfulfilled.

245
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,597
Will you work for me again?

246
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,101
No!

247
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,228
I see.

248
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,829
Whoa, how cheesy.

249
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,755
Damn, that water sure feels nice and hot!

250
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:20,928
I don't suppose the flames of hell
will be quite so tepid though!

251
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:26,267
I'm going on ahead
to see what they are like, my brethren!

252
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:34,275
Back to where you were born,
into my soul, Greed.

253
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,527
Fine!

254
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,281
Don't blame me if I upset
your stomach though, Daddy, sir!

255
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,135
I pray for your unwavering loyalty
and well-being

256
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,221
as we move toward the forthcoming day.

257
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,113
Father!

258
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,949
Welcome back, Father!

259
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,455
I'm home, Selim.

260
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,999
How was your inspection?

261
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,503
It truly was a fulfilling inspection.

262
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,380
You're not as young
as you used to be, dear.

263
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,926
You could give up your seat
to a younger man and settle down.

264
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,429
Oh, no, I'm not ready
to be mothballed yet.

265
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,806
Oh, right.

266
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,392
I ran into the Fullmetal Alchemist
down south.

267
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,894
The little alchemist?

268
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,396
Really?

269
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,733
Selim, you sure do enjoy stories
about Edward.

270
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,404
Well, he is the youngest State Alchemist.
That's so cool, isn't it?

271
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,910
Wow, I'd like to learn alchemy too.

272
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,329
What would you do once you learned it?

273
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,333
I'd want to get a state certification
and help out Father.

274
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:19,839
Well, in the future, Selim,
maybe I will have you help me out.
