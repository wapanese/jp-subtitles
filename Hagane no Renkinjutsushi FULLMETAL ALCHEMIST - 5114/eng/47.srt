1
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,262
<i>On the day before the Promised Day,</i>

2
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,974
<i>Alphonse Elric hid himself
</i><i>at the East Area training grounds.</i>

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,524
<i>However, the Homunculi Gluttony
</i><i>and Pride appear, and capture him.</i>

4
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,619
<i>Alphonse.</i>

5
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,793
<i>Wake up, Alphonse.</i>

6
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,172
Who are you?

7
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,011
It's too soon for you to die.

8
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:22,809
There's still so much use
we need to put you to.

9
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,041
Excuse me, is this Kanama?

10
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,880
Mr. Ho.

11
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,507
You have a visitor.

12
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,474
So you've come, Edwa--

13
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,561
Ah, that feels better.

14
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,481
You didn't have to haul off
and slug me out of nowhere, you know!

15
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,358
And with your right hand too!

16
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,028
You've made some more friends. Whoa...

17
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,281
It just works out
that we're all in the same boat.

18
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,867
And incidentally,
I'm the boss of these guys.

19
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,998
Well, well, thank you
for looking after my son.

20
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,166
Not at all.

21
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,253
- And a damn sassy son he is.
- Shut up!

22
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,756
That's an unusual tattoo.

23
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,844
Ah, this?

24
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,513
I suppose there's no sense in hiding it.

25
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,892
Pops, don't keep back anything
from us either.

26
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,190
Tomorrow is the "Promised Day," right?

27
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,864
Yeah. I'll tell you everything.

28
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:19,009
I guess you can't accept this
as readily as Alphonse did.

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,260
You talked to Al too?

30
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,345
Yeah.

31
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,892
He probably has his own take
on some of it, but he accepted it.

32
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,857
I am the Philosopher's Stone
that you wanted.

33
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,485
- Will you use me?
- Don't be ridiculous!

34
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,196
Those are the lives of people
that have nothing to do with this!

35
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,739
There's no way we can use you,

36
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,991
when it's our own fault
we lost our bodies!

37
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,662
I'm glad my son would say so.

38
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,336
Tomorrow, there will be an eclipse.

39
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,338
He is planning to exploit it.

40
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,341
Exploit the eclipse?

41
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:05,680
Edward, will you help me
put a stop to his scheme?

42
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,142
Help you? Don't get the wrong idea.

43
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,852
I'll knock that bearded bastard's
block off

44
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,188
without teaming up with you!

45
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,856
It's just that right now,

46
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,108
it looks like banding together
assures our victory,

47
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,277
which is the only reason
why I'm listening to you!

48
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,453
Good.

49
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,707
Whatever your reasons are,
you'll still fight alongside me.

50
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,968
Granny Pinako asked me
to give Mom's last words to you.

51
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,474
"Sorry I couldn't keep my promise."

52
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,102
<i>And "I'm dying first."</i>

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,235
There, I told you!

54
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,757
Don't you think you should talk more
heart-to-heart with your old man?

55
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,885
Yeah, yeah. At least call him "Pop."

56
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,972
It sounds like there's been a lot
between you in the past,

57
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,809
but he's not the sort of man
who would abandon his wife.

58
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,814
I'm sure a lot has happened to him.
Go on, hear him out.

59
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,818
Aw, geez, shut up!
A lot has happened to me too!

60
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,528
Like what?

61
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,905
I'll bet you're just being stubborn.

62
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,035
You're not sure how to sort out
your feelings, huh?

63
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,078
I can't blame you.

64
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,415
He's a Philosopher's Stone,
in the form of a live person.

65
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,919
And what's more,
he also happens to be your father.

66
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,838
It's not just that.

67
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,302
He's not quite who I was expecting.

68
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:22,025
<i>Someday, I'll be
</i><i>a wrinkly old woman myself.</i>

69
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,612
Even so, no matter what form I take,

70
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,281
I want us to be able
to all smile together.

71
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,951
So let's always stay a family.

72
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,871
Trisha, I'm going away.

73
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,624
Wait here for me.

74
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,925
Okay.

75
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,555
I'll wait for you.

76
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,898
"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise."

77
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,652
You've passed away first, huh?

78
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,699
I may not have been able to grow old
and die with you like you wanted,

79
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,410
but you always believed

80
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,662
that I would be coming back
to you later on.

81
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,044
Tomorrow, Trisha.

82
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,092
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

83
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,511
What are you doing with that?

84
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,314
Are you planning to wear something
that flashy again?

85
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,025
Why does it have to be red?

86
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,867
This will probably be our last battle
against them.

87
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,161
I have to make sure
I'm all fired up for it.

88
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:05,545
Look, you guys don't have
to tag along with me.

89
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,466
I think it might be better for you
if we parted ways here, fellows.

90
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,260
Hey, now, you can't decide that
for yourself.

91
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,344
You work for me.

92
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,390
Or, do you, you know, want to get
your original bodies back, or...

93
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,600
I don't know.

94
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,102
There's a lot about these bodies
that comes in handy.

95
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,354
I wouldn't really mind staying like this.

96
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,107
That's more like it!

97
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,485
So then, why?

98
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,572
Well, you know,
we don't have anywhere else to be.

99
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,492
My animal instincts tell me
that if I stay here,

100
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,993
something good will happen to me.

101
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,082
What about you?

102
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,627
Didn't you say you'd split
from the Homunculi?

103
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,631
Are you asking
why I've returned to Central?

104
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,633
I'm not telling.

105
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,392
What is it?

106
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,781
Al!

107
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,617
Oh, it's you. Don't scare me like that.

108
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,704
I'm glad we managed to link up again.
How have you been?

109
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,083
- Brother, you're all right too.
- Huh?

110
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,752
I thought you were together
with Major Miles.

111
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,004
Is everything all right with them?

112
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,758
I need to speak to you about that.
Come here a minute.

113
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,218
Okay.

114
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,265
Al, is something the matter with you?

115
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,812
Why do you ask?

116
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,064
No reason, it's just that...

117
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,400
- Ed!
- Ling?

118
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,569
Get away from him!

119
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,237
That's...

120
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,740
He's...

121
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,631
What is this?

122
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:18,136
So you've gone over to their side, Greed.

123
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,230
To think you'd let the human
take you over again.

124
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,985
Your soul is too weak!

125
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,245
The FÃ¼hrer is still missing?

126
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,999
They say they've only found the body
of one of his subordinates downriver.

127
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,294
It would be a miracle if he's still alive.

128
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,547
I'll enlist the cooperation
of the Northern forces,

129
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,216
and direct the search myself.

130
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,801
You, personally, General?

131
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,057
I won't be able to rest until I see
his corpse for myself.

132
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,603
You're not going to make for Central,
as we first planned?

133
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,313
There's not much choice.

134
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,567
I'll have to let Colonel Mustang
have the bigger bite of Central.

135
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,155
<i>The current Bradley administration
</i><i>is still functioning</i>

136
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>without any great difficulty.</i>

137
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:27,288
<i>If either Colonel Mustang
</i><i>or General Armstrong starts anything now,</i>

138
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,749
<i>they'll be treated as rebels.</i>

139
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,586
<i>And if that happens,
</i><i>that is when I step in.</i>

140
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,548
<i>After they are held up as the villains,</i>

141
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:42,095
<i>General Grumman will come riding in
</i><i>on a white horse.</i>

142
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,684
<i>I'll let the youngsters
</i><i>pull the chestnuts out of the fire,</i>

143
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,355
<i>so that I can take charge
</i><i>of this country with little risk.</i>

144
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,609
<i>That's probably what the old fox
</i><i>is thinking.</i>

145
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,240
<i>We've joined forces
</i><i>with the Promised Day ahead of us,</i>

146
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,452
<i>but I can't let my guard down
</i><i>until it's all over.</i>

147
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,965
- Al!
- It's Pride.

148
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,092
Pride?

149
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,095
Yeah.

150
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,472
I guess you could say
he's our oldest brother.

151
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,308
A Homunculus?

152
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,689
You're going to betray us,
no matter what, aren't you, Greed?

153
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,235
At this point, you are nothing
more than an obstacle to us.

154
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,321
Damn it, how did you know I was here?

155
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,618
How dare you disguise yourself as Al?

156
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,871
It is not a disguise.

157
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,126
This is, indisputably,
your brother's body.

158
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,758
You bastard!

159
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm going to deal with Greed now.

160
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,432
Fullmetal Alchemist,
would you be so kind as to come with me?

161
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,395
Hey, Mr. Gorilla, you guys run--

162
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,731
Whoa, you guys sure are fast!

163
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,693
Our animal instincts are telling us
not to fight with that thing.

164
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,905
Are you going to be all right?

165
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,199
I'll be fine.

166
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,826
They need Al and me,
so they won't kill us.

167
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,413
But I can go all out against them!

168
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,123
I won't hesitate to take them down!

169
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,127
You are correct. I will not kill you.

170
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,382
I might slice up two or three
of your limbs, though.

171
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,558
I can't afford to run toward the slums!

172
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,568
Guards won't work against this guy!

173
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,863
That was close!

174
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,247
Now then, I have captured your friend,
as well.

175
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,331
What will it be?

176
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,752
Will you do as I say
if I capture the slums' people, as well?

177
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:25,842
True to form, he goes right
after the last thing you want.

178
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,818
I can't stand to keep losing my fights.

179
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,422
- What's that?
- A blackout?

180
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,424
Hey, what's going on?

181
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,141
<i>I can't see anything...</i>

182
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,893
<i>but then, his eyes have disappeared too.</i>

183
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,731
- Greed.
- Is that you, Heinkel?

184
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,567
What is this? What's going on?

185
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,570
Oh, you only get shadows
when there's light.

186
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,989
When it's pitch-black,
he can't materialize,

187
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,658
and just like us, he can't see anything.

188
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,660
So he's gone, then?

189
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,954
He's just lying in wait.

190
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,208
When the lights come back on,
he'll return.

191
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,043
Hey, what do we do?

192
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,172
Heinkel, did you see
Alphonse's shadow earlier?

193
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,467
Yeah, with the snaky,
tentacle-looking things.

194
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,551
Not those.

195
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,055
He always kept near a large shadow, right?

196
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,308
His main body is somewhere
in the forest shadows.

197
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,768
Main body?

198
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,395
The suit of armor wasn't his main body?

199
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,064
No.

200
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,651
He has a specialized container
that he uses to go out in.

201
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,195
What kind of container?

202
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,788
<i>The moon and stars are not out tonight.</i>

203
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,543
<i>The others cannot act
</i><i>in this darkness either.</i>

204
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,420
<i>I'll just wait for the slum's lights
</i><i>to come back on, and...</i>

205
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,929
You're not getting away!

206
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,558
You're pretty good,

207
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,894
attacking me in this form
without even flinching.

208
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,523
Sure, I might hesitate to lay
into a little kid.

209
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,026
On top of which,

210
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,988
my animal instincts
are screaming at me!

211
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,991
They're saying that if I don't beat
this guy, I'm in deep trouble.

212
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,496
Ed.

213
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,833
- Hey, Ed.
- Is that you, Mr. Gorilla?

214
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,168
Where's your brother?

215
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,798
He hasn't moved.
Whenever he moves, he clanks.

216
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,426
All right, for the time being,
let's move away from here.

217
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,885
And leave Al behind here?

218
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,263
I know how worried you must be,

219
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,890
but what if we get close to him,
and it's a trap?

220
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,437
We have to stick together,
at least until Heinkel deals with Pride,

221
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,939
so we can avoid attacking each other.

222
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,904
That sound is the lion guy fighting?

223
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,367
When it's dark, leave the fighting
to the nocturnal animals.

224
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,875
<i>Lousy Pride.
</i><i>How did he know where we are?</i>

225
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,002
<i>Does he have that sort of ability?</i>

226
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,800
Get down!

227
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:11,776
I smell the Fullmetal Alchemist,
I smell Greed.

228
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,154
- That voice, it's Gluttony!
- Him?

229
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,697
I get it.

230
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,035
So they used Gluttony's sense of smell
to track us down.

231
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,496
Sniff, sniff...

232
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,584
I also smell someone I don't know.
I can eat them, right?

233
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,005
You're up, Darius. He's a Homunculus too.

234
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,591
How am I supposed to handle
a monster-class opponent like him?

235
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:40,054
He's only relying on his nose
to move around.

236
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,849
If you take him now,
you'll be evenly matched, won't you?

237
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,853
My animal instinct is telling me not to.

238
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,065
But, hey, a man's gotta have nerve!

239
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,192
Victory favors he who strikes first!

240
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,161
And another!

241
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,289
That was brutal, Mr. Gorilla.

242
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,626
I thought we were sticking together
so we could avoid attacking each other.

243
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,669
Sorry.

244
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,424
<i>I guess in the dark, we don't have
</i><i>the upper hand against Gluttony.</i>

245
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:20,052
<i>But once the lights are back on,
</i><i>there's Pride.</i>

246
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,012
<i>This is going to be tough.</i>

247
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,265
<i>Hey, Greed!</i>

248
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,808
Is that you, Ling?

249
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,518
Switch with me.

250
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,730
I'm able to sense a Homunculus' presence.

251
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,691
<i>I'm the one who realized Pride
</i><i>was out there, right?</i>

252
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,653
<i>I can maneuver around better
</i><i>in the darkness!</i>

253
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,492
Don't go running off with this body!

254
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,036
Don't be ridiculous!
It was my body to begin with!

255
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,247
<i>Time to eat--</i>

256
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,207
There you are!

257
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,507
Oh, nice one. I'm glad I paired with you.

258
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,884
Thank you.

259
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,968
- Is that you, Ling?
- Yeah!

260
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:08,976
I'm mad, I'm hungry,
but you won't let me eat you right away!

261
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,980
So I'm gonna swallow you all!

262
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,733
- I sense something bad.
- Bad like what?

263
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,611
- Something's coming.
- Something like what?

264
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,155
It's the same as that time earlier.

265
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,074
Hey, what is it you guys are looking at?

266
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,368
Explain it to me, the normal guy!

267
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,039
What?

268
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,296
Huh?

269
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,049
- What?
- Hold still!

270
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,638
- Is there someone else out there?
- I don't know.

271
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,891
I don't know, but that's...

272
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,728
That smell...

273
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,816
I know it.

274
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,962
Thank goodness you're all right.

275
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,924
I've been waiting for you, Lan Fan!
