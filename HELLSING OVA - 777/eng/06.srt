1
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,600
This is my new home.

2
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,350
Teacher,

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,690
for what reason am I here?

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,860
Why do my father and
mother not come for me?

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,980
Is it because I am the mistress' child?

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,120
I don't need any friends.
I don't need any pals.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,790
I don't need my father or mother.

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,750
I will become great.

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,090
I will become great. I will become great,
and get even with everyone.

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,510
<i>Director...</i>

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,560
<i>Director!</i>

12
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,520
Please wake up, Director!

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,060
Director Maxwell!

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,400
Anderson and the other
paladins who went on ahead

15
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,860
have secured Integra Hellsing.

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,950
They have engaged the Last
Battalion in pursuit of her.

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,540
Tch, that hell-bent crusader.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,750
I ordered him to just observe,
and to avoid confrontation.

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,680
Look how it burns.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,520
Almost like purgatory.

21
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,270
The capital city of London
has been devastated.

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,610
Not since the Blitz has it been like this.

23
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,360
There is no estimating the number of dead.

24
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,330
Nor is there any telling
just how many are undead.

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,910
It's God's punishment.

26
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,330
The fools gloated as they waxed strong in
their heresy, and this is what they get.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
It serves them right.

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,050
Indeed.

29
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,800
What about America?

30
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,720
Utter chaos.

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,350
The White House is burning even now.

32
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,440
Also, a presidential aide
turned into a vampire,

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,860
right in the middle of
a congressional session,

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,360
killing the president and
13 of his cabinet members.

35
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,150
That sounds about right.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Our American branches
are still under deployment.

37
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,540
If the damage spreads, take action.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,620
Otherwise, we will not get involved.

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,130
Their confusion works to our advantage.

40
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,630
Let it drag out as much as it will.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,970
However, up to now,
that's all the activity they've shown.

42
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,390
Why might that be?

43
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,140
I'm not interested in why.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,350
As long as they stay out
of our way, that is enough.

45
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,270
I am only interested in
Britain, Hellsing, and Arucard.

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,280
That fatty... that fat major is
beyond even the Vatican's interests.

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,860
I won't have it.

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,200
We will hit them as hard
as we can from the sides!

49
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,080
Yes we will. We will reclaim Britain

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,170
from the pagans and
the monsters for Europe!

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,590
We are free to kill
the pagans and the monsters.

52
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,550
That's what my teacher taught me.

53
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,980
From the Order of the Sword of
Courland, 340 strong reporting!

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,980
From the Order of Calatrava
la Nueva, 118 strong reporting!

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,610
From the Order of Santo Stephano
di Toscana, 257 strong reporting!

56
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,120
From the Order of Malta,
2457 strong reporting!

57
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,940
We are reporting as
ordered by the Holy Father.

58
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,860
Concurrently, we elevate Bishop Maxwell.

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,320
You are now an archbishop.

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,160
We, the members of this corps,
form the Knights of the 9th Crusade.

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,210
We hereby entrust all command
authority to Archbishop Maxwell.

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,890
Amen! I fully take this
upon me, body and soul!

63
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,850
Our target is London,
dead capital of the British Empire.

64
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,190
Let our zealous subjugation,
<i>Reconquista</i>, now commence!

65
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,900
Amen!

66
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Amen! Amen!

67
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,240
Amen!

68
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,770
To think that I, a member of Section XIII,

69
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,310
after being called a demon spawn,
hated, cursed, and left destitute,

70
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
would be made an archbishop,

71
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,070
in command of a military force...

72
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,160
Director!

73
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,830
What is it?

74
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,450
H-Here...

75
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,040
The British carrier in the Atlantic...

76
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,050
It's moving?
It has set sail? That's ridiculous!

77
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,050
After the fire it sustained,
it's on the move?!

78
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,050
It's speed is quite slow.
Just a few knots,

79
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,060
but it is definitely
on the move. To London.

80
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,270
Arucard...

81
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,390
...is coming.

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,320
No matter. Hellsing, Millennium,

83
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,240
and Arucard will be no more. In the end,

84
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,200
we will be the ones
raising our ringed fists high.

85
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,870
All forces, move out! Our time as
the agents of God's punishment

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,370
has arrived!

87
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,280
Each one of them is charging
into hell with a joyous heart.

88
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,160
Just who among them

89
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,040
will be able to survive in there,
in that scene of carnage?

90
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,380
I'm sure that each one of them will,
without question, die with a joyous heart,

91
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,750
within that twilight.

92
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,270
There's that old, familiar smell...

93
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,360
The smell of men being impaled...
The smell of women being hewn down;

94
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,490
the smell of babies being burned to death;

95
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,040
the smell of the aged being shot to death.

96
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
The smell of death.

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,790
The smell of war!

98
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,380
Here I come, Major.

99
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,220
Zorin, start your attack.

100
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,890
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

101
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,980
Restart Zeppelin 2's engines!

102
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,150
The Zorin Blitz squad is now attacking!

103
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,030
Target Hellsing headquarters!

104
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,010
How many remain?

105
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,310
Half have been taken from us.
They're better than we thought.

106
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Thermite!

107
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Incinerate the bodies of the Nazis!

108
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,690
Leave no trace of them!

109
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,610
I'm leaving.

110
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,240
Where are you going?

111
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,120
To my mansion. I have a task to carry out.

112
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,250
A task as commanding officer.
I have to go now.

113
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,130
I cannot allow that.
We are taking you into custody.

114
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,010
Light me.

115
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,720
Light my cigar, will you?

116
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,600
You're so inconsiderate.

117
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,850
Light me.

118
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Light me.

119
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,570
Er, um... Do you realize
the position you're in?

120
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,070
Light me.

121
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,350
You can't threaten me.
I'm going home to my mansion.

122
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,600
Shoot me if you wish.

123
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,600
Stop, Yumie.

124
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,070
I-I'm just no good with these types.
What is wrong with me?

125
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,320
W-We could all tie her up,
a-a-and take her away, couldn't we?

126
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,450
Let's shoot her!

127
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,450
I can hear you.

128
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,290
Is that what you want, Section XIII?

129
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,420
Is that what you want, Anderson?

130
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:00,470
Absurd. Forcing an unarmed woman
to act against her will as a group?

131
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,590
Sounds like the act of rapists.

132
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,890
Well then, I'll be leaving.

133
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,480
But it's not safe for a woman on
the road at night. Take me home.

134
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,980
All right. We will take you home.

135
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,690
Huh?!

136
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm in a hurry. Let's go.

137
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,440
Hold on!

138
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,620
What is this?
I don't like what happened here.

139
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,750
W-W-What do we do?
The chief is going to get mad at us again.

140
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,380
W-We <i>do </i>have her secured
like this, in a sense.

141
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,090
We won't get yelled at.

142
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,140
That's just sophistry.

143
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,720
Shut up!

144
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,930
Heinkel, find us a car.

145
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,730
We're sitting ducks like this.

146
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,650
Yes...

147
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,270
Are you sure about this, Father Anderson?

148
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,150
This will call your
accountability into question.

149
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,570
I don't care. This is for the best.

150
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,160
Maxwell's methods are too clever by half.

151
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,170
We will be over Hellsing
headquarters momentarily.

152
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,670
All right. All personnel,
prepare for battle!

153
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,470
Incoming support fire from
the flagship. Retrofitted V1s.

154
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,640
The Deus Ex Machina is
running interference for us, huh?

155
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,230
Give Hellsing a whole bellyful of them!

156
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,820
What is this?

157
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,820
What?

158
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,120
What are they doing to us?!

159
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,120
We're being sniped at!

160
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,040
The fire is coming
from Hellsing headquarters!

161
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,210
It's her.

162
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,510
The retrofitted V1s
have all been shot down!

163
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,180
That's impossible. There were
24 of them, all fired at the same time.

164
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,980
Searchlights! Light up
Hellsing headquarters!

165
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,690
Please, do not do that!
They will shoot at us!

166
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,690
It doesn't matter! She can already see us!

167
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,270
<i>You've shot them all down, young lady.</i>

168
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,480
That new equipment is in
top form, huh, young lady?

169
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,620
<i>The Hallconnen II 30mm semi-auto cannon.</i>

170
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,620
<i>Maximum range of 4000 meters;</i>

171
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,620
<i>gross weight, 345 kilograms.</i>

172
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,710
We're pulling out all the stops
against these jokers, young lady.

173
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,710
Mr. Bernadotte, would you mind
not calling me "young lady"?

174
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,050
<i>I do have an actual name, Seras.</i>

175
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,220
Sorry about that, young lady.

176
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,520
Tell me...

177
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,020
<i>Can you see London, young lady?</i>

178
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,400
Yes, I can.

179
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,450
Piccadilly Circus, Soho, and
Covent Garden have turned to ashes.

180
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,240
Our London is now...

181
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,620
...synonymous with Hell.

182
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,380
I couldn't stand London.
I thought it was a stuffy old city.

183
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,210
I didn't think
it was the city for me at all.

184
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,300
Even so, when we would go out and party
at this cabaret on the weekends,

185
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,220
the beer was cold, and tasty,

186
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,140
and the bartender

187
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,730
was this idiot who liked
the most ridiculous dirty jokes.

188
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,610
The hookers in the whorehouses
were money-grubbers,

189
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,650
and there were a lot
who were hard on the eyes.

190
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,070
But you know,

191
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,570
they were all nice to us,

192
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,860
and they all had this
pitiful look in their eyes.

193
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,370
The lady at this restaurant on
Versailles Road would always serve me

194
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,660
fish and chips,
without me ever ordering it.

195
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,710
She said it was because I was a foreigner,

196
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,290
and that it was the local
delicacy, time and time again.

197
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,670
I told her it was too greasy,
and I couldn't eat it,

198
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,300
but I didn't want to offend,

199
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,260
so I gagged it down,
each time, hard though it was.

200
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,230
I couldn't stand London.
But still, those people...

201
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,520
The bartender, the hookers, the old lady

202
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,650
had nothing to do with this conflict.

203
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,650
They had nothing to do with this war,
or Nazis, or vampires.

204
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,660
That major guy,

205
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,660
and Section XIII,

206
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,410
and the Last Battalion,

207
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,700
and those of us in Hellsing
were none of their concern.

208
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,590
But now, there they are,
dead bodies eating dead bodies.

209
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,800
That's something I just can't accept.

210
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,930
<i>Seras, let's avenge them.</i>

211
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,930
<i>Let 'em have it. Let those guys have it.</i>

212
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,860
Mm-hmm, all right.
All right, Chief. All right!

213
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,500
Target the enemy flying dreadnought,

214
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,960
and prepare to open fire!

215
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,130
<i>Fire!</i>

216
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,020
We're taking fire!

217
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,150
Let 'em have it.

218
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,610
Let those guys have it.

219
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,960
First, third, and fourth blocks hit!

220
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,170
Explosion in ready room 2!

221
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,560
Aft engine mounts 4
and 5 have been shot off!

222
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,740
Flight capacity down 32 percent!

223
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,990
Lieutenant!

224
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,580
We have to...
We have to turn the ship around!

225
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
It's too late!

226
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,130
This ship's light armor is
as good as a paper balloon

227
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,630
against that much firepower.

228
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
This huge hulk can't escape.

229
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,720
Bring us down! Land us! Crash-land us!

230
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,310
Hit Hellsing headquarters... No, hit <i>her!</i>

231
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,570
Hit Seras Victoria!

232
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,920
No! Get out of there, Seras!

233
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,770
The wide-area suppression
incendiary burst grenade launcher,

234
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,070
Vladimir...?

235
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,590
We're out of control!
We're out of control!

236
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,590
W-We're falling!

237
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,220
Oh, she did it! She did it!

238
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,720
-Tallyho! Tallyho!
-All right!

239
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,550
They're not through yet!

240
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,720
That's right. They're not through yet,
ladies. Keep your eyes open.

241
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,730
They're coming.

242
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,230
They escaped just before they crashed!

243
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,240
That's impossible!
They're not even scratched!

244
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,490
That's right.
They aren't human. They're monsters.

245
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,090
Captain...

246
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,920
Young lady, you stand down and rearm.

247
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,630
Yeah!

248
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,060
Just you watch, young lady.
Let us show you how geese fight.

249
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,240
All right, the foreplay is over.

250
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,490
Here they come, geese.

251
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,740
It's time to go to work. Rock n' roll!

252
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,750
There are 42 surviving soldiers!

253
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,750
Those warheads were not
just run-of-the-mill bombs.

254
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,510
We've lost more than half our
personnel, and all of our heavy arms.

255
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,220
Even so, our spirits are high!

256
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,970
Your orders, Lieutenant Zorin Blitz?

257
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,470
It is enough. It will be
enough to kill all of them!

258
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,980
We'll kill them.

259
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,480
We'll kill them all!

260
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,780
Young lady, vampires
are what they are, right?

261
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,040
Folks with inhuman reflexes
and physical capabilities,

262
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,960
possessing a beastlike thirst
for blood and terrible strength.

263
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,050
They can sense a human's
bloodlust, read their moves,

264
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,050
escape their notice,
and move sharp-footedly.

265
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,050
They can avoid firearm
and sword attacks easily,

266
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,350
attack their opponent,
and feast upon their blood, right?

267
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,560
Well, how does this sound?

268
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,780
Mines! They've got mines!

269
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,280
They've stopped. Do it.

270
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,890
Bingo!

271
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,850
That's what happens when
you look down on humans.

272
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,310
Th-They set those traps?

273
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,860
Traps? It's the fools' own fault
for charging in here, head-on.

274
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,990
They're mindless,
motionless, emotionless devices.

275
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,870
And they aren't single points,
but a full-scale frontal attack.

276
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:02,200
60 claymore mines with blessed ball
bearings, all detonated at the same time.

277
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,580
Go ahead and dodge <i>that,</i> if you can.

278
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,340
We're not all that great
at fighting, you see.

279
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,550
It's a messy affair, so we don't
come out and fight in the open,

280
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,340
not like you soldiers.

281
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,470
Third floor, grenade volley.

282
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,060
Rapid-fire shots! Lay down a line of fire!
Don't let them raise their heads up!

283
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,770
A whole sheet of it!
Put down a full-scale attack!

284
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,030
Rifle squads, concentrate all of your fire
into a hail of bullets

285
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,030
in one place at a time!

286
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,540
Captain!

287
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,080
We have halted the enemy's advance.

288
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,830
They're pinned down behind the hills

289
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
and aren't moving an inch.

290
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,170
They're cooking something up.
But for now, that will do.

291
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,800
As long as they can't get
near us, we'll end up on top.

292
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,100
This is the first time
we've done any house-sitting.

293
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,930
Any that we're getting paid for.

294
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,770
If we let those scary old men
into the house, we lose.

295
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,860
Because we're not all that
great at fighting, you see.

296
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,370
Are they going to withdraw?

297
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,910
Ordinarily, they would.

298
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,460
If they were ordinary people,
they would withdraw.

299
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,760
They already would have,
no doubt about it.

300
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,390
But those guys ain't human.

301
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,810
They're monsters.

302
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,360
What the...

303
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,150
What is that thing?!

304
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,210
<i>-What is that?!</i>
<i>-That thing is huge!</i>

305
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,130
What is it?!

306
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,210
H-Hey, have we lost our minds?

307
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,130
What's the matter?!
What are you doing?! Keep firing! Hey!

308
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,810
Why aren't you shooting?!

309
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,600
Hey, what's going on?!

310
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,730
H-Hey, what kind of trick is this?

311
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,140
Th-This... This cannot be happening!

312
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,250
-Save me! My leg! My leg!
-It's a monster!

313
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,250
My arm! My... My arm!

314
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,000
Help us!

315
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,050
I-I can't move!

316
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,280
It can't be... This isn't happening...

317
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't know what this is, but,

318
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,910
there's something inside me
that's telling me that...

319
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,220
<i>I told you about the other eye</i>
<i>inside your forehead, right?</i>

320
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,180
<i>That's your third eye.</i>

321
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,560
Let go of your human eyes.

322
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,940
They are a matter for humans.

323
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,400
But you are no longer a human.

324
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,190
You are not human.

325
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,330
An illusion...?

326
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,620
It's an illusion!

327
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,830
-It's a monster! Help!
-My leg! My leg!

328
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,050
-My arm! M-My arm!
-Snap to! Please, snap to!

329
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,380
It's just a vision!

330
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,920
-Help me!
-I-I can't move!

331
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,930
It's a vision! An illusion!

332
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,470
Impossible! This can't be happening!

333
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,100
There's no way this can be!

334
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,480
Captain, it's an illusion!

335
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,230
This is an illusion!

336
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,690
Captain!

337
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,990
W-What...?

338
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,500
M-My arm... It's there...

339
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,790
W-What was that?

340
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,000
What's going on?

341
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,630
W-What was that just now?

342
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,460
Please, snap out of it!
It was an illusion.

343
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,800
It was witchcraft or something!

344
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,970
Witchcraft?

345
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,550
You say it's an illusion? That thing?!

346
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,470
Yes!

347
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,560
Correct, it was an illusion.
Nicely detected, Seras Victoria.

348
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,440
However... However, it's too late!

349
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,440
This ain't good.
We've lost the front quarter.

350
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,070
This is the front entrance.

351
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,620
We're being overrun by enemy
soldiers here, and they're coming in!

352
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,130
Gather our forces together.

353
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,050
Those who have split off, take it slow,
and pull back while fighting.

354
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,800
All remaining soldiers, assemble here!

355
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,140
Bring as many explosives
and grenades as you can carry.

356
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,980
Young lady...

357
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,560
Y-Yes?

358
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,020
We'll barricade ourselves
in this part of the building.

359
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,610
We'll take up defense,

360
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,360
and young lady, you're on offense.

361
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,490
We will defend this place.

362
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,990
While we do, young lady,
you will dispose of them.

363
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,500
Y-Yeah!

364
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,870
You're our ace in the hole,
young lady. Take care of them.

365
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,630
Before those guys cut us to ribbons.

366
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,880
We're counting on you.

367
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,190
R-Right!

368
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Oh, there's one important thing I forgot!

369
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,520
Seras!

370
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,030
Yes?!

371
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,530
Close your eyes!

372
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,170
W-W-What are you doing?!

373
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,920
Captain, no fair!

374
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,500
Yeah, no fair!

375
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,920
All right, let's go, you guys! Hurry!

376
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,470
That's abuse of power!

377
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,300
Sweet! In that case...

378
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,340
Me too!

379
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,510
-Me too!
-Me too!

380
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,140
Me too!

381
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,060
Nitwits!

382
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,940
Young lady Seras...

383
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,570
Don't go dying, now. Don't you die.

384
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,580
Captain, and the rest of you...

385
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,590
All right, go on!

386
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,800
Off I go!

387
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,510
She's a fine girl, huh?

388
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,190
Yeah. She's so good, it's ridiculous.

389
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,490
If we let that girl die,
we'll disgrace our manhood.

390
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,400
It will land us in hell, get me?

391
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,910
You're right.

392
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,120
Mm-hmm.

393
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,530
Yeah, that's the truth.

394
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,120
You bet, you bet.

395
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,750
Well, I hate to say this,
but I need your lives.

396
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,500
This will be the place
where you lose your lives.

397
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,510
Consider your posts to be your graves.

398
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,840
Captain, listen here.
Ordinarily, this is where you'd say,

399
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,050
"Anyone who wants to run, run now,"

400
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,140
or you'd let your subordinates flee,
staying behind by yourself,

401
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,520
or something like that.

402
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,140
What are you talking about?

403
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,520
You're all ungrateful sons,

404
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,270
who became merchants
of war for the fun,

405
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,820
and for the pocket change, aren't you?

406
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,740
-That's about right.
-You've got our number.

407
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,610
That we are.

408
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,790
Now then...

409
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,080
Let's go die, you dogs.

410
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,290
Let's go die,
while yelling out, "Fuck! Fuck!"

411
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,550
with our bellies full of lead,
writhing in pain.

412
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,170
You're probably right.

413
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,180
No doubt.

414
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,180
Absolutely no doubt about it!

415
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,250
It's not over yet.
The war is still just getting started.

416
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,290
It will grow more and more terrible.

417
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,800
Oh, yes, it would not do otherwise.

418
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,480
Now, you're going to pay.

419
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,070
Now, you cannot be saved!

420
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,120
<i>Verein</i>!

421
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,580
<i>Sturm</i>!<i> Sturm</i>!<i> Sturm</i>!

422
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,880
Damn them!

423
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,890
Now, die already, you scum!
