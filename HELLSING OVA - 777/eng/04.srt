1
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,840
<i>That despicable little smirk on his face.</i>

2
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,180
<i>That dreadful laugh...</i>

3
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,260
<i>with his cheeks</i>
<i>contorting slightly upwards.</i>

4
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,910
<i>He didn't look anything</i>
<i>like a Nazi SS officer.</i>

5
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,710
But at the time, in 1941, you all...

6
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,040
The Vatican's
European General Directorate...

7
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,460
collaborated with him
and his organization.

8
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,930
We were forced to collaborate.

9
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,720
He was carrying a direct
order from the<i></i>Führer.

10
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,850
Yes, of course.

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,520
And they commenced operations.

12
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:58,320
<i>The operation and their scheme are</i>
<i>ingrained in my memory, my Master.</i>

13
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,740
<i>Well done.</i>

14
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,830
<i>Arucard, Her Majesty herself is</i>
<i>convening a round table discussion.</i>

15
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>Oh, the Queen?</i>

16
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,670
Return at once and report the details.
Don't keep her waiting.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

18
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,550
Did you enjoy the thrill of war, Integra?

19
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,390
Did you feel the blood rush down there?

20
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,060
Did you see the dark red flame?

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,140
Shut up, you idiot! Who gives a damn!

22
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,350
Now get back here, damn you!

23
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,330
What the hell are you people doing?

24
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,500
There's absolutely no way
I can tell you that, Colonel.

25
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,170
It's a top secret order
issued by the late Führer.

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,300
Get off your high horse!

27
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,600
Why won't you turn us into vampires?!

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,390
Why? Why?! Answer me, you bastard!

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,560
That's enough, Colonel.

30
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,780
Any more of this childish behavior
and I'll blow your head off.

31
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,580
What are you doing?

32
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,090
What do you intend to do with
your army of 1000 vampires?

33
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,710
Major?!

34
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,300
<i>The pudgy little man</i>
<i>with the glasses said it...</i>

35
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,180
<i>as if he were hell's</i>
<i>own commanding officer.</i>

36
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,060
I intend to savor
the infinite pleasures of war.

37
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,730
Of the next war...

38
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,730
and the next war after that one.

39
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,870
The operation
called for creating vampires...

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,620
the secret "Last Battalion."

41
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,370
It's simple.

42
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,130
You helped fund the operation.

43
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,300
And you knew about it as well.

44
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,130
You knowingly collaborated.

45
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,260
Forced to? Nonsense.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,970
You wanted him to turn you into a vampire.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,770
It wasn't just me!

48
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,020
All of us were...

49
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,350
They tricked me...

50
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,980
Help me...

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,570
Please, Maxwell.

52
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm begging you!

53
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
Nope.

54
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,240
SLURP

55
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,830
Can't do it.
It's impossible to get back.

56
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,830
It'll take an extra week by boat.

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
An airplane is out of the question.

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
We can't leave that
big wooden box here, can we?

59
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,260
This is my final domain.

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,760
This is where I was born
and this is where I will die.

61
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,310
SLURP SLURP

62
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,420
So you want some more, Anderson?!

63
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,220
Arucard!

64
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,250
The Vatican has a small jet airplane
13 kilometers north of here.

65
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Take that release paper
and get the hell out of here...

66
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,500
before I decide to kill you again.

67
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,430
Amen.

68
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,450
I'm back, my Master.

69
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,990
Job well done, my servant.

70
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,080
You're in the presence of the Queen.
Take off your sunglasses.

71
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,950
It's been a long time, Vampire.

72
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,780
Let me get a closer look at you.

73
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,130
You haven't changed at all, Arucard.

74
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,710
You can see the years have
taken their toll on me.

75
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm a wrinkled old lady.

76
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,350
You're still the same spirited girl
you were 50 years ago, my lady.

77
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:45,350
No, your highness is without a doubt
even more beautiful today.

78
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,110
Give me your report, Vampire.

79
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,870
Fifty-five years ago,
a crazed Nazi major...

80
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,120
attempted to create a vampire army.

81
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,430
Walter and I laid waste to the operation.

82
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,730
However, they refused to give up.

83
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,860
Now they're trying to
complete their research.

84
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,860
They're the remnants
of the Third Reich's...

85
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,990
"Last Battalion."

86
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,570
That's what Millennium is.

87
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,830
Tubalcain's blood must have given us away.

88
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,250
The Major really blew it.

89
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,210
Hold it.

90
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm the messenger.
I'm not here to fight with you.

91
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,470
Walter.

92
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,220
Security was airtight.
And no sign of any breach.

93
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,230
Your security is useless against me.
I'm everywhere and nowhere.

94
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,520
He's only a child.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,770
What's Millennium? What are they after?

96
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,280
What?

97
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,410
Hello.

98
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,500
Hello...

99
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,260
To the representatives of Britain
and the Vatican who are here today...

100
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,970
my commanding officer, the Major,
has something he wants to tell you.

101
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,850
Please give him your attention.

102
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,060
Huh?

103
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,650
<i>What's the matter? There's no picture.</i>

104
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>Major, stop it!</i>
<i>For god's sake please don't.</i>

105
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,110
<i>Warrant Officer Schrödinger,</i>
<i>the screen is completely blank.</i>

106
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,080
<i>-Oh, I can see them now.</i>
<i>-Help! Please help!</i>

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,710
Major, it looks like you're having
quite a time over there.

108
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,790
<i>No, a great weight has finally</i>
<i>been lifted from my shoulders.</i>

109
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,460
<i>It feels good. It feels very good.</i>

110
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,970
Hello, Major.

111
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,090
<i>It's been a long time, Arucard.</i>

112
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,720
<i>I'm extremely happy to see you again.</i>

113
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,230
What is it you want?

114
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,690
<i>It's the head of the Royal Order of</i>
<i>Religious Knights, Sir Integra Hellsing.</i>

115
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,240
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you.</i>

116
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,240
What is the purpose of this idiocy?

117
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,450
Answer me!

118
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,830
<i>The purpose?</i>

119
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,500
<i>That's a stupid question,</i>
<i>my beautiful fräulein.</i>

120
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,790
<i>Purpose? How funny.</i>

121
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,300
To put it in the strongest terms,
fräulein...

122
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,510
we have no purpose.

123
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,850
HANG THE DEFEATIST!!

124
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,100
You should know, fräulein...

125
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,860
that there are those in this world,

126
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,610
certain irredeemable louts,
for whom the means need no end.

127
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,620
That is to say, ourselves.

128
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,710
Don't stop until he is completely gone.

129
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,130
We can't have him turning into a ghoul.

130
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Wow! That looks pretty harsh, Major.

131
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,730
You people are insane.

132
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,230
<i>Someone from the Vatican's Iscariot</i>
<i>Organization speaks of "insanity"?</i>

133
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,610
<i>It is your God who guarantees my insanity.</i>

134
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,240
<i>So let me ask you...</i>

135
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,330
<i>Who is it that guarantees</i>
<i>your God's sanity?</i>

136
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,960
<i>We are the Third Reich's SS.</i>

137
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,300
<i>Do you have any idea how</i>
<i>many people we've killed?</i>

138
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,970
We're insane?
As if it were something new.

139
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,800
You should have said
that half a century ago.

140
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,430
<i>Very well. Excellent.</i>

141
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,980
<i>Then try to stop me,</i>
<i>you self-proclaimed "normal" people.</i>

142
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,320
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>you people are not my enemy.</i>

143
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,190
<i>My enemy is Britain...</i>

144
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,990
<i>Hellsing...</i>

145
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,570
<i>No, it's that man</i>
<i>standing gleefully over there!</i>

146
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,880
A splendid declaration of war.

147
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,390
Fine. I'll annihilate you
as many times as I have to!

148
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,390
<i>We will never give up.</i>

149
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,890
<i>We'll reverse this ridiculous outcome</i>
<i>as many times as we have to.</i>

150
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,150
Arucard, Seras. Shoot.

151
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,570
<i>Shooting the messenger,</i>
<i>that's not very nice.</i>

152
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,450
<i>Goodbye, fräulein.</i>

153
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,830
<i>I look forward to meeting</i>
<i>again on the battlefield.</i>

154
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,810
Sir Hellsing.

155
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,060
Arucard.

156
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,270
This is an order.

157
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,030
Destroy them.

158
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,750
They're finally paying us some attention.

159
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,050
Doc, Captain, once I start
to dance, I dance to the finish.

160
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,220
Enjoy it as much as possible, right?

161
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,700
You're slow!

162
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,580
In the time it took you just
to walk down the hall,

163
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,660
I went to London, got my head
blown off and made it back already.

164
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,920
Perhaps you should go on a diet, Major.

165
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,300
That's impossible.

166
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,260
Warrant Officer Schrödinger,
stop being disrespectful.

167
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,510
It's all right, Doctor.

168
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,260
The Warrant Officer has
carried out his mission.

169
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,320
Engage flaps!

170
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,580
Commence Deus Ex Machina!

171
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,180
This is the Last Battalion's Commander
speaking to the entire air fleet.

172
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,890
We are headed for England's capital,
for the skies above London.

173
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,600
Send up the beacon.

174
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,770
The signal fire of defiance
announcing our return

175
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,560
to this mortal world.

176
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,370
<i>Let's sing a little song today</i>

177
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,830
<i>And drink some cool wine</i>

178
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,380
<i>The glasses should be ringing</i>

179
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,420
<i>Since we must, we must part</i>

180
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,350
<i>Give me your hand</i>

181
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,600
<i>Your white hand</i>

182
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,440
<i>Farewell, my love, farewell</i>

183
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:54,860
<i>Farewell, farewell</i>

184
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,820
<i>Since we're going</i>

185
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,790
<i>Since we're going</i>

186
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,130
<i>Since we're going against England</i>

187
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,010
<i>England</i>

188
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,100
And thus the ship came into my possession.

189
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,520
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor...

190
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,480
My bullet punishes all
without distinction.

191
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,610
Welcome aboard.

192
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,990
You have your wish.

193
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,450
We and our ship are
at Millennium's service.

194
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,620
What's it like, new Captain?

195
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,870
What's it like to become a vampire...

196
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,340
after betraying your own country
and killing all your mates?

197
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,630
I see.

198
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,590
How does it feel to unleash
your powers of invincibility and...

199
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,180
turn your superiors and subordinates
into ghoul corpses, new Captain?

200
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,850
I see.

201
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,190
Well done! This is amazing!

202
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,980
Millennium is very happy to have you.

203
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,240
Oh, you certainly deserve full credit.

204
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,120
We couldn't have done it without you.

205
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,750
The Major will be so happy.

206
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,670
Well...

207
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,300
now that the deed is done,
hurry up and die, Limey.

208
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,970
You set us up, bitch!

209
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,810
I only heard a single shot!

210
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,310
But that's ridiculous! It can't be!

211
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,020
I'm Rip Van Winkle, the hunter.

212
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,320
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor...

213
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,490
My bullet punishes all
without distinction!

214
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,450
You bitch!

215
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,700
Foolish child.

216
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,850
First Lieutenant.

217
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,770
Oh, you're awake?

218
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,780
I ran out of paint before I could finish,
but I guess this will do.

219
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,620
We'd be a pretty sorry
looking ship without this.

220
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,370
Our cursed banner.

221
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,630
The German Third Reich's
Atlantic Fleet Flagship Adler...

222
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,840
now commencing operations!

223
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,140
No matter how many times we kill them,
they come back.

224
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,270
They certainly are a persistent lot.

225
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,770
However many times they come back,
we'll just keep killing them.

226
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,560
It's as simple as that.

227
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,280
This time it's not just the two of us.
We have a new member.

228
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

229
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,570
What?

230
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,870
Why did you make Seras a vampire?

231
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:36,080
Why would you of all people
do something so out of character?

232
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,380
It was her decision.

233
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,550
She chose her own path.

234
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,340
What about her family?

235
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,590
She doesn't have any. She's an orphan.

236
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,350
I figured.

237
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,850
She's much more interesting
than she looks.

238
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,980
Her superiors and coworkers
were being turned

239
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,690
into ghouls right and left
in her town of death.

240
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,610
A vampire was trying to rape and kill her.

241
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,740
It was a hell like the bottom
of a witch's cauldron.

242
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,080
And what did she do?
What did she choose?

243
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,370
Giving up is what kills people.

244
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:22,590
Those who refuse to give up are
entitled to trample upon humanity.

245
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,590
Now all she needs to
do is drink blood, right?

246
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,850
She'll drink.

247
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,060
She'll definitely drink.

248
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,710
Why don't you drink blood?

249
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,130
You're not human anymore.

250
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,760
You're a vampire, Seras.

251
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
But, um, it's just...

252
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,820
Integra!

253
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,540
I cut my finger.

254
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,420
I don't want it to get infected.

255
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,130
Please, lick it for me.

256
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,420
But, um...

257
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,550
Lick it. That's an order.

258
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,750
Seras, whatever you do, don't bite.

259
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,880
It's genuine,
100 percent pure virgin blood.

260
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,260
You feel any better?

261
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,550
Uh, but...

262
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,140
thank you.

263
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,850
Prepare your gear and standby for action.

264
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,480
We've lost contact with our aircraft
carrier Eagle off the coast of Wales.

265
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,140
It's probably them.

266
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,980
Y-Yes, sir!

267
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,360
We're leaking information
to them like a sieve.

268
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,290
I've already been attacked by
their vampire faithful four times.

269
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,160
<i>They have informants all across the world.</i>

270
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,290
<i>Over there, in Britain, in the Vatican.</i>

271
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,760
<i>They probably even had</i>
<i>one at the round table.</i>

272
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>They are the scum of the earth.</i>

273
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,600
The question is, what are
these vampires going to do?

274
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,640
<i>They have their sights set on England.</i>

275
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,070
It's turned out
just as you planned, Maxwell.

276
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,240
You must be overjoyed.

277
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,030
<i>Part of me is.</i>

278
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,070
<i>But the other part is extremely unhappy.</i>

279
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,120
Then why didn't you argue back
when he said our God was mad?!

280
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,790
They're not the least bit
interested in us.

281
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,460
They're completely absorbed
with Hellsing and Arucard.

282
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,760
In which case, actions
speak louder than words.

283
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,770
When the time is right,
we'll clobber them from the side.

284
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,350
<i>Yes.</i>

285
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,930
<i>When all is said and done,</i>

286
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,940
<i>we'll be the ones standing in</i>
<i>the ring with our fists raised.</i>

287
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,900
<i>His Holiness, the Pope, issued a</i>
<i>mobilization order some time ago.</i>

288
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,860
<i>He's transferred the Knights of Malta,</i>

289
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,780
<i>the Knights of St. Steven,</i>

290
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,080
<i>the Military Order of Calatrava la Nueva,</i>

291
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,330
<i>the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword,</i>

292
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,290
<i>and the Swiss Company</i>
<i>headquarters to here.</i>

293
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,590
<i>The Vatican's Administration of</i>
<i>Holy Relics 3rd Division, Matthew,</i>

294
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>has also gone into action.</i>

295
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,300
<i>Specialized anti-vampire tactical</i>
<i>arms are also being prepared.</i>

296
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,470
It's just like a Crusade.

297
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,100
<i>Yes. That's exactly right.</i>

298
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,560
<i>Only the enemy isn't Allah.</i>

299
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,900
This time the enemy is the god of war...

300
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,190
Mars!

301
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,530
Very well.

302
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,030
Castle after castle...

303
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,780
town after town...

304
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,160
we'll heap their corpses
on top of each other!

305
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,370
<i>You are our trump card, Anderson.</i>

306
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,920
<i>Return to base by</i>
<i>whatever means you see fit.</i>

307
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,960
All right.

308
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,170
<i>In the name of the</i>
<i>Father and the Holy Spirit.</i>

309
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,170
Amen!

310
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,140
Mars!

311
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,360
Mars!

312
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,530
Mars.

313
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,660
All right, you bastards.

314
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,750
Have a taste of our divine punishment.

315
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,100
Thirty-six hours, fifteen minutes more.

316
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,110
Oh, I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait.

317
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,280
We've had no communication
with Eagle for 18 hours.

318
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,910
She's in the Atlantic, resting 300
kilometers off the coast of Pawling.

319
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,120
She's flying that symbol of madness.

320
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,450
Millennium.

321
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,040
The situation is moving outside
the Royal Navy's sphere.

322
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,250
What's the status?

323
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,220
-Tell her.
-Yes.

324
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,470
She's not responding whatsoever.

325
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,350
There's been no reply to
any of our communications.

326
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,640
However,
a satellite photo has confirmed...

327
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,310
that there is a person
on deck holding a parasol.

328
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Two SAS platoons are currently
approaching via helicopter...

329
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,690
in order to check out the situation
and bring things under control.

330
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,070
General.

331
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,570
What is it?

332
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,410
Cancel the operation and
order them to return immediately.

333
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,200
Otherwise they'll be wiped out.

334
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,750
The helicopters have been shot down!

335
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,920
By weapons onboard the carrier?!

336
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,090
No.

337
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,710
It was a single musket shot.

338
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,380
That's absurd!

339
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,010
We'll get confirmation immediately.

340
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,480
What are you going to do, Integra?

341
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,360
We've received direct orders
from her Royal Highness.

342
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,280
We've determined that these
incidents are the work of vampires

343
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
and will be taking independent action.

344
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,570
-What the...?!
-What?

345
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,780
You heard me, Sir Penwood.

346
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,370
Right.

347
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,710
Very well, Integra.

348
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,420
You and Hellsing are free to act.

349
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Yes.

350
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,440
They aren't attacking us themselves...

351
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,240
but if we draw near,
they fire the weapon.

352
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,950
It's textbook.
They're trying to lure us in.

353
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,450
But we can't just call it
a ghost ship and leave it at that.

354
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,000
It's too dark and menacing.

355
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,250
For vampires,
the sea is the lowest pit of hell.

356
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,630
They may be locked in
the situation, but so are we.

357
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,180
How do we get Arucard and
Seras onto that floating fortress?

358
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,890
A large ship?

359
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,690
No. It would take too long.

360
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,940
We can't count on them
to stay put forever.

361
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,110
A small high-speed craft?

362
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,530
No.

363
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,990
They have high caliber
anti-aircraft and Gatling guns.

364
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,200
It's hard to imagine it standing up
to a hail of bullets.

365
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,120
What about dropping them in from above?

366
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,330
No. With the anti-aircraft
missiles they have onboard,

367
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,960
we couldn't even get close,
let alone directly above.

368
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,010
We could use an airplane
with lots of decoy chaff.

369
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,130
No.

370
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,430
Even if we fooled the missiles,
they still have their magic bullet.

371
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,560
The bottom line is...

372
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,150
despite their hail of
missiles and magic bullets...

373
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:52,320
you need to get me
standing on top of that deck.

374
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,740
We're asking the impossible.

375
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,290
No, there is an aircraft
that's up to the task.

376
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,040
It's probably the only one
of its kind in the world.

377
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,870
<i>My son</i>

378
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,660
<i>Take heart</i>

379
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:47,710
<i>Thou shalt not thus despair</i>

380
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,190
<i>Now or over valley and mountain</i>

381
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,190
<i>Tomorrow we meet with the day</i>
<i>The noble deer</i>

382
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,190
-What's she singing?
-<i>As he roveth</i>

383
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,610
-It's from Carl Maria Von Weber's...
-<i>The eagle bold</i>

384
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,200
-"Der Freischütz."
-<i>As he moveth</i>

385
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,620
<i>Our rifles shall give us for prey</i>

386
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,200
<i>Shall give us for prey</i>
<i>Shall give us for prey</i>

387
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,040
What's happening?

388
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,920
What?

389
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,840
He's... He's coming!

390
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,970
We've got something on the radar!
It's approaching us.

391
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,510
My god...

392
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,060
It's traveling at Mach 2.8.
Altitude is 85,000!

393
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,060
Altitude is 85,000? That's ridiculous!

394
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,230
It's a reconnaissance craft. SR71.

395
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,150
He's coming!

396
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,480
First Lieutenant, what's coming?

397
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,950
It's him!

398
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,240
It's him!

399
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,910
The voice of madness is coming!

400
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,830
Raising the stench of death
as he clenches the reins...

401
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,710
heading straight for us with
his black iron horses in tow!

402
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,720
Enemy aircraft now diving!

403
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,640
My god...

404
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,350
He's trying to ram us?!

405
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,650
Blast the engine!
Move her out of the way!

406
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,480
Put up a barrage of anti-aircraft!
Hurry! Hurry!

407
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,820
I hear a voice from over there...

408
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,870
I hear a voice calling me...

409
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,500
Unleash Cromwell, numbers 3, 2, and 1.

410
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,470
You will soon lose the light of day.

411
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,890
Fate has driven you.

412
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,810
Goodbye...

413
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,650
My spirit trembles...

414
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,470
First Lieutenant, do you know
how "Der Freischütz"<i></i>ends?

415
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,110
Kaspar, who has trifled with
the Black Ranger, Zamiel,

416
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,280
is whisked away to hell by Zamiel...

417
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,400
<i>and his corpse is thrown</i>
<i>into the bottom of a ravine.</i>

418
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,660
<i>Prepare yourself, First Lieutenant.</i>

419
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,920
<i>Zamiel is descending upon you as well.</i>

420
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,510
Those who impersonate the dead...

421
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,060
shall join their ranks!

422
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,900
First Lieutenant!

423
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,530
It's almost time for the order!

424
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,370
We have to hold out until then!

425
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
You goddamn monster!

426
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,350
Shoot him! Shoot him!

427
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,610
The grenades! Throw the grenades!

428
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,170
What the hell?

429
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,640
What the hell are you?!

430
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,360
<i>Prepare yourself, First Lieutenant.</i>

431
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,570
<i>What will you do in the face of Zamiel?</i>

432
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,780
<i>What will...</i>

433
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,660
...you do, Rip Van Winkle?

434
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,480
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor...

435
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,980
My bullet punishes all
without distinction!

436
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,290
Die!

437
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,710
Die! Die!

438
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,640
Die! Die!

439
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,890
Die and go to hell!

440
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,530
I caught it.

441
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,040
Rip Van Winkle...

442
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:50,170
I've caught you.

443
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,710
<i>Well done, First Lieutenant.</i>

444
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,880
<i>The operation was a success.</i>

445
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,140
<i>No matter how many stones</i>
<i>you cast upon the water's surface...</i>

446
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,890
<i>No matter how much</i>
<i>you stomp upon the shadow...</i>

447
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,100
<i>The water's surface and</i>
<i>the shadow never go away.</i>

448
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,480
That is how it is.

449
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,320
That is the river of death.

450
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,610
Life and death,
it's all just one big hoax.

451
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,620
Immortal, invincible,
undefeated, and almighty.

452
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,830
It's ludicrous.

453
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,830
But we will overthrow him.

454
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,960
Through your sacrifice,
we will overthrow Arucard.

455
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,180
Don't.

456
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,760
She's performed her mission perfectly.

457
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,810
Absolutely perfectly.

458
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,650
I won't allow her to be cremated.

459
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,570
Y-Yes, sir.

460
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,030
<i>Achtung</i>.

461
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,160
Farewell.

462
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:54,460
I'll see you in Valhalla,
First Lieutenant.

463
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,040
Farewell.

464
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,840
-Farewell.
-Farewell.

465
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,640
See you later, Rip Van.

466
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,060
<i>Sieg Heil</i>!

467
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,730
Are you having fun, Arucard?

468
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,560
War is fun.

469
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,980
Sing the victory hymn, Arucard.

470
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,110
And then watch.

471
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,820
I can see it.

472
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,280
I can see it clearly
from behind my spectacles.

473
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,660
The city's lights... Its steeples...

474
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,250
Hear the victory hymn, Arucard.

475
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:24,300
And watch the collapse
of the British Empire!

476
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,220
My friends, I like war...

477
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,100
My friends, I like war.

478
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,900
My friends, I love war.

479
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,610
I like wars of extermination.
I like lightning warfare.

480
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,900
I like bruising slugfests.
I like defensive wars.

481
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,200
I like siege warfare.
I like smashing enemy lines.

482
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,030
I like falling back.
I like mopping-up operations.

483
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,660
I like withdrawals.

484
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,830
Wars on prairies, in streets,
in trenches, on grasslands...

485
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,660
on tundra, in deserts, on the sea,
in the air, in the mud, in swamps...

486
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,250
I love every possible act of warfare
that occurs on the face of the earth.

487
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,260
I like blasting the enemy to smithereens

488
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,140
with artillery salvos that thunder
across the line of battle.

489
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:17,260
My heart leaps whenever an enemy
soldier is tossed high into the air

490
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,770
and cut to pieces by
a few well placed shots!

491
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,980
I like it when a tank operator
uses a Tiegel Acht-acht to

492
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,610
obliterate enemy tanks.

493
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,660
It felt good whenever an
enemy soldier who screamed

494
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,580
as he fled from a blazing tank was
mowed down by a machine gun.

495
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,330
I like it when rows of infantry
with the tips of their bayonets

496
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,290
all lined up trample upon enemy lines.

497
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,460
It plucks my heart strings

498
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:55,050
to see panicked fresh recruits stabbing
dead enemy soldiers over and over again.

499
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,890
The sight of despairing
deserters being strung up

500
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,980
from a street lamp is
a pleasure I can't resist.

501
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,520
There's nothing better than
lowering down my palm and

502
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,480
seeing screaming prisoners
of war drop like flies

503
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,150
as they're mowed down
by ear-piercing Schmeissers.

504
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,450
When the pitiful resistance fighters
make their brave stand only to

505
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:25,880
have their entire city smashed to
atoms by Dora's 4.8 ton bombshells...

506
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,750
I'm simply in ecstasy!

507
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:33,260
I like being ravaged by
Russian armored divisions.

508
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,800
It's so sad to see towns that were
supposed to be defended at all costs

509
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,050
being laid to waste...

510
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,930
their women and children
being raped and killed.

511
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,610
I like being squashed and exterminated
by Anglo-American material superiority.

512
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,190
Crawling around on the ground like vermin

513
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,610
while being hounded by
Jabos is the ultimate humiliation.

514
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,330
My friends, I want war...

515
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,000
Hellish war.

516
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,750
My friends...

517
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,010
My brothers in arms who serve me...

518
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,680
What do you want?

519
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,220
Do you want further war?

520
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:27,770
Do you want a merciless, shit-like war?

521
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,820
A war that unleashes all of nature's fury?

522
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,950
A war like a tempest that kills
all the ravens upon this earth?

523
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,450
<i>Krieg</i>!<i> Krieg</i>!

524
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,830
Then war it is.

525
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,420
We are a clenched fist...

526
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:58,010
about to be lowered with all its might.

527
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:05,770
But after enduring over
half a century in the darkness...

528
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,310
for us, a simple, ordinary
war is no longer sufficient.

529
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,650
We need a massive war.

530
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,070
A massive, all-out war!

531
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,360
We are but a single battalion.

532
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,700
The remnants of a defeated army
numbering less than a thousand.

533
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,410
However, I believe that
each of you old warriors

534
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,710
is equal to a thousand of their men.

535
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,040
Which means together, including myself,

536
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,880
we form an army of
one million and one men.

537
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,670
Let's wake them up...

538
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,550
The ones who sent us into oblivion
and who now lie fast asleep.

539
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,140
Let's drag them down by their hair,

540
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,140
open their eyes, and remind them.

541
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,600
Remind them of what
it feels like to live in fear.

542
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:57,860
Remind them of the sound
of our combat boots!

543
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,510
Remind them that between heaven and hell

544
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:25,470
there are things they
never thought imaginable.

545
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,930
It's Europe! The light of Europe!

546
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,900
Our<i> Kampfgruppe</i> of a thousand vampires

547
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,280
is going to turn this world to ash.

548
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,650
Yes.

549
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,410
That is the light of Europe
we've been longing for.

550
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,540
I've brought you back
to our old battlefield...

551
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,670
just as I promised.

552
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,260
To our dear beloved war!

553
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,180
Major! Acting Major!

554
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,300
Battalion Commander!

555
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,140
Major! Acting Major...!

556
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,530
At last the sea lion has crossed
the ocean and climbs up upon the land.

557
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,570
To all members of
the Millennium Battalion,

558
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,080
this is an order from your commander.

559
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,700
My friends...

560
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,130
We're going to give them hell.

561
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,590
<i>"At last the sea lion has crossed</i>
<i>the ocean and is heading up the hill."</i>

562
