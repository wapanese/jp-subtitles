1
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,560
They're really making
a spectacle of things, huh?

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,560
My master, my servant.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,980
Every which way, they are all written off.

4
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,480
Now, what is the final tally?

5
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,120
We are nearly to the climax.
Now it's Hellsing's turn.

6
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,740
It's been a long time!

7
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,030
Are you my death? Are you our deaths?

8
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,300
Everyone is dying with a smile.

9
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,720
Yes. They came here to die, after all.

10
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,220
If they want to die so badly...
If they want to die so badly,

11
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,890
then just hang yourselves!

12
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,600
You could have
hanged yourselves, 50 years ago!

13
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,270
I'm afraid we could not
have had that, frÃ¤ulein.

14
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,490
There is no way we could
settle for simply dying.

15
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,450
That is just how incorrigible we are.

16
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,040
There is nobody in the whole
world that has need for us.

17
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,210
Everybody in the whole world
is trying to forget us.

18
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,800
But even so,
we are still needed by ourselves.

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,100
We are not about to just "simply" die.
We need more than that.

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,810
Our deaths require that there
is something more than that.

21
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,480
Something more, something more!

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,480
Such is how we have come this far.
And now we are here!

23
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,700
Something more!
There must be something else!

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,700
Some other place where we can fight,

25
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,830
some other enemy
somewhere for us to fight!

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,960
The world is vast. It is filled
with menace and marvel!

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,960
It is rich to overflowing
with conflict and gunfire!

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,510
There is no doubt that
somewhere in this world,

29
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,640
there lies a battlefield
fertile enough to support us!

30
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,100
Our deaths require something...
Something even more.

31
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,780
Otherwise, we would be
compelled to march on endlessly.

32
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,740
Just for us to die. That is
why you are precious to us!

33
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,240
Such is your value to us!

34
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,790
You are magnificent!

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,870
The Order of the Royal
Imperial Church, Hellsing!

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,170
You are what makes it
worth it for us to die,

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,050
and you are what makes
it worth it for us to kill.

38
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,300
Miss Integra, please go on ahead.

39
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,220
Seras...!

40
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,180
Quickly!

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,850
Go find the Major! We must not let him...

42
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,690
we must not let men like him
say another word!

43
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,240
Don't get killed.
I won't permit that, Seras.

44
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,070
I absolutely won't permit that.

45
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,210
Hmph, such a faithful dog.

46
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,220
Well done.

47
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,310
Hmph, you sure placed a bet
with some long odds, Walter.

48
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,770
Your card's about to burn up
and fall to the ground.

49
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,530
My master will see to your master.

50
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,950
My comrade will see to your comrades.

51
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,280
And as for you,

52
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,370
I will kill you.

53
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,160
Such a cruel end.

54
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,710
I have no interest in matching you
in the fight you staked your life on.

55
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,880
You are nothing but a simple traitor.

56
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,920
A simple one!

57
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,430
In my entire life, I have never
abided a single traitor.

58
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,810
How long do you think I will
comport myself fighting one-on-one?

59
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,190
You will die all too easily.
To say nothing of me being hungry.

60
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,110
I am unsure whether even I will
be able to devour all of this!

61
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,450
Everything has ended up
exactly as you desired, Major.

62
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,160
Yes. Everything is as I wish.

63
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,460
He has again
begun constructing the ramparts.

64
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,590
I have won.

65
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,170
From the outset, I never
considered him to be human.

66
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,970
In fact,
I don't even think of him as a vampire.

67
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,020
He is a castle,
as well as a mobile territory.

68
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,930
A population comprising

69
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,940
a river of death,
led by the will of their tyrant.

70
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,570
How does one defeat such a thing?
How does one slaughter such a thing?

71
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,200
I have pondered nothing else,
day and night.

72
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,410
That is the one and only way
that I wage war, after all.

73
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,000
War! War! Between him and me!

74
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,170
One must fight
with one's whole body and soul.

75
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,550
What is it that I have?
What is it that he has?

76
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,340
Being able to change his body,
employ familiars,

77
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,180
wield power to control minds,
regenerate his body,

78
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,650
and drink the blood of others,
all to shield his own life.

79
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,020
That is who he is.

80
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,690
I have nothing.

81
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,780
The reason being, I am human.

82
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,280
It would be fantastic to
become a vampire, wouldn't it?

83
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,040
Being able to live without end,
and to continue to fight without end,

84
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,040
must be rapturous, yes?

85
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,380
<i>But I cannot do that. And I never will!</i>

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,760
<i>Immortality is wonderful.</i>
<i>Powers are brilliant.</i>

87
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,890
<i>The soul's life is assimilated,</i>
<i>and its currency is blood.</i>

88
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,310
Get lost!

89
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,350
<i>My mind, my soul, and my</i>
<i>life all belong to me alone.</i>

90
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,190
<i>The joining of life with another...</i>
<i>The merging of life...</i>

91
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,860
<i>The unification of minds...</i>
<i>The true nature of vampires...</i>

92
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,870
<i>How magnificent!</i>

93
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,750
<i>It must surely be magnificent.</i>
<i>It must certainly be joyous.</i>

94
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,750
<i>But you must be joking.</i>
<i>I'll have absolutely no part of it!</i>

95
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,010
<i>What's mine is mine.</i>

96
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,510
<i>Every last hair, every last drop of blood.</i>

97
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,930
<i>I am me. I am me.</i>

98
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,140
<i>I am me!</i>

99
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,190
<i>I envy you. So brilliant, so beautiful.</i>

100
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,780
<i>That's why I adore you,</i>
<i>which is why I hate you.</i>

101
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:02,660
<i>Which is the whole reason why you</i>
<i>are my enemy. I count you my enemy.</i>

102
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,210
<i>I have finally found my archenemy.</i>
<i>For my war.</i>

103
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,960
<i>And so, we began</i>
<i>our tireless preparations,</i>

104
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,420
<i>for the next 50 years.</i>

105
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,430
Meow.

106
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,730
All is in readiness. All for this moment.

107
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,900
The Last Battalion, and the
Knights of the 9th Crusade,

108
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,740
and Anderson,
and the werewolves, and Walter,

109
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,750
and everything else over our
50 years has been for this moment.

110
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,380
Once Arucard unleashes Level 0,
discharges all of his lives,

111
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,380
and he becomes all alone in his castle,

112
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,970
can Anderson defeat him?

113
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,510
Can Walter defeat him?

114
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,760
Nay, I think.

115
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,270
He is a terrifying vampire,
all by himself.

116
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,810
He is a man who attacked all of
London by himself a century ago.

117
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,280
He is a man who fought the Ottoman
Empire by himself 500 years ago.

118
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,910
And once he starts drinking blood again,

119
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:31,120
everything will come to nothing.
Such guile!

120
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,290
In both life and death,
he scams everything.

121
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,090
And right now,
he is indeed in the thick of it.

122
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,670
What does one do to kill such a mad king?

123
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,430
Trample past wave
after wave of his numbers,

124
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,930
and destroy his almost limitless
forces to claim his head?

125
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,430
No!

126
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,150
He will drink blood once again.
The king is a big eater.

127
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,240
His greatest weapon is also his weakness.

128
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,280
Past and present, the tyrant has
gulped down his poisoned drink

129
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,280
for the sake of his own pride.

130
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,120
It's no use...

131
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,790
He's too strong...

132
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,350
It's no use...

133
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,600
No use...

134
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,520
<i>Hey, now, are you serious?</i>

135
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,360
<i>This ain't like you.</i>

136
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,450
<i>Get up. The woman I know</i>
<i>didn't know when to quit.</i>

137
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,170
<i>You're such a hopeless bitch.</i>

138
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,260
Snap out of it, you bloody fool.

139
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,010
Okay, now that your eyes are opened,

140
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,270
let's go, young lady! Let 'em have it!

141
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,060
Let's get this guy together!

142
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,110
Not just a point!

143
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,610
A surface! Take out the whole surface!

144
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
Got him!

145
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,420
No you haven't!

146
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,100
This is just too much. He's a monster.

147
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,520
He's as good
as a real-life wolfman, ain't he?

148
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,770
A werewolf!

149
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,280
A gold tooth...

150
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,280
Tooth fillings...? Then, all of this is...

151
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,030
It sure is.

152
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,120
The stuff they stole turning
Europe upside down 50 years ago.

153
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,660
Everything from gold bullion

154
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,580
to wads of money to watches,
all scattered about.

155
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,710
That filling you've got was probably

156
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,670
pulled out of some poor fellow
in a concentration camp somewhere.

157
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,800
Which is to say, that's the
kind of people these are.

158
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,220
They aren't even so much
as a military force.

159
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,680
At best, how different are they
from a band of killers?

160
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,270
I wouldn't even rate this bunch
as high as shit.

161
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,770
An invincible force? Knights of steel?

162
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,190
Ha! Don't make me laugh!

163
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,030
A silver tooth?

164
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,830
Y-You mean...

165
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,370
What a kindhearted mutt.
He's asking you to kill him with that?

166
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,670
S-So then, he intentionally led us here?

167
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,590
I get it.
He's a war dog that wants to die.

168
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,430
What do you say we end his misery?

169
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,100
If he's a war dog, Mr. Bernadotte,
then you've got no room to talk.

170
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,100
Without a doubt.

171
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,020
Also, please don't go smoking
inside of me.

172
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,560
Here he comes!

173
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,320
Don't run. Take him head-on.

174
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,490
Right!

175
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,710
Go! Conquer him! Let him have it!

176
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,040
When he attacks,
he is also flesh and blood.

177
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,590
Not yet!

178
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,640
Not yet!

179
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,780
He's predicting our moves!

180
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,280
It doesn't matter.

181
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,740
Mm-hmm. Let's go!

182
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,700
Yeah! Get him!

183
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,590
I've got you this time for sure!

184
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:30,560
Wolfman, sir, this is payback from
a certain someone 50 years ago.

185
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,110
Take it.

186
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,370
That's what you get for messing
with another man's woman.

187
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,120
Your collar has been sent flying.

188
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,580
Farewell, war dog!

189
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
It's almost like...

190
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,610
It's almost like a child
having an enjoyable dream.

191
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,620
That's right. I'm sure this evening

192
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,040
has been a whole night's
dream come true for them.

193
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,920
Mr. Bernadotte...

194
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,880
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,250
Let's go and finish this.

196
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,840
All dreams must come to an end.

197
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,430
Go!

198
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,700
Major!

199
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,500
Hey!

200
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,550
I'm so glad to finally be
able to see you in person.

201
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,810
Unfortunately, that gun won't be enough.

202
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,480
Call it a commander's discretion.

203
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,740
I thought you might be
late for this little feature,

204
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,990
but luckily, you're in time.

205
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,750
This is to be a one-night show.

206
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,250
As long as I'm going to see it,

207
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,590
I should be with a pretty lady,
in the most exorbitant seats.

208
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,050
Stop screwing around!

209
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,600
Enjoy this.

210
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,940
This is the production of the century.

211
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:26,280
Our story has not been told since 1898.

212
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,160
That's because Nosferatu Arucard...

213
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,580
is about to be eliminated.

214
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,460
What?!

215
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,880
There's all-you-can-eat,
and then there's <i>this</i>!

216
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,600
Now! Shall we do this, Walter?

217
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,430
Not yet... My battle is not over yet...

218
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,190
It's not over yet! Major, stop this!

219
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,030
Make it stop, Major!

220
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,660
No, it's over now. It's too late.

221
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,910
It's too late, for everything.

222
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,410
It's too late, you fool!

223
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,220
It's now too late for everything.

224
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,220
You are no longer able to triumph.

225
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,730
The chance is now virtually forever lost.

226
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,480
I have given you a golden opportunity.

227
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,310
Two chances of a lifetime...

228
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,690
to physically bring down Arucard.

229
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,070
The only two golden opportunities
there have been since 1898.

230
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,450
An armed Schutzstaffel,
consisting of 1000 vampire troops...

231
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,750
The 3000 of the Ninth
Airborne Mobile Crusade...

232
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,800
Not to mention Iscariot...

233
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,800
Not to mention the werewolf...

234
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,340
Not to mention Anderson...

235
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,850
Then there's
the half of your life up to now.

236
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,310
The moment created
from all of that sacrifice

237
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,440
is the only moment when
it is possible to kill Arucard.

238
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,240
Nonetheless, your wires have not
reached in that far, have they?

239
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,450
Exactly how many lives
does Arucard have now?

240
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,450
One million? Two million?

241
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,790
You can no longer beat him.

242
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,420
Your life has now been in vain.

243
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,840
Don't go spacing out, kid.
Pull it together.

244
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,720
Only a few
tens of thousands of tries to go.

245
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,940
If Anderson was unable to beat me,
then there's no way that you,

246
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,690
a pale little brat, could spend 50,

247
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,980
or even 500 years agonizing it out,

248
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,860
and somehow be able to beat me.

249
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,120
You are beaten, Arucard.

250
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,880
I have won.

251
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,050
You are beaten, Arucard!

252
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,020
Beaten? Who, exactly? Me?

253
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,070
Lose? Me, lose, you say?

254
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,610
Me, defeated by you people,
Professor Hellsing?

255
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:43,450
I am never beaten. There is
no way I can be beaten. Ever.

256
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,040
<i>What?</i>

257
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,840
<i>What am I looking at?</i>

258
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:58,140
<i>What... is this view? What is this sight?</i>

259
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,940
<i>Ah, that's it...</i>

260
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,150
<i>That's it...</i>

261
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,910
<i>That's right...</i>

262
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,720
<i>The light of the sun</i>
<i>was like this then, too...</i>

263
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,100
<i>The view when I died is always like this.</i>

264
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,400
<i>And I think, again and again,</i>

265
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,280
<i>who knew the light of the sun</i>
<i>was as beautiful as this?</i>

266
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,920
"Out, out, brief candle!

267
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,850
Life's but a walking shadow..."

268
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,730
What?!

269
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,400
What is happening?!

270
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,400
What did you do?!

271
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,950
I've done it all.

272
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,620
He absorbed
Warrant Officer SchrÃ¶dinger's life.

273
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,790
That is nothing other than assimilating

274
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,920
SchrÃ¶dinger's
"life essence" into his own.

275
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,220
He is a self-observing SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat,
possessed of his own will.

276
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,100
His very existence is that of

277
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,020
an equivocal Cheshire Cat,
bounding about within a certain world.

278
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:17,820
As long as he is aware of himself,
he is everywhere, and he is nowhere.

279
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,740
However, now,

280
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,870
he has been dissolved into millions
of other consciousnesses and lives.

281
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,660
He can no longer
recognize himself as himself.

282
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,670
So then what happens?

283
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,840
He is now nowhere. He is
neither alive, nor is he dead.

284
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,810
Right now, Arucard...

285
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,310
...is just a lump of imaginary numbers.

286
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,100
Arucard!

287
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,360
Do not close your eyes!

288
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,240
Open your eyes!

289
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,620
Arucard!

290
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,000
I order you... Arucard!

291
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,930
Do not disappear!

292
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,610
No... This is farewell, Integra.

293
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,610
Arucard!

294
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,450
I gave him all that I had...

295
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,630
...but all that he was is now lost.

296
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,880
I have lived my life for this day.

297
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,060
I have lived entirely for this moment.

298
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,560
In my war, which has been a string
of losses, this is my first win.

299
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,820
You... You...!

300
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,820
Yes, it's nice, isn't it? So this is...

301
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,660
victory.

302
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,520
So it will be you two...

303
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,610
that will kill me.

304
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,850
He's dead! He's dead!
He's gone! He's gone...

305
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,200
Damn it!

306
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,750
Is this what I was hoping for? Is this it?

307
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,330
Is this it?!

308
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,150
Die! Die, die, die!

309
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,360
You've done at least enough
to earn this! I'll kill you!

310
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,160
Yes... this is my fate.

311
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,700
A fitting fate for a traitor.

312
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,250
I will die... with no further ado...

313
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:37,510
Vampire my ass! Reaper my ass!
I will kill you like it's nothing!

314
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,740
Shoot me again... Shoot me...

315
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,660
Yeah! Yeah! I'll plug you good!

316
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,120
Die! Die!

317
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,760
Yeah! I'll shoot you! I'll shoot
you up! I'll shoot you, all right!

318
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,930
You are free to shoot me.

319
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,230
However...

320
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,310
...you are not the one who will kill me.

321
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,490
Wait! Hold on!

322
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,240
Wait! Wait!

323
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,660
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

324
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,750
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

325
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,890
I have... to go...

326
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,160
Well, pleased to meet you, frÃ¤ulein.

327
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,460
I am merely stating the obvious.

328
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,040
Yes, it will be you two.

329
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,840
It will not be Arucard that defeats me.

330
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,930
It will be me that defeats Arucard.

331
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,100
My archenemy is Arucard,

332
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,820
and right now, your archenemy is me!

333
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,490
Now, bring it on! Here is your enemy!

334
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,080
He is right here!

335
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,710
You are over there...

336
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,290
and I am here!

337
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,630
Here I am.

338
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,050
Seras, shoot him.

339
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,220
Shoot him! Shoot him!

340
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,770
Search and destroy!

341
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,940
Search and destroy!

342
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,120
Doc made it too strong.

343
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,770
The <i>Acht-acht</i>!
That's fantastic! I love it!

344
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,690
It's over, Major!

345
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,980
So... it would seem.

346
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,410
But hey... not just yet.

347
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,660
Is that... Is that what you are, Major?!

348
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,290
That's right.

349
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,540
This is me.

350
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,670
A machine!

351
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,680
Do not speak... in such... rude terms...

352
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,600
young lady.

353
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,980
I am decidedly human.

354
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,770
Monster...

355
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,150
You are a freak.

356
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,910
No, I am not. I am human.

357
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:57,000
There is one thing that
makes a human a human...

358
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,670
and that is their will.

359
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,800
I am not a pitiful monster like Arucard,

360
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,050
who must continuously
take into himself others,

361
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,640
using the currency of blood,
to go on living.

362
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,480
Do not lump me in with that weakling.

363
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,360
As long as I have my will,

364
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:29,740
then even if all that I am is a brain,

365
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,240
floating in a glass jar
of culture medium...

366
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,790
Even if all that I am...

367
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,460
are memory circuits in a giant computer...

368
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,000
then I am human.

369
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,510
A living creature with the soul...

370
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,010
mind, and will of a human.

371
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,690
And even if he may smile in
the appearance of a young girl,

372
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:06,940
or kneel down in the form of
a battle-hardened warrior,

373
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,240
full of sentimentality, he is a monster.

374
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,870
Which is precisely why I hate him
from the bottom of my heart.

375
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,250
I reject the vampire Arucard!

376
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,420
He is a monster that looks like a human,

377
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,260
and I am a human
that looks like a monster.

378
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,760
I am me.

379
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:46,400
You and I are...
You are not the same as me.

380
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,570
In all of the warring in this world,
that has been everything.

381
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,070
Ever since mankind
was born into this world.

382
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,410
You, too, believe yourself
to be different than I am.

383
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,880
Our declaration of hostilities
was completed long ago.

384
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,170
Now, let's wage war.

385
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,710
That's the first time I hit anyone.

386
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,200
Ah... this is good...

387
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,750
A good war... This was a good war...

388
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,010
Die. You must die.

389
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,440
Was it a good war, Major?

390
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,200
This is not even a war.

391
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,040
After being nearly dead for
60 years, you have just expired.

392
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,000
You must die. It is absolute retribution.

393
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,170
Whatever you may profess humankind to be,

394
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,640
you are no longer the least bit human.

395
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,520
You are simply a genuine monster.

396
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,900
And at any time, it is only a human
that can defeat a monster.

397
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,070
Monsters are defeated by humans.

398
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,820
That is because only humans
have "defeating" as their goal.

399
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,580
Not for the joys of fighting.
Because it is our duty to carry out.

400
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,000
You are not human.

401
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,550
That is why he is coming back!

402
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,640
Is it over?

403
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,230
No, it's not. Not at all.

404
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,280
Technology advances thanks to science.

405
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,070
My research makes great strides!
No! No! My research <i>made</i> great strides!

406
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,530
What do I do? What do I do?

407
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,950
What? What?

408
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,210
Not yet... I can't reach it yet...

409
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,840
What am I doing wrong? What am I missing?

410
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,180
That's it! Someday...! Someday...!

411
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,640
The whole world... Every last
person will have their share!

412
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,230
This miraculous science!
These scientific miracles!

413
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,610
Where do you think you're
going, Grand Professor?

414
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,740
No, no, Doc. You must
not be such a poor loser.

415
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,240
W-Walter!

416
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,370
The remnants of the remnants of
the Nazis? It's not even laughable.

417
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,290
Why, you... misbegotten scum!

418
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,420
You're quite the esteemed
misbegotten scum yourself, Doc.

419
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:05,260
You, and all of the things
you make, including me.

420
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,640
The farce is over.
The performers must now disappear.

421
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,020
Isn't that right, Grand Professor?

422
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,770
Farce? Farce, you say?
I don't want to hear it from you!

423
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,810
How dare you, you defective merchandise!

424
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,230
It's a one-night, one-act farce.

425
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,610
Both this war, and this world.

426
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:33,620
I just... I just wanted to play the
best role I could amidst all this.

427
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:51,680
What a cruel end.
Arucard was right. I'm a disgrace.

428
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,310
Defective goods like you...
A failed creation such as you...

429
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,940
dares laugh at us?!

430
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,940
I will not have the likes of you
calling my research a farce!

431
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,450
I will not have you laughing
at the Major's battalion!

432
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,950
Not by you!
Not by any "thing" such as you!

433
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,040
My theories have made leaps forward!
My research has made leaps forward!

434
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,410
The science has been put into practice,
and keenly moves forward!

435
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,460
Someday, I will overtake this!
Someday, I will surpass Arucard!

436
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,630
You shouldn't be so absurd.
You, and I, and everyone else dies.

437
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,470
All defective goods die.

438
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,430
Shut your mouth!

439
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,480
Mina Harker.

440
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,490
Yes, indeed. This was your teaching aid.

441
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,700
The one being from whom Arucard...
Dracula drank blood, and was drunk.

442
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,870
"The beginning of everything."

443
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,920
It was said that Dracula was defeated by
Hellsing, and returned to being a person.

444
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,300
However, Arucard did not die!

445
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,220
Arucard is still inside of her.

446
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,060
No matter what becomes of her,
he exists deep inside her.

447
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,020
It's the vampire blood, which neither...

448
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,900
consecrated host, nor holy water,
nor crucifixes have any effect on.

449
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,320
That's why you started from there.

450
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,860
An imitation Arucard.

451
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,910
To that end you exhumed her,

452
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,500
and stripped her already skeletal
body even further to the bone.

453
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,550
But ultimately, all you did
was create knock-off copies.

454
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,300
If that isn't a farcical comedy,
then what exactly is it?

455
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,520
And poor Mina...

456
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,940
Strike everything, and take our leave

457
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,310
both you, and me.

458
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,910
At pinball!

459
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,250
Ah... damn...

460
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,840
I sure did want to beat that guy.

461
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,390
Farewell, Madam.

462
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,740
Walter!

463
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,620
Walter has just passed on.

464
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Right.

465
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,600
Let's go back. Let's go back, Seras.

466
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,470
Back to our home.

467
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,560
Fly!

468
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,120
The simultaneous
US-British bio-terror attack,

469
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,920
also known as the "Airship
Incident," 17th Report.

470
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:21,470
The casualty count for the US, including
all cabinet officials, stands at 64,300.

471
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,890
For Britain, 3,718,917.

472
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,850
Don't you have
your fencing training today?

473
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Are you sure you won't attend?

474
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,730
Yes. I'm going to stay here for
a short while longer, then go.

475
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,610
If the events of 30 years ago
were to happen again,

476
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,740
since it will be my task to bring them
to a resolution without taking up arms.

477
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:54,040
Hmph... Islands, when you make that face,

478
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,380
you look just like your great-grandfather.

479
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,060
Hold it! That's the match!

480
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,560
Lady Integra wins!

481
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,910
Well done, well done. Your skills
have not diminished one bit.

482
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,410
Section XIII, I thought I asked you
to wait in the reception room.

483
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:34,540
Yes, well, simply waiting
around is not in my nature.

484
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,170
And no matter how long I waited,
no one ever brought me any tea.

485
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,300
I grew a little bit weary of it.

486
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,840
I can't just have you wandering around.
You will go back there.

487
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,680
Yes, yes, all right, I shall return.

488
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,070
Chief Makube, the security inside
the manor is as lax as ever.

489
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,410
We could beat them now.

490
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,240
Young fool. You must be blind.

491
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,160
Huh?

492
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,290
Yow!

493
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,130
That hurts, you know! What the hell!

494
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,960
What was that?

495
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,880
One of Seras Victoria's shadows.

496
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,890
It envelops the whole region
of the hall, including ourselves.

497
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:35,390
But, in exchange for myself and the chief,
we could take out half the Round Table.

498
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:41,820
No, not yet! We have lost too much.

499
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,900
After the Ninth Crusade,
the Vatican has lost too much power.

500
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,160
Look, just wait.

501
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:56,290
We have waited for 500 years.
Another century or two is nothing.

502
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,750
The next crusade will go more smoothly.

503
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,800
That's all for today. You are dismissed.

504
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,890
Sir Penwood, good work.

505
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,510
Oh, er, yes, ma'am.

506
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,850
You have a fine form. It's getting better.

507
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,310
No, I still have much to learn.
Thank you very much.

508
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:26,030
Um, did grandpop... I mean,
my grandfather, also learn fencing?

509
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,410
Your grandfather...

510
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,870
sliced this way and that through
the approaching Nazi forces,

511
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,960
and was truly peerless in all of Britain.

512
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,500
He cut every approaching enemy
clean in half,

513
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,960
until ultimately,
he strapped bombs all over himself,

514
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,590
and blew himself up, taking
an enemy airship with him.

515
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,680
He was the guardian deity of Britain.

516
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,890
My left eye was lost as
a result of his lethal blades.

517
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,890
-That's not true, is it?
-It's the truth!

518
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,270
It's truly the truth!

519
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,940
It's true!

520
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:05,020
It's true, so I would ask you for
the funds for a new helicopter.

521
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,440
Not again!

522
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,780
If you please.

523
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,700
Yes, ma'am...

524
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,580
If you please!

525
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,710
How cruel!

526
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,420
That was rough. Both to
him and his whole family.

527
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,300
You're almost acting like
you're the Mafia, aren't you?

528
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,630
It's all right. I have to make them work.

529
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,930
Starting now, I have to
make them work extra hard.

530
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,220
Once I die, Hellsing will be through.

531
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:41,270
Then, those other gentlemen
will have to bear the load.

532
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,270
From then on, they will bear
the load under a state-led ministry.

533
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,980
The way it should be.

534
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,190
This is not the time for one
family to lead the organization.

535
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,530
Besides, I'm getting a bit tired.

536
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,160
Eh? You don't look that way to me.

537
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,160
When I looked in the mirror this
morning, I spotted a new wrinkle!

538
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,040
And, when I saw the wrinkle, I...

539
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,920
remembered Walter.

540
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,550
Fight on, Madam!

541
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,010
What is this?

542
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,600
Don't get so depressed!
Don't you get depressed!

543
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,220
Are you still down?
Can you not get over him?

544
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:23,350
Please don't talk about dying.
If you like, I could drink your blood.

545
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,770
See this? I'm imitating the master--

546
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,320
That was nothing to kick me over, was it?!

547
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,240
Don't even joke about that, dummy!
You haven't changed in decades!

548
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,910
And what is
Arucard up to, anyway, the idiot?!

549
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,740
He hasn't come back once, has he?!

550
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,370
You said he was coming back, didn't you?!

551
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:51,380
He will come back. I can tell.
He has sucked my blood, after all.

552
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,470
Sure, he's coming back, you say,
but it's been 30 years. 30 years!

553
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,330
You're a vampire,
so it may be fine for you.

554
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,960
I never get more wrinkles, so yeah.

555
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,710
You are a bad girl!

556
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,590
Is that what you say?
Is that how you talk to me?!

557
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,260
I-I'm sorry! Forgive me, forgive me!

558
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,520
What is it, Master?!

559
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:29,660
That was a harsh welcome.
And as noisy as ever.

560
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,160
Master!

561
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:38,050
Your return is late, Arucard.
What have you been doing?

562
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,970
I have been killing off...

563
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:47,010
the lives that are inside of me.

564
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,690
Three million, four hundred twenty-four
thousand, eight hundred and sixty-seven...

565
01:00:54,350 --> 01:01:00,400
I've been killing off all but one of them.

566
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,700
I am now right here.

567
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,370
I am now nowhere, and I can
be everywhere.

568
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,670
Hence, I am here.

569
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,210
You're late. You're worse than late.

570
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,010
You're late, Arucard.

571
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:27,050
Hmph, I'm sorry.

572
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:32,850
Were you trying to drink my blood?

573
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,350
Yes... I was.

574
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:41,650
I haven't eaten anything in
30 years, and I'm hungry.

575
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,080
I am an old woman now.

576
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,330
I...

577
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,800
That is all right.

578
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:03,470
Hmph...

579
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,870
Welcome back, Count.

580
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,200
I have returned, Countess.

581
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,550
