1
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,060
<i>Aerial Cruiser 3, the </i>Arthur Seys-Inquart<i>,</i>
<i>has been downed!</i>

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,940
<i>We've lost signal!</i>

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,860
<i>Blister is expanding! Cannot sustain lift!</i>

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,720
Cruiser 2,
the <i>Alfred Rosenberg</i>, is in flames!

5
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,590
We cannot contact the landing party!

6
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,680
Platoon 7's blips have been wiped out,
and we've lost contact!

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,060
Have they been wiped out?

8
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,310
Wiped out?!

9
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,730
What is going on down there?!

10
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,190
Major!

11
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,110
Major, sir!

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
Your orders? Major?

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,120
What a racket. Be quiet.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,410
Keep it down and enjoy
the act's climax, at least.

15
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,460
You're all sobbing
over the loss of your units

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,340
like you're young girls going
through your first time.

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,170
Captain...

18
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,220
Sir!

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,890
Distribute firearms and ammunition
to surviving crewmen on all ships.

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,470
Issue hand grenades to
those who cannot stand.

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,150
But... But sir, there aren't enough guns
or ammunition for all of them anymore.

22
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,860
Then give them pipes,
or munitions, or anything else.

23
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,990
Arm the troops and assemble them.

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,160
Once that is complete,
we will all charge together.

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,540
It will be fun. Very fun.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,830
We'll charge in headlong as
we sing the "Horst-Wessel-Lied."

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
What fun!

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,380
<i>Zum letzten Mal</i>

29
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,550
<i>Wird nun Appell geblasen!</i>

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,430
<i>Zum Kampfe steh'n</i>

31
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,390
<i>Wir alle schon bereit!</i>

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,560
What's the matter? Why aren't you singing?

33
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,570
I've had enough of this!

34
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,780
We are not the SS! We're the German Navy!

35
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,950
We are here with you
to face the British forces!

36
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,700
But I have had enough!

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,250
This is no longer a battle!

38
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,130
I cannot send my men to die any longer!

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,250
You've come this far,

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,720
and still you do not realize
the true nature of our conflict?

41
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,140
Well, it does not matter.
Insubordination is the essence of war.

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,700
It's no use, Doc. I can't hit him.

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,660
Your sharpshooting is as dull as ever.

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,080
How did you manage to
get into the <i>Schutzstaffel</i>?

45
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,790
Major!

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,250
Mm-hmm, shoot him.

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,500
He is a defeatist.

48
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,260
Arm the remaining crewmen, Lieutenant.

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,600
I leave anyone who will not
follow orders to your discretion.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,270
Instruct them in the
fundamentals of our conflict.

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,310
He who comes to strike down another

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,980
must be struck down by another.

53
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,610
Besides, the mission has all gone
according to plan, hasn't it?

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,040
This war has never once escaped

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,000
the tiny grasp of the palm of my hand.

56
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,550
<i>Master...</i>

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,590
<i>Who...</i>

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,430
<i>Who... is that...?</i>

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,690
<i>Ah... that... is me...</i>

60
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,470
<i>God, I will in no way</i>
<i>beg for mercy from you.</i>

61
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,230
<i>Fight!</i>

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,690
<i>All of you, fight for the sake of God!</i>

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,240
<i>God will not help those who beg for help.</i>

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,080
<i>He will not save those who beg for mercy.</i>

65
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,500
<i>Those are not prayers,</i>
<i>but mere petitions to God.</i>

66
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>You may die.</i>

67
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,460
<i>Fighting is prayer itself.</i>

68
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,260
<i>At the end of such an astonishing</i>
<i>prayer, God will descend.</i>

69
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,890
<i>Jerusalem will descend!</i>

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,180
<i>Tattered, fractured, rent, and scattered,</i>

71
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,890
<i>prayer after prayer after prayer,</i>

72
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,980
<i>God will descend before our</i>
<i>miserable... our wretched selves,</i>

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,190
<i>from out of Heaven!</i>

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,740
<i>So then...</i>

75
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,240
So then, did they descend?
Either God, or Jerusalem?

76
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,590
<i>What's the matter? Answer me, King.</i>

77
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,550
<i>The king has gone mad.</i>

78
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,680
<i>They all died. They all died.</i>

79
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,310
<i>For you, for those who believed you,</i>

80
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,610
<i>for your paradise, for your god,</i>

81
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,490
<i>for your prayers, they all died.</i>

82
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,200
<i>You killed foe, you killed friend,</i>

83
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,500
<i>the people you were to protect,</i>
<i>the country you were to govern,</i>

84
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,210
<i>man and woman, elder and child,</i>

85
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,250
<i>until even yourself...</i>

86
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,470
<i>Incorrigible. You are an absolutely</i>
<i>incorrigible monster, Count.</i>

87
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,120
<i>If, nevertheless, you will</i>
<i>trek through capitulation...</i>

88
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,160
<i>Master...!</i>

89
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,540
<i>A voice... calling to me...</i>

90
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,250
<i>Master!</i>

91
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,670
<i>Who is it that calls me?</i>

92
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,680
<i>Master!</i>

93
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,180
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

94
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,400
Master!

95
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,480
Master!

96
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,260
<i>It burns.</i>

97
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,680
<i>His world... burns up.</i>

98
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,280
Master! Master!

99
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,740
Keep it down, policewoman.

100
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,620
Your voice carries out as loud as ever.

101
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,330
Almost like that of a resounding song.

102
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,420
Master!

103
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,090
Anderson...

104
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,430
I would not have minded
being defeated by you...

105
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,180
...had it been that day...

106
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,560
Had it been that wasteland at sunset,

107
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,190
on that day, 523 years ago...

108
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,650
I would have given you my heart.

109
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,570
But I cannot do that any longer.

110
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,290
You cannot defeat me!

111
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,830
At any time, it is only a human
that can defeat a monster.

112
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,710
It must be... a human!

113
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
<i>Integra...</i>

114
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,190
<i>There are many</i>
<i>undead monsters in the world.</i>

115
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,490
<i>Looking at them, I had a thought.</i>

116
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,370
<i>Do they really wish to be undead?</i>

117
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,960
<i>Most of them</i>
<i>desire conflict... A gory battle.</i>

118
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,630
<i>As it is, this is nigh unto sobbing for,</i>
<i>or craving, what they want.</i>

119
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,220
<i>This is a cry out of desire for death.</i>

120
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,390
<i>Nosferatu, the No Life King.</i>

121
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,100
<i>His castle, his land, his subjects,</i>

122
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,900
<i>the souls of his loved ones,</i>
<i>as well as his own soul...</i>

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,980
<i>everything and anything he ever had</i>
<i>vanished,</i>

124
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,490
<i>and he became a specter, merely walking</i>
<i>from one conflict toward the next.</i>

125
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,280
<i>But as for me, Integra...</i>

126
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>That terrifying,</i>
<i>immortal monster appears to me</i>

127
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,750
<i>as a terribly wretched, wretched child,</i>
<i>broken down and crying weakly.</i>

128
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,720
You are me!

129
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,150
You are me! I was also the way you are!

130
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,490
I was also the way you are!

131
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,170
Do not weep, fiend.

132
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,420
Were you chased by a child?

133
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,600
Do not weep, fiend.

134
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,140
You became a fiend because
you didn't want to cry, right?

135
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,650
It is because a man cries
until his tears dry up

136
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,780
that they become fiends, and
are reduced to being monsters,

137
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,150
until that's all they are.

138
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,450
So then, laugh.

139
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,660
Laugh arrogantly
and insolently. Like you always do.

140
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,170
I pass on. You keep living on.

141
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,880
How much longer must your
miserable self keep living?

142
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,840
Until the greatness of my past

143
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,680
is demolished
by the greatness of my future.

144
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,480
But hey, I will see you soon,
my archenemy,

145
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,690
someday, in Limbo.

146
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,410
I hear voices.

147
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,710
The voices of children...

148
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,180
I hear their voices at play...

149
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,230
The children... I must go...

150
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,980
They're all waiting... Maxwell...

151
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,780
You mustn't cry... everyone...

152
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,870
Say your prayers... before bedtime...

153
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,420
Amen...

154
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,840
Amen.

155
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,270
Amen.

156
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,730
W-Walter! Is that you, Walter?!

157
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,690
This is trash.

158
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,810
When people die, they become trash.

159
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,820
And trash has no need to be mourned.

160
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,070
Isn't that right, Integra?

161
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,700
Walter...

162
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,500
Walter, what have they done to you?

163
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,420
What have they done?

164
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,090
They captured me, made me
a vampire, brainwashed me,

165
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,510
and sadly enough, forced me to
fight against my former master.

166
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,600
If that were my answer,
would it satisfy you, Seras?

167
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,400
I stand here without having
been given orders by anyone.

168
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,650
I stand here as myself.

169
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,110
I stand here as Walter C. Dollneaz.

170
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,490
I am planning to cut you up here,
at daybreak, with full intent to kill.

171
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,450
Walter...

172
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,160
Why, Walter?!

173
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,170
Do not call me by name!

174
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,960
N-No, don't!

175
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,010
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

176
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,260
Who cares about
your master-servant business!

177
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,390
Makes no difference to me!

178
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,970
Spatial constriction?!

179
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,980
Shimabara Sword Style, Shoki!

180
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,980
<i>I got you!</i>

181
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,400
<i>You got nothing. I got you.</i>

182
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,410
<i>With the cry and strike that it may be so,</i>

183
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,210
<i>I slip my way out of this world...</i>

184
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,880
Yumie!

185
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,350
No one can stand in my way.

186
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,940
I will allow no one
to interfere with my revolt.

187
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,580
Sir Islands...

188
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,080
Has Her Majesty
been secured in the Casemate?

189
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,630
Yes. The nuclear sub <i>Nereid</i>
is headed this way.

190
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,590
If the damage spreads any further,
we will have her flee to Canada.

191
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,220
What is the status in London?

192
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,310
It is the height of chaos,
the same as before.

193
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,350
Penwood's last message was
the last official communication.

194
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,770
Penwood, eh?

195
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,360
Yes. Penwood.

196
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,610
That fool. That was
uncharacteristically heroic of him.

197
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,870
Everyone made light of him,
saying he was a fool,

198
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,370
but who knew how great
a fool he actually was?

199
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,250
They'll pay. How dare they
take away our great friend!

200
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,920
How dare they take away our great ally!

201
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,170
Yeah, they'll pay.
Those Nazi lowlifes! Those maggots!

202
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,930
We have to make sure
we take vengeance for him.

203
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,720
We can clear the vampires out of
our installations across the land

204
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,350
with about a half-days' worth of time.

205
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,980
All thanks to the strike teams
you positioned ahead of time.

206
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,650
However, the problem is London.

207
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,860
It's all we can do right now
just to erect the blockades.

208
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,200
Her Majesty and the powers that be

209
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,120
are considering a counterstrike
that includes the final solution.

210
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,080
Nukes?

211
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,170
That's right.

212
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:38,130
A phase that renounces London, involving
three Trident SLBMs from the <i>Nereid</i>.

213
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,220
However, that is a last strategy.

214
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,800
A nuclear strike on our own
people would be infamous.

215
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,560
Besides, Her Majesty has faith.

216
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,890
London is still in the heat of battle.

217
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,730
There are still those who are fighting.

218
00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,360
Yes, fighting indeed.
Including that daughter of Arthur's.

219
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,000
Islands, when the younger members
made accusations toward Penwood

220
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,370
concerning the traitors who
were at the Round Table,

221
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,040
you categorically
rejected them, didn't you?

222
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,000
That's right.

223
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,130
He was incompetent,
but he was a man among men.

224
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,300
If it came to treason, he would
have surely taken his own life.

225
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,640
Then who was it? You and I are the
only ones from the Round Table left.

226
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,150
Was it you? Or was it me?

227
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,900
Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,070
If I were to turn traitor, I would put it
in writing and circulate it to all of you.

229
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,530
I do have misgivings
about one thing, though.

230
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,540
When Arthur... When Integra's
father died, I cautioned them.

231
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,960
His brother, Richard, was a dangerous man.

232
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,090
He would definitely try to kill Integra,

233
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,470
and claim the family name for his own.

234
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,300
"Don't take your eyes off of Richard,

235
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,550
and don't take
your eyes off of Integra, either."

236
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,930
I warned the butler,

237
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,850
the Hellsing Family butler,
Walter C. Dollneaz.

238
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,440
But then, the night of the attack,
where was he?

239
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,110
What was he doing?

240
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,280
Arthur realized how dangerous Arucard was,

241
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,080
and locked him in the basement.

242
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,790
However, that evening,
when Richard was pursuing Integra,

243
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,590
she released him,
and she became his master.

244
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,380
What if all of these events had
been leading toward that end?

245
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,810
What if he was acting toward
that goal from the beginning?

246
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,980
And if so, how long has he been
against us? 10 years? 20 years?

247
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:04,240
Or perhaps, since September
of 1944, in Warsaw?

248
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,920
<i>He shot through my cheeks!</i>
<i>Why, when he could have killed me?</i>

249
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
<i>"Don't interfere." Is that it?</i>

250
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,850
<i>He took pity on me! Pity! Pity!</i>

251
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,520
<i>Does he not consider me</i>
<i>to be a fighting force?</i>

252
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,900
<i>Am I a defeated soldier?</i>

253
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,950
<i>Does he not even regard me as an enemy?!</i>

254
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,910
Heinkel!

255
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,280
Are you all right, Heinkel?

256
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,410
I'm fine! Never mind me, see to Yumie!

257
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,750
It's hopeless.

258
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,330
Yumie has had it.

259
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,750
Yumie... Yumie...!

260
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,890
Damn it! Damn it,
damn it, damn it, damn it!

261
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,100
That bastard!
That bastard! That filthy butler!

262
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,520
Give me that!

263
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,770
The gun! Give me your gun!

264
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,110
You can't go injured like that, Heinkel!

265
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,530
I don't care! I don't care anymore!

266
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll kill him! If nothing else,
I'll kill that filthy butler bastard!

267
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,830
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

268
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,970
Get up! Get up
and fight, Hellsing! Arucard!

269
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,940
Hey there, Reaper!

270
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,280
You once said Englishmen looked
forward to growing old, didn't you?

271
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
You said that you declined any glory

272
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,240
that wasn't easily won, didn't you?

273
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,870
In your aged form, you were billions,

274
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,210
even trillions of times more attractive.

275
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,760
What an ugly form that is.

276
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,390
Have you become a reaper,
both body and soul?

277
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,680
That's right.

278
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,220
This world is but a single night's dream
within a much larger battleground.

279
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,600
At the moment of daybreak,
I have at last become its Reaper!

280
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,650
Get up and fight, Arucard!

281
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,030
You and I are both
just dogs now. Running dogs.

282
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,950
Dogs which do not bark for themselves.

283
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,680
Orders! Give me your orders, my lord!

284
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,100
I can kill.
Without the slightest hesitation,

285
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,180
and without the least regret,
I can strike someone dead.

286
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,980
That is because I am a monster.

287
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,440
And you are... Integra.

288
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:36,030
I will stand with guns readied.
I will take aim with them.

289
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,320
I will load ammo in their magazines,
pull back their slides,

290
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,750
and I will release
their safeties. However,

291
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,210
any killing will be done at your will.

292
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:54,010
Now, what will it be?
Your orders, Director of Hellsing,

293
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,680
Integral Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing?!

294
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,640
Speak! Speak! Speak! Tell him, frÃ¤ulein!

295
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,650
Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak!

296
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,650
Speak up! Speak up!

297
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,660
Speak! Say it!

298
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,460
Start talking! Tell him, my lady!

299
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,970
Search and destroy!

300
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,270
Search and destroy! My servant,
I have given you an order!

301
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,480
Nothing has changed!

302
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,980
Lay waste to all forces that oppose us!

303
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,110
Keep pressing forward and smash
through any obstacle in your way!

304
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,490
No matter who that may be!
No matter what that may be!

305
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,870
No matter... who...

306
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,330
...that may be...

307
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,510
Ah, she said it! She finally said it!
She told him! She told him!

308
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,140
Yes, my Master.

309
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:34,150
Outstanding! You truly were
a master worthy of my service.

310
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,320
I am no longer going to ask
"Why?" or "What happened?"

311
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,610
You have now become my enemy.

312
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,620
You have become an enemy of Hellsing.

313
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,540
You have become an enemy of Britain!
That's what you've done!

314
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,460
You must be defeated!
You must be destroyed!

315
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,510
<i>Well said, Integral Fairbrook</i>
<i>Wingates Hellsing!</i>

316
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,430
<i>I was wrong to call you an amateur.</i>

317
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,140
<i>I won't do it again.</i>

318
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,180
You have now at last become my enemy.

319
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,770
You have become a powerful
force worth beating,

320
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,820
and my great and wonderful archenemy.

321
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,670
<i>Destiny has shuffled the cards.</i>

322
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,560
Come to me! I call!

323
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,320
<i>Das Dritte Reich</i>.
<i>Seien Sie herzlich willkommen</i>.

324
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:08,830
Go on. Go ahead. Go and kill them.
Go, conquer, and put an end to this.

325
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Yes. Off I go to conquer.

326
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,210
M-Master...

327
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,590
Go on, Seras. Our master needs a retinue.

328
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,970
Go and bring an end
to the man's long dream.

329
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,720
It has been 55 years.
Morning has now come.

330
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,390
I will bring an end to my
long night with this man.

331
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,350
Walter...

332
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,070
Um, this may be strange for me to say,

333
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:47,360
but... um... thanks for all you've
done up to now. Take care.

334
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,620
You, too.

335
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,130
Hurry!

336
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,420
Right!

337
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,680
Walter, farewell!

338
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,430
Farewell. Farewell, and die.

339
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,110
Welcome, madam.

340
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,620
I'm holding all jokers.

341
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,950
I'm putting an end to all of this. I call.

342
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,420
Fine women, aren't they?

343
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,930
You are now mine. You are my...

344
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,850
You are the beloved servant of
my dear master, and myself, alone.

345
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,440
No longer your own.

346
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,380
Are you angry, Reaper?
Get angry! Get angry!

347
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,000
This fools' dance
I've had with you ends today!

348
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,460
Chew on this!

349
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,580
Like you said, once upon a time...

350
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,460
there are no such things
as immortal freaks.

351
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,210
Your words are true!
As of now, they don't exist!

352
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,050
I will kill you until you perish.

353
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,940
That won't work!

354
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,530
Black Dog, Baskerville...

355
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,260
Stay your bark, mongrel!

356
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,340
So, what is next? What will you do now?

357
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,720
Arucard the Vampire,
you're just a simple vampire!

358
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,100
Who is it that made that gun?
Have you forgotten?

359
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,400
That was for
bringing down Anderson, wasn't it?

360
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,610
And I am not Anderson.

361
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,000
-Hmm?
-What's this?

362
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,250
Oh, it's him!

363
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,260
Let's see, who is that again...?
Oh, it's that guy! With the brother!

364
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,760
That is Luke.
Warrant Officer Luke Valentine.

365
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,010
It looks as though he was swallowed
by the dog, and kept there.

366
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,100
With the dog dead, its control over him
changed, and he manifested himself.

367
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,020
W-What is this?!

368
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,020
What happened? What is happening?!

369
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,040
Imagine, you showing up here,
Luke Valentine...

370
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,670
If you fancy yourself a minor Nazi,
then I will let you fight!

371
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,050
<i>My body... won't hold out... Already...?</i>

372
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,140
<i>No, we agreed.</i>
<i>We agreed, and I struck back.</i>

373
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,430
<i>We agreed, and this is what became of me!</i>

374
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,950
It's you!

375
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,420
You must be hard to stomach.

376
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,630
A half-digested failure at
becoming even excrement.

377
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,940
Quite the amusing marionette
you've acquired, Walter!

378
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,740
No! No, not yet! I can't die yet! Not yet!

379
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,120
I still haven't defeated Arucard!

380
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,670
Sure enough. He didn't
have any time left, anyway.

381
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,210
It was quite
a reckless procedure to undergo.

382
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,380
Nay!

383
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,930
Everything that we could
have given to him, we gave.

384
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,600
Everything that we could have
taken from him, we took.

385
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,560
His life, his master,
his loyalty, his devotion...

386
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,110
He staked them all,
and it still wasn't enough!

387
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,400
And so, he even borrowed money
to stake from scoundrels like us.

388
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,870
Even if, by doing so,
the interest is so exorbitant

389
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,990
that with the morning's light,
and the cock's crow, he is ruined.

390
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,250
For 50 years,

391
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:15,500
he has staked
everything to take on Arucard.

392
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,050
Just like we have. He staked
it all on one night's battle.

393
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,050
Destiny has shuffled the cards,
and you get one hand.

394
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,430
You are only dealt one hand!
You're taking on the joker!

395
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:35,190
So then, what are you, Walter C. Dollneaz?

396
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,160
Not too shabby, Luke Valentine!

397
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,670
You deserved better
than to be fed to my dog.

398
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,260
Checkmate!

399
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,150
My puppet has been beaten, has it?

400
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,650
Even so!

401
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,110
I've got you cornered.

402
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,230
It's over, Arucard!

403
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,240
Yeah. Let's put an end
to this fools' dance.

404
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,880
Quickly... get to his heart...

405
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,970
His heart... His heart...

406
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,190
<i>No... This isn't right...!</i>

407
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,910
Yes, you missed. What a shame.
I thought I was empty.

408
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,920
This half-eaten dog food
is surprisingly tasty.

409
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,630
What's the matter, man in black? Stand up.

410
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,220
I can't have you giving up on me
after just one punch, kid.

411
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,190
Because you used a deviant
method of becoming a vampire,

412
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,060
your regenerative and
restorative powers are lagging,

413
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,570
and your body is being pulverized.

414
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,400
Now then, what is to become of you?

415
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,740
You can no longer maintain
that form, can you?

416
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,330
Not like during your heyday.
So, what will you become?

417
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,250
Will you revert to
being an old man? Or rather,

418
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,000
will you become a kid again?

419
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,470
Hey there, Walter! It's been 60 years!

420
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,220
What do you think you're doing?

421
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,720
Stop screwing with me!

422
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,770
I am not screwing with you.
You are the one screwing around.

423
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,730
I am just sticking around for your
parlor tricks, your child's play.

424
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,950
The form you take on means nothing to me.

425
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,410
Just like I told you 60 years ago.

426
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,870
Not to mention the reason
why you betrayed us, perhaps.

427
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,420
You have a poor memory, kid.

428
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:28,800
There is nothing here.
In the end, the final analysis,

429
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,930
this is just a schoolyard spat.
That is why we became kids...

430
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,430
both you and I.

431
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,720
Such is the true nature of war.

432
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,020
If you cannot overcome that,
you cannot be yourself.

433
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,230
To that end, you must turn everything
upside down and sell it at a loss.

434
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,610
Yes, who I was 500 years ago...

435
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,570
Who I am now... Anderson... the Major...

436
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,910
You wanted to fight me, right?

437
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,420
Otherwise, you couldn't take even
one more step forward, right?

438
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,210
You don't know the way
to move forward, do you?

439
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,800
Are you afraid of becoming useless?

440
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,720
Are you afraid of growing old?

441
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,390
Are you afraid of being forgotten?

442
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,020
John Bull? Don't be ridiculous.
You're the one screwing around.

443
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,900
You are a kid. You haven't
changed at all in 60 years.

444
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,020
You're still just a skinny little urchin.

445
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,740
Now, bring it on,

446
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,780
you filthy brat!

447
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,840
