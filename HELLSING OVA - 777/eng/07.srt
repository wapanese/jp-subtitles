1
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,930
What is it? Why are you crying?

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,060
Th-The kids at school told me
"You're the child of a killer,"

3
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,360
and "Your family members are
killers who go to war for money."

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,820
They're right. It's true.

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,740
Serving as mercenaries
has been the family trade

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,580
for eight generations now.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,370
From the time of your grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa's grandpa.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,880
Your own pop died when
he was in Columbia, didn't he?

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,840
He got in over his head, making
money to pay for you to be born.

10
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,760
Don't tell me you didn't know this.

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,770
G-Grandpa... Grandpa,
did you kill people, too?

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,770
Yeah, I did. A whole lot of people.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,150
W-What for?!
Why would you kill other people?!

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,650
Why else do mercenaries fight? For money.

15
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,070
Whether the objective
of the people we fight for

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,660
is an idea or principle, to bring
down a system, or to prop one up,

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,160
to be the aggressor,
or to be the defender,

18
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,260
for homeland, for family,
for a woman, for drugs, for food,

19
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,170
there are many reasons.

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,390
We don't know what they are.
We just know that they're important.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,650
But I think that you can take care of all
that stuff without having to take up arms.

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,820
Or should I say, do you need
a reason like that to take up arms?

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,950
I think that earning the pennies
they pay is reason enough.

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,000
On the other hand, the few
pennies they throw our way

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,460
is enough for us to risk our lives over.

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,300
We head out here and there to the world's
battlegrounds over those pennies,

27
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,130
where we kill
and get killed for those pennies.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,010
What's more, we don't do it
because we're told to do it,

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,720
it's because we enjoy it.

30
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,770
Those pennies we earn on the battlefield

31
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,270
are worth more to us than our own lives,
or the lives of others.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:36,110
Our family line really is a line
of human scum, considering.

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,070
Sorry, but you can't help it
if they pick on you at school.

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,500
But hey, I bet the time will come
soon enough for you to understand.

35
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,630
After all, you <i>are </i>our grandson.

36
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,260
It's true. You were absolutely right.

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,300
Yep.

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Hurry! Find anything that can
be used to make a barricade,

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,060
and fall back to the final line!

40
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,970
Roger!

41
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,890
Contact B Wing, too! Look sharp!

42
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,300
Help me! Help me! Help me!

43
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,930
They're pouring in, damn it!

44
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,970
Fire! Fire! Fire!

45
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,560
Our bullets!
Our bullets won't hit!

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,390
Fall back! Fall back!

47
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,680
Medic! Medic!

48
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,560
Damn it all, we've been cut off! Shit!

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,570
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

50
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,280
<i>This is B Wing. Captain,</i>
<i>our route of retreat has been cut off!</i>

51
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,240
We cannot join up with you.

52
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,410
Nonsense! Get over here,
even if you have to crawl!

53
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,540
We're preparing
to hole up in the round table room.

54
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,170
This is the most reinforced spot.

55
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,540
We'll be able to hold here.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
<i>They'll pick you off too easily</i>
<i>over there! Don't give up!</i>

57
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,840
<i>We'll wait with the barricade open!</i>
<i>Do anything you can!</i>

58
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,180
No, we can't Captain.

59
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,310
We're all wounded, including myself.

60
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,560
He's already dead.

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,310
Hurry up and dispose of him.
He's gonna become a ghoul.

62
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,320
Water... Give me some water...

63
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,070
We'll hold out here as long as we can.
Please, close up the barricade.

64
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,820
<i>Good hunting, and farewell.</i>

65
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,530
You dumbass!

66
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,590
Damn it, so that's it, huh?
All right then, damn it, die.

67
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,170
<i>Later, then. It's been fun.</i>

68
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,260
That goes double for me, Captain.
Well, we're going on ahead.

69
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,890
Over and out.

70
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,650
Close up the barricade.

71
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,530
Upend this huge round table
and add it to the barrier.

72
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,620
I don't care
what you use, just pile it on!

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Captain, what about the men in B Wing?

74
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,040
They've had it.

75
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,380
I see. That's too bad.

76
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,550
We're done for! It's all over now!

77
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,380
Shut up, you dumbass!

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,590
I've had enough of
fighting against monsters!

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,890
I can't take it anymore!

80
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,850
Integra and Arucard have forsaken us!

81
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,980
What are you talking about?
You can't get out anywhere

82
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,270
and nobody's letting you out.

83
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm leaving! I've had enough!

84
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,280
Where do you plan to go?
Your grave is right here.

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,780
This ridiculously huge
building is your grave marker,

86
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,780
and your grave keeper is
that fearsome Miss Integra.

87
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,330
Your epitaph will read,

88
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,830
"These badass mercenaries
defeated the evil Nazis,

89
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,790
and now lie here
like the badasses they are."

90
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,050
But that's going to change, thanks to you.

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,800
Because of your whining, it will be,

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,140
"Gutless pussies kicked the bucket
here, while crying like women."

93
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,970
You can't be serious!

94
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,060
You're going to die here like a man,
even if I have to force you!

95
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,440
You take the money

96
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,570
and you do the fighting because
you like it, right, soldier?!

97
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,280
Then you will fight
and die because you like it!

98
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,070
Damn it! Damn it! Fuck! Fuck!

99
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,410
Besides, there's still no
guarantee that we're going to die.

100
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,580
We are the defense.

101
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,210
Go on, now,
hurry and get the barricade up.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,960
The offense
is currently scoring our points.

103
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,560
Damn it, hit them! Damn it! Damn it!

104
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,570
Come on, you monsters!
Bring it on, you monsters!

105
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,740
Don't run away! Fight!

106
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,450
Here they come. We're done for.

107
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,960
Keep it together!

108
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,420
Burn it! Burn it!

109
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,420
Kill them all! Kill them all!

110
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,220
<i>This </i>is the power of Hellsing?
<i>These </i>are their royal knights?!

111
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,930
What a laugh that is!

112
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,110
That way.

113
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,460
Small-timer, you annoy me.

114
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,490
This is impossible! My... My house?!

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,780
Father!

116
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,910
Father, welcome home.

117
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
M-Michelle...?

118
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,130
N-No, that's not possible...

119
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,130
You... died!

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,590
You died, didn't you?!

121
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,140
What's the matter, Father?
Why the stern face?

122
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,430
It's a vision... It's a vision!

123
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,270
This is...

124
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,270
This is another illusion.

125
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,410
Damn it! Damn it!
Is this more of that witchcraft?

126
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,200
Michelle, are you just a vision, too?

127
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,160
It's not real!

128
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,130
None of it's real!
It's completely fabricated!

129
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,670
Death is the only cure for a fool!

130
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,100
Sergeant, how about that one?

131
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Oh, hang on a second.

132
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,650
Judging by the sourness,
hmm, type A, with a negative Rh.

133
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,440
Let's see, I bet I'm right this time.

134
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,950
Amazing! Right on the money,
right on the money. Well spotted.

135
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,910
The richness is what's different. See?

136
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,450
Is that right? Amazing.

137
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,500
It tastes different going down.

138
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,540
Also, type A is more, how can I say...

139
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,180
I-I'll take care of them.

140
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,470
I'll... I'll...

141
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,850
I'll take care of all of them!

142
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,200
My eyes! My eyes!

143
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,200
Damn, they got us.

144
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,460
Medic! Over here!

145
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,460
Bring those chairs over here! Hurry!

146
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,500
Block it up, quickly!

147
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,670
The barricade! Hurry!

148
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,720
Damn them! Damn them!

149
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,220
Idiot! Don't expose yourself!

150
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,350
Damn it...

151
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,110
We're... We're done for!

152
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,490
Shut up, you dumbass!

153
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,280
Even if we surrender,
they'll still torture us all to death.

154
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,370
Those guys are monsters. They'll eat us!

155
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,330
Redistribute the remaining ammo.

156
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,790
Captain, here. This is the last of it.

157
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,630
We're out of blessed silver bullets.

158
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,130
Kill me! I've had it!
I can't see! Kill me!

159
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,640
Captain! I can't take it!
I don't want to die!

160
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,970
Shut up, will you?
I'd really rather not die, either.

161
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,400
This is just like that one time.
In Uganda, Jang Wijde,

162
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,610
and the right-wing-held
positions at the airfield?

163
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,660
Our reinforcements
showed up in time back there,

164
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,620
but this time... Damn, it's no use.

165
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,330
Enough of that blather,
Deputy Chief. She's coming.

166
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,170
I'm sure she's coming.
That's the kind of girl she is.

167
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,560
Damn them and their rockets.
They still have those damn things?

168
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,190
Everyone, report!

169
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,570
Deputy Chief, give me a damage report!

170
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,410
Deputy Chief!

171
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,080
Deputy Chief! Hey, Deputy Chief!

172
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,090
I'm exhausted...
Permission to rest ahead of you?

173
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,090
Yeah. Rest well. See you later.

174
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,350
Bulls-eye. Shall we charge in?

175
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,110
No, not yet. Hit them one more time.

176
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,610
We only have one Panzerfaust left.

177
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,610
It's our hole card.

178
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,370
I don't care, do it! Blow them away!

179
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,370
Blow that pathetic bunch to bits!

180
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,620
<i>Jawohl</i>.

181
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,340
Damn...

182
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,770
Do it!

183
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,040
Direct cannon support? It's you!

184
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,050
Captain...

185
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,310
Yeah, she's here, as promised.

186
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,440
Our girl is really here,

187
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,810
to single-handedly kill all the monsters.

188
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,320
Ah, damn it.

189
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,320
What a hell of a fine girl
she is, that's for damn sure.

190
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,120
I should have kissed her,
by force if I had to.

191
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,840
Seras... Seras Victoria!

192
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,350
You're the only one left!

193
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,810
So what if I am?!

194
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,240
It's an illusion, an illusion!
It's not real, it's an illusion!

195
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,790
It's an illusion! It's an illusion!

196
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,500
Seras is causing more problems, is she?

197
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,840
Yes. When one of the
boys took a toy from her,

198
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,010
she hit him with a rock.

199
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,930
It's an illusion! It's an illusion!

200
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,430
She hasn't taken to any
of the other teachers one bit.

201
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,020
The effects of the incident
must still be hard on her.

202
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,520
Still, if she causes any more difficulty,

203
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,900
this orphanage will no longer
be able to look after her.

204
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,030
<i>Don't let her rattle you.</i>

205
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,110
<i>Go deeper...</i>

206
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,490
Why do you want to be a police officer?

207
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,040
Can't you think of any
other path for yourself?

208
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,500
No.

209
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,540
You're too stubborn.

210
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,300
Sure, your father was a fine policeman.

211
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,340
But you have many other possibilities.

212
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,220
It's almost as though you're
squandering your chances.

213
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,970
<i>It's just a vision...</i>

214
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,970
<i>Go even deeper...</i>

215
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,190
All right, Seras, listen to me closely.

216
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,570
You must not come out
of here, no matter what.

217
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,610
Mum...

218
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,280
Mum... Mum...!

219
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,630
Have you croaked? Have you croaked?

220
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,130
Hey, you, have you croaked, copper?

221
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,430
Are you dead? Are you dead?

222
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah, he's good and dead.

223
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,140
Filthy pig! You filthy pig!

224
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,390
You feel sorry now?

225
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,400
This is what happens when
a flatfoot sticks his nose in too deep!

226
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,410
You got that, lady?

227
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,180
You little brat!

228
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,310
That filthy little brat! Damn it!

229
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,560
Hey, get up. We've gotta get out of here.

230
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,020
It hurts! It hurts, damn it!

231
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,570
This is more than I bargained for!

232
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,070
Now I'm gonna rape the old lady.

233
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,950
Get real, she's dead.

234
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,200
Not a problem. She's still warm.

235
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,560
Good morning, Miss Seras.
Did you have pleasant dreams?

236
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,740
One more! One more!

237
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,390
You're a tough chick!

238
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,030
What are you, an insect? A frog?

239
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,340
What is this? You're not at all
what they told me you'd be.

240
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,800
You're trash. A big sloppy mess.

241
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,810
Now then, it's about time for you to die.

242
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,560
I think I'll slice off that head of yours.

243
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,440
Die!

244
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,030
Shut up, you hag!

245
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,740
What?!

246
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,620
Have some more!

247
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,970
Chill, you ugly troglodyte.

248
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,690
Hurry, Captain!

249
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,610
This way! Hurry, Captain!

250
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,940
You got it.

251
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,200
Captain... Berna...

252
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,780
Don't try to talk.

253
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,200
Damn it...!

254
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,420
Mr. Bernadotte... R-Run!

255
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,260
You've done enough, Mr. Bernadotte...

256
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,260
I told you to keep quiet!

257
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,640
-Son of a bitch!
-Damn it!

258
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,780
-Captain!
-Captain!

259
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,530
Yeah!

260
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,730
You trash...!
You scum, trying to be a hero...!

261
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,490
Mr. Bernadotte...? Mr. Bernadotte!

262
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,080
Dumb... Dumbass...!

263
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,420
Mr. Bernadotte!

264
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,670
If you came to save me,
and I... I end up saving you...

265
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,470
...we're screwed, huh...?

266
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,700
Mr. Bernadotte...

267
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,320
That's what you get
for not paying attention.

268
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,150
I finally stole a kiss from you.

269
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,660
B...Ber...

270
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:25,410
Hey, don't cry, Seras.
You're a tough girl, ain't you?

271
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,670
Now devour me. Devour me,
and let's get her, together, Seras.

272
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,430
<i>You dummy.</i>
<i>I told you not to cry, didn't I?</i>

273
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,150
<i>Your eyeballs have been</i>
<i>gouged out. You're such a fool.</i>

274
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,650
<i>Your arm has been lopped off, too.</i>
<i>You're falling apart.</i>

275
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,160
<i>Such a foolish girl.</i>

276
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,660
<i>Ah, damn it.</i>

277
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,950
<i>Damn it all.</i>

278
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,170
<i>You're such a fine girl.</i>

279
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,170
<i>If I can die to protect her,</i>

280
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,710
<i>that's okay with me.</i>

281
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,810
Captain...

282
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,190
It can't be... Damn. Damn!

283
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,870
Tear-jerking, isn't it? Eh?

284
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,370
When a piece-of-trash insect like that

285
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,370
buzzes around making a pest
of himself, that's what happens.

286
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,720
Now then, you've really gone and
done a number on us, haven't you?

287
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,380
Well now, what shall we do about that?

288
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,470
R-Reinforcements!

289
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,390
A detached force?

290
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,520
Let's squash these
pesky bugs under our palms!

291
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:58,150
Such is the end for the life of an insect!

292
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,160
Not again! Not again, damn it!

293
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,790
You called him an insect, didn't you?

294
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
You called him a bug, didn't you?

295
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,380
You'll pay for this.

296
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,140
You'll pay for this!

297
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,900
You'll pay for this...
You'll pay for this!

298
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,550
Off I go, Captain Bernadotte.

299
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,600
Off I go.

300
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,730
Off I go!

301
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,860
What...?

302
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,360
The lieutenant's spell...!

303
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,740
Together we go.

304
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,490
Together we get... We get those guys!

305
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,410
<i>What is this? What's going on?</i>

306
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,620
<i>My soldiers are trembling</i>
<i>with fear. These vampires,</i>

307
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,000
<i>who swarmed the battlefield,</i>
<i>while under heavy fire,</i>

308
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,750
<i>and are members of the</i>
<i>battle-hardened Waffen-SS...</i>

309
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,800
<i>...are frightened by</i>
<i>a single girl before their eyes.</i>

310
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,180
<i>Frightened by a girl,</i>
<i>who is wounded from head to toe!</i>

311
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,890
<i>What the hell... is this?!</i>

312
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,690
F-Fire! Fire! Fire!

313
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,130
<i>This is bad...</i>

314
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
<i>This is bad!</i>

315
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,180
<i>I'm not sure what's going on here,</i>

316
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,470
<i>but this is bad!</i>

317
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,720
I am not about to
drink one drop, one speck,

318
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,140
one microliter of your blood!

319
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,890
I won't do it! I won't do it!

320
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,900
Deeper... Deeper...

321
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,990
Deeper... Even deeper... Even deeper...

322
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,660
...even deeper!

323
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,910
<i>W-What is this? Who is that?</i>

324
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,210
<i>This isn't right! This... This isn't her!</i>

325
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,920
<i>Who is this? What is this?</i>

326
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,920
<i>This isn't right! It's not her!</i>

327
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,010
<i>Her memories...</i>
<i>her mind... it's all mixed up!</i>

328
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,300
<i>What is this?</i>
<i>Who is this? Whose mind is this?</i>

329
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:47,650
<i>Him? That man I called an insect?!</i>

330
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,780
Blood is the currency of the soul,
the coinage of the will.

331
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,160
This is what it is to
suck blood, and what it is...

332
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,160
...to offer blood.

333
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,660
Are you okay? Are you still alive?

334
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,160
SchrÃ¶dinger!

335
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,420
Don't act so surprised.

336
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,590
I am everywhere, and yet nowhere.

337
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:18,180
Zorin, I am here to deliver
a message from the major.

338
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,970
"Stealing marches and first strikes
are the rewards of a soldier.

339
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,890
Ah, of course. Which means
that going against orders,

340
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,440
losing precious soldiers,
and dealing with inept underlings

341
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,190
is the reward of the commander."

342
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:39,490
That's what he said. Normally,
you'd be blown to cinders by now,

343
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,580
but the major and Doc have gotten
their hands on this fascinating toy,

344
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,120
and they're all wrapped up in it,
with no time to bother with you.

345
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:54,960
This monster is both Seras Victoria,
and not Seras Victoria.

346
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,510
This vampire will be performing
your execution. Bye, now.

347
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,650
Away with you! Out of my presence!

348
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,900
Out of my mind!

349
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,170
Is that...

350
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,920
Is that the same girl?

351
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,110
I'm off.

352
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,120
You're off? Where are you going?

353
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,420
I made a promise to the captain,
that we would get them.

354
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,260
Which is why
I'm going off now, to get them.

355
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,430
Oh...

356
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,270
<i>Right. Captain, this is where you died.</i>

357
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:18,150
<i>Right here. But you're in there, too.</i>

358
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,030
Hang on a second.

359
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,710
Yes, sir!

360
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,170
Sir!

361
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,860
<i>The sky was starting to get light.</i>
<i>Dawn was approaching.</i>

362
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,400
<i>Not paying heed even</i>
<i>to the light of the sun,</i>

363
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,160
<i>she flew off, like a bow fully drawn.</i>

364
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,030
<i>Toward the dead city...</i>

365
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,750
<i>...for a raid at daybreak!</i>

366
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,190
This is it. This is what I wanted to see.

367
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,940
Ah, it's so wonderful.

368
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,190
Zorin died, Major.

369
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,690
Just like a bug.

370
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,620
I knew it. Such a foolish little girl.

371
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,450
The destruction has begun.

372
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,960
It makes the heart leap, huh?

373
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:54,380
You're a terrible person.
You brought everyone with you,

374
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,970
and you're planning to send every
last one of them charging into hell.

375
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,470
That's what war is.

376
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,310
Hell is right here.

377
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,190
I take without end,
and am taken from without end.

378
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,400
I destroy without end,
and am destroyed without end.

379
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,780
As such,
I have overcome days of aspiration

380
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,950
and nights of resignation
to stand here now.

381
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,450
Behold,

382
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,120
our destruction is coming...

383
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,870
...together with victory!
