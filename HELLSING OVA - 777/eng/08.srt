1
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,730
Oh... God...

2
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,070
A-An angel...

3
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,070
Angels!

4
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,200
A-Angels...

5
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,030
That is correct!

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,330
We are the surrogates
of the Angel of Death!

7
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,250
We will now pass judgment
on this religious trial!

8
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,060
Britain stands accused!
The monsters stand accused!

9
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,150
The verdict is the death penalty!
The death penalty!

10
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,690
Death! Death! Death! Death!

11
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,900
I feel pity for you.

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,870
However, I cannot forgive you.
Now die, like barren wildflowers.

13
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,540
Whirl about like butterflies,
and die like bees!

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,600
What do you know?

15
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,440
That kid can really do something
when he puts his mind to it, huh?

16
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,480
M-Major...

17
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,240
Major, this is dangerous!
Please, come back inside!

18
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,620
Doc, is it ready yet?

19
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,290
Huh? Yes. It will be risky,
but I have done as you requested.

20
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,080
Although, the treatment was a bit rough,

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,290
and it is extremely unstable.

22
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,510
That is splendid. Very good.

23
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,840
Indeed, it is an outstanding specimen.

24
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,720
Good work, Doc.

25
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,850
You could do some work, too, you idiot!

26
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,100
I did work! I went to the
Hellsing house and watched Zorin!

27
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,810
Oh, really?

28
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,700
<i>Achtung</i>!

29
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,620
All units, equip ultraviolet
protection, and muster!

30
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,960
Masks!

31
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,670
Muster the battalion!
Muster the battalion!

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Keep watch here!

33
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,830
Keep watch there!

34
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,410
Eradicate the enemy!

35
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,330
Target dead ahead!

36
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
Carry out the execution!

37
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,240
Major! Please, come inside!

38
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,710
The special thin armor plating
won't hold out for long!

39
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,330
Major? Maj...

40
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,510
He's playing music.
The music of the battlefield.

41
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,790
He's... leading it!

42
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,080
The music of the battlefield,
and we are the instrument!

43
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,170
One big, howling, crawling
instrument, offering up our tone!

44
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,670
Nobody can interfere with him.

45
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,810
Enemy commander located!
He's on top of the airship!

46
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,520
What the hell is he doing?

47
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,940
He's crazy! A mad ghost of war!

48
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,070
Major!

49
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,660
Die!

50
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,630
Good work, butler.

51
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,070
This was decided a half-century ago!

52
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,160
The mark of the skull is
fitting for this angel of death!

53
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,010
They haven't come... to save us...?

54
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,560
Die! Die! Die! Die!

55
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,310
Good! Kill them all!

56
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,150
You worms! This is our power!
This is the Vatican's power!

57
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,570
The only good Protestant
is a dead Protestant!

58
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,040
You've betrayed us, Maxwell.

59
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,050
Sneak attacks and betrayal
are par for the course in war.

60
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,260
In fact, they deserve praise.

61
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,060
Particularly when
going against the heathen.

62
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,650
However... However, this is different.

63
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,030
I do not like this.

64
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,700
Maxwell, you are enraptured.
Absolutely intoxicated.

65
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,450
By your authority and power.

66
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,500
We are only supposed to be
mere implements of force.

67
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,000
I am just a knife, for
executing the condemned.

68
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,590
Simply power in the service of God.

69
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,970
Maxwell, you have now
given up serving God.

70
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,260
You are serving the power of God!

71
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,060
Yeah?! Isn't that right,
Archbishop Maxwell?!

72
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,440
Father Anderson,

73
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,570
we have orders from
His Excellency, Archbishop Maxwell.

74
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,070
We are to take Integra, Director
of Hellsing, into custody at once.

75
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,290
No, I do not like this.

76
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,210
It is not a matter of whether
you like it or not, Anderson.

77
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,080
I don't like this!

78
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,260
Seras!

79
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,680
Seras Victoria!

80
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,560
Are you injured, Miss Integra?

81
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,020
I'm fine. How is headquarters?

82
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,320
We were attacked by
a company of enemy soldiers.

83
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,030
We eliminated the enemy.

84
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,530
Headquarters has been wiped out.

85
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,790
Including Mr. Bernadotte.

86
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,870
I see, you don't say.

87
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,210
Seras, you drank Bernadotte, huh?

88
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,220
You've become a vampire, haven't you?

89
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,220
Y-Yes.

90
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,810
Stand down.

91
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,680
The girl is already too
much for you to handle,

92
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,850
even if you ganged up on her.

93
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,770
Seras Victoria, the vampire...

94
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,570
...you are starting to become
something quite fearsome.

95
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,820
Yes, I am, Father Alexander Anderson.

96
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,830
I am not afraid of anything anymore.

97
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,580
Your eyes look like they go
down to the bottom of the abyss.

98
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,130
What a state to be in, for
someone who looks so human.

99
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,340
H-He is...

100
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,850
...returning!

101
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,150
This is fantastic. It all goes awry now.

102
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,490
<i>Something is sailing up the Thames River.</i>

103
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,120
What is it?

104
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,960
<i>A ghost... ship...</i>

105
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,200
And they, who had gathered before
a painting of a line of spears

106
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,960
now reunite before a line of spears.

107
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,210
A division of panzer grenadiers

108
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,590
turned to vampires from Germany's
Third Reich, "The Last Battalion."

109
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,140
Five hundred and seventy-two
of their number remain.

110
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,060
Knights of
the Roman Catholic Vatican Curia,

111
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,600
of the ninth airborne mobile crusade.

112
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,860
Two thousand, eight hundred seventy-five
of their number remain.

113
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,400
The Order of the Royal
Imperial Church of England.

114
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,370
Three of their number remain.

115
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,790
And so, the players all take
their places on the stage,

116
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,460
and the curtain rises
over this Walpurgis Dawn.

117
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:18,600
Lord! My lord,
Integra Hellsing! Your orders!

118
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,900
My servant, the vampire
Arucard, I now order you!

119
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,490
Stain in vermillion the army wearing
white with your gun of platinum.

120
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,450
Stain in scarlet the army wearing
black with your gun of iron.

121
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,130
Stain with crimson each and
every last one of our foes.

122
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,510
Search and destroy! Search and destroy!

123
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,340
Lay waste to them!
Do not let them leave this island alive!

124
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,850
Acknowledged. As you wish, my master.

125
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,270
Releasing control-restriction system
level zero.

126
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,030
Make good on your homecoming.

127
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,990
Unleash yourself thousands of times
and make good on your return!

128
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,410
Recite it!

129
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,000
I am the Bird of Hermes...

130
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,940
I eat my own wings...

131
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,750
Everyone here has sensed it.

132
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,720
Something terrible is about to happen.

133
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,430
Unless we put down this monster,
something terrible is about to happen!

134
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,680
...to keep myself tame...

135
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,860
Here it comes...

136
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,620
The river is coming. The river of death!

137
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,620
The dead shall dance,

138
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,710
and hell shall sing!

139
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,340
Cease fire! Cease fire!

140
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,210
Im... possible...!

141
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,290
It's not possible!
How can anything like that be?!

142
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,800
That is what the vampire Arucard is.

143
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,890
Blood is the currency of
the soul, the tender of life.

144
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,060
It is nothing more than the medium
by which life is transacted.

145
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,060
To drink blood is to take
the entire being of a life unto oneself.

146
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,070
You can understand what that means
now, can't you, Seras Victoria?

147
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Yes.

148
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,830
The Kazan and Yeniçeri forces!

149
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,330
You even devoured them, did you?

150
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,170
No wonder you won't die.
No wonder you can't be killed.

151
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,640
Just how many lives does he have?
How many lives did he drink?!

152
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,770
The principality of Wallachia's army...

153
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,910
You took your own soldiers...
your own subjects... your own fiefdom!

154
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,410
What a fiend you are! A monster!
A devil! A <i>dracul</i>! Dracula!

155
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,840
Full perimeter defense!
Square up! Close formation!

156
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,090
What is this?! What is awakening?!

157
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,930
It's death!

158
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,890
Death is awakening!

159
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,820
This is fantastic! I want it! Magnificent!

160
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,700
Fire! Shoot it up!

161
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,160
Shoot it up!

162
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,770
Fire! Fire! Fire!
It's hell below us! It's hell!

163
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,110
We keep shooting it,
and it keeps coming out!

164
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,180
Our lines are crumbling!
Bishop, please withdraw! Bishop!

165
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,090
This can no longer be called a battle!

166
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:55,310
D-Don't be ridiculous!
I am not a bishop! I am an archbishop!

167
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,850
I am an archbishop!

168
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,510
This is hardened tektite
compound reinforced glass!

169
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,760
Dead people like you
cannot even scratch it!

170
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,520
Anderson!

171
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,770
Anderson!

172
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,200
We are Iscariot.

173
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,540
The representatives of
God's punishment on earth.

174
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,790
We will shatter your dreams,
without the least bit of discord.

175
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,590
Farewell, my friend.

176
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,350
Anderson! Anderson! Anderson!

177
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,390
Save me, Anderson!

178
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,650
Save me, Teacher! Teacher!

179
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,280
Teacher...

180
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,870
Am I to die here... all alone...?

181
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,750
No...! No...! I was born all alone...

182
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,090
...and now I must die all alone...?!

183
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,100
Jesus...

184
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,110
Teacher...

185
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,820
Mr. Anderson...

186
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,830
I will become great. I will become great.

187
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,130
I will become great
and get even with everyone.

188
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,050
You are such a fool.

189
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,430
A big fat idiot.

190
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,900
Anderson calling all paladins.

191
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,070
Return to the Vatican.

192
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,160
<i>The Ninth Crusade expeditionary force,</i>

193
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,120
<i>Reconquista,</i>
<i>has been completely wiped out.</i>

194
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,000
Morning is coming. The dream is now over.

195
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,800
Return to the Vatican.

196
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,260
Y-You can't mean it, Anderson!

197
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,760
Your place to die is not here.

198
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,470
Leave! Protect the Vatican.

199
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,100
Protect the Pope!

200
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,860
Protect Catholicism throughout eternity.

201
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,820
I am going to defeat him.

202
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,740
I will defeat Arucard! I must defeat him!

203
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,740
Father! What's going to
become of you if you fight him?!

204
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,160
Nay! It's now. It's now or never.

205
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:51,000
Now is the time, when Arucard
has released all of his restraints!

206
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,920
This is the form whereby
I can beat all of the lives

207
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,180
and all of the attacks which he possesses.

208
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,640
He has dispatched all of
the warriors from his castle.

209
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,430
It is a concentrated force.

210
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,980
Right now, in his castle,
the lord of the manor... stands alone!

211
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,070
At this moment, he is a single vampire.

212
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,740
Dracula, all on his own.

213
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:21,780
This... This was the sole objective
of that mad battalion commander.

214
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,410
It was all one great sacrifice in
order to bring down Arucard alone.

215
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,880
A thousand SS,

216
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,750
three thousand crusaders,
a million Britons,

217
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,300
all of them, friend and foe,

218
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,800
with the surety that I would come, too.

219
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,640
Farewell, gentlemen! Maxwell is weeping.

220
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,060
That utterly hopeless fool!

221
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,320
He is the same spineless
weakling that he ever was.

222
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,950
Farewell.
I shall see you someday, in Limbo.

223
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,200
-Father!
-Father Anderson!

224
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,950
Welcome back, Count.

225
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,290
I have returned, Countess.

226
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,220
W-Welcome back, Master.

227
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,060
M-Master, you have a moustache, huh?

228
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,980
A moustache...

229
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,950
Seras...

230
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,000
Seras Victoria...

231
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,900
Nicely done, my sworn enemy.

232
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,370
We are the representatives of God;

233
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,280
the agents of divine punishment on earth.

234
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,080
Our calling is to exterminate
the flesh of all the fools

235
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,040
who would defy our God,
down to the last trace!

236
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:31,850
Amen!

237
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,540
I'm impressed that you have
developed yourself so fully, as a man.

238
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,590
My enemy, try to kill me!

239
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,420
Go ahead and thrust
your bayonet into my heart!

240
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,050
As occurred 500 years ago...
As occurred 100 years ago...

241
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,020
Put an end to the interlude
between my dreams,

242
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,680
my beloved archenemy.

243
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,060
You need not even ask!

244
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,920
Pure silver,
macedonium-processed mercury rounds

245
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,130
in Marvels Chemical NNA9 cartridges.

246
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:54,680
39cm in length, weighing 16kg,
with 13mm armor-piercing rounds.

247
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,350
Jackal!

248
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,440
It's perfect, Walter!

249
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,180
Now what?

250
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,690
Now what will you do?
Your monster is right here, Catholic!

251
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,690
You're going to defeat me, right?
What are your chances of winning?

252
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,030
One in a thousand? One in ten thousand?

253
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,990
A billion? A trillion?
Or even a quadrillion?

254
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:59,580
Even if it's a novemdecillion,
I can still more than handle it!

255
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,670
<i>Contact with Nordland Platoon</i>
<i>has been lost!</i>

256
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,420
<i>Respond, you dumbasses!</i>

257
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,960
<i>Communiqué from the aerial cruiser!</i>

258
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,170

259
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,510
<i>Nobody is responding!</i>

260
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,390
Butler, mix up some Verhoeden
cocoa and bring it to me,

261
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,760
with plenty of milk and sugar.

262
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,020
London has perished,
the Crusade has perished,

263
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,150
and the Last Battalion is perishing.

264
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,280
Arucard is also there.

265
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,280
I am also here.

266
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Everything is proceeding.
It is proceeding perfectly.

267
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,100
What's the matter, Christian?
Your monster is over here.

268
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,150
You're wounded from head to toe.

269
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,650
Your arm is cut through, and
about to fall off. What will you do?

270
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,780
Are you a dog? Or are you a human?

271
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,830
What does it matter, vampire?

272
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,750
My arm has only been
cut through, hasn't it?

273
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,670
Now stop boasting, and come at me.

274
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,920
Come on and fight me! Hurry! Hurry!

275
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,060
Fantastic.

276
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,650
Humans are magnificent, all right.

277
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,640
Exploding chain!

278
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,490
Forward!

279
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,160
Forward!

280
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,910
Forward! Forward! Forward! Forward!

281
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,200
Forward! Forward!

282
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,620
What kind of man is this?

283
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,670
He's almost...
Almost like those other men.

284
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,550
Come on. Come on, Alexander Anderson!

285
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:05,430
Come and stand before my gaze,
like those other men did.

286
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Like that other man did,

287
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,110
and try to run through
the viscus at my heart!

288
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,360
Get out of my way!

289
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,390
Damn it, you fools!

290
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,310
You giant, meddling dumbasses!

291
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,650
If we return to the Vatican now,
we will no longer be who we are!

292
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,400
We will no longer be Judas of Iscariot!

293
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,070
We will become mere bags of flesh,
filled with blood and human waste!

294
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,370
"By crying out amen and killing,
the world slippeth back into place."

295
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,160
You're the one who
taught us that, aren't you?!

296
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,330
Let us now behold
the deceit of the zealot!

297
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,920
You ignorant fools! All of you
are thinking only of dying!

298
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,090
Limbo has been made full!

299
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,010
Very well, come with me.

300
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,010
I am about to charge my
way into hell at full speed!

301
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,100
Join me, as you always have!

302
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,100
What are ye?

303
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,100
We are Iscariot! We are Judas of Iscariot!

304
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,530
Countless lives struggle

305
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:47,910
and writhe as though one life,
all sharing one common rapture,

306
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,660
seeking blood even while spilling blood,

307
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,870
continuously multiplying and receding,

308
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,670
ever fighting, without end.

309
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,090
Whether that rapture is faith in "God,"

310
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,680
or war in the name of "Nazism,"

311
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,930
or as part of the being called "Arucard,"

312
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,100
we are now, at last, the same thing.

313
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,770
It's like a dream, isn't it,

314
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,320
my dark brethren?

315
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,570
To the death!

316
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,070
Go!

317
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,740
Amen!

318
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,030
I'm going on ahead!

319
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,940
You stand before me?

320
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,330
I'm impressed. I'm impressed, Iscariot.

321
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm impressed, Alexander Anderson!

322
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,840
You're not the only one who
carries a weapon that can end life.

323
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,550
That's your ace in the hole, is it?

324
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,530
A nail?

325
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,950
The Holy Shroud...
the Holy Grail... the Lance of Longinus...

326
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,910
That is the last of
the lost holy artifacts of Rome?

327
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,790
That's right.

328
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,290
That lingering scent of a miracle...
It's the Holy Nail of Helena!

329
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,760
That's right!

330
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,220
Don't do it, Anderson!

331
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,930
Are you trying to become
a monster?! A monster of God?!

332
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,270
Do you mean to
become an actual plaything

333
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,140
of the divine power of immortality?

334
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,940
It's the same thing.
It amounts to the same rubbish!

335
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,440
Whether a monster that affirms God,
or a monster that denies God...

336
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,280
Do you intend to use
the scrap from that miracle

337
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,450
to become more scrap
from that miracle, yourself?

338
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,870
Do you mean to drive you, me,
and our duel...

339
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,710
into the afterlife?

340
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,380
A monster like me...

341
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,590
A weak monster who
could not bear to be human

342
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,600
must be defeated by a human.

343
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,820
Don't do it, human.

344
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,530
Do not become a monster... like me.

345
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,870
I just want to be a bayonet.

346
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,500
I just want to be a
bayonet of God's punishment.

347
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,380
I wouldn't have minded being born a storm.

348
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,960
I wouldn't have minded being a threat.

349
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,930
I wouldn't have minded being an explosive.

350
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,590
I wouldn't have minded being

351
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,810
a simple, terrible windstorm,
without heart or pity.

352
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,600
If I can become like that by
thrusting this into me, then I shall.

353
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,190
May it be so.

354
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,020
Y-You...

355
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,790
You blasted fool!

356
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,950
Thorns... The thorns...!

357
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,700
Anderson! Just what have you become?!

358
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,290
His body is no longer that of a man.

359
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,130
Now, the only way for both you
and I to die and return to dust,

360
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,460
is to have this gouged out of us...

361
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,630
the viscus at our heart.

362
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,430
Father Anderson!

363
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,390
Father!

364
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,500
It was no longer man, nor demon...

365
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,120
Neither day, nor night.

366
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,810
Master!
