1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,750
<i>All flesh is like grass.</i>

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,090
<i>All human glory is like grass flowers.</i>

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,630
<i>The grass withers, the flowers fade,</i>

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,340
<i>but the word of the Lord endures forever.</i>

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Am I defeated?

6
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,280
You are defeated.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,490
There's no such thing as
a never-ending nightmare.

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,330
Your castle and your dominions are gone.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,790
Your servants are all dead.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,750
The girl's heavenly host has
disappeared without a trace.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,670
She will never be yours.

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,860
Count, you have nothing.

14
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,110
You are a pathetic No Life King.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,620
You have nothing.

16
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,280
Nothing!

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,680
A dream...

18
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,600
It was a dream?

19
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,440
Utter nonsense.

20
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,450
Comrade Integra...

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,370
Something quite significant
must have happened

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,210
for you to convene
a round table conference.

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,210
Sir Hellsing.

24
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,630
Yes.

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,430
The number of vampire attacks has been
rising steadily over the past few months.

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,100
We can't hush this up any longer.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,470
We can only spin this thing so far.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,770
What's going on?

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,060
Yes.

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,360
A thorough investigation
of the vampires and ghouls

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,360
defeated so far has yielded...

32
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,740
What is that?

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,490
A transmitter, or some similar device.

34
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,200
They were embedded in
the vampires in numerous places

35
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,290
and are thought to have
both examined and reported

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,880
on all their conditions,
actions, mental states, and battles.

37
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,090
What?!

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,010
These attacks are not
occurring spontaneously.

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,890
There's someone behind
the scenes who's controlling...

40
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,260
the vampires.

41
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,810
And another thing...

42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,770
What?

43
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,060
Something else?

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,140
Ghouls.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,730
Traditionally, ghouls are what
non-virgin men and women

46
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,950
whose blood had been
sucked by vampires turn into.

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,570
It's different this time.

48
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,330
During these attacks, not one
new vampire has been created.

49
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,410
Even adolescent boys and girls

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,580
who were clearly virgins
have all turned into ghouls.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,920
What's more, ghouls are
supposed to cease to exist

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,210
along with the blood
of their host vampire.

53
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,720
In the Badrick attack,

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,550
despite the fact that the
Vatican's Father Anderson

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,470
had already destroyed the vampire...

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,480
When we stormed the place,
it was crawling with ghouls.

57
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,440
What does it mean?

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Whoever it is that's pulling
the strings behind this...

59
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,780
knows about vampires and ghouls.

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,030
Just like us.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,580
Walter...

62
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,290
What is this?

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,790
What is it? It's a coffin.

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,170
Why... Why is this thing in my room?

65
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,260
It was on order by Sir Integra herself.

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,180
"You can't have a vampire
who doesn't sleep in a coffin."

67
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,010
Or so she said.

68
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,180
And my bed...?

69
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,560
I disposed of it. Naturally.

70
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,690
No!

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,190
Walter!

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,610
GRINDING TEETH

73
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,620
Why,
it was on Mr. Arucard's orders as well.

74
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,990
Master?

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
Yes.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,750
You haven't drank a sip of blood
since you became a vampire.

77
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,090
So, if you don't sleep in a coffin made
out of the earth from your birthplace,

78
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,050
you will only continue to grow weaker.

79
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,970
Is it not something you feel
comfortable doing yet?

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,190
You imbecile.

81
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,690
Master...

82
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
You chose the night.

83
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,690
You've turned your back on
the sun and started to walk the night.

84
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,200
There's no turning back
to the light of day.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,330
Mr. Arucard, I was hoping
to deliver this to you just now.

86
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,170
What have we here?

87
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,930
An anti-Midian combat-use
13-millimeter pistol. The Jackal.

88
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,180
It's the first pistol to use
its own custom bullets.

89
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,020
Not the converted 454 Casull
shells we've used up until now.

90
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,850
Thirty-nine centimeters in length,
ten kilos in weight,

91
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,690
and holds six rounds.

92
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,860
Not something the human race
is able to handle anymore.

93
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,740
Custom bullets?

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,200
Exploding steel shells, 13mm.

95
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,860
The casings?

96
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,870
Pure Macedonian processed silver casings.

97
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,700
And the bullet itself...
Exploding-type or mercury-type?

98
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,460
Mercury bullets which have
gone through all the proper rites.

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,300
It's perfect, Walter.

100
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,960
Much obliged.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,300
I could even kill Anderson
with this thing.

102
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,760
Wow. It's amazing.

103
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,140
Miss Seras, your weapon
has also been newly made.

104
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,060
A 30mm anti-Midian cannon. The Hallconnen.

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,730
It uses two kinds of shells.

106
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,650
Depleted uranium and
exploding steel incendiary.

107
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,160
With the exception of tanks,
it destroys all ground or air weaponry.

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,950
What the hell is this thing?!

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,460
The guy's friend is a doctor.

110
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,670
One of those plastic surgeon types.

111
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,210
There's this patient who's fucking crazy.

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,090
He asks to have a hole drilled in his head
and a glass plate put in so you can see

113
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,850
his brain floating there.
And the doctor does it.

114
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,980
Then the guy has a plastic
horn implanted in his head.

115
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,520
Now he's a monster!

116
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,810
What the fuck was he doing, right, bro?

117
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,730
Shut up.

118
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,240
You're always yammering
before we do a job.

119
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,950
You should be quiet and cool.

120
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same old shit. I know. I know.

121
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,370
Failure is not permitted.

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,080
Failure?

123
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,670
No fucking way!
I could do this in my sleep.

124
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,930
What are you doing here?
This place is off limits.

125
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,890
I beg your pardon.

126
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,180
We're on a tour of little known spots.

127
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,730
This mansion isn't open to the public?

128
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,440
This is private property.
Please leave at once.

129
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,190
-Very well.
-Yes sir.

130
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,880
You don't look so hot.

131
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,380
Are you all right?

132
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,510
Well then, <i>ciao</i>.

133
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,850
Hold your fire! Hold it!

134
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,060
Stop!

135
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,270
Bro, these guys are fucking idiots.

136
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,940
Are you sure about this?

137
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,360
It's a test.

138
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,820
Just an insignificant, ordinary test.

139
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Those guys, as well as us two, are
nothing more than a process to him.

140
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,630
A test, huh? Whatever.

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,390
Fucking worthless!

142
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,940
I just wanna kill them
and drink their blood!

143
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,820
I don't give a shit
about Hellsing or Arucard.

144
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,360
Just fucking kill 'em!

145
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,290
What? What's going on, Integra?

146
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,880
<i>This is the control room! Sir Integra!</i>

147
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,300
What is it? What happened?

148
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,090
<i>It's an attack! An enemy attack!</i>

149
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,010
What?!

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,430
<i>We're cut off from the outside world!</i>

151
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,770
<i>There's a battle going on now</i>
<i>at the first floor entrance!</i>

152
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,140
Drive them back! Buy time if you can't!

153
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,350
<i>Roger!</i>

154
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,650
Who are they? How many?!

155
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,570
Tell me the situation!

156
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,570
<i>The enemy is...</i>

157
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,570
<i>They're... ghouls!</i>

158
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,540
Ghouls!

159
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,920
Goddammit! Why won't they die?!

160
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,130
Goddammit!

161
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,280
Up, up!

162
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,570
Down, down!

163
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,950
Left, right! Left, right!

164
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,500
There's only one invincible
motherfucker and that's me.

165
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,130
I'm getting a fucking hard on!

166
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,030
A ghoul army...?

167
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,240
We need to buy time!

168
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,910
First priority is our evacuation!
Secure a path to the heliport!

169
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,540
What was that sound?!

170
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,660
<i>I'm afraid it was the sound of</i>
<i>the helicopter being destroyed.</i>

171
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,290
They know our every move.

172
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>Sir Integra, we can't hold out!</i>
<i>They are right there!</i>

173
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,880
Security Office, what's going on?

174
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,050
Hey! Hey!

175
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,020
<i>Hello, hello. Can you hear me?</i>

176
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,190
Good afternoon, all of you
at the round table conference.

177
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,650
Can you hear me, little miss Hellsing,
you fucking bitch whore?

178
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,070
We're the Valentine Brothers.

179
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,580
I'm the younger brother, Jan.
Nice to meet you.

180
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,750
We're in the middle
of a late lunch right now.

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,710
Thanks for providing us
with all your people.

182
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,720
The dear members of your force
are going to be turned into our shit.

183
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,390
Now we're coming to kill you.

184
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,140
Have you pissed yourself?
Started saying your prayers?

185
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,530
Are you ready to tremble in
the corner and beg for your lives?

186
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,820
<i>Well, you still might have</i>
<i>time to kill yourselves.</i>

187
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,080
<i>Seriously, take my advice.</i>
<i>Bye now. I love ya!</i>

188
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,000
What's going on, Integra?

189
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,420
Ghouls are targeting headquarters!

190
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,420
The enemy is coming.
It appears we've had a security leak.

191
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,470
Don't be so nonchalant!

192
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,800
Walter, where are you?

193
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,970
I'm in Miss Seras' room in the basement.

194
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,390
I already have a grasp of the situation.

195
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
It'll be four to five hours until
Military Police reinforcements arrive

196
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,400
upon noticing
our disrupted communications.

197
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,240
In the meantime, current forces will
have to defend the conference room.

198
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,570
<i>What should we do?</i>

199
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,950
There's only one way
to the conference room.

200
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,120
Please fortify the entrance.

201
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,620
I propose that we divide
Arucard and Seras into 2 teams.

202
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,500
One team
will provide defense for you there,

203
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,590
the other will go on offense.
How does that sound?

204
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,130
<i>How will you get here?</i>

205
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,260
<i>The passageway is full of ghouls.</i>

206
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>How did you get to Arucard</i>
<i>in the basement 10 years ago?</i>

207
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,220
The ventilation shaft!

208
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,980
Correct. Please wait for a little while.

209
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,020
We'll be there momentarily.
Very well then.

210
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,400
<i>Walter...</i>

211
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,570
They ate my people.

212
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,240
This I will not forgive!

213
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,410
There must not be even one left standing!

214
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,160
Most certainly not, Sir Integra.

215
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,130
Are we about to witness the
return of Walter, Angel of Death?

216
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,300
Um, what are you talking about?

217
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,550
You'll know soon.

218
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,760
An old man and a rookie. Together,
that should count as one, right?

219
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,810
Looks like we can have
a little fun this time.

220
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,400
I wonder if there are any
normal people in this organization.

221
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,750
Stop making such a racket.

222
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,910
What?

223
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,050
Hello, hello. Can you hear me, bro?

224
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,760
It's Jan, commander of
the great Hellsing killer army.

225
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Oh yeah!

226
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,800
We've finished taking
over the first and second floors.

227
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,140
Now all that's left is to crash
the conference on the third floor

228
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,480
and kick the shit out of that
dumb bitch and the old farts.

229
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,110
<i>Proceed accordingly,</i>
<i>and don't let your guard down.</i>

230
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,610
I'm heading for the basement now.

231
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,790
Let's find out what you can do...

232
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,000
Arucard.

233
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,390
What's going on?!

234
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,730
The enemy will be here shortly.

235
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,110
They've taken over the first and
second floors as well as the roof.

236
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
There's no place to escape to anymore.

237
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,570
You're responsible for this!

238
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,490
Sir Penwood!

239
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,990
This is not the time
for that kind of talk.

240
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,250
When it comes down to it,
it's every man for himself.

241
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,790
Isn't that right, Integra?

242
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,090
Yes.

243
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,840
They're ghouls, and they're armed too.

244
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,380
It's no use.

245
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
We're all... We're all going to die!

246
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,560
It's someone's bum!

247
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,740
Are you all right, Miss Seras?

248
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,740
Seras! Walter!

249
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,830
Sorry, we're late.

250
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,240
Oh my...

251
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,500
The defense forces have
been virtually wiped out.

252
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,750
I don't know who thought of
arming and organizing these ghouls...

253
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,130
...but whoever it was certainly
knows what they're doing.

254
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,470
Walter, give it to me straight.

255
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Are we done for?

256
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,770
No. Never!

257
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,190
Compared to what Sir Hellsing
the First faced a century ago,

258
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,230
this wouldn't even be considered a crisis.

259
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,940
We will attack with Arucard
coming from the basement,

260
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,870
and the two of us,
coming from the third floor.

261
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,040
Just as you have ordered...

262
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,370
not a single one of them
will be left standing.

263
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:36,130
Let's teach this young man
just how expensive our tuition is.

264
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,230
They use some pretty fine leaves.
This is what they call bourgeois.

265
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,400
It pisses me off.

266
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,360
It truly pisses me off!

267
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,360
The gap between rich and poor
in England is way too fucking big.

268
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,030
I can't just simply kill that bitch.

269
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,240
She needs a lesson on
blue-collar suffering,

270
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,290
and I'll give it to her, right up her ass.

271
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,300
I know you're there.

272
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,810
Even if you hide,
I still sense your powerful aura.

273
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,890
Even if I hide?

274
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,740
I don't run or hide.

275
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,580
I just got a little tired of waiting.

276
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,880
Nice to meet you, Arucard.

277
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm Luke Valentine.

278
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,300
I'm someone who worships you.

279
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,560
Little miss Hellsing, we're coming now.

280
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,980
I'm going to rape you, and kill you,
and then fuck your dead body again.

281
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,610
We'll kill every one of you,
and then torch the place.

282
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,150
Then I'm gonna go back home,
jerk myself off, and go to bed. Okay?

283
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,170
Did I miss?

284
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,930
Guess I really have lost my touch.

285
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,430
Walter C. Dollneaz.

286
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,390
The Hellsing family's butler.

287
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,810
Formerly in charge of
garbage disposal at Hellsing.

288
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,820
Fire!

289
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,200
They're slow.
Ghouls are ghouls, after all.

290
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,200
A nice idea,
eyeing their stubbornness, but...

291
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,210
they're still a far cry from
being an invincible army.

292
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,170
Have you already pissed yourself?

293
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,010
Are you saying your prayers?

294
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,770
Are you ready to tremble in
the corner and beg for your life?

295
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,020
Well lookie here!

296
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,570
I was just thinking how boring this was.
We were winning so easily!

297
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,910
March!

298
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,550
Miss Seras, commence direct support.

299
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,430
R-Right.

300
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,360
Second round. Fire the
incendiary grenade with VT fuse

301
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,490
into enemy ranks!

302
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,860
R-Right!

303
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,290
You fucking bitch!

304
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,930
Drop dead, old man!

305
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,940
You bastard!

306
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,450
Go to hell!

307
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,660
Are you all right, Walter?

308
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,670
It's not like the old days.

309
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,550
But where did you learn
that submission move?

310
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,720
Well, I am a former police-girl.

311
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,720
You bitch! So you're a vampire, huh?

312
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,640
I didn't hear about someone
like you being in Hellsing.

313
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,480
What the fuck are you doing?!

314
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,440
I'll ask the questions.

315
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,810
What's your objective?

316
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,610
Who's pulling the strings?

317
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,450
Why, I was just passing by.
I don't know a thing.

318
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,780
Forgive me? Guess not.

319
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,870
Young man... Next time it's the left.

320
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,580
We came here to attack...

321
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,750
the Hellsing Special Operations Agency
and the round table conference...

322
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,130
and to destroy Arucard.

323
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,130
That's what we were told to do.

324
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,720
"We"?

325
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,430
Did you say "we"?

326
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,230
Yes, I did.

327
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,230
Right now, my older brother's
beating the shit out of Arucard.

328
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,490
Up until now, I've heard your name

329
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,290
a number of times during
my missions, Arucard.

330
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,370
How absurdly strong you are.

331
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,420
How you can writhe
in an ocean of blood with perfect grace.

332
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,630
How you're a Nightwalker
living outside the world of humanity.

333
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,220
You're purer than the darkness of night.

334
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,140
A pitch-black monster
within pitch-blackness.

335
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,310
And now I know.

336
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,140
All those rumors about you were true.

337
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,980
When I was human, I feared you.

338
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,940
And when I gave up
being human, I admired you.

339
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,410
You are the trailblazer of immortality.

340
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,910
Even after you dissolved into darkness,

341
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,160
I kept on chasing your shadow.

342
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,910
That's rubbish.

343
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,790
There aren't any immortals in this world.

344
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,630
Exactly!

345
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,420
The legend of your immortality ends today.

346
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,930
I will kill you and go beyond my dreams!

347
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,010
I'm not like the other instant vampires!

348
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,980
I'm going to surpass you
and become number one!

349
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,940
I was born for this day.

350
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,690
Check!

351
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,620
What the hell...

352
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,420
is that gun?

353
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,630
Your reflexes are amazing.

354
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,050
I told you! I'm not like the
others that came before me.

355
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,180
I have all of your abilities.

356
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
No! I have that and a lot more!

357
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,940
We were born to kill you.

358
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,520
So hurry up and fucking die.

359
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,280
You're in no position to do anything.

360
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,790
You really are a feeble old man.

361
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,060
All right, time for
the cannibal show to begin!

362
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,720
Go on and stuff yourselves!

363
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,570
What in God's name...?!

364
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,410
The party's just begun.

365
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,870
No!

366
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,760
Welcome to Hellsing.

367
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,820
<i>Good God...</i>

368
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,700
<i>He doesn't even dodge the bullets.</i>

369
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,700
<i>Could he be indestructible?</i>

370
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,330
<i>No, there's no such thing in this world.</i>

371
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,750
<i>Surely he's suffering</i>
<i>more damage than I am.</i>

372
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,000
<i>I can win this!</i>

373
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,210
<i>I can beat this Arucard!</i>

374
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,260
This is great. I haven't
had so much fun in ages.

375
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,430
What's your name again?

376
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,940
Luke... Valentine...

377
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,810
Luke Valentine.

378
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,400
I recognize you are more
than a Category A vampire.

379
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,240
Releasing control-restriction system...

380
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,910
level 3, level 2, and level 1.

381
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,910
Recognizing approval of Situation A
according to Cromwell invocation.

382
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,540
Commencing limited lifting
of ability use restrictions

383
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,050
until enemy before me has
been rendered completely silent.

384
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,060
Well then, time to educate you as to...

385
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,190
how a real vampire fights!

386
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,950
What the...
What the hell are you?!

387
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,530
What's the matter?

388
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,200
You've only had your legs severed so far.

389
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,580
Come on, attack!

390
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,120
Send out your slave demons!

391
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,080
Transform yourself!

392
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,550
Put your legs back together and stand!

393
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,550
The night's only just begun!

394
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,380
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

395
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,050
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

396
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,970
The fun is about to start!

397
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,810
Hurry! Hurry!

398
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,640
You're a monster!

399
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,740
Now I see what you are, you little punk.

400
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,830
You're a failed and worthless creature!

401
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,370
Shut up, you Hellsing-plaything!

402
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,500
You've reduced yourself to becoming
a dog for the Church of England.

403
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,540
You're not fit to...

404
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,170
Quiet!

405
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,090
You're...

406
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,800
dog food.

407
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,440
I guess that's how it ends, punk.

408
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,240
You were shit as a man.

409
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,570
Now you'll become dog shit.

410
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,870
The guy upstairs didn't
seem to amount to much,

411
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,290
but looks like they're having
a harder time of it than I imagined.

412
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,800
My men...!

413
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,680
Even my men have been turned into ghouls!

414
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,470
Seras!

415
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,850
You can stop now. That's enough.

416
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,600
Enough... Please... stop...

417
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,620
Checkmate, sonny boy.

418
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,620
Go ahead and kill me, you old fart.

419
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,160
Not now.

420
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,250
First, I need to know
who put you up to this.

421
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,590
Then I'll kill you
in a most generous manner.

422
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,670
You're too soft, aren't you?

423
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,090
Hey there, bitch!

424
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,220
No more wisecracks. I'm angry.

425
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,360
Who are you people?

426
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,070
Why did you do this? Who led you here?

427
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,990
Answer me!

428
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,040
Answer!

429
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,370
You already know.

430
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,290
It's the device that was embedded in me.

431
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,170
Even now,
it's sending information to them...

432
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,970
about the failed operation,
and even this conversation right now.

433
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,930
You think they'd let me live...

434
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,600
when I'm about to tell
you fucking everything?

435
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,230
See. I knew it!

436
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,940
I will tell you idiots one thing!

437
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,820
Try as much as you can, you bitch!

438
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,200
Mill... en... ni... um...

439
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,420
Millen... nium?

440
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,760
Are you all right, Miss?

441
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,760
Yes, I'm fine.

442
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,430
But please put them
out of their misery, will you?

443
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,930
Yes.

444
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,770
No. You mustn't do that, Walter.

445
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,610
That's the commander's job.

446
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,490
Sir Hellsing, it's your duty.

447
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,240
Sir Islands! That's going too far!

448
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,450
It's unacceptable to say
that nothing could have been done.

449
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,790
You should have been
prepared for this somehow.

450
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,500
You are entirely responsible
since you're the leader.

451
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,920
The fact they died or survived as
these creatures is your fault.

452
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,800
Sir Islands!

453
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,220
Walter.

454
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,280
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

455
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,860
It's all my fault.

456
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,160
Walter, find out about
this "millennium" thing.

457
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,450
Quickly and thoroughly.

458
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,910
Yes. Of course.

459
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,790
We'll have to pay them back
a trillion times to settle this.

460
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,090
Out of the 96 members of
the London Headquarters,

461
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,050
only 10 are left.

462
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,890
And 8 of whom are alive because
they were away from headquarters.

463
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,770
When all is said and done,

464
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,610
the only ones to survive
were you and myself.

465
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,530
What about Seras and Arucard?
Don't they count?

466
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,280
No, since those two are already dead.

467
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,990
Indeed. I see.

468
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,620
What about Millennium?

469
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,630
We asked the British Intelligence Service
and the National Public Safety Commission

470
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,340
to search through the unsorted
book stacks at the British Museum.

471
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,970
However, there's
no information worth looking at.

472
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,890
In America, Japan, and France,

473
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,680
there were seven occult and
military enthusiast associations.

474
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,560
As well as a <i>Star Wars</i>
related club in Los Angeles.

475
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,480
<i>Star Wars</i>?

476
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Millennium Falcon,
the name of Han Solo's ship.

477
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,820
So the bottom line is,
we pretty much have no idea.

478
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
I'm sorry.

479
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,120
Only thing we know for sure is
the meaning of the word itself.

480
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,490
A thousand years.

481
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,040
No, there's another thing.

482
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,000
What?

483
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,130
Don't you remember, Walter?

484
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,550
Millennium Empire.

485
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,890
A group that half a century ago sought
the glory of a 1000-year kingdom...

486
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,390
and plunged the entire world into war.

487
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,940
Hitler. Germany.

488
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,690
Nazis. The Third Reich.

489
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,910
It's all right gentlemen.

490
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,580
Let's resume the experiment.

491
