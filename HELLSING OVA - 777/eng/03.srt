1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,880
Miss.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,050
With regards to recruiting new members
of the Hellsing Organization,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,300
I've decided to hire a group
of professional mercenaries.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,430
Mercenaries? Can we trust them?

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,220
They're only in it for the money.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,140
Yes...

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,100
but these aren't just any mercenaries,
they're true professionals.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,940
As long as they have a contract
and get their money,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,360
the Wild Geese
will never break their word.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,950
That fucking bomb almost killed us!
We're on the same side.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,580
They're incestuous bastards,
that's for sure.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,960
They've probably got 12 younger sisters.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,580
That comes out to two a day,
not including Sundays.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,840
Don't cry, lose your head,
shout or despair.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,460
We're lost numbers.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,680
They never counted us to
begin with. We're disposable.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,050
And if we die, they'll just replace us.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,230
There's no shortage of people
who're willing to kill for money.

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,230
Captain, the Palace has fallen as well.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,810
That was too easy!

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,070
Can't they put up
a little more of a fight?

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,450
That means the civil war is over
and we're out of a job.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,820
I've got a lead.

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,910
Where?

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,910
Not another sand trap I hope.

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,760
You don't have to worry about that.

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,680
This next one is in the city of fog.

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,910
Captain Bernadotte,
what the heck is this?

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,700
Has a war started in London?

30
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,250
Since when did we become security guards?

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,500
Are we just stroking some fat cat's ego?

32
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,670
I can't believe this.

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,210
I don't know how to put this,
so I'll give it to you straight.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,010
We're here to get rid of monsters.

35
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,430
Get rid of monsters?

36
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,090
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,640
It's true.

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,770
Your enemy is a vampire
who gains immortality

39
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,930
by drinking human blood.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,350
Our job is to carry garlic and holy water,

41
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,820
put a wooden stake in its heart,
chop off its head, burn its corpse,

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,610
and sprinkle its ashes at the crossroads.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,070
For more information,
read your Bram Stoker.

44
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,700
That's ridiculous.

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,870
There's no such thing as vampires.

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,080
You just don't know about them.

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,170
Or to be more precise,
you've never been told.

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,090
Formed 100 years ago, our Royal Order
of Religious Knights, Hellsing...

49
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,220
has been working in secret
for a long time

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,010
with the intended purpose
of fighting vampires.

51
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,640
If you still don't get it,
then take a good look for yourselves!

52
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,020
That is your enemy, a vampire.

53
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,440
What?!

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,570
Hold on a sec, you're a vampire?

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,030
Yes, well... I guess I am.

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,670
They're laughing at me, aren't they?

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,340
Then why don't you show
them some proof, Police Girl?

58
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,210
Roger!

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,470
Please, go ahead.

60
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,060
If she's a vampire, then I'm Frankenstein.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,350
SMACK

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,940
Captain!

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,990
She's a monster!

64
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,450
I didn't see it coming, not even a sign!

65
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,990
She just poked me in the forehead
and my whole head's swimming.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Is she really a vampire?

67
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,790
She really is.

68
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,580
She may be the lowest of the lowest rank,

69
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,170
but she's a card-carrying vampire.

70
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,800
What a bunch of lily-livered cowards.

71
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,970
You think we can use these people?

72
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,970
I'm sorry, Miss.

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,470
I tried to stop him, but...

74
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,560
They're going to be guarding my bed.

75
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,350
I wanted to see who they were.

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,530
That aside, Miss...

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,700
We received this in the mail.

78
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,370
A letter?

79
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,450
The head of the Vatican's
Special Operations 13th Division...

80
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,620
Iscariot Organization...

81
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,830
Enrico Maxwell.

82
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,510
What time is it, Walter?

83
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,840
It's just past three o'clock.

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,840
They ask to meet with us
and then show up late.

85
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,890
Are they luring us into a trap?

86
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,140
Not even they would try something
in the middle of the day in public.

87
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,230
Especially when they're in
the very heart of enemy territory.

88
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,400
You really have to come here
in order to appreciate this place.

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,530
They've maintained everything perfectly.

90
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,610
Just as you'd expect of the Royal Museum.

91
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,740
Yes, you're quite right.

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,250
What's this? Are we late?

93
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,920
It would appear so.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,040
Oh, hello. Sorry to keep you...

95
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,130
Don't come any closer!

96
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,420
What business brings the Vatican here?

97
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,100
And not just the Vatican, but its
murderous Iscariot Organization.

98
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,180
Oh, this is no good.
Looks like we're not well-liked here.

99
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,600
First, let me introduce myself.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,940
I'm Iscariot's leader, Enrico Maxwell.

101
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,240
It's an honor to meet you.

102
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,820
I don't care who you are.
Tell me why you're here.

103
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,080
Now, now, there's no reason to get upset.

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,200
We didn't come here today
to fight with you.

105
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,000
You expect me to believe that?!

106
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,960
After you trampled over our agreement...

107
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,420
sending Agent Anderson to
Badrick in Northern Ireland...

108
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,260
where he attacked our agents,
killing two of our men.

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,890
I almost got killed myself.
Don't tell me you've forgotten!

110
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,890
And so what?!

111
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,850
What did you say?

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,560
Don't let my politeness get to your head!

113
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,730
What difference does it make

114
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,110
if two or two million of your
vile Protestant soldiers die!

115
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,900
If his Holiness the Pope
hadn't ordered us himself,

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,700
we wouldn't be here
talking to you filthy creatures.

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,040
So stop your whining and listen,
you Protestant sow!

118
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,910
You called her a sow?

119
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,750
Nothing like the 13th Division
to put the fear of God in you.

120
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,210
Even your insults are despicable.

121
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,500
You've been doing it for 2,000 years now.

122
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,800
Some things never change.

123
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,470
Nosferatu Arucard,
"garbage disposal man"...

124
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,890
"Joker Assassin."

125
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,430
It's the first time I've seen
you with my own eyes.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,730
It's a pleasure to meet you, Arucard.

127
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,810
It's a pleasure to meet you too, Maxwell.

128
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,110
And goodbye.

129
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,650
Did you think you could
call my master a sow...

130
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,360
and leave this place alive?

131
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,910
I'll shoot you dead, human!

132
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,910
Oh no, I'm so scared.

133
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,330
I can't talk with a terrifying bodyguard
pointing a gun at my head.

134
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,880
If that's how you want to play,
I have an idea.

135
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,590
Let's make it an even fight.

136
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,010
Anderson!

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,100
"Ask of me

138
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,180
and I shall give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance

139
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,810
and the uttermost parts of
the earth for thy possession.

140
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,730
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron.

141
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,360
Thou shalt dash them in
pieces like a potter's vessel.

142
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,570
Be wise now therefore...

143
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,070
O ye kings, be instructed,
ye judges of the earth.

144
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,830
Serve the Lord with fear
and rejoice with trembling.

145
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,950
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
and ye perish from the way...

146
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
when his wrath is kindled but a little.

147
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,210
-Don't! Stop it, Anderson!
-Blessed are they...

148
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,090
that put their trust in him."

149
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,550
One swing of my sword
and it'll all be over.

150
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,590
If we ignored an enemy
standing right before our eyes,

151
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,970
we wouldn't be Iscariot or the Vatican.

152
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,110
That's why you're you.
And the same goes for me as well.

153
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,610
Let's do this, Judas Priest!

154
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,570
This time won't be
like the last, vampire!

155
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,580
No! Stop it, Anderson!

156
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,950
Hi! Everybody, this way.

157
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,460
-Right this way, everyone from Japan!
-What's this priest doing with a sword?

158
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,300
That must be an avant-garde type of art.

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,840
Everyone from Japan...

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,550
My granddaughter is a big fan.

161
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,470
Grandpa!

162
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,720
-...this way.
-Grandpa! Grandpa!

163
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,220
This way!

164
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,020
This isn't the time or place to fight.

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,560
Yes, I guess you're right.

166
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,860
I'm going to head back and sleep.
Getting up midday makes me tired.

167
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,490
Chief, I'm going back to Rome.

168
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,450
It's a most excellent museum.

169
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,210
Next time, let's bring the orphans.

170
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,960
Yes, of course.

171
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,630
Next time, I'll kill him.
I swear I'll kill him.

172
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,350
Looks like we both have to contend
with some difficult subordinates.

173
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,100
Isn't that right, you pig?

174
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,520
Well, I'll just have to swallow it.

175
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,110
Shall we go talk at the outdoor cafe?

176
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,110
Very well.

177
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,700
Well done!

178
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,620
Thank you!

179
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,920
We know there's a certain word

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,590
you've been desperately
trying to learn more about.

181
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,670
And so far your search has
been completely fruitless.

182
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,630
You've done your homework.
It's just like you said.

183
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,850
Millennium, right?

184
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,930
This is a so-called
Special Operations matter,

185
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,560
but we do have some information
regarding the name "Millennium."

186
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,400
Do you want to know?
Do you really want to know?

187
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,450
Do you really, really want to know?

188
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,750
Please.

189
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,800
This is Millennium.

190
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,940
Going back 50 years to World War II.

191
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,400
Nazi soldiers fled from defeated
Nazi Germany en masse.

192
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,820
The entire operation began
right before the war ended.

193
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,030
Obviously, if they'd fled
while the war was ongoing,

194
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
they would have been deserters.

195
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,660
And the vast majority of these soldiers
fled to South America,

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,880
where there were a number
of pro-German states.

197
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,510
That's Millennium?

198
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,420
Yes.

199
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,800
The Millennium we know of refers to both

200
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,800
the name of the classified plan
and the military unit...

201
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,430
that carried out
the transportation of people and supplies.

202
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,980
You're wondering how
we know all this, aren't you?

203
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,980
That's right, because we helped them.

204
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,650
The Vatican gave them its full support.

205
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,240
It looks like
they've finally figured it out.

206
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,240
They know about Millennium.

207
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,540
Figured it out?

208
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,250
They still don't know a thing.

209
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,250
You seem to be enjoying this, Major.

210
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,590
Yes, I'm enjoying this.
I'm enjoying this immensely.

211
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,220
It's a struggle. Think about it.

212
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,510
We're going to have
a desperate, bloody struggle.

213
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,890
Isn't this wonderful?
It's a struggle... A struggle.

214
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,020
I assume you've heard?

215
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,530
Yes, I heard.

216
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,490
The Nazis... I can't believe it.

217
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,950
I thought I wouldn't hear
their name again after 50 years.

218
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,950
Is it really that surprising?

219
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,580
I had a feeling they
might be involved in this.

220
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,040
I knew I'd seen
this same dark cloud before.

221
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,540
Really, why's that?

222
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,960
Why? You're asking why, Walter?

223
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,550
The only ones who would use
the undead in actual combat are...

224
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,520
you all, them, and myself.

225
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,020
And their undead research institutes
were completely destroyed 50 years ago.

226
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,780
The two of us killed
every last one of them.

227
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,450
Right. We did, didn't we?
I remember now.

228
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,580
That's why I don't want to grow old.

229
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,000
For us John Bulls, growing old
is one of life's pleasures.

230
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,130
Arucard,
we're flying you to South America.

231
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,550
We're not so kind
as to stay out of the ring

232
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,090
when someone's so clearly picked a fight.

233
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,180
That's what makes you John Bulls.

234
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,810
And it's why you're no longer
the power you once were.

235
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,150
Unless it takes perseverance to
achieve, it's not worth working for.

236
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,740
Arucard, Walter's told you?

237
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,110
Yes.

238
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,490
You have only one order.
Search and destroy. Over.

239
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,500
As you wish, my master.

240
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>A vampire having a glass</i>
<i>of wine in broad daylight</i>

241
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,890
<i>while enjoying a leisurely</i>
<i>trip to South America?</i>

242
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,520
<i>This isn't anything like the legend.</i>

243
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,070
<i>But the legend holds</i>
<i>true on some accounts.</i>

244
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,610
SOB, WEEP, MISERY, PAIN...

245
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,910
Someone please open this thing...

246
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,490
Someone help me!

247
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,170
I reserved a suite.

248
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,970
Yes. Mr. J.H. Blenner.
I have your reservation right here.

249
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,390
We've prepared
the penthouse suite for you.

250
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,430
Over here! Over here!

251
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,560
I'm in the penthouse suite.

252
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,600
Roger.

253
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,770
Hey, over here.
He's in the penthouse.

254
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,700
Excuse me sir, is that your luggage?

255
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,790
Sir, I'm terribly sorry, but...

256
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,290
we don't allow such...

257
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,790
such large personal belongings to be...

258
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,500
Everything's fine.

259
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,840
But it's just that... we...

260
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,180
The size of your luggage... it's too...

261
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,730
Everything's fine.

262
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:39,580
Everything... is... fine...

263
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,120
Everything's fine.

264
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,130
Everything is just fine.

265
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,090
Let's go.
Hurry up and bring my bags.

266
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,970
What the hell was that? Magic?

267
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,010
Or maybe some type of love beam.

268
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,270
This is so unfair!

269
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,480
They put me in a 30 dollars a night motel
and he gets to stay here.

270
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,740
The inequity! Damn you bourgeoisie!

271
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,490
Cheap hotels have their own charm.

272
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,490
Is that right?

273
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,580
Red Glove to White Sock.
The guest has entered the hotel.

274
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,250
I repeat.
The guest has entered the hotel.

275
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,790
All right, we'll start
the investigation tomorrow.

276
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,460
I'll come by for you in the evening.

277
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,680
You vampires prefer
working at night, don't you?

278
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,010
I can hardly wait.

279
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,480
I said I can hardly wait.

280
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,270
I see. There's nothing we can do about it.

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,070
Hellsing and the Vatican
are now in the same boat.

282
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,280
It won't be easy...

283
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,870
cleaning up after the mess
we left 50 years ago.

284
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,910
I'm sorry to always give
you such unpleasant tasks.

285
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,080
Your Holiness,
don't look at it that way.

286
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,630
Please, use Iscariot
in whatever way you like.

287
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,260
And as far as dealing with the sinners,

288
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,050
let's have
them fight it out with one another.

289
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,220
They'll dig their own graves and
conduct their own funerals as well.

290
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,850
<i>Seras, wake up.</i>

291
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,310
Seras.

292
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,320
Who are you?

293
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,030
I am your gun, the spirit of Hallconnen.

294
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,660
No!

295
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,330
No, don't run away. Don't run away.

296
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,630
You've been working hard,
so I've come to give you my support!

297
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,670
Now go ahead and
ask me anything you want.

298
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,920
Don't hold back.

299
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,640
Then, Spirit of Hallconnen,
there is one thing I'd like to ask.

300
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,760
Suffering many misfortunes,
I'm in the most dreadful plight.

301
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,430
Will my life continue to be
plagued by such misfortunes?

302
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,770
Uh-huh.

303
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,980
Wait, Seras! I didn't mean that!

304
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,150
I take it back!

305
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,400
Seras, listen well.
It's not a time to sleep.

306
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,080
Something very dangerous and
bad is about to happen to you.

307
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,200
What do you mean bad?

308
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,700
I mean terrible.

309
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,960
Dangerous?

310
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,500
I mean dangerous.

311
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,880
No!

312
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,170
Wake up.

313
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,340
Good morning.

314
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,550
Get up. There's something
interesting going on.

315
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,020
The lights?

316
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,690
That sounds like a...

317
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,810
What?!

318
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,400
<i>This is NKT Brazil's Julia Eduardo...</i>

319
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,400
-What the...?
-<i>...tensions continue to...</i>

320
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,740
-What the hell's going on?!
-<i>...Hotel Rio de Janeiro.</i>

321
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,410
<i>Just 30 minutes ago,</i>

322
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,080
<i>two armed terrorists killed several</i>
<i>of the hotel's employees and guests.</i>

323
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,910
<i>They are holed up on the top floor...</i>

324
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,330
<i>having taken over</i>
<i>a dozen people hostage.</i>

325
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,130
Yes, regarding that
I will get in touch with them...

326
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,760
No, I don't think that's the case.

327
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,640
You want to go to war that badly?

328
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,390
You warmongers.

329
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,140
<i>Here's the latest on the terrorist</i>
<i>incident at the Hotel Rio...</i>

330
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,110
Let's see you dance, you freaks.

331
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,820
Show me some hell.

332
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,700
It's time for war.

333
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,330
The snipers are in place.

334
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,710
SWAT teams Yanan and Dagaran
are both ready to go.

335
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,170
Send them in!
Commence storming operations!

336
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,750
The two terrorists on
the top floor are heavily armed.

337
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,300
Commence storming operations immediately.

338
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,050
They are to be shot on sight.

339
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,260
I repeat. Do not worry
about apprehending them.

340
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,890
Shoot on sight.

341
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,600
You're okay with that,
right, Mr. Tubalcain?

342
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,810
Good, good, very good.

343
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:22,110
There's nothing more you can do,
if you want to go to paradise.

344
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,070
Dagaran Team, secure the 12th floor!

345
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,320
<i>We're all set. Secure the 12th floor.</i>

346
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>Quito Team, secure elevator floor.</i>

347
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,250
<i>We're all set. Floor secured.</i>

348
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,340
It seems a police SWAT team
has stormed the building.

349
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,420
What's Arucard going to do to them?

350
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,430
To him, they're merely obstacles

351
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,260
standing in the way
of his primary objective.

352
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,350
I think it's pretty obvious what he'll do

353
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,810
to anyone who tries to
oppose him using force.

354
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,900
Even if they're humans?

355
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,610
Even if they're just ordinary humans?

356
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,570
Have you forgotten, Miss?

357
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
He is a certifiable monster.

358
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,780
<i>Rear guard, set to go.</i>

359
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,540
<i>Advance guard,</i>
<i>Team Dei Romeo, storm the floor!</i>

360
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,580
<i>Roger! We're moving in!</i>

361
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,650
You dogs...

362
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,160
I see. You certainly pack a punch.

363
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,080
However...

364
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,210
Dogs can't kill me.

365
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,970
Only humans can kill monsters.

366
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,950
It won't open.

367
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,710
You're a monster!

368
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,630
So I've been told.

369
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,840
And what are you, who stands before me...

370
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,590
a human?

371
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,090
A dog?

372
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,220
A monster?

373
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,280
M-Master...

374
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,200
Seras, prepare for battle.

375
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,910
But...

376
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,990
What's the matter? Get a move on.

377
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,040
But... Master...

378
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,630
They're humans.

379
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,960
So what?

380
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,500
They're humans!

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,380
And so what, Draculina?!

382
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,800
When someone's firing at you,

383
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,350
it doesn't matter whether
they're human or not.

384
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,100
They came here simply
to be killed, slaughtered,

385
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,690
and sent to their graves
where they can rot.

386
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,940
That's all. That's all this is.

387
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,270
There's no getting around it.

388
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,230
It is the one truth
which nobody can deny...

389
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,150
not God, the devil, or you!

390
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,030
But, even so, they...

391
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,040
That's just the way it is.

392
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,330
They...

393
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,170
Master...

394
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,750
Come on, Seras.

395
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,090
Follow me into the darkness,
you little scared cat.

396
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,390
Master...

397
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,100
Yes!

398
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,600
It's a direct line. You think it's...?

399
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,020
Who is it?

400
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,030
<i>It's your servant, Integra.</i>

401
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,950
<i>Give me the order, my Master.</i>

402
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,120
What did you do to
the SWAT team they sent in?

403
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,950
<i>I killed them.</i>

404
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,040
I wiped them out.
There's not one of them left.

405
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,880
Now give me the order, Integra.

406
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,090
The police department's senior levels
are under their control, aren't they?

407
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,130
This siege, they're simply
carrying out their orders.

408
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,600
These people I'm about to kill
may be ordinary humans...

409
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,430
but I can kill them.

410
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,190
I'm ready to strike them down

411
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,440
without hesitation
or the slightest regret.

412
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Why? Because I'm a monster, that's why.

413
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,490
What about you, Integra?

414
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,870
<i>My gun is pointed,</i>
<i>my sights are trained,</i>

415
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,490
<i>my magazine is fully loaded.</i>

416
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,540
<i>I've pulled the slide</i>
<i>and removed the safety.</i>

417
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,500
<i>But...</i>

418
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,290
you have to pull the trigger.

419
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,130
So what are you going to do?

420
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,300
<i>I'm waiting for my order,</i>
<i>Director of Hellsing...</i>

421
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,720
<i>Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing.</i>

422
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,130
Don't underestimate me, foot soldier!
I gave you my order!

423
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,420
Nothing's changed!

424
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,260
Search and destroy!
Search and destroy!

425
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,010
Any force that stands in
your way is to be squashed!

426
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,840
Don't run and hide!

427
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,680
Through the front door
and blow them away!

428
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,810
Crush all opposition!
Reduce them to smithereens!

429
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,350
<i>Roger.</i>

430
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,770
<i>Yes, that's the final fig leaf.</i>

431
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,480
<i>This is wonderful indeed.</i>

432
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,280
<i>You're giving me a hard-on, Integra.</i>

433
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:46,080
In that case, I'll come out swinging.
Watch carefully, Sir Hellsing.

434
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,660
M-Master...

435
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,800
Walter, do you think
I made the right decision?

436
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,470
It's not my place to say
if it's right or wrong.

437
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm merely the butler.

438
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,390
I'm here to serve you, my lordship.

439
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,400
Now, shall I make us some tea?

440
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,650
We do have
some fine quality Ceylon leaves.

441
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,320
<i>Headquarters...</i>
<i>Headquarters...</i>

442
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,030
<i>This is the second wave on the top floor.</i>

443
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,830
<i>Help us! Help!</i>
<i>He's a monster! Damn it!</i>

444
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,450
<i>Headquarters...</i>
<i>Headquarters... Fucking shit!</i>

445
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,500
<i>We're in hell! Goddamn it!</i>

446
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,250
So then, that's it?

447
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
This is nothing.

448
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,550
The bloodbath has just begun.

449
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,470
He's not even close to being finished yet.

450
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,970
In that case, how shall we proceed?

451
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,470
I don't care how many locals die,
but this isn't working.

452
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm not having any fun at all.

453
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,770
What's the point of sprinkling
a watering can over a raging fire?

454
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,530
Give word to Tubalcain Alhambra.
Tell him to prepare for attack.

455
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,530
Remedy the situation
however he sees fit!

456
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,780
Quick! Pull back!
Withdraw! Withdraw!

457
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,030
He's coming! Hurry! Run!

458
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,500
Quick, get in! Come on!

459
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,880
Shut it! Hurry!

460
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,230
You idiot!

461
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,740
What are you doing?!

462
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,410
Shut it! Hurry!

463
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,010
Open sesame.

464
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,350
Mission accomplished, soldiers.

465
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,020
Now goodbye.

466
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,800
It's been five minutes
since the SWAT team went in.

467
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,680
The situation inside is unclear.

468
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,930
Roll camera!

469
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,930
What a most splendid declaration of war.

470
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,050
I love this.

471
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,560
It's war. We can go back to war now!

472
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,680
Look at him.

473
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,980
He's so hideous,
it makes my spine tingle.

474
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,270
That's what we want.

475
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,860
Someone who dances
between life and death,

476
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,190
who bridges the gap
between sanity and madness.

477
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,530
He looks as spirited as ever.

478
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,660
He's evil like us,
this visitor from the night,

479
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,200
this undead comrade.

480
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,960
My fellow soldier, my noble vampire.

481
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,340
Oh, I can hear the symphony of war.

482
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,470
I haven't heard that sound in a while,
the chorus of the fiery pits of hell.

483
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,640
Oh my, your table manners
are absolutely exquisite.

484
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,230
You certainly live up to
your reputation, Arucard.

485
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,230
My name is Tubalcain Alhambra.

486
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,570
My friends call me the Dandy Man.

487
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,110
Are you the one who
sent in those poor souls?

488
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,700
Oh, you mean those
unfortunate men up there?

489
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,580
Their superiors were idiots,
that's why they ended up that way.

490
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,000
Even if all their troops are killed,

491
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,500
these people want to become immortal.

492
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,630
They're hopeless idiots.

493
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,930
There's no such thing as immortality.

494
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,970
Those poor souls did
help me in some small way.

495
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,350
How many of those prized shells
do you have left, Arucard?

496
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,770
I don't need the song and dance.
What are you going to do, Dandy Man?

497
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,900
We're taking your life.

498
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,700
You'll become
just another worthless sample.

499
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,790
That's right. Us, Millennium's.

500
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,550
I see.

501
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,050
There's absolutely no helping you people.

502
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:21,640
Which is why it makes perfect
sense for me to fight you.

503
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,560
Didn't you learn anything from
the first time we destroyed you?

504
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,720
You're trapped.

505
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,990
You can't get away.

506
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,990
Arucard the vampire, you're nothing.

507
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,830
Tubalcain is fighting him.

508
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,960
If anything happens to him, they won't
be able to hold their end of the bargain.

509
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,880
According to our reports...

510
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,580
I still haven't quite earned my pay.

511
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,830
Well, shall I go get the chopper?

512
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,580
I can't stop the bleeding.

513
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,800
Those cards
and his powers are impressive.

514
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,590
Amusing. Very amusing.

515
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,140
They're quite amusing, these people.

516
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,310
Say there...

517
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,140
Are you ready then, Arucard?

518
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,520
Now go back
to that lovely home of yours

519
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,400
in the lowest pit of hell.

520
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,530
What's so funny?

521
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,610
I'm just so happy that...

522
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,040
there are still people in
this world as stupid as you.

523
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,500
Millennium?

524
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,920
The Last Battalion?

525
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,670
That's right.

526
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:01,010
It's the crazy Major and
his cold-blooded <i>Kampfgruppe</i>.

527
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:04,800
The world is still ripe with madness.

528
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,890
Come on, sing and dance, Alhambra!

529
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,810
Let's hear you squeal like a pig!

530
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Squeal? Me?

531
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,940
You still don't get it, do you?

532
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,280
If only the world were as
simple as you think, Arucard.

533
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,940
You really have gone soft
in the head, haven't you?

534
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,870
Trying to run and hide again?
It's no use.

535
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,760
You little bitch!

536
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,930
Don't fuck with me!

537
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,150
Who do you think you are?

538
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,140
Squeal like a pig!

539
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,000
Checkmate, Tubalcain.

540
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,840
Now, allow me to keep my promise.

541
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,970
Permit me to fulfill my duty.

542
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,930
I want you to tell me everything.

543
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,060
Yes, let your blood do the talking.

544
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,940
<i>So it's war?</i>

545
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,530
<i>That's right, it's war.</i>

546
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,450
<i>A huge war without any</i>
<i>distractions or interruptions.</i>

547
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,840
Master! Master!

548
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,840
This is...

549
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,310
Master...

550
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,860
Master...

551
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,540
Arucard, Seras!
I'm here to pick you up!

552
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,170
We kill our enemies.
We kill our allies.

553
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,050
We kill the people
we're supposed to protect

554
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,550
and lay waste to the countries
we're supposed to govern.

555
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,510
We even kill ourselves
and it's still not enough.

556
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,220
We're incorrigible warmongers,
you and me, Major.

557
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,900
Hurry up. Or rather, <i>please</i> hurry up!

558
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,820
That Alhambra looks like
an old rag, doesn't he?

559
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,280
He really is strong, isn't he?

560
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,620
Outrageously strong!
Stronger than any of us imagined!

561
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,960
I-I'm sorry.

562
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,210
I assume this means that
we still have more work to do...

563
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,250
No! Don't be ridiculous.

564
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,720
Rather, I'd say we're on
the verge of a huge success.

565
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,970
The things we've learned here today
will serve us well against Arucard.

566
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,220
We've gained a means to
a most extraordinary being, a Midian.

567
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,980
Not a person anymore, a Midian.

568
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,690
That is to say, our 50 years of
hard work are about to pay off.

569
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,650
We will build monsters,
turn them into soldiers,

570
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,280
organize them, train them,

571
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,490
supply them, militarize them,

572
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,160
and command them.

573
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,540
We are the <i>Letzte Bataillon</i>,
the Last Battalion!

574
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,870
Magnificent! Grand Professor!

575
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,380
I am most grateful.

576
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,540
Well then, gentleman!

577
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,800
This most delightful show
draws to a close for now.

578
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,470
It's about time we headed back to
our beloved home, don't you think?

579
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,100
Captain, we're ready to turn around.

580
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,270
Hurry. We've kept the old folks at
the opera house waiting long enough.

581
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,780
We need to get there
as fast as possible...

582
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,740
since I'm sure they're
about to explode with anger.

583
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,080
I see. This is serious indeed.

584
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,330
I'll fly her at full tilt, Major.

585
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,330
Prepare for starboard turn.
Engage the flaps!

586
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,290
Confirming. All flaps engaged!
Height is good.

587
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,170
-Starboard 20!
-Starboard 20!

588
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,220
Destination, Jaburo, Panterschanze.

589
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,430
We're coming, you old timers.

590
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,180
I don't give a damn how many
hundreds or thousands

591
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,100
or millions or billions
of people try to stop me.

592
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,110
No!

593
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,320
All those who stand
in my way will be killed.

594
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,570
<i>Welcome to this crazy time</i>

595
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,500
<i>You have arrived in the era of madness</i>

596
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,830
