1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,420
<i>Arucard...</i>

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,260
<i>Wake up, Arucard...</i>

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,930
Who are you?

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,940
I am the essence of your gun,
Jackal Willis.

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,280
S-Stop! Stop that Willis!

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Listen to me!
Please, hear me out Willis!

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,590
Where is this place? I'm leaving.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,090
This is my space.

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,050
This is Willispace Willis.

10
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,180
You can no longer leave this place Willis.

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,270
For the rest of your life,
you will remain here Willis,

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,850
appearing in odd productions,

13
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,600
whether entertaining
or not, I cannot tell Willis.

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,360
Also, my mass is not 10 kilograms...

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,360
...from now on, it's 16 kilograms,
if you please Willis.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,360
What?

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,740
You're going to run pell-mell with
me through the Nakatomi Building,

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,040
help me rescue a chunky
gangster with a samurai sword

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,170
getting ass-raped and
voiced by Tessho Genda,

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,880
and blow up a meteor
together with Steve Buscemi,

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,420
sweeping the Golden
Raspberry awards Willis.

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,220
Also, we're going to
get jerked around by a kid

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,970
with a long name who can see ghosts,

24
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,890
roll our taxi to catch Milla Jovovich...

25
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,230
He was an imposter.
That sure was a close call.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,900
You always have to be on guard
against sneak attacks and betrayal.

27
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,400
You should pick your own
weapons as much as you can.

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,410
Now then, it's time to wake up.
Seras and Integra are waiting.

29
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,910
Ah! There you are, General de Gaulle!

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,580
What?

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,340
Damn, I missed.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,170
Hello, I'm Christopher Walken.

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,590
I'm Tom Berenger.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,390
Together, we are the Dogs of War.

35
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,930
Get out.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm Maximillian Schell.
I say kill them all.

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,190
Get out!

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,650
Hello, I am the Emperor.

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,270
Who are you?

40
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,610
Hello. I am the Fourth Protocol.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,450
That makes no sense.

42
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,660
Hello, I am the Negotiator.

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,330
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

44
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,910
At last the sea lion has crossed
the ocean and climbs up upon the land.

45
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,880
General! Communications with the

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,220
Central Intelligence Command
Center has been cut off!

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,050
I cannot reach them!

48
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,340
What?!

49
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,640
We've lost contact with the
London BTN control station, as well.

50
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,770
We're also cut off from
civilian communications

51
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,730
and phone lines in the
metropolitan area.

52
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,060
There's no contact
from Ark Air Force Base!

53
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,360
We're cut off from the Atlantic
Fleet and from Fleet Command.

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,740
No contact with National Defense
or Defense Intelligence Headquarters.

55
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,740
General, we've received word
that a civilian craft has spotted

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,910
airships moving north
over Newfields, south of London.

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,750
Airships? Did you say airships?

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,630
Impossible. Are you telling me
that they're starting a war?

59
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,630
That's exactly right.

60
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,880
Integra...

61
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,640
A war has begun.

62
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,000
Maximum speed! Onward!

63
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,670
Faster! Faster, faster!

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,670
Rev the engines until they burn out!

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,300
Faster! Faster!

66
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,060
Flat-out! Flat-out!

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,150
Run flat-out toward the spires
of the city dimly seen ahead!

68
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,150
Flat-out! Flat-out!

69
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,990
Run flat-out toward
the clamor of the great strike,

70
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,700
still in our memories!

71
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,380
Hey, hold on a minute, now...

72
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Bugger off, will you?

73
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,220
Stuff it! Listen, you...

74
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,470
Hey, Jansen, say something, will you?

75
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,350
The moon...

76
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,520
The moon...!

77
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,040
That's awesome!

78
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,520
All battalion members, <i>achtung</i>!

79
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,020
Gentlemen, night has come.

80
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,860
You who are invincible
remnants of the last army,

81
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,280
and long-serving recruits,

82
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,280
the night of the fulfillment
of your vows has arrived.

83
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,280
Welcome to the eve of war!

84
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,300
All right then, everyone,
please have a look at your handbooks.

85
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,350
On page three of <i>Operation</i>
<i>Sea Lion, Second British Landing,</i>

86
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,900
please look at the heading
"London Explodes! Crack Battle Vampires."

87
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,150
Huh?

88
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,660
Uh-oh...

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,410
Oh, dear, what is it, Schrödinger?

90
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,660
Doc, I'm sorry, I forgot my handbook.

91
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,090
My word. What are we to do with you?

92
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,760
Look on with the captain.

93
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,180
Zorin... Lieutenant Zorin Blitz...

94
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,180
As you command.

95
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,150
Our objective is to bring
down Hellsing, and Arucard.

96
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,150
The men under your command
will be the vanguard unit.

97
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,120
Take Zeppelin 2 and rush
over to Hellsing headquarters.

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,530
Acknowledged.

99
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,200
But do avoid anything too drastic.

100
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,620
Wait for the arrival of
myself and the main force.

101
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,670
There should be no great bother.

102
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,420
Hellsing will be as helpless
as babies without Arucard.

103
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,260
Do not take the women too lightly.

104
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,430
Do not take Integra Hellsing
and Seras Victoria too lightly.

105
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,940
Integral Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing...

106
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,360
She is the Hellsing's scion.

107
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,690
The current head of the greatest
family of vampire hunters in history.

108
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,490
She is the one that Arucard
recognizes as being his master.

109
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,950
Then there is the policewoman,

110
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,540
the vampire Seras Victoria. She is...

111
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,010
something of a miracle.
You might also say something of a joke.

112
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,050
This is something that not even
she herself may be aware of.

113
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,180
And that makes it all the
more entertaining, does it not?

114
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,850
They are both terribly
inexperienced and imperfect,

115
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,480
and as a result, I would
argue that like Arucard,

116
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,070
they are worthy of
being called an archenemy.

117
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,030
Zorin, I will say this again.
Do not do anything too drastic.

118
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,070
Wait for my arrival.

119
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,950
Acknowledged, Battalion Commander.

120
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,540
Very well. Then let loose the floodgates.

121
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,460
Let loose the floodgates
of the dark waters of war!

122
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,550
Our first objective is
the entire London area.

123
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,260
The west bank of the Thames,
the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben,

124
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,880
the Office of the Prime Minister,
the Ministry of Defense,

125
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,760
Buckingham Palace,
Scotland Yard, Westminster Abbey,

126
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,730
Piccadilly Circus, Soho, the City,
Southwark. Burn it all down!

127
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,730
The central government houses,
St. Paul's Cathedral!

128
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,980
Major, what about the Cabinet War Rooms?

129
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,400
Blow them up, of course.

130
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,320
They're repulsive.
Don't leave a single fragment remaining.

131
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,370
What shall we do about
Trafalgar Square, Major?

132
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,660
Burn it. Bring down the statue of Nelson.

133
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,170
The Tower of London,
the British Museum, the British Library.

134
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,840
Destroy them all. They're repulsive.

135
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,710
What about Tower Bridge?

136
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,470
Bring it down.
London Bridge, too. Like the song.

137
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,600
And the Imperial War Museum?

138
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,100
Blow it up.

139
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,480
Destroy everything that you see,

140
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,310
and devour everyone that you see.

141
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,320
Eat and drink to your heart's content.

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,990
This imperial capital of eight million
will be reduced to your supper.

143
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,080
Come, gentlemen,
let us kill, and be killed.

144
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,080
Let us die, and give death.

145
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,880
Now, let us have a toast.

146
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,590
As of tonight, from this moment,
the banquet at last begins.

147
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,900
What are those?

148
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,310
Is this a movie, or something?

149
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,230
Take a picture, quick!

150
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,540
<i>Prosit</i>!

151
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,370
<i>Prosit</i>!

152
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,470
More.

153
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,970
Ready the next salvo of retrofitted V1s!

154
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,720
Prepare to drop the Waffen-SS!

155
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,100
Sir!

156
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,360
All retrofitted V1s fired!

157
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,490
The result is a crippling blow!
Crippling! Crippling!

158
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,620
Not yet.

159
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,450
More.

160
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,170
More fruits of battle!
More fruits of battle!

161
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,880
Beautiful.

162
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,090
Like hell shining.

163
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,970
We are monsters. Down there
is the only place we can live.

164
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,810
Down there
is the only place we want to go.

165
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,350
<i>Commence ground combat operations.</i>
<i>Deploy paratroopers!</i>

166
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,360
Here we go, frontline swine! Off to war!

167
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,540
Fünf<i>...</i>

168
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,540
Vier<i>... </i>Drei<i>...</i>

169
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,790
Zwei<i>...</i>

170
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,080
Eins<i>...</i>

171
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,650
Huh? Who are you?!

172
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,170
Please do not try
anything funny, Sir Hellsing.

173
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,800
As of now, this facility is under
the control of Millennium.

174
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,180
Lt. Colonel, what is the meaning of this?

175
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,100
Shut up!
<i>This </i>is the meaning of this, General.

176
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,190
It's great to be a vampire.

177
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:07,900
How lucky I am, to be able to
capture Sir Hellsing here like this.

178
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,910
What's so funny?!

179
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,910
Your joke is laughable.
You're all such newborn vampires,

180
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,870
while we're the institution
of your annihilation.

181
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,290
To think that baby frogs
who still have their tails

182
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,420
would face a snake,
and call themselves lucky...

183
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,220
D-Damn you...!

184
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,010
You can claim your Iron Cross
from your corporal in the next life.

185
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,260
Bitch!

186
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,690
Walter, to work.

187
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,940
As you wish, Madam.

188
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,450
Now then, I shall take
you to task, youngsters.

189
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,030
You old geezer!

190
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Begging your pardon.

191
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,650
Traitors.

192
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,570
Are you all right, Sir Penwood?

193
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,570
Huh? Yeah...

194
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,910
I was convinced that you had betrayed us.

195
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,460
I may be powerless against them,
but I am not a coward.

196
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,800
The entire city is under attack!

197
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,840
We cannot reach the Chiefs of Staff!

198
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,760
We've lost contact with roughly
150 primary military installations

199
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,770
and command centers throughout Britain!

200
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,270
Either that, or they're engaging
an unidentified enemy force!

201
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,190
The same as this bunch.

202
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,490
This place is sure to be
one of their targets of attack.

203
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,490
We should flee at once, Sir Penwood.

204
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,500
German soldiers are
dropping from the airships!

205
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,380
It's the Waffen-SS!

206
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,790
What?!

207
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,800
Sir Penwood, we must flee.

208
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,300
A horde of vampires will be
sweeping in at any moment.

209
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,310
You... You return to your
organization as quickly as possible.

210
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,310
You have a task
that only you can carry out.

211
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,070
I-I cannot run.
That's the last thing I can do.

212
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,570
This place has very little
ability to command remaining.

213
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,450
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

214
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,080
It's possible that
communications may be restored,

215
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,580
and we may be able to issue orders again.

216
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,710
There may be a base somewhere,

217
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,460
fighting off the enemy,
waiting for orders to come from us.

218
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:20,390
I-I am the commanding officer here.
I cannot very well leave.

219
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,810
I am a powerless man. A nervous Nellie.

220
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,020
A man so hopeless,

221
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,980
not even I understand what
I am doing in a position like this.

222
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,900
I'm someone who has
lived off of my family name,

223
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,320
who has
never had to struggle for anything.

224
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,370
I have always had my positions
and tasks handed to me.

225
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,490
Which is why I think that I must
at least accomplish my task...

226
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,920
this task which I have been given.

227
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,460
Go on. Off you go, Integra.

228
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:59,720
You have... Hellsing has a task
that only Hellsing can carry out.

229
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,480
It is loaded with blessed
atomized silver tip rounds.

230
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,020
They should be more effective
against them than ordinary iron.

231
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,030
Farewell, and good hunting, Sir Penwood.

232
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,660
Yes. You, too, Sir Hellsing.

233
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,500
The rest of you,
hurry and get out of here.

234
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,460
We only need a minimum of personnel here.

235
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,250
In fact, now, you know, in all candor,

236
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,800
I may be enough on my own.

237
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,510
All of you, get out of here. Quickly.

238
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,020
W-What? What's so funny?!
Hurry up and run away! That's an order!

239
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,570
I will try once again to
reach National Defense.

240
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,030
Start finding us a line.

241
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,780
Gather ammunition and weapons!
Form a garrison. Hop to!

242
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,700
Sir!

243
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,160
Hey, hold on, now...

244
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,750
Set up barriers
at all the entrances. Hurry!

245
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,420
What did I say to you, you fools?!

246
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,260
There's no need to
accompany me during this!

247
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,550
What are you talking about, Admiral?

248
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,560
You can't work a single
console here, can you?

249
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,430
Please, sit where you always do, sir.

250
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,310
You'll get in the way of our work.

251
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,910
Thank you, men. Thank you.

252
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,210
Reassessing damage reports.

253
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,840
Form ranks, and go make
direct contact, even if it's on foot!

254
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,600
Open up a line to our
foreign branches, as well!

255
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,850
I want more intelligence!

256
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,990
We're leaving, Walter.
As soon as possible.

257
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,990
As you wish.

258
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,330
We'll charge through the city.
You can do that, right?

259
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,490
As you command.

260
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,660
I will accomplish my task.

261
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,250
As a Hellsing, I swear it...

262
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
you miserable vampires!

263
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,380
Damn it! Damn it!

264
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,420
Damn it!

265
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,390
Damn! Damn! Damn!

266
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,510
Cruising for girls, in this sea of flame?

267
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,180
It's abysmal. A hell on earth.

268
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,440
But it's no more than
a shadow of things to come.

269
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,160
Well done.

270
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,160
You have fulfilled your duty.

271
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,040
Now rest.

272
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,380
Hurry, Walter. We're taking vengeance.

273
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,430
Integra Hellsing spotted.

274
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,060
She is traveling at high
speed along Regent Street

275
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,940
toward Hellsing Manor.

276
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,610
Capture her.

277
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,320
Capture her!

278
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,830
<i>Calling all soldiers...</i>
<i>Calling all soldiers...</i>

279
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,170
<i>This is Vice Admiral Penwood,</i>

280
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,380
<i>British Security Special Command Center.</i>

281
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,760
<i>I am transmitting in the hopes</i>
<i>of reaching someone out there.</i>

282
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,110
<i>This facility will soon fall.</i>

283
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,990
<i>The monsters are almost upon</i>
<i>the other side of our doors.</i>

284
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,990
I now deliver the final
orders from this facility

285
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,290
to whomever is
listening to this transmission.

286
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,620
Resist, and fulfill your duty.

287
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,910
The new head of the family?

288
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,580
You?

289
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,620
Walter, this girl?

290
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,630
"This girl"?
What a thing to say, Sir Penwood.

291
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,630
Or, er, um...

292
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,300
I am the family head, Integral Hellsing.

293
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,390
I have killed my uncle,
and taken my place as family head.

294
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,100
I would like you to stop
referring to me as "this girl."

295
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,060
M-My apologies. I am sorry.

296
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,700
My father, while he was alive,
told me that if I needed anything,

297
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,240
I was to ask Mr. Penwood.

298
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,950
Y-Yes! Arthur! Whenever anything
came up, he would always say,

299
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,660
"Give me some newer model guns!"
or "I need a helicopter."

300
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,670
Always with the impossible demands.
My goodness gracious!

301
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,250
Not to be outdone by my father,

302
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,920
I, too, believe I will have many requests.

303
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,180
I thank you in advance.

304
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,200
You put up a good stand,
you good-for-nothings.

305
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,960
What's so funny, human?

306
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,970
Good for nothing? From you,
who are good for even less than I am?

307
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,480
Farewell, Integra.
I enjoyed our time together.

308
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,610
S-Stop!

309
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,990
No way!

310
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,950
I cannot honor that request.

311
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,880
Walter...

312
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,300
Yes?

313
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,430
Hurry!

314
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,620
What is it?

315
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,670
Miss Integra,
please back the car up at once,

316
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,970
and find another escape route.

317
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,590
Walter...

318
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,770
As fast as you can. As fast as you can!

319
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:01,440
Do not turn back for me. No matter
what happens, run as fast as you can.

320
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,940
Walter...

321
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,360
The way I am now,

322
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,120
I do not know how long I can
hold out against that fellow there.

323
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,880
Walter...

324
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,220
I order you to come
back alive, no matter what!

325
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,810
As you command.

326
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,810
I knew it.

327
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,650
I knew it was you.

328
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,990
<i>That is correct, young man.</i>

329
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>Long time no see, huh, butler?</i>
<i>55 years, isn't it?</i>

330
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:47,210
I must say, you always...
<i>Always </i>show up to bother me

331
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,750
when it is dinnertime.

332
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,760
Integra Hellsing is on the move.

333
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,760
She has altered her route,
and is moving at high speed.

334
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:04,020
Attention, all available squads!
Go after her! Go after her!

335
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,020
Integra Hellsing is by herself. Repeat...

336
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,530
Go after her! Capture her!

337
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,570
Capture her! Capture her!

338
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,800
There she is!

339
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,570
<i>Panzerfaust</i>!<i> Zielen</i>...

340
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,700
<i>Feuern</i>!

341
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,010
Integra Hellsing!

342
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,430
By order of the battalion
commander, say your prayers!

343
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,160
Hmph, you don't know
when to give up, fräulein<i>.</i>

344
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,540
No matter how hard you struggle
or try to escape, it's hopeless.

345
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:50,040
Give up. There is no longer
any place here in London,

346
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,050
here in Midian, where you can
run or hide. Give up, human.

347
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,550
Run? Hide?

348
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,300
Hopeless?

349
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,560
Give up?

350
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,220
Give up, you say?

351
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,810
Indeed, that does sound
like something you would say.

352
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:18,240
You, who could not bear to remain human.

353
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,910
Well don't go selling us
humans short, you monsters.

354
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,120
Come on! I'll fight you!

355
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,540
Fine by me!

356
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,170
W-Whad id did...?

357
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,970
M-My body id cubbing abard...

358
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,230
B-Bayonets!

359
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,740
It's you...! From the
Vatican's Iscariot, Section XIII...

360
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,120
The Assassin, the Guillotine Judge...

361
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,370
The Regenerator, Angel Dust...

362
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,330
The Bayonet Father...

363
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,840
Alexander Anderson!

364
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,350
Facing down a horde of monsters
while sporting a bloody nose?!

365
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,230
"Come on"?! "I'll fight you"?!

366
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,860
Did you hear that, Heinkel?

367
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,700
Did you hear that, Yumie?

368
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,910
There's no doubt about it.

369
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,750
This is... This woman is...
These people are...

370
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,170
our sworn enemies!

371
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,880
Our archenemies!

372
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,970
Father Anderson, the orders
we have received at this juncture

373
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,390
were to just observe.

374
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,220
Moreover, rescuing Hellsing there

375
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,140
is a serious breach of orders, is it not?

376
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,150
So what am I to do,
stand here and do nothing?

377
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,690
<i>We </i>are to be the ones who crush them!

378
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,650
<i>We </i>are the only ones who <i>may </i>crush them!

379
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,160
No one else may have them!
No one else may interfere!

380
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,160
No one else! No one else!

381
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,210
You're with Iscariot.

382
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,750
You won't stand in our way!

383
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,500
Hold your tongue.
The dead do not speak!

384
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,680
Do the dead walk before my eyes?

385
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,390
Will the undead raise an army,
fall in, and advance?

386
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,730
Those who abandon the natural order,
embrace a heretical order,

387
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,560
and propose to pass by
here would presume that we...

388
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,860
That Iscariot...

389
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,690
...that <i>I w</i>ould allow it to happen?!

390
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,240
You will die, not trembling
before me, but as straw before me!

391
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,210
Amen!

392
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,510
I ask of you, who are ye?!

393
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,890
We are Iscariot! We are Judas of Iscariot!

394
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:33,390
Then, Iscariot, I ask of you,

395
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,560
what have ye in your right hand?!

396
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,150
Daggers and poison!

397
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,900
Then, Iscariot, I ask of you,

398
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,400
what have ye in your left hand?!

399
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,110
30 pieces of silver and straw rope!

400
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,370
Then...!

401
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,790
Iscariot, what are ye?!

402
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,050
We are apostles, yet not apostles!

403
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,300
We are believers, yet not believers!

404
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,130
We are adherents, yet not adherents!

405
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,300
We are heretics, yet not heretics!

406
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,600
We are those who do
naught but submit to death,

407
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,850
who merely bow our heads,
begging the Lord for forgiveness,

408
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,230
who merely bow our heads,
striking down the enemies of the Lord!

409
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,780
Lowly soldiers of death,
brandishing daggers in the night,

410
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,780
and administering poison as supper!

411
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,160
We are apostles, a flock
of apostles, we are assassins,

412
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,330
we are Judas of Iscariot.
At the appointed hour,

413
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,540
we cast our 30 pieces
of silver to the holy place,

414
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,670
and with our straw rope,
we hang ourselves about the neck!

415
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,810
Thus do we desire to
descend into hell en masse,

416
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,930
form ranks in squared formation,

417
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,480
and engage...

418
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,320
the 7,405,926 demons of hell!

419
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,850
My nemesis...

420
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,980
My master...

421
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,860
I am drawn to you...

422
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,080
and I shall continue my dream, as well.

423
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,640
Onward, to the battlefield!
