1
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,100
Where? Where are you?

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,770
Pretty, pretty niece.

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,350
My pretty niece.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,900
My pretty fr채ulein.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Budding flower and successor to
the Royal Order of Religious Knights,

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,400
Hellsing Organization,

7
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,410
Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,410
Integra, you don't understand a thing.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,540
I waited 20 years for my
brother, no, your father to die.

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,050
But then at the hour of his death,
he made you head of the family and died,

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,180
leaving a will which I cannot accept.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,470
He shouldn't have done that.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,890
It was an unforgivable act.

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,100
Hellsing is mine!

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>Integra...</i>

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,860
If it should ever come to it...

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,610
If the situation is critical...

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,860
If you've been cornered by the enemy
and there's nothing else you can do,

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,280
go to the long forgotten jail
in the basement.

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,710
One of the legacies of
our Hellsing family is there.

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,420
A means for your protection.

22
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,560
This is the means for my protection.

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,860
I've found you, fr채ulein.

24
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,750
Uncle...

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,830
That's right, fr채ulein.

26
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,010
You want the Hellsing family so badly that
you'd be willing to go so far as to...

27
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,930
Right once again, fr채ulein.

28
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,710
The dead body...! It's...!

29
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
Bastards!

30
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,320
What's that? What did you just say?

31
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,660
Please, I'd appreciate it if
you tell us one more time...

32
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,670
Director of Hellsing...

33
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,380
Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing.

34
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,670
Very well, I'll tell you once more.

35
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,390
They're ghouls. The village
has become a ghoul den.

36
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,890
Ghouls are what becomes of non-virgin
humans who've been attacked by vampires.

37
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,770
They're much like zombies
controlled by vampires.

38
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,240
Which means
there's a vampire in the village.

39
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,530
Ghouls, vampires...?

40
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,910
That's ridiculous! You expect me
to believe an occult story like that?

41
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,210
Petty officials like you don't know,
and don't need to know.

42
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
But our Royal Order of Religious Knights,
better known as the Hellsing Organization,

43
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,590
has been fighting these
monsters for a very long time.

44
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,220
It's only natural you don't know as we're
a special operations agency organized

45
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,400
for the purpose of eradicating
the satanic monsters that wish to harm

46
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,360
our British Empire and Protestant Church.

47
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,660
There's a vampire in the village
that's controlling the ghouls.

48
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,120
The adversary is a monster.

49
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,200
Send in all the regular
troops and police you want...

50
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,790
You're just providing them with more food.

51
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,380
Only when a Dracula sucks the blood
of a female-virgin,

52
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,920
or a Draculina sucks the blood
of a male-virgin,

53
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,720
do the vampires breed new vampires.

54
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,050
Otherwise, people are no more than food.

55
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,060
They turn into ghouls and
become the vampire's servants.

56
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,940
I've lost the signal from
Search Party Squads 2 and 3.

57
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
What?

58
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,940
What's going on? Answer! Answer! Hey!

59
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,950
In order to keep the ghouls
from further multiplying,

60
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,450
you need to terminate
the leader vampire itself.

61
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,210
That's where we come in.

62
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,880
Hellsing will take care of the vampire.

63
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,670
You can't be serious.

64
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,420
One of our top anti-vampire
experts is already on his way

65
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,720
to the town of Cheddar.

66
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,310
The issue will be settled in
a matter of hours.

67
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,060
Who the hell is he?

68
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,810
When it comes to monsters...

69
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,320
especially vampires...

70
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,070
he's the greatest expert there is.

71
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,120
It's a great night.

72
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,080
The kind of night that
makes me want to drink blood.

73
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,630
Ah, the quiet...
It really is a great evening.

74
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,450
There's no use running.

75
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,800
No use firing your gun either.

76
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,260
Eddie...

77
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,430
Simon...

78
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,440
That's right. Your partners are mine now.

79
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,060
I'm going to make you
one of mine as well.

80
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,200
What I want is a loyal slave.

81
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't want to create some
Draculina with her own free will.

82
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,710
Girls your age aren't usually
virgins nowadays, but...

83
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,710
I'm still going to rape you.

84
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,300
Then I'll take my
time as I suck your blood.

85
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,710
I'll have you join the other ghouls.

86
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,220
I'm going to make you my slave.

87
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,110
Who the hell are you?

88
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,740
A professional killer.

89
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,990
A professional killer?

90
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,830
You're a professional killer?
You can't be serious.

91
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,750
Have you lost your mind?

92
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,630
Kill him.

93
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,790
Are you dead already,
professional killer?

94
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,400
He's a vampire?

95
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,740
That's right.

96
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,990
Humans don't make very
reliable anti-vampire experts.

97
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,500
They injure quickly.

98
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,580
They die quickly.

99
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,120
Even their spirits are weak.

100
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,460
The most efficient way
to destroy a vampire

101
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,130
is with another vampire.

102
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:26,140
And the domesticated vampire
at the Hellsing Organization...

103
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,640
is first class, even amongst them.

104
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,620
How can he kill them like that?

105
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,120
Those bullets...

106
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,250
They're exploding 13mm shells
made out of a melted down

107
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,380
silver cross from Lanchester Cathedral.

108
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,640
They'll kill any freak they hit.

109
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,100
Why...? Why?!

110
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,940
Why would a fellow vampire
side with the humans?

111
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,530
Don't move, professional killer!

112
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,490
She's the only survivor.
Don't you want to let her live?

113
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,950
Come on, it's no big deal.

114
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,830
Help me escape.

115
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,920
Or at least look the other way.

116
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,710
Young lady, are you a virgin?

117
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,510
What are you talking about?!

118
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,050
I'm asking if you're a virgin.

119
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,180
You swine!

120
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,300
Answer!

121
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,310
Yes! I am!

122
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,540
You... miserable creature!

123
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,010
What's your name?

124
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,310
Your father called me...

125
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,820
<i>Arucard.</i>

126
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,640
In order to hit his heart,
I had to hit your lung.

127
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,350
Sorry, but it's a high caliber gun.
You won't last very long.

128
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,600
What do you want to do?

129
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Father...

130
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,510
Mother...

131
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,000
Tonight... really is...

132
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,130
a great night.

133
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,130
Hey.

134
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,430
Where am I?

135
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,640
Holy smokes, it's a Police Girl!

136
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,730
A cop!

137
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,770
The fuzz!

138
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,850
The law!

139
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm going to be raped...

140
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,900
or killed!

141
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,080
What's it feel like to be dead,
Police Girl?

142
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,710
But it was your choice.

143
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,130
The path of the Draculina.

144
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,810
I can't move.

145
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,360
Where am I?

146
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,380
Police Girl, how's it feel
now that you're a Draculina?

147
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,300
Fangs?!

148
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,180
You're too loud, Police Girl.

149
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,140
I don't care if you're a Draculina now,
you still must act like an English woman.

150
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,810
Draculina?

151
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,860
U-Um, excuse me, but where am I?

152
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,740
The Royal Order of Religious Knights.

153
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,030
Better known as
the Hellsing Organization.

154
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,410
We expel monsters. We are monsters.

155
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,420
So then I'm...

156
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,420
Of course you'll be working for us as
a member of the Hellsing Organization.

157
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,420
We've had a string of incidents
involving some suspicious Midians.

158
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,430
Take out the vampire, Police Girl.

159
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
They severed their victims' heads
and wrote with their blood.

160
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,190
This is a challenge to
Christianity and Christians.

161
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,400
They're thumbing
their noses at our church,

162
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,910
our country, and Hellsing.

163
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,450
<i>The target is moving north on Route 17.</i>

164
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,750
<i>They're going around attacking</i>
<i>families they've pre-selected.</i>

165
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
<i>These goddamn freaks</i>
<i>must not be allowed to live!</i>

166
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,230
Soon we'll be able to live forever.

167
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,730
As invincible vampires.

168
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,230
You can't even change into fog or a bat.

169
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,780
You can't even heal your gunshot wounds.

170
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,030
If you run out of bullets,
you can't even fight.

171
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,790
And you want to be a nosferatu?
Shame on you!

172
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,890
Don't let her get away, Police Girl.

173
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Yes!

174
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
What's wrong? Make it quick.

175
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,610
She's incredibly fast!

176
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,530
She's already 500 or 600 meters away.

177
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,540
Think of yourself as having another
eye on your forehead and shoot.

178
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,540
Shoot like a human, and you'll
only be able to hit like a human.

179
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,630
But...

180
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,000
You can't miss.

181
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,550
The heart. A single shot
right through the heart.

182
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,340
But I don't have a scope,
and look how dark it is.

183
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,980
That would be a problem
if you were human.

184
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,730
But you're no longer human.

185
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,810
<i>It's such a big gun, and yet</i>
<i>I hardly felt any recoil at all.</i>

186
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,020
<i>It's night, yet could see better</i>
<i>than in the day.</i>

187
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,020
Well done, Police Girl.

188
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,520
<i>And now, I'm having a conversation</i>
<i>through some sort of telepathy.</i>

189
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,030
What on earth's happened to me?

190
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,580
<i>I'm...</i>

191
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,010
Not yet.

192
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,090
You still have a ways to go.

193
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,260
And a long ways to go at that.

194
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,650
<i>Too many.</i>

195
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,740
<i>Far too many.</i>

196
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,740
<i>Too many vampire related incidents.</i>

197
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,830
<i>What's more, it's only third and fourth</i>
<i>rate small-fry who keep killing at random.</i>

198
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,880
<i>Nothing but pointless,</i>
<i>cheap and pathetic, foolish acts.</i>

199
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,130
<i>It's like someone is churning out vampires</i>
<i>as if it's the easiest thing in the world.</i>

200
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,350
Hey, both of you, stop that!

201
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,940
You must never resort to
violence against your friend.

202
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,310
You can't go to heaven if you do that.

203
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,270
I'm sorry, Father.

204
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,200
Listen. The only people it's
all right to use violence against

205
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,490
are monsters and heathens.

206
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,920
All right, go back to your room.

207
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,630
Yes, Father!

208
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,920
-Let's go!
-Yeah.

209
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,800
What can I do for you?
What seems to be the matter?

210
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm afraid there's been quite
a number of strange happenings of late.

211
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,810
Especially in England.

212
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,520
Yes. Seems there's quite
a cover-up going on.

213
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,810
It's a vampire.

214
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,990
Vampires have been turning up
repeatedly within their borders.

215
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,990
The numbers are clearly outside the norm.

216
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,280
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

217
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,080
Lots of English Protestants
have died, right?

218
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,540
No, they haven't.

219
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,630
I believe you're familiar with Hellsing.

220
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,840
They've performed better
than we anticipated.

221
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,510
Actually, it appears damage
has been kept to a minimum.

222
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,470
Those amateurs!

223
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,760
They're like a kindergarten
compared to us.

224
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,730
Catholics, the Vatican...

225
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,770
and us.

226
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,110
We've been continuing the fight against
them far longer than Hellsing has.

227
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,570
What is it you want from me?

228
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,490
If the trouble is in England,
we can let them handle it, no?

229
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,450
If it were in England.

230
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,830
So...?

231
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,790
This time it occurred in Ireland.

232
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,130
Northern Ireland. A local town, Badrick.

233
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,010
Hellsing is on the move.

234
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,840
We cannot just sit back and watch.

235
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,970
Brazenly sending in someone,
as if it were their own territory.

236
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,520
They're as shameless
and presumptuous as always.

237
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,650
That place doesn't belong to
the Protestants.

238
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,190
It's Catholic land, it belongs to us.

239
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,990
We hunt the vampires.

240
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,240
We can't allow them to get
a head start on us, Anderson.

241
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,990
And if I should run into Hellsing?

242
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,920
We are the only and absolute
instruments of God on earth.

243
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,130
We cannot back away from
a challenge from heretics.

244
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,970
"If anyone does not
love the Lord Jesus Christ...

245
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,050
let him be accursed. O Lord, come." Amen!

246
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Police Girl.

247
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,750
They're not human beings.

248
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,580
They're puppets.
Might as well be pumpkins.

249
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,170
They're just puppets.

250
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,090
Aim...

251
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,960
One shot and it's over.

252
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,370
Police Girl...

253
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,210
When you aim, make sure to put
a hole through the heart or the head.

254
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,720
These people didn't become
ghouls because they wanted to.

255
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,260
There's no way to change people who've
become like this to how they were before.

256
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,560
We shoot them dead
quickly for their own good.

257
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,410
Sir... Yes Sir, my Master.

258
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,620
Looks like she's getting
the hang of being a Midian.

259
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,160
Holy bayonets.

260
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,830
A spiritual barrier?!

261
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,290
We are the agents of God.

262
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,670
We are the instruments of
his divine punishment on earth.

263
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,960
Our mission is to wipe out...

264
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,970
every last bit of flesh of
those fools who oppose him.

265
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,970
Amen!

266
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,810
Chief, a report from our
intelligence officer at the Vatican.

267
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,310
Rome... the Vatican...

268
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,310
The Vatican's Special Operations
13th Division,

269
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,560
the Iscariot Organization, is on the move!

270
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,650
Iscariot.

271
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,820
The Vatican's unofficial
special operations unit.

272
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,200
The single most powerful
fighting force they have.

273
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,660
Professionals at exorcism,
suppressing heathens,

274
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,210
and exterminating heretics.

275
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,790
The 13th Division, named after Judas...
It isn't even supposed to exist.

276
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,960
How many?

277
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,260
They've only sent in one person.

278
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,470
The Paladin, Father Alexander Anderson!

279
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,600
Father Alexander Anderson?

280
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,980
What will happen if he
runs into Arucard and the girl?

281
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm going to Badrick too!

282
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,240
Get my gun, my sword,
and two bodyguards ready!

283
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
Yes!

284
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,120
Walter, I'll leave negotiations
with the Vatican to you.

285
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,240
Certainly.

286
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,620
Paladin Anderson,
Professional Killer Anderson,

287
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,870
Bayonet Anderson,
Judge Anderson the Beheader,

288
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,790
Angel Dust Anderson...

289
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,380
His origins, race, and age
are all a mystery.

290
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,760
There's only one thing known about
him other than his many nicknames.

291
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,890
The fact he is a specialist
in fighting monsters.

292
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,140
Just as Arucard is our trump card
in the fight against monsters,

293
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,400
he's the Vatican 13th Division's
ace-in-the-hole for dealing with them.

294
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,900
The monster killing
Paladin, the annihilationist!

295
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,410
Put Arucard and the girl
in front of him...

296
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,450
and he's bound to do something.

297
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,080
It's a lovely moon, you monsters.

298
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,760
You make such lovely
cries of agony, young lady.

299
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,770
But you won't die from that.

300
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,850
That's because not a single
dagger pierced your heart.

301
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,110
It's been a while since I've gone
vampire hunting. I have to enjoy it.

302
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,610
Vatican 13th Division.

303
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,070
Special Operations Organization,
Iscariot.

304
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,830
That's right, you Hellsing lapdogs.

305
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,080
So you're the miserable Arucard?

306
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,590
The one who sides with humans
even though he's a vampire.

307
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,090
Hunter of vampires...
Hellsing's garbage man.

308
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
What did you do with the vampire here?

309
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,800
I've dealt with him.

310
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,770
He was a piddling, two-bit small-timer.
I didn't even have time for fun.

311
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,370
You two are the only ones left.

312
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,910
Is that so?

313
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,270
You're a brave Father to
pick a fight with a vampire.

314
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,980
And to do it head on,
even though it's night.

315
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,990
You didn't even try to
catch me by surprise.

316
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,490
But you're a fool.

317
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,990
Master.

318
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,120
Don't talk.

319
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,740
You've been stabbed with holy bayonets.

320
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,120
Recovering under your own power will--

321
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,710
What the...?!

322
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,070
Amen!

323
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,820
Regenerator...

324
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
That's right.

325
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,830
Our race was engineered and manufactured
in order to fight you creatures.

326
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
Amen!

327
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,990
Master!

328
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,130
Hurry! Knowing Iscariot...

329
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,630
No, knowing Arucard,
it's probably already started.

330
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,270
This thing is Hellsing's trump card?!

331
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,730
The best vampire they've raised?!

332
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,820
You must be kidding me!
He's a complete joke!

333
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,240
Those Protestants
can't do anything right.

334
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,170
Oh, she's still able to move
even after all that damage.

335
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,340
It seems I may have taken
the Draculina a little too lightly.

336
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,620
Master...

337
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,790
You're terrible.

338
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,830
Dragging me into this...
Leaving me all alone...

339
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,880
I can't believe this is happening.

340
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,760
Where do you think you're going?

341
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,590
There's no place to run.

342
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,600
Dust to dust.<i> Pulvis et pulvis</i>.

343
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,180
You are nothing more than dust.
And to dust you shall return!

344
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,680
Amen.

345
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,190
<i>I have to go! I have to escape!</i>

346
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,280
<i>I got to get out of here and tell Integra!</i>

347
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,540
<i>What's this?</i>

348
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,540
That's a spiritual barrier, little girl.

349
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,050
It's impossible for you
Midians to penetrate it.

350
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,050
Now be good and let me
slaughter you, you goddamn monster.

351
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,680
<i>He's going to kill me.</i>

352
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,690
<i>He's going to kill me.</i>
<i>He's going to kill me!</i>

353
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,400
<i>I'm going to die!</i>

354
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,190
<i>This is no time to lose your head,</i>
<i>Police Girl.</i>

355
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,990
Master?

356
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,460
<i>Take my blood, Police Girl...</i>

357
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,380
<i>and you shall not be the vampire</i>
<i>only treated like a slave.</i>

358
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,680
<i>Truly you shall be one of our kind.</i>

359
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,970
<i>You shall suck blood wisely...</i>

360
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,390
<i>Stroll the night on your feet.</i>
<i>Be the eternal "No Life King."</i>

361
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,770
<i>Drink my blood, Police Girl.</i>
<i>No... Seras Victoria.</i>

362
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,660
It's over.

363
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,830
That girl belongs to us.

364
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,630
What do you think you're doing...

365
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,750
Iscariot Paladin,
Father Alexander Anderson?

366
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,720
Director Integra.

367
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing.

368
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,770
To what do I owe the honor of having
the Director make an appearance herself?

369
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,850
Father Anderson.

370
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,100
This is a serious violation
of the agreement.

371
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,020
This place is supposed
to be under our control.

372
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,280
Withdraw immediately!

373
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,280
If you don't there is going to be
a crisis between the Vatican and us.

374
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,280
I don't care if you're the 13th Division.
We will not allow such indiscretions.

375
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,290
Withdraw? Did you say withdraw?!

376
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:09,170
We? The 13th Division Iscariot,
the agents of divine punishment on earth?

377
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,010
Don't take us lightly, you whore!

378
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,930
We'd never retreat
from you filthy Protestants!

379
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:30,730
You're the ultimate in bio-engineered
regeneration as well as healing?

380
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
You monster!

381
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,950
You're all too weak,
every single one of you.

382
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,570
There's nothing to discuss.

383
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,870
I chopped the head off that
garbage man you're so proud of.

384
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,370
I decapitated him.

385
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,750
You chopped his head off?

386
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,090
-That's all?
-What?!

387
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,050
Take your hands off Integra, you monster!

388
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,230
You don't have a chance, Father Anderson.

389
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,310
I'd back off quietly if I were you.

390
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,650
What are you talking about?

391
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,320
I'm just about to finish you all off.

392
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Then you'd better make it quick.

393
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,070
If you don't get a move on, that person
you decapitated will come back to life!

394
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,070
What?

395
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,840
<i>You didn't drink it, did you, you fool?</i>

396
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,180
You cut off his head? Pierced his heart?

397
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,060
Don't put him in the same
class as those other vampires.

398
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,320
Those things won't kill him.

399
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,070
Just as you are the fruit
of anti-vampire technology,

400
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,280
he is the greatest of the undead,

401
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,830
which the Hellsing family took
100 years to so proudly make.

402
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,080
The vampire, Arucard!

403
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
Master!

404
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,240
Now you understand.

405
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,450
Well, what are you going to do, Anderson?

406
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,460
I see. I'm not prepared
to kill him as I am now.

407
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,670
We'll meet again, Hellsing.

408
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,470
Next time, I'll kill you all.

409
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,190
That was close...

410
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,910
Are you all right, Arucard?

411
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,240
Yeah.

412
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,160
It's been a while since
I had my head plucked off.

413
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,750
So that was Father Anderson
from Iscariot?

414
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,670
It's a cross-border combat violation,
according to the agreement.

415
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,710
He attacked a member
of the organization...

416
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,260
committed acts of bloodshed.

417
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,840
The Vatican owes us big for this.

418
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,760
However, they're not
the ones we're fighting now.

419
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,850
A huge organization working in the shadows
is behind this string of vampire attacks.

420
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,980
Then give me the order.

421
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,280
Tell me to wipe them out.
Tell me to annihilate them.

422
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,650
Tell me to turn them into dirt.

423
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,820
That's what you should do,

424
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,240
my Master, Integra
Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing.

425
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,500
When the time comes, I will.

426
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,710
Really?

427
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,750
It'll be my pleasure.

428
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,170
My great pleasure.

429
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,880
My great, great, pleasure.

430
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,170
Hey.

431
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,640
Why didn't you drink the blood?

432
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,390
Why didn't you drink it?

433
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,730
I'm not sure.

434
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:39,270
But I felt like if I drank the blood,

435
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,780
it would mean the end of something.

436
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,280
You nitwit.

437
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,910
But perhaps that's all right.

438
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,410
Maybe it's okay to have someone like you.
Someone who's scared to walk at night.

439
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,170
Why did you make
the Police Girl one of you?

440
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,510
Why indeed...

441
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,050
As a bit of entertainment?
A spot of fun?

442
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,510
A passing fancy?

443
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,680
No, it's none of those things.

444
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,560
Perhaps your human
capriciousness has rubbed off on me...

445
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,900
after spending so much
time with you people.

446
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,440
Come, Police Girl. Don't dawdle.

447
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,320
Yes, sir. My Master.

448
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,200
But, my name's not Police Girl.
It's Seras Victoria.

449
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,330
Shut up you coward.

450
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,210
You're a Police Girl.
"Police Girl" will do just fine.

451
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,630
You're so mean!

452
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,300
Master!

453
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,930
Or perhaps you could call it
a "No Life King's" sentimentality.

454
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,440
No, a "Count's..."

455
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,700
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

456
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,250
<i>let's carry on</i>
<i>with the plans for the war!</i>

457
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,500
<i>For the next war!</i>

458
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,960
<i>For the war after the next war!</i>

459
