1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,450
<i>Wh-What's the deal with this guy?</i>

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,610
<i>Don't tell me he's...</i>

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,740
<i>a parasite?</i>

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,730
<i>No, he's human.</i>

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,330
<i>I can tell that much, somehow.</i>

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,060
<i>But... Migi...</i>

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,580
<i>He's asleep!</i>

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,690
Parasyte

9
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,690
The Maxim

10
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,510
In Cold Blood

11
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,050
What's the deal with that guy?

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,990
He's acting like a completely 
different person now.

13
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,430
This is who he truly is.

14
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,850
<i>Is he human?</i>

15
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,860
<i>Is he?!</i>

16
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,360
<i>It's not like...</i>

17
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,370
<i>It's not like I think I'm all that special.</i>

18
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,050
<i>Why can I tell humans and monsters apart?</i>

19
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,410
<i>Well, let me think...</i>

20
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,590
<i>Maybe it's because I played 
around a lot with humans.</i>

21
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,150
<i>So, basically...</i>

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,230
<i>I know more about all the qualities</i>

23
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,540
<i>this life form possesses than anyone else.</i>

24
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,320
This toy's pretty fragile.

25
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,190
<i>I sure played around...</i>

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,610
<i>But isn't this ability of mine 
something most animals have, anyway?</i>

27
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,990
<i>It's just about telling your 
own kind apart from others.</i>

28
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,290
<i>When I first found one of them, 
sure, I was shocked.</i>

29
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,310
<i>It's not every day you see an alien being</i>

30
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,800
<i>walking in a crowd wearing human clothes...</i>

31
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,970
<i>If watched a crowd for a while,</i>

32
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,120
<i>I'd be lucky to see two come 
through in a given hour.</i>

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,860
<i>It was weird that no one 
around me seemed to notice,</i>

34
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,560
<i>but that "thing" also didn't 
seem to give a damn.</i>

35
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,630
<i>I didn't really approach them.</i>

36
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,820
<i>Even I thought it'd be dangerous.</i>

37
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,570
<i>I guess you could call it my animal instinct.</i>

38
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,840
<i>I was kind of looking forward to finding out</i>

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,100
<i>what these strange beings would do, but...</i>

40
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,350
<i>It amounted to nothing.</i>

41
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,330
<i>It wasn't all that different 
from the kinds of things I did.</i>

42
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,510
Wow, what a mess.

43
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,580
You should clean up your toys when 
you're done playing with them...

44
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,770
Don't move!

45
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,700
I-It's not what you think!

46
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,650
It wasn't me! You've got it all wrong!

47
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,540
I'd never...

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,570
He's taking his sweet time.

49
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,160
Hirama-san, we can't drag 
this out much longer.

50
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,430
Look at Izumi Shinichi.

51
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,500
He kept his cool during our questioning,

52
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,170
but even he seems to be afraid this time.

53
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,790
Uragami.

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,300
No.

55
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,350
What?

56
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,680
What do you mean?

57
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,470
Well, he might have potential.

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,790
But what caught my attention

59
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,060
wasn't anything like that.

60
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,870
It just distracted me, that's all.

61
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,070
What distracted you?

62
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,670
It turned out I was just imagining it,

63
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,080
but I thought I saw something

64
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,960
not entirely human deep within his eyes.

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,850
What?!

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,410
Idiot.

67
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,470
Don't yell right into my ear.

68
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,370
I told you I was just imagining it.

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,450
When I took a good, long look,

70
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,830
there was nothing to it.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,360
So, you will be staying at a hotel 
for a few more days, at least.

72
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,550
We will have someone accompany you

73
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,500
any time you want to visit your home,

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,550
so be sure to contact us first.

75
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,490
Oh, that's really unnecessary...

76
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,990
No, I insist.

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,690
Um, Hirama-san?

78
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,000
About the baby...

79
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,370
If you're referring to the one Tamura 
Reiko was holding in her arms,

80
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,360
it still needs to undergo testing.

81
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,010
After all, the child was 
being raised by a parasite.

82
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,960
So once you're sure the baby 
is normal, what then?

83
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,150
Well...

84
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,720
The child will be raised in appropriate facilities.

85
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,010
Why do you ask?

86
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,780
Does the child concern you that much?

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,240
No.

88
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,530
Well...

89
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,460
If you were to say you're 
Tamura Reiko's relative,

90
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,660
I'd ask if you'd like to have custody.

91
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,510
What?

92
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,300
I was kidding.

93
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,670
<i>Deep within his eyes, huh?</i>

94
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,530
<i>I have no way of telling.</i>

95
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,140
Shinichi, need the bath?

96
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,570
You go ahead.

97
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,220
All right, thanks.

98
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,460
<i>Who was he?</i>

99
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,340
<i>Just thinking back gives me chills,</i>

100
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,320
<i>even though I've seen so 
many man-eating monsters.</i>

101
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,120
Shinichi, it appears that you 
are not only tired in body,

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,480
but also exhausted in spirit.

103
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,300
I met someone really scary 
while you were asleep.

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,200
A human?

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,130
Yes...

106
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,280
But I think he was a killer.

107
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,770
I don't know what to think anymore.

108
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,940
There are humans who are 
unfathomable and terrifying,

109
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,030
but that man-eating parasite, Tamura Reiko,

110
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,780
saved me.

111
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,410
She healed the hole in my heart.

112
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,250
I still cannot comprehend her behavior.

113
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,760
We are two halves of the same whole.

114
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,480
We and humans are one family.

115
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:24,270
Conference Room

116
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,050
Regarding the "Legal Analysis of Critical Response

117
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,270
and Operation Planned to 
Mitigate Massacre by Parasites."

118
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,460
Technically, the government 
has approved this operation,

119
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,030
but keep in mind that 
there are many gray areas.

120
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,620
I look forward to working with you,

121
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,280
Inspector Hirama.

122
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,830
I'm only an assistant inspector.

123
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,080
But there's talk that you may be promoted

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,580
straight to superintendent 
by the day of the operation.

125
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,830
Surely you're joking.

126
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,860
He's been assigned to command the 
ground forces during the operationâ€”

127
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,090
I'm Yamagishi.

128
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,080
As you have already heard,

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,850
Hirama-kun will be supporting this operation 
by overseeing all the support functions,

130
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,650
and Yamagishi-kun will 
oversee the core operation

131
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,350
with regard to identifying 
and eliminating the enemy.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,930
Director General,

133
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,580
the man named Uragami I spoke of previously

134
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,660
may be a great asset, 
depending on how we use him.

135
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,650
I believe it'd be best to incorporate him

136
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,550
as an integral element in our core strategy.

137
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,370
I appreciate the thought,

138
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,150
but regarding this "super ability" of his...

139
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,590
I hear he's a mass murderer.

140
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,520
Having such a foreign element working 
with our tactical forces in an operation

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,180
may result in mishaps at a critical point.

142
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,730
No, he doesn't need to be a 
part of the tactical force.

143
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,640
I'd just like him to function as a pair of eyes.

144
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,870
Eyes, eh?

145
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,110
But we have a sensing system 
in place for that purpose.

146
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,610
They are not a flock of sheep 
who can be herded by dogs.

147
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,030
You seem to give their possible 
humanity too much credit.

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
This is not intended to be a manhunt,

149
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,870
but an extermination of pests.

150
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,540
I have lost contact with Tamura Reiko.

151
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,550
The same goes for Kusano, 
Hikawa, and Maesawa.

152
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,530
Three mangled bodies were found 
in a construction site within the city,

153
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,560
and a female thought to be a parasite was 
shot to death the following day in a park.

154
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,800
Not to mention, all the bodies were 
retrieved by a specialized agency,

155
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,820
and their identities have not been revealed.

156
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,370
Kusano had always borne 
animosity toward Tamura Reiko.

157
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,820
He must have plotted to kill 
her without our consent

158
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,880
and been killed by her instead.

159
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,080
Then the one who was shot dead 
in the park was Tamura Reiko.

160
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,710
Most likely.

161
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,800
Now that a parasite task force 
agency has been created,

162
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,640
I no longer receive any information.

163
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,190
That means the government is beginning 
to treat this as a serious issue.

164
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,330
It appears so.

165
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,020
Izumi-kun!

166
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,440
Murano.

167
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm sorry I made you worry.

168
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,890
It's okay.

169
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,820
Oh, wait.

170
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,530
Here are all the notes 
I took while you were gone.

171
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,540
Thanks.

172
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,510
I'll return them once I make copies.

173
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,460
Oh, look who's back!

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,790
So you can come back to school starting today?

175
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,170
Huh? Oh.

176
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,050
Yeah.

177
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,170
Listen up!

178
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,180
This is your last timed run in high school!

179
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,480
Give it all you've got so that 
you won't have any regrets!

180
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Idiot.

181
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,980
Everything he says is so over the top.

182
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,520
Izumi!

183
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,570
I've always wanted to tell you this.

184
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,890
You never take any of this seriously!

185
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,650
This is your last chance, so try for once!

186
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,990
<i>If it were only that simple...</i>

187
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,990
<i>Last time in high school, huh?</i>

188
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,330
Set!

189
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,880
10... 10.5 seconds?

190
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,640
Wow.

191
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,860
<i>It'd be easy to break 10 seconds.</i>

192
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,610
Why're you getting changed in the 
corner like you're hiding something?

193
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,650
Huh?

194
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,490
Don't be so shy! You're a dude!

195
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,550
Sorry.

196
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,040
It's fine.

197
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,570
Ow!

198
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,420
Idiot.

199
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,550
Hi-yah!

200
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,060
We'll be graduating in three months.

201
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,470
Yeah.

202
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,690
A lot of things happened in high school, huh?

203
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,320
Way too much.

204
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,080
But there were good things, too.

205
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,300
Yeah.

206
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,330
I should study.

207
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,370
Huh?

208
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,050
Are you actually going to take 
university entrance exams?

209
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,090
What's that supposed to mean?

210
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,600
You know, when I go to uniâ€”

211
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,600
Let's go.

212
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,610
We will win!

213
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm 99.9% certain,

214
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,880
but I feel like we're just 
missing one last thing.

215
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,200
I don't know what that is,

216
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,670
but there is something missing.

217
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,250
I'd like your help.

218
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,510
Why...

219
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,250
Why is it always Izumi-kun?

220
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,720
Izumi-kun isn't the only one affected.

221
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,520
Everyone here is trying their 
best to forget what happened!

222
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,080
We were all supposed to be 
leading perfectly normal lives,

223
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,030
like normal high school students.

224
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,150
But just a little step off the track,

225
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,140
and there's blood everywhere!

226
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,670
He seems to be a high school student.

227
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,040
He's the witness I told you about.

228
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,190
Ah.

229
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,800
I hear you saw Hirama-san and his 
men put down one of them recently.

230
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,390
Higashi Fukuyama
City Hall

231
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,390
Yamagishi

232
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,390
Yes.

233
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:20,890
Outer Riot
Police Unit

234
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,720
I understand that you are a civilian,

235
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,970
but I'd like to hear your opinion as to

236
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,890
what weapons might be effective against them.

237
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,940
Higashi Fukuyama
City Hall

238
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,940
Yamagishi

239
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,820
Flamethrowers, for example.

240
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,820
Against things that can move that fast?

241
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,090
Of course, fire won't be enough.

242
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,520
But I think it'll be effective.

243
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,050
Basically,

244
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,920
it'll startle us,

245
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,700
and just the "us" on the surface.

246
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,710
We have intellect on par with that of humans,

247
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,340
and we do not fear fire.

248
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,590
But should flames suddenly come near us,

249
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,560
there will be a disconnect between 
our "outer" and "inner" selves.

250
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,100
In short, we'd be startled.

251
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,680
Huh.

252
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,020
Goto's body hosts several parasites

253
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,440
that are controlled by one mind.

254
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,690
So if that one mind becomes startled,

255
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,190
it should unbalance him greatly.

256
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,650
I see...

257
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,830
A flamethrower?

258
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,700
Ah, forgive me.

259
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,960
Well, it may not be a bad idea.

260
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,960
But no matter how many parasites 
may reside in one body,

261
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,590
there is only one heart.

262
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,250
<i>Today is the day.</i>

263
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,390
Huh? What's going on?

264
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,200
What's this, a military coup d'etat?

265
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,830
Looks like the riot squad, but...

266
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,570
<i>It can't be.</i>

267
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,440
Sensors ready.

268
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,630
Commence operation.

269
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,790
This is an emergency.
We repeat: this is an emergency.

270
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,170
To everyone in this building:

271
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,720
we have very important information.

272
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,500
Please listen carefully.

273
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,240
I am Mizushima, a detective with the 
Higashi Fukuyama Police Department.

274
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,650
A man armed with a rifle 
has entered the building

275
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,010
and has concealed himself somewhere 
on the building rooftop.

276
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,510
Mutsuki and Kisaragi squads are to 
rendezvous in the main entrance hall.

277
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,760
Yayoi squad, cover the annex.

278
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,390
Uzuki squad, cover the second 
floor and seal off all exit points.

279
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,390
Satsuki squad, protect the sensing system.

280
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,380
Minazuki squad, neutralize the foxes.

281
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,530
To all workers:

282
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,150
please move to the entrance 
hall on the first floor.

283
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,290
Information and Reception

284
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,690
<i>They're claiming they're the police?</i>

285
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,410
<i>My bet would be that none 
of them are from the police.</i>

286
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,980
<i>So you're really moving 
forward with this, humans?</i>

287
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,010
This is where the real game begins.

288
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,350
The foxes will be stripped of their disguises

289
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,390
and lured to the hunting grounds.

290
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,400
The armed suspect is on the 
north side of the rooftop!

291
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,280
We will have you evacuate 
through his blind spot,

292
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,900
but he may notice if large 
groups evacuate at once.

293
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,170
Thus, we'll have you evacuate in groups of seven.

294
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,490
I don't know, okay?

295
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,660
I'll have to actually see them in person.

296
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,750
Not through a screen like this.

297
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,070
Anyway, this is impressive.

298
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,180
It's like a war.

299
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,890
Am I even going to be needed?

300
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,930
Huh?

301
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,250
Oh, it's you.

302
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,490
So calling in the cavalry wasn't enough.

303
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,680
You had to recruit a killer and a minor for help.

304
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,070
You're in quite a bind, huh?

305
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,810
Enough! Keep your mouth shut!

306
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,820
Well?

307
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,330
Are there any?

308
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,330
I'm not sure.

309
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,990
If we can at least identify

310
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,870
the deviant with multiple parasites in 
one body, the one you said you saw...

311
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,630
<i>"The deviant"...</i>

312
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,230
And regarding the other one, 
the mayor, Hirokawa...

313
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,330
<i>That's right.</i>

314
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,830
<i>Hirokawa is the key.</i>

315
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,270
<i>What was she trying to say about him?</i>

316
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,410
We're to evacuate in groups of seven.

317
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,380
Mayor, you should go first.

318
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,770
Of course not.

319
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,150
Please prioritize children and the elderly,

320
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,420
as well as women.

321
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,910
City workers should wait as long as they can.

322
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,660
Here comes the first seven.

323
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,670
HQ to all squads.

324
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,950
Should foxes attempt escape 
or retaliation when fired upon,

325
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,050
engage safeguards immediately.

326
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,050
Roger that.

327
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,520
Removing materials that do not contain 
human DNA from the sensor image.

328
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,130
No hits.

329
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,310
Bring the next seven.

330
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,860
No hits in this batch, either.

331
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,330
Migi, you can't tell how many there are?

332
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,810
We're a fair distance away, 
so I can't be precise,

333
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,460
but there are quite a few.

334
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,100
There!

335
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,960
That one!

336
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,160
So the first hit is a woman.

337
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,030
Crime and Punishment

338
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,790
Next time:

339
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,020
"Crime and Punishment."
