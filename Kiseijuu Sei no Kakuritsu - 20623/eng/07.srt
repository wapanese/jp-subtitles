1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,950
Don't move!

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,650
It's not her?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,620
It wasn't her...

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,370
But this one's a monster, too, right?!

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,670
H-Hang on a second!

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,270
What is it, Migi?

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,680
He still has his human brain.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,970
What?!

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,550
Huh, now this is pretty unusual.

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,830
Just the hand, huh?

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,920
Whoa!

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,730
H-How is that a human brain?!

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,630
N-No, he's right!

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,530
It's really—

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,120
It's the real deal, see?

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,510
It's true, Shinichi.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,130
His brain is intact.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,160
From the lower half of his face 
to the front of his neck,

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,340
and perhaps down to his chest is where...

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,870
That's right.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,450
So we're in the same boat!

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,660
Parasyte

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,660
The Maxim

24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,440
Dark Night's Passing

25
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,820
A year after I got married,

26
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,280
my wife ran off.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,550
She didn't say why,

28
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,040
but I think she got sick of my 
easygoing, indecisive personality...

29
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,500
But I didn't have the guts 
to actually kill myself.

30
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,760
It's beautiful...

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,050
A s-snake?!

32
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,020
Go away!

33
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,990
Shoo! Shoo!

34
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,260
And then...

35
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,300
I'll finish.

36
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,670
Your right hand should have 
some recollection of this, too.

37
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,680
At first, "take over the brain" is our only goal,

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
so I was working my way toward the brain.

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,930
But...

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,590
What's going on?

41
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,620
The host is not breathing.

42
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,690
This body will soon die.

43
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,210
Forget taking his brain...

44
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm about to die with him.

45
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,500
I merged with his body as it 
approached a near-death state,

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,200
and...

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,480
I see.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,590
Interesting.

49
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,890
So, yeah, that's how I...

50
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,110
Let me talk, too

51
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,810
When I give you control over my upper body,

52
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,680
I can't be as dynamic when I talk!

53
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,100
Shut up!

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,860
But this sure was a surprise.

55
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,450
When this guy suddenly said one of 
his own kind was coming closer,

56
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,270
I wasn't sure what kind of monster I'd see.

57
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,060
But it was a relief to see you.

58
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,280
Man, I didn't know there were others like me!

59
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,690
So, tell me.

60
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,870
What's the story behind your right hand?

61
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,500
Yeah, tell us.

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,720
Okay.

63
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,130
But before I do that, 
can we go somewhere else?

64
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,620
I'm Izumi Shinichi.

65
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,170
This is Migi.

66
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,930
It's just that we need to stay 
close to a certain location.

67
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,610
Oh, I'm Uda Mamoru.

68
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,320
You can just call him Parasite.

69
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,150
Yeah, Parasite's just fine.

70
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,400
He's gone.

71
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,350
Where'd he go?

72
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,420
That's horrible.

73
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,660
It's too cruel!

74
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,450
And that's why you've stayed 
near this hospital all this time...

75
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,920
It must be so hard on you.

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,170
I don't think I could bear it.

77
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,710
Right...

78
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,000
Why does this guy cry so much?

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,970
I really don't get humans.

80
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,470
I sometimes feel the same way.

81
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,310
Migi has a very proper way 
of speaking, doesn't he?

82
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,870
Huh? Oh...

83
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,980
I think it's probably because 
he's read so many books.

84
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,270
I learned human speech from TV.

85
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,250
He loves watching movies, see,

86
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,740
and he's always crying over them.

87
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,230
Crying's pretty unique to humans, huh?

88
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,990
Just be quiet for a second!

89
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,250
I work at a hotel in the next town over.

90
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,790
I'll let you know the moment 
this "enemy" of yours shows up.

91
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,420
Let us help you!

92
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,970
I mean, you're the first person 
like me I've ever met!

93
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,680
<i>He really does cry a lot...</i>

94
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,720
<i>But I'm also glad.</i>

95
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,240
<i>I didn't know there were others like me...</i>

96
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,180
<i>That I had allies!</i>

97
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,110
Shinichi...

98
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,480
Shinichi!

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,220
What do you want at this time of night?

100
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,960
It's important.

101
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,910
I thought about telling you during the day,

102
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,870
but since Uda and his parasite 
showed up, I missed my chance.

103
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,830
Remember what happened, Shinichi.

104
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,940
You ran at the speed of an Olympic athlete,

105
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,090
and leapt more than three meters high.

106
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,590
What?

107
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,690
You didn't realize it?

108
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,420
Then allow me to explain.

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,280
First, about my own body...

110
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,380
This requires practice, you know.

111
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,650
If I just split in two,

112
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,440
each of us is capable of thought and speech.

113
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,020
Huh.

114
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,030
But if I split into fragments that are too small,

115
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,100
our intelligence is diminished

116
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,080
to the point that we will become incapable 
of thought, much less rejoining the others.

117
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,360
We'd shrivel up and die in no time.

118
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,040
Whoa...

119
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,310
So, when I split into multiple selves,

120
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,740
I issue a mental directive in advance...

121
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,040
A mantra, if you will.

122
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,040
"Come back together as one."

123
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,300
O-Okay, I see.

124
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,140
However, there are places 
where even the smallest

125
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,800
of my fragments can survive.

126
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,910
Somewhere with a constant flow of fresh blood...

127
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,490
Namely, anywhere within your body.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
My...

129
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,310
Wait, Migi, you—

130
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,200
That's right.

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,570
The Migi who's talking to you right now

132
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,820
only accounts for about 70 
percent of my original self.

133
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,740
When I closed the hole in your heart,

134
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,080
I issued a directive to return to your 
right hand via your bloodstream.

135
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,710
But your restored heart was much 
stronger than I'd expected,

136
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,710
so my fragments scattered 
throughout your body.

137
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,890
They have become so small that I can 
no longer communicate with them.

138
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,540
What the...

139
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,900
And here I thought nothing could 
possibly surprise me anymore.

140
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,860
If you didn't exhibit any physiological changes,

141
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,650
I was going to keep quiet about it.

142
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,900
Migi.

143
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,160
Yes?

144
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,200
You said throughout my body.

145
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,160
Does that include my brain?

146
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,660
I don't know.

147
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,170
But the fragments are not conscious,

148
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,420
and I doubt they would 
bother to infiltrate capillaries.

149
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,670
Do you have some concern?

150
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,600
No, it's nothing major.

151
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,800
I may just be imagining it.

152
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,980
<i>At that time,</i>

153
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,640
<i>I felt like my heart would burst from 
all the emotions welling up inside me,</i>

154
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,060
<i>but I still couldn't cry.</i>

155
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,150
<i>It was the same earlier today, too.</i>

156
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,060
<i>Uda-san cried like a baby when he met</i>

157
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,070
<i>someone like him for the first time, but I...</i>

158
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,320
Crying's pretty unique to humans, huh?

159
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,080
The hole in my heart, huh?

160
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,520
Maki-chan.

161
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,710
Oh, you knew I was here?

162
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,970
Do I look like a normal human being to you?

163
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,470
Huh?

164
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,470
S-Sure. Why?

165
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,790
Jeez, what's your deal?

166
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,810
You get your answer, and that's it?

167
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,810
You don't tell me anything.

168
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,870
Huh?

169
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,060
Back on the boat, and now, too...

170
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,320
You have this terrible look on 
your face sometimes, like...

171
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,450
Like you're crying inside!

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,710
I-It makes me worry about you.

173
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,450
Sorry.

174
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,880
Just forget it!

175
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,380
It's Uda-san.

176
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,570
It's here! A parasite!

177
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,470
We think it must be your enemy!

178
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,240
And she's heading straight here?

179
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,270
No, she seems to have noticed 
us and is coming closer.

180
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,140
We'll do our best to keep 
her here until you come.

181
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,740
Do you know what you're saying?!

182
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,900
If she realizes you still have your human brain,

183
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,790
she'll attack, no matter what you tell her!

184
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,740
What?

185
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,990
She's a hundred meters away.

186
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,080
Hurry!

187
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,120
Get out of there!

188
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,950
O-Okay!

189
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,910
I'll follow the cape and head to 
the town where you are now!

190
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,880
Shinichi, I'm detecting one parasite.

191
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,370
One?

192
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,100
That must be Uda-san.

193
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,840
Hurry up!

194
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
She'll catch up to us!

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,680
Th-This is the best I can do!

196
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,460
Looks like she's able to maximize

197
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,370
the potential of the human body.

198
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,310
We don't stand a chance against her.

199
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,370
Let's make a break for it!

200
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,910
We can't!

201
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,890
Shinichi-kun and Migi will be here soon.

202
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,460
We have to work together to beat her!

203
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,040
Then go that way!

204
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,050
We'll have a better chance there.

205
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,710
Shinichi.

206
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,250
You can sense the other one?

207
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,590
No... I'm tired...

208
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,350
You've got to be kidding me!

209
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,610
I can't stay awake any longer...

210
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,030
Wake up, Migi!

211
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,130
Are you going to let Uda-san 
and his parasite die?!

212
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,990
At least...

213
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,370
I can leave you this.

214
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,440
Hey!

215
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,440
If you can, run.

216
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,810
Choose...

217
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,890
your own... survival...

218
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,820
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

219
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,030
<i>If I can join forces with 
Uda-san and Parasite...</i>

220
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,570
Hey, the path ends here.

221
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,120
Isn't this bad?

222
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,680
No, even if she catches up to us,

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,330
you and Shinichi can flank her here.

224
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,230
You're the second one I've 
met whose brain is intact.

225
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,380
But to me, you are just a hindrance.

226
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,360
I will finish you now.

227
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,660
Huh!

228
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,750
So this is what the "finished product" 
that we're supposed to be looks like!

229
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,770
<i>Where?</i>

230
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,860
<i>Where is she?!</i>

231
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,020
<i>I... I'm gonna die!</i>

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,820
You are pathetic.

233
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,810
Compared to my host that has unified with me,

234
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,660
the human that you reside in is sluggish.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,580
<i>Yeah, tell me about it.</i>

236
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,430
<i>Not to mention, his breathing's so uneven</i>

237
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,600
<i>that even I'm getting tired.</i>

238
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,670
<i>But this chick's attacks follow 
a pretty simple pattern,</i>

239
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,670
<i>as if she's only targeting 
one spot on our body...</i>

240
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,940
This fight is over.

241
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,050
Die now.

242
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,990
In cases like yours, when it's unclear how 
far the parasite's influence reaches,

243
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,830
destroying the heart is the 
most effective approach.

244
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,960
<i>I guessed... as much...</i>

245
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,380
<i>Another one?</i>

246
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>But something's not right.</i>

247
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,030
<i>The signal's too weak,</i>

248
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,330
<i>as if the parasite is asleep.</i>

249
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,300
Why?!

250
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,020
I killed you!

251
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,510
Was my aim off?

252
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,690
No, that's impossible.

253
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,530
How did you survive getting 
stabbed in the heart?

254
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,270
I suppose I should've cut 
your head off, as well.

255
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,830
This is cruel.

256
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,980
Even the voice is the same.

257
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,790
I won't waste any time killing you!

258
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,670
That's right...

259
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,500
Come!

260
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,090
A monster should look like one!

261
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,720
I'll kill you, too.

262
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,720
<i>"Too"?</i>

263
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>Then, is Uda-san...</i>

264
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,870
<i>His right hand's signal is weak.</i>

265
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,580
<i>It's as though it's hibernating.</i>

266
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,800
<i>If that's true, then what can one 
lone human possibly accomplish?</i>

267
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,510
He evaded my attacks?!

268
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,780
No, humans don't have that kind of agility...

269
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,970
<i>Impossible!</i>

270
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,670
<i>I see it!</i>

271
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,640
<i>I can see each move she makes!</i>

272
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,870
<i>It's totally different from when I fought A!</i>

273
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,610
<i>Now I see!</i>

274
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,560
<i>When they move, they're 
morphing at incredible speeds!</i>

275
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,140
<i>Inconceivable!</i>

276
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,850
Uda-san!

277
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,120
<i>He was the only one...</i>

278
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,230
<i>The only one in the world 
who could understand!</i>

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,990
Damn you!

280
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,310
<i>How?</i>

281
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,870
<i>How can he move so fast?</i>

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,070
<i>The neck...</i>

283
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,750
<i>Just aim for the neck up!</i>

284
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,550
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

285
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,300
<i>Now!</i>

286
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,920
<i>Without a moment's delay!</i>

287
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,530
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

288
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,100
<i>He can't be human!</i>

289
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,850
<i>He's not human!</i>

290
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,100
<i>Mom!</i>

291
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,110
<i>Mom, I'm going to...</i>

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,860
<i>I'm going to hack that monster...</i>

293
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,360
<i>out of you right now!</i>

294
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,380
<i>Shit!</i>

295
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,760
Die.

296
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,620
Uda-san!

297
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,810
Th-This isn't your mom, of course.

298
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,370
But...

299
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,250
I don't think you should 
be the one to finish her.

300
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,880
Why?

301
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,630
Why are you also alive?

302
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,270
I figured out your pattern of attack.

303
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,140
You always went right for our heart.

304
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,450
So I shifted the positions of 
our heart and vital organs

305
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,890
right before you struck.

306
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,630
<i>Mom...</i>

307
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,460
<i>It's over.</i>

308
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,190
<i>It's over now...</i>

309
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,520
Thank you for your hospitality.

310
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,610
Goodbye.

311
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,670
Hey, I'll see you to the hospital!

312
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,430
Did you finish what you needed to do?

313
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,680
Yeah, I did.

314
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,190
Hey, come back to do 
some sightseeing next time.

315
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,570
No, I don't think I'll ever come back.

316
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,540
No!

317
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,890
I mean... Just sometime.

318
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,570
It can be a long time from now.

319
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,450
Okay.

320
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,210
Sakurazaki Hospital

321
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,550
Goodbye.

322
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,350
I hope you'll understand when I say... 
Um, how should I put this...

323
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,730
I just want you to believe me when I say...

324
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,230
That right until the end... No, 
even now, your mom loves you.

325
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,440
And I love you and Mom, too.

326
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,560
Okay.

327
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,010
Dad, I want to ask you something.

328
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,740
About your dream...

329
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,450
Um...

330
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,250
In the nightmare you had,

331
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,500
did Mom, well... suffer at all?

332
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,630
No, it all happened so fast.

333
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,080
I see.

334
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,640
Shinichi?

335
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,440
Nishi Fukuyama Station   South Exit

336
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,370
<i>It's him.</i>

337
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,750
<i>He's close!</i>

338
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,710
<i>Izumi-kun?</i>

339
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,210
<i>Izumi-kun!</i>

340
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,460
<i>He's back!</i>

341
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,470
Izumi-kun!

342
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,890
Hey.

343
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,030
Freezing Point

344
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,930
Next time:

345
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,540
"Freezing Point."
