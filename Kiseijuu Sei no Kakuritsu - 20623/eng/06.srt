1
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,690
Parasyte

2
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,690
The Maxim

3
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,650
The Sun Also Rises

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,460
I pierced the heart.

5
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,840
Your human host died instantly.

6
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,360
You'll follow in a matter of minutes.

7
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,480
Accept your fate as one who 
failed to seize the head.

8
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,980
<i>There's no time to lose.</i>

9
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,270
<i>A direct hit to the heart</i>

10
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,700
<i>cannot be repaired in mere minutes.</i>

11
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,950
<i>Yet, if I do nothing, Shinichi's brain will die.</i>

12
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,330
<i>Which means...</i>

13
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,460
<i>My only option is to merge myself with his heart.</i>

14
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,670
<i>While I seal the hole in his heart,</i>

15
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,980
<i>I must maintain his heart function,</i>

16
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,120
<i>as well as circulate blood within myself.</i>

17
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,580
<i>She seems to have successfully 
relocated to her current host's head,</i>

18
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,530
<i>but what I am about to embark 
on is a far riskier venture.</i>

19
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,250
<i>All right, I think I can make this work.</i>

20
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,250
<i>But I cannot expect spontaneous recovery.</i>

21
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,700
<i>I should gradually recruit cells 
from all over his body</i>

22
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,100
<i>to augment the healing of his wound.</i>

23
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,000
<i>At the same time, I will gradually 
return to his right hand</i>

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,640
<i>through his blood stream.</i>

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,180
What?

26
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,140
Izumi-kun's absent again today?

27
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,850
Our homeroom teacher tried calling his home,

29
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,390
but no one's picking up.

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,900
That worries me...

31
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,260
Want to swing by on our way home?

32
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,920
Sure.

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,610
Oh, but I don't know his address.

34
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,240
I do.

35
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,690
I went home with Izumi-kun the other day.

36
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,470
What?

37
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,940
Hey, hey!

38
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,250
Since when are you and Izumi-kun a thing?

39
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,750
No! That's not it...

40
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,880
It's not? Then what is it?

41
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,750
It's none of your business, Akiho!

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,150
Don't butt in!

43
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,760
Why not? C'mon!

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,850
So is Izumi dating Murano?

45
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,430
Shut up!

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,490
C'mon, tell me.

47
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,770
Oh, drop it, Akiho.

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,830
Sugar, huh.

49
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,610
<i>The hole's been sealed.</i>

50
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,620
<i>It looks more like it's been 
fused shut than sewn up.</i>

51
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,680
<i>Migi?</i>

52
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,710
<i>Did Migi heal me?</i>

53
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,970
S...

54
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,970
So, it wasn't...

55
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,960
a dream.

56
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,610
Hello?

57
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,150
Oh, we finally got a hold of you.

58
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm calling from Sakurazaki Hospital.

59
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,620
Is this where Izumi Kazuyuki-san lives?

60
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,400
Yes...

61
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,750
Did something happen to Dad?!

62
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,490
Yes, but he is fine.

63
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,510
He's asleep right now,

64
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,990
but his life is not in any danger.

65
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,960
So, when you come to visit, can you bring things

66
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,120
like clothes and—

67
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
I'll come right away!

68
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,200
Izumi-kun?

69
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,360
Oh, um...

70
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,870
I just came by because you 
haven't been at school...

71
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,120
You'd mentioned that your parents 
were away traveling, too,

72
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,960
so I thought maybe you've been 
at home sick and alone...

73
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,160
Dad got hurt on his trip.

74
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,820
What?

75
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,140
Then your mom must be 
stuck dealing with it alone...

76
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,720
I won't be back at school for a while.

77
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,100
I-Izumi-kun...

78
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,570
Shinichi-kun!

79
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,290
Y-You'll come back, right?

80
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,170
<i>I'll kill her!</i>

81
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,160
<i>Dad saw her in that form before he ran away.</i>

82
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,090
<i>That's why she looked up our 
address and came all the way here.</i>

83
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,910
That man has not returned?

84
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,330
<i>How did she find our address?</i>

85
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,810
<i>In their luggage,</i>

86
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,290
<i>or at their hotel?</i>

87
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,300
<i>I bet she'll eventually figure out 
which hospital Dad's in, too.</i>

88
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,800
<i>I have to hurry... Hurry...</i>

89
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,630
Um...

90
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,770
Excuse me.

91
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,770
Are you okay?

92
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,390
You seem really troubled.

93
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,780
Are you from Sakurazaki?

94
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,320
Huh? Yeah.

95
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,710
Then you know where Sakurazaki Hospital is, right?

96
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,730
Oh, yeah.

97
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm familiar with it.

98
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,180
Sakurazaki Hospital

99
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,240
So it was on the 18th, at dusk,

100
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,580
when your wife was murdered?

101
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,090
Yes.

102
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,100
Has...

103
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,820
Has my wife's body been found?

104
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,220
Izumi-san...

105
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,800
Your wife is alive.

106
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,780
What?!

107
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
On the 18th,

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,040
the day you fell into the sea,

109
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,580
your wife returned alone to the hotel after 9:00 PM.

110
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,560
That's impossible!

111
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,570
She spoke with the front desk staff,

112
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,520
saying you had to leave early on urgent business,

113
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,990
but that she'd stay one more night.

114
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,290
Then she checked out the next morning.

115
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,690
No...

116
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,640
That's not possible...

117
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,080
It was an imposter.

118
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,300
But the staff saw the burn mark 
on Nobuko-san's right arm,

119
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,810
and they're sure that's who they saw.

120
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,660
Izumi-san.

121
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,840
I believe your deep psychological shock is causing

122
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,620
the reality you saw before the fall and 
the nightmare you had after the fall

123
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,920
to become jumbled together.

124
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,110
That was no nightmare.

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,110
I know it wasn't!

126
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,360
It's here.

127
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,870
Thank you.

128
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,580
Bye!

129
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Yes, he's down that way.

130
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,550
Dad!

131
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,550
Shinichi...

132
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,560
D-Da—

133
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm sorry I made you worry.

134
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,050
M-Mom is...

135
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,760
<i>It hurts so much...</i>

136
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,580
<i>I can barely speak from the grief,</i>

137
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,070
<i>yet I have no tears...</i>

138
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,530
Are you okay, Shinichi?

139
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,860
Mom's...

140
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,960
Shinichi...

141
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,260
About Mom...

142
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,930
She got caught up in some accident,

143
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,590
and we don't know where she is.

144
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,490
What?!

145
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,270
Dad...

146
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,340
Y-You saw, didn't you?

147
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,260
Saw what?

148
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,780
You mean...

149
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,460
Yeah...

150
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,550
I apparently had a nightmare

151
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,440
because I hit my head.

152
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,710
<i>A nightmare?</i>

153
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,440
<i>That's a lie!</i>

154
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,970
I've asked the police to look for her.

155
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,610
I'll need to stay here for a while yet,

156
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,820
but it's nothing serious.

157
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,830
<i>What are you saying?</i>

158
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,830
<i>How can you say all this, Dad?!</i>

159
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,240
Shinichi,

160
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,960
did something happen at home?

161
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,460
You know something happened!

162
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,970
Mom was murdered!

163
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,290
By a monster!

164
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,810
I said that kind of nonsense on the phone?

165
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,290
Sorry!

166
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,620
I'm so sorry!

167
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,810
I was wrong!

168
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,740
<i>What?</i>

169
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,810
<i>Does he really think he dreamed it all up?</i>

170
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,250
Shinichi, I'm going to be okay.

171
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,820
I want you to take it easy for two 
or three days, then go back home.

172
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,110
I know it's tough,

173
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,090
but hang in there for just a little longer.

174
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,870
If you have any problems,

175
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,020
go to your uncle in Chiba—

176
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,130
Dad, I need to talk to you about something.

177
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,250
It's about Mom and the monster—

178
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,100
Shinichi!

179
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,340
Please... I can't talk about that right now.

180
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,840
<i>Dad...</i>

181
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,360
<i>He's crying.</i>

182
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,720
<i>So he does know.</i>

183
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,850
<i>He knows Mom's dead.</i>

184
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,440
<i>I wish I could tell him what 
the monster actually is!</i>

185
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,850
<i>Tell him what kind of creature killed Mom!</i>

186
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,110
<i>If only Migi was a true ally to humanity!</i>

187
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,970
I brought some clothes.

188
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,740
Shinichi, where are you going to stay?

189
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,500
I'll stay here.

190
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,620
But you can't get a good night's rest here.

191
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,820
There's supposedly a hotel near the beach,

192
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,310
so you should go stay there.

193
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,130
<i>A hospital...</i>

194
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,660
<i>Wait, Migi's asleep.</i>

195
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
<i>Maybe this is my chance to reveal him.</i>

196
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,740
<i>No, now isn't the time!</i>

197
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,150
<i>I need his abilities to both 
find and fight the enemy!</i>

198
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,610
<i>It's pathetic, but I have no choice 
but to rely on him right now!</i>

199
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,700
What?

200
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,950
Sakurazaki Hotel's that far from here?

201
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,170
It's not that far.

202
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,960
It's only about 300 meters away.

203
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,010
<i>300 meters...</i>

204
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,670
<i>That's right on the edge of Migi's 
ability to detect the enemy.</i>

205
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,660
<i>It'll be too late if we detect her 
as she shows up at the hospital.</i>

206
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,970
Inn 
Namiki 
50m down the hill

207
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,510
<i>It's right behind the hospital.</i>

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,010
<i>This is perfect.</i>

209
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,730
Excuse me.

210
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Will it be just you staying here?

211
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,730
Oh, you're...

212
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,960
Mom!

213
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,550
We have a guest!

214
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,330
<i>Dad must've seen Mom get killed...</i>

215
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,900
<i>I'll eventually have to tell him everything I know.</i>

216
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,370
<i>But right now, I have to keep Dad alive</i>

217
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,080
<i>and avenge Mom!</i>

218
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,470
Um, your meal's ready for you downstairs.

219
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,240
Okay.

220
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,990
<i>I can easily sense people.</i>

221
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,240
<i>Are the walls that thin,</i>

222
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,890
<i>or did my hearing improve?</i>

223
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Inn 
Namiki

224
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,100
Shinichi...

225
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,050
I thought about keeping it to myself,

226
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,760
but I decided to tell you.

227
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,600
It's important.

228
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,710
Your feelings towards your 
family are quite strong.

229
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,790
In comparison, your feelings 
toward me are not as...

230
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,520
No, rather, I know you think 
of me more as a nuisance.

231
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,870
While we are allies,

232
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,960
we may also be enemies who belong 
to two different species.

233
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,280
What's your point?

234
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,970
The day I repaired your damaged body,

235
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,380
I also underwent change during the process.

236
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,300
Change?

237
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,790
I now have a weakness.

238
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,790
A weakness that others of my kind do not have.

239
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,110
For about four hours a day,

240
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,770
I fall asleep.

241
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,950
That's it?

242
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,790
You've slept before.

243
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,800
It's not the same.

244
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,820
Until now, even if I was asleep,

245
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,070
the slightest thing would wake me up.

246
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,720
For example, if you were surprised,

247
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,450
if your breathing became uneven,

248
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,230
or if one of my kind showed 
up 300 meters away.

249
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,740
One of your kind...

250
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,040
That's right.

251
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,740
But now, I'm unable to detect 
any of that when I'm asleep.

252
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,500
So, should an enemy appear 
during those four hours,

253
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
it'd mean the end for us both.

254
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,440
I had to detach from your right arm

255
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,990
for a long time in order to repair your heart.

256
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,510
My physiology was slightly altered as a result.

257
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,910
Why didn't you tell me 
something that important?!

258
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,610
It appears you harbor 
strong animosity toward me

259
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,950
now that one of my kind 
has killed your mother.

260
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,650
It is dangerous to tell an 
enemy about one's weakness.

261
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,870
That's why I didn't tell you until now.

262
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,660
But I have decided that continuing 
to keep you in the dark

263
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,950
would be even more dangerous.

264
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,910
Do you understand now?

265
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,420
I don't think of you as an enemy anymore, Migi.

266
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,370
You saved my life.

267
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,220
That is not entirely precise.

268
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,400
Your life sustains my life, as well.

269
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,190
Namiki Diner

270
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,560
Morning!

271
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,520
Oh.

272
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,770
Good morning.

273
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,280
Huh?

274
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,190
Your color looks better today.

275
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,160
You were more haggard yesterday.

276
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,810
I guess you got a good night's rest.

277
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,910
Sakurazaki Hospital

278
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,140
Oh, thanks.

279
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,390
It must've been a while since 
you last read the paper.

280
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,350
Yeah.

281
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,670
I lost both my tablet and my 
cell when I fell into the sea.

282
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,350
We'll have to replace them once we get home.

283
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,540
Yeah...

284
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,050
What's your plan?

285
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,560
I'll stay here a while longer 
and see how things go.

286
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,100
<i>While Migi is in deep sleep,</i>

287
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,570
<i>I have to use my own eyes to keep watch.</i>

288
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,290
<i>When possible,</i>

289
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,760
<i>I'll have Migi sleep during broad 
daylight when people are around</i>

290
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,470
<i>and the risk of attack is small.</i>

291
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,080
<i>What would be her approach?</i>

292
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,220
<i>Migi told me not to fight until he was awake,</i>

293
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,000
<i>but I won't have a choice 
if she suddenly comes at me.</i>

294
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,980
<i>Besides, I could never run away from Mom's killer!</i>

295
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,590
Hello.

296
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,220
Hey, uh... Makiko-chan, right?

297
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,200
You can call me Maki.

298
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,230
Were you sitting here all this time?

299
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,250
Are you that worried about your dad?

300
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,320
I guess.

301
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
It's not like there's much else to do.

302
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,770
I see.

303
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,960
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

304
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,620
Huh?

305
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:45,990
Shinichi!

306
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,920
We have company!

307
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,880
It's just about 300 meters away,

308
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,330
in the direction of the beach.

309
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,330
<i>She's here!</i>

310
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,910
Maki-chan!

311
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,880
Which road leads to the beach?

312
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,110
What?

313
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,240
You can just keep going

314
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,630
on the road you take to my place—

315
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,120
Hey, wait!

316
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,340
But if you stay on that road, 
you'll hit a seawall!

317
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,010
Hey!

318
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,680
Wait!

319
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,560
Wait!

320
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,280
He's so fast!

321
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,000
Shinichi, I need to confirm.

322
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,030
Confirm what?!

323
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,040
Is it acceptable to kill her?

324
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,170
Yes!

325
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,920
Just thinking about how she's 
still out loose in the world

326
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,920
makes my blood boil!

327
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,290
I told you to wait,

328
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,680
but you just up and ran off.

329
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,090
To get to the beach, you have 
to circle around that way—

330
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,220
Seriously?!

331
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,520
<i>Something just went out 
of sight at the other end.</i>

332
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,400
<i>That's her!</i>

333
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,300
Shinichi,

334
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,570
there's another thing I need to tell you.

335
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,580
It's about you.

336
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,250
I've only just become certain of it myself, but—

337
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Save it for later!

338
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,260
<i>I won't let you get away!</i>

339
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,300
<i>I'll make you pay!</i>

340
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,710
<i>You'll pay for killing Mom!</i>

341
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,380
Don't you move!

342
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,030
Dark Night's Passing

343
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,940
Next time:

344
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,870
"Dark Night's Passing."
