1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,850
What?

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,110
Mitsuo?

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,740
What's with him?

4
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,300
Hey, don't!

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,590
Shut up!

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,000
It's none of your business who I choose to fight.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,770
Shimada-kun?

8
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,880
I would rather avoid causing trouble,

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,400
so I went easy on you.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,200
But should you come looking for a 
fight again for no good reason...

11
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,750
I'll end you.

12
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:57,670
Parasyte

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,670
The Maxim

14
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,030
Test Results

15
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,510
Beyond Good and Evil

16
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,510
Yes!

17
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,570
Izumi-kun?

18
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,040
You're Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?

19
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,790
Huh?

20
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,860
Oh, um...

21
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,420
Oh, sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

22
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,470
Oh, no, I am Izumi.

23
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,850
Um, what's your name?

24
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,960
Murano.

25
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,610
Murano Satomi.

26
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,460
We were assigned to the same 
room for the entrance exam.

27
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,340
Oh, right... Sorry.

28
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,320
I was so tense, I didn't notice 
anything going on that day.

29
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
See you in April.

30
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,750
I hope we'll be in the same class!

31
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,830
Y-Yeah.

32
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,000
<i>His right hand's signal is weak again.</i>

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,070
<i>Why?</i>

34
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,760
<i>Is he asleep?</i>

35
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,360
<i>If I send a strong signal with no warning,</i>

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,270
<i>he should react reflexively...</i>

37
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,270
<i>Especially if I radiate hostility!</i>

38
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,120
<i>He's way too dense.</i>

39
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,530
Hide's a real hottie, huh?

40
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,440
Huh? Oh, I don't really...

41
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,040
Don't try to hide it.

42
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,000
I know you drew his face.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,920
What?! You snooped?!

44
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,780
He's so cool.

45
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,050
I've never seen a guy as hot as him.

46
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,540
I wonder if he's had plastic surgery.

47
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,840
What if his face is fake?

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,850
Nah, no way.

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,370
Hey, draw his face for me sometime, too.

50
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,450
I'll be waiting!

51
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,280
<i>Fake?</i>

52
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,870
Why can't we go public?

53
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,650
Our greatest fear

54
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,250
is triggering widespread panic due 
to lack of credible information.

55
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,740
When people stop trusting each other,

56
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,750
it'll lead to discrimination and fear,

57
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,770
then scaremongering and mass hysteria...

58
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,630
That's my son, Shinichi.

59
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,640
Hello, nice to meet you.

60
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,040
In any event,

61
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,900
we do not yet possess the means to 
distinguish them from normal humans.

62
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,290
There is nothing to be 
gained by going public now.

63
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,070
We are truly sorry about your wife.

64
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,910
However, if we may be blunt,

65
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,880
the current situation is akin to "just" 
having a few thousand or fewer

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,670
"savage beasts" roaming around Japan.

67
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,170
So, how is the sketch this time?

68
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,810
Yes, it was just like this.

69
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,060
I see.

70
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,860
So it can morph into anything.

71
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,950
Literally, anything's possible.

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,190
It appears there are quite 
a few rumors going around.

73
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,800
So it seems.

74
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,320
But we could have foreseen this.

75
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,450
If we continue mindless predation like insects,

76
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,430
we will be hunted down

77
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,970
and eradicated.

78
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,960
What weak and imperfect life forms we are.

79
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,780
You're probably the only one

80
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,960
who's given it so much thought.

81
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,470
I only have one question.

82
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,090
What is the purpose of our existence?

83
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,920
The answer is simple.

84
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,980
Man has become toxic to Earth,

85
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,560
and there was a need for a neutralizer.

86
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,070
So I am nurturing a toxin within me.

87
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,860
Did your visitors leave?

88
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
"Savage beasts," huh?

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,170
I've decided to tell at least you the truth.

90
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,010
Yes, it's about Mom.

91
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,040
<i>I just listened without saying anything.</i>

92
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,010
<i>I nodded as Dad spoke, without telling 
him a thing about my right hand.</i>

93
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,730
<i>At the end, Dad finally told 
me outright for the first time</i>

94
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,990
<i>that Mom was dead.</i>

95
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,650
<i>Today we're asking Professor Big Mouth</i>

96
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,050
Everyone Gush a Nosebleed

97
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,430
<i>for his expert opinion on 
when to brush your teeâ€”</i>

98
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,050
<i>Hey, I'm talking here! 
You think this is lion dance time?</i>

99
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,650
Uh-oh, he passed out again.

100
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,100
Ew, what's this? Gross.

101
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,100
D-Don't look at that!

102
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,890
This is for an ongoing investigation!

103
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,710
Oh, so that's your suspect?

104
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,940
O-Of course not! This is a monster!

105
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,630
Anyway, did you need something?

106
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,310
Yeah...

107
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,120
I wanted you to take a look at this.

108
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,020
Is he a friend of yours?

109
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,120
It's good work.

110
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,390
You have talent.

111
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,630
So, does anything about 
him strike you as odd?

112
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,870
Like, maybe his personality 
or his way of thinking...

113
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,380
You draw faces for a living,

114
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,110
so you can tell, right?

115
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,510
You've got to be kidding.

116
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,020
Not when this is all I've got to go on.

117
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,270
I see.

118
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,220
<i>He's alone again today.</i>

119
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,030
<i>Is he waiting for someone?</i>

120
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,960
<i>Or is he watching someone?</i>

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,840
Hey!

122
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,710
Heads up!

123
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,250
Uh...

124
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,890
Are you okay?

125
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,610
Yeah.

126
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,820
A... A fake face...

127
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,480
<i>I really have to patch things 
up with Murano today.</i>

128
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,360
Murano!

129
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,750
About the other day, that was...

130
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,260
Well, it wasn't anything serious.

131
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,890
She was just messing with me.

132
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,800
So...

133
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,150
Shinichi.

134
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,470
What, Migi?

135
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,980
Now's not a good time.

136
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,570
I'm sensing hostility in Shimada.

137
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,590
I believe I said I'd end you,

138
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,780
but if you insist.

139
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
Let's go somewhere...

140
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,160
away from prying eyes.

141
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,780
He has four to six targets,

142
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,210
most likely all human.

143
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,750
It will be a massacre.

144
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,750
Izumi-kun?

145
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,420
If you want to intervene, 
I can give you their location.

146
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,370
What do you want to do?

147
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,970
What choice do I have?!

148
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,070
Izumi-kun?!

149
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,900
This guy's being way too accommodating.

150
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,200
Maybe he doesn't get the situation he's in.

151
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,660
You guys don't get to touch him.

152
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,860
He's mine.

153
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,450
You can all come at me at once.

154
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,040
Someone who's something of 
a pest is on his way here.

155
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,500
If we're going to do this, it should be soon.

156
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,850
<i>It's over that wall.</i>

157
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
Izumi?

158
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,770
<i>He must have jumped more 
than three meters high.</i>

159
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,380
<i>Did his right hand help him?</i>

160
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,770
<i>That can't be...</i>

161
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,990
Shimada!

162
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,770
You've finally shown what you really are!

163
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,500
What I really am?

164
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,280
Do you want to fight me here, then?

165
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,310
I didn't seek out this situation.

166
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,030
I'm the victim here.

167
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,030
Isn't that right?

168
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,800
Go.

169
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,540
I'll take care of the rest.

170
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,210
I see.

171
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll leave you to it, then.

172
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,470
Hey, wait!

173
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,600
You're gonna run?

174
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,320
You think you're so hot.

175
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,730
You think you saved your friend's ass?

176
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,870
Friend?

177
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,240
You guys don't know anything.

178
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,010
Just go home.

179
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,240
And never go after that guy again.

180
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,990
I'm talking to you.

181
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,720
You're the leader here, aren't you?

182
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,400
<i>How'd he know?</i>

183
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,510
<i>He's never met Yano-san before.</i>

184
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,230
I like the look in your eyes.

185
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,330
<i>You shouldn't mouth off when you don't know shit.</i>

186
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,230
<i>If talking won't resolve matters,</i>

187
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,030
<i>maybe inflicting some pain will.</i>

188
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,080
Let's go!

189
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,160
Yano-san?

190
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,490
<i>We'll lose.</i>

191
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,820
<i>We'll lose if we try to fight him.</i>

192
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,030
Murano...

193
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,600
Um, here.

194
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,610
Thanks.

195
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,240
What do you want?

196
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,240
Just wondering what ended 
up happening to them.

197
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,990
That's none of your business anymore.

198
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,140
Did you use your hand?

199
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,250
I bet you beat all of them up.

200
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,340
I didn't do any of that!

201
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,090
Go. Just go!

202
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,090
You're hurting me.

203
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,670
Sorry.

204
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,440
Did something happen between 
you and Shimada-kun?

205
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,510
He's really messed up!

206
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,190
He might look harmless,

207
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,690
but he's a shit-faced asshole!

208
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,320
Izumi-kun...

209
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,070
You're not being yourself, Izumi-kun.

210
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,090
That's not how you talk.

211
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,580
It's not normal.

212
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,080
Not normal? How?

213
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,140
I don't know how to put it,

214
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,050
but the Izumi-kun I know isn't 
someone who says things like that.

215
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,430
To me, it looks like you're trying too hard.

216
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,450
I'm not trying too hard.

217
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,990
That's not true.

218
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,490
You're a completely different person now.

219
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,440
You've changed.

220
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,190
I may have changed,

221
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,820
but I'm not trying hard at it.

222
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,360
Why are you different, then?

223
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,200
Who can change like that without trying at it?!

224
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,200
Are you

225
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,650
really Izumi-kun?

226
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,210
Shut up!

227
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,730
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

228
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,150
It's because of the hole in my chest.

229
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,740
It could also be characterized 
as a hole in your back.

230
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,900
From my perspective, 
you have become stronger.

231
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,870
Perhaps not so much as a person,

232
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,660
but more as a life form.

233
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,430
You stay calm, no matter what happens.

234
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,520
You quickly recover from dips in your mood.

235
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,870
And your thought processes are quite logical.

236
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,140
In a way,

237
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,670
it's no wonder people think you've changed.

238
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,670
You're just saying whatever sounds good.

239
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,800
But this mental toughness 
works to your advantage.

240
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,790
Are you trying to cheer me up or something?

241
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,080
Maybe?

242
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,140
If necessary,

243
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,560
I'll think of other ways to cheer you up, for later.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,950
Well, that's sure nice of you.

245
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,690
<i>I saw it</i>

246
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,610
<i>with my own eyes.</i>

247
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,090
East Fukuyama Station

248
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,960
<i>He changed clothes.</i>

249
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,320
<i>Where's he going?</i>

250
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,020
<i>His face changed?!</i>

251
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,810
<i>He can change his face?</i>

252
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,210
<i>He can become someone else?</i>

253
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,440
<i>That's impossible!</i>

254
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,380
<i>It's almost as if...</i>

255
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,890
<i>No way...</i>

256
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,640
<i>It can't be!</i>

257
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,950
Haruki?

258
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,560
What is it, Yuko?

259
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,130
Why are you still in your uniform?

260
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,150
I want to ask you something.

261
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,690
We don't actually know what they are.

262
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,300
Some think they're aliens; others, mutants,

263
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,410
or bio-weapons...

264
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,290
But it's true that their faces can change?

265
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,690
Yeah, that's what witnesses say.

266
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,030
They also speak human language

267
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,420
and eat people.

268
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,440
Try to be careful if you're 
walking around at night alone.

269
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,180
Though relative to the population 
of the entire human race,

270
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,430
their numbers are few, so
I doubt you'll ever run into them.

271
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,680
R-Right, of course...

272
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,380
If only we could catch one of them alive.

273
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,780
<i>Eating people?</i>

274
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,810
<i>Shimada-kun is doing that?</i>

275
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,820
<i>I really should tell Haruki...</i>

276
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,960
But if I happen to be wrong...

277
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,410
I know.

278
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,550
I should talk to Shimada-kun first.

279
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,090
Fine Arts

280
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,860
<i>These would be way too obvious.</i>

281
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
<i>This should work.</i>

282
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,920
What'd you want to talk to me about?

283
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm pretty sure you've never 
even noticed me before,

284
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,850
but I've thought of you as a really cool guy.

285
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,540
I was always watching you.

286
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,950
So, well... I saw you.

287
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,360
I don't want to think that you're 
different from the rest of us,

288
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,190
but if you are what some rumors claim...

289
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,670
If you are... something that 
kills and eats human beings...

290
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,450
If I am?

291
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,050
If...

292
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,740
<i>If</i> you are, I want you to go 
home without saying a word

293
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,660
and never come back here again.

294
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,460
I don't want you to kill anyone anymore!

295
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,340
Did you tell anyone about this?

296
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,290
Hey...

297
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,350
Do you really kill people?

298
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,470
You see? Colloquial and classical 
Japanese are different.

299
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,280
You have to get a feel for the verbs.

300
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
Shinichi.

301
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,750
Not good.

302
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,860
Not good at all.

303
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,700
Sh-Shimada... kun...

304
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,510
That idiot!

305
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,490
Next time:

306
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,030
What Mad Universe

307
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,690
"What Mad Universe."
