Private Investigation Agency

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,590
Teito Private Investigation Agency

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,540
As for the P.I. himself...

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,280
I'll take care of him.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,990
What about the human with 
the parasite in his arm?

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,500
Miki's supposed to go tomorrow.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,260
Youko!

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,630
Yumi!

9
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,710
Parasyte

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,710
The Maxim

11
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,970
Happy Family

12
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,420
You know what I think?

13
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,950
Your combat style must be unique.

14
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,010
That's why others of my kind 
were done in so easily.

15
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,000
It's hard to comprehend that

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,370
even with the human brain intact, 
you're actually stronger.

17
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,920
Based on our analysis of the 
body in our dining area,

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,800
it doesn't seem like victory 
was immediate, either.

19
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,260
Oh, I guess it wasn't the 
right moment to laugh.

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,320
So, how do you usually do it?

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,480
Can you tell me how you fight?

22
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,890
What's with him?

23
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,850
He talks up a storm and he's creepy as hell.

24
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,170
Stay on guard.

25
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm sure he's trying to get a feel for us.

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,760
No matter how expressive he may seem,

27
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,750
keep in mind that it is totally 
alien from human emotions.

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,050
I see.

29
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,620
You always confer while you fight.

30
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,380
Is that effective?

31
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,170
You have excellent speed 
and motion detection.

32
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,050
I think it'll be a bit difficult 
to bring your body back intact.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,470
There are too many blades.

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,100
Why not produce more of your own?

35
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,410
It's not that simple.

36
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,060
They have to be of a certain size at minimum.

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,760
He's pretty slow.

38
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,970
You might be faster than him,

39
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,860
but it's not as if you have a lot of stamina.

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
Right...

41
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,850
I've been running all day.

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,420
I think we're in deep trouble.

43
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,550
I am also exhausted. The fight 
was short, but intense.

44
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,420
So we're a tired duo.

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,650
But we've managed to put some 
distance between us and him.

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,440
He's a new type of enemy, three on one body.

47
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,810
What about his legs?

48
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,610
His legs?

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,380
You said during the last fight

50
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,410
that the human part is their weakness.

51
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,130
If we can manage to strike his legs...

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Hmm...

53
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,730
What?

54
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,540
Is it not possible?

55
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,550
It bothers me

56
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,040
that I can't get a good sense of 
where his parasites are distributed.

57
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,710
Why not? There are three of them.

58
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,050
It has to be the head and both arms.

59
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,870
It should be, but somehow...

60
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,050
We messed up. He's caught up to us.

61
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,990
He tripped again.

62
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,940
"Again"?

63
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,000
Man, you really like to run.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,670
This is getting really tiresome.

65
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,930
Let's just forget about leaving bodies intact.

66
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,890
We don't have a choice.

67
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,300
We'll have to gamble.

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,790
Let's aim for the legs, as you suggested.

69
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,160
I'll block the next attack 
that comes from the right.

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,940
You'll have to dodge the
attack coming from the left

71
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,800
barehanded while holding your ground.

72
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,800
You're asking the impossible.

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,870
Oh?

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,870
Impossible.

75
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,650
I win!

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,020
What?

77
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,240
What was that?

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,920
A mid-air collision.

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,310
Between his own tentacles, no less.

80
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,380
What?

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,710
I'm getting a clearer picture 
of his true nature now.

82
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,250
True nature?

83
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,140
Yes.

84
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,280
I was certainly taken aback at first,

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,400
but it may be more for 
show than anything else.

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,670
I hope so.

87
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,050
First, the parasites encompass an area 
greater than his head and two arms.

88
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,610
The leg I managed to attack 
earlier wasn't human.

89
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,560
No way!

90
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,590
In any case, I am certain that the 
head is still the control center.

91
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,440
I don't sense independent thought 
in his arms' movements.

92
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,690
Here he comes.

93
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,600
I don't care how many times I have to run!

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,670
I found a good location.

95
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,200
Go into those woods!

96
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,530
His control center leaves 
something to be desired.

97
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,620
His bodily movements lack coordination.

98
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,030
That's why he trips and lets his 
tentacles collide in mid-air.

99
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,890
Above all,

100
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,750
why do you think his head does not 
morph and join in the offensive?

101
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,970
You're right...

102
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,720
The head has its hands full coordinating 
the arms and other parasitic components.

103
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,830
So, if the head were to morph, 
he would fall into chaos.

104
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,870
There's nothing to fear.

105
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,230
In the end, there is only one enemy.

106
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,180
All right, we'll fight here.

107
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,730
Stop.

108
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,340
Rather than aiming for the legs 
or torso, go for the head.

109
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,490
Decapitation is the most certain strategy.

110
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,400
But how do we...

111
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,710
We can do it!

112
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,180
At my signal, make a beeline for him

113
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,610
at top speed!

114
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,120
What?

115
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,390
Trust me.

116
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,380
I finally caught up with you guys.

117
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,550
Don't move!

118
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,270
<i>Using the trees as a shield,</i>

119
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,510
<i>dodge his attacks by moving 
right and left, and up and down,</i>

120
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,210
<i>while maintaining a constant distance.</i>

121
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,560
<i>If we continue to evade by 
moving in a straight line,</i>

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,210
<i>he'll become familiar with our movement</i>

123
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,310
<i>and predict our next move.</i>

124
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,850
<i>That's when we spring our surprise.</i>

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,100
Now!

126
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,220
<i>From his perspective,</i>

127
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,870
<i>the hunted, moving in a straight line,</i>

128
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,570
<i>is now suddenly the hunter, 
rushing toward him as a point.</i>

129
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,410
<i>What was parallel will 
have become perpendicular,</i>

130
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,660
<i>and horizontal, vertical.</i>

131
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,240
<i>To someone who already struggles 
to utilize his striking tentacles,</i>

132
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,880
<i>he won't gain his bearings in time to attack us.</i>

133
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,370
What?!

134
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,920
We did it!

135
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,430
What's wrong?

136
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,440
You can...

137
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,930
You can do that?

138
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,770
Time to swap leads.

139
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,690
Come back, Miki.

140
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,250
Well, this is embarrassing.

141
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,770
That goes without saying.

142
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,290
You should stay a right hand, Miki.

143
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,840
It wasn't three of them.

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,600
What?!

145
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,200
Look.

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,420
He is now completely one.

147
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,630
In an instant, he assumed 
control over his entire body

148
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,420
and became a single lifeform.

149
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,170
However, before that happened, 
their consciousness split into five.

150
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,430
In other words, there are <i>five </i>
total parasites on that body!

151
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,320
F-Five?!

152
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,270
When the other one was the "head,"

153
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,180
I felt there were three

154
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,440
because he was unable to unify them into one.

155
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,360
You are correct.

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,270
Only Miki and I can serve as the control,

157
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,190
and only I can unify everyone.

158
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,800
Migi...

159
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
Yeah, now is not the time to gawk in awe.

160
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,080
It appears we have traveled 
quite a ways while I was asleep.

161
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,650
I've seen you before.

162
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,420
You're...

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,800
His movements are totally different now!

164
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,970
Not even monkeys can move like that!

165
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,690
Being in the woods is now 
working to our disadvantage!

166
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,950
He's quite fast...

167
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,310
For a human.

168
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,900
Excuse me!

169
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,610
Shit.

170
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,420
We're getting on.

171
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,470
Shit!

172
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,540
No way!

173
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,300
He's even capable of <i>that</i>?

174
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,560
What the...

175
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,570
I... I'm going 60 kph.

176
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,940
Is that a monster?!

177
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,260
Migi...

178
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,580
It's not my fault.

179
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,260
I had no part in this!

180
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,940
That douchebag drove off!

181
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
Hey, are you okay?

182
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,140
I feel lethargic.

183
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,400
It must be from the blood loss earlier.

184
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,360
I don't have enough blood.

185
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,740
Blood?

186
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,760
I understand your pain.

187
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,460
Butâ€”

188
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,550
Is there anyone called Hirama-san here?

189
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,730
Hirama?

190
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,340
Chief.

191
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,780
You may go.

192
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,930
Kuramori-san,

193
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,270
I won't ask you why you know 
about Inspector Hirama.

194
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,320
You must have some idea

195
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,040
about the parasites.

196
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,200
Shinichi, buy some clothes.

197
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,690
We stand out too much.

198
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,120
Then we'll need to eat.

199
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,800
Sure, but I don't ha ve money.

200
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,600
What?!

201
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,270
Where'd you get that money?!

202
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,220
From the truck earlier.

203
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,300
But I am not human,

204
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,190
so don't bring up human laws and morals.

205
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,950
But you're <i>my</i> hand, aren't you?

206
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,630
This is what <i>I</i> did in 
order to preserve <i>my</i> life.

207
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,720
I am a different species from you,

208
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,240
but we are in a partnership,

209
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,080
which demands mutual respect.

210
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,330
On that premise, the common 
purpose that binds us

211
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,830
is survival.

212
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,830
But isn't that theft?

213
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,090
Sure.

214
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,590
Fried Pork Cutlet Set    Teriyaki Chicken Set   Grilled Pacific Saury Set

215
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,590
Moving on,

216
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,320
the police have revealed that Kuramori-san's 
wife and eldest daughter

217
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,140
were killed by a sharp, sword-like weapon.

218
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,140
<i>Kuramori? Can it be?!</i>

219
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,740
Furthermore, Kuramori-san's office,

220
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,300
which handled private investigations,

221
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,770
burned down the same night in what is
currently believed to have been arson.

222
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,150
Kuramori Family Massacre 
Possible Revenge Homicide

223
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,150
The police intend to question Kuramori-san

224
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,520
about the possible connection 
between these two cases.

225
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,630
They must've decided that he's 
too dangerous to keep alive.

226
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,060
His family was probably 
just collateral damage,

227
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,410
since their actual target got away.

228
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,570
I have to call Dad...

229
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,550
Shinichi?

230
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,660
Where are you, out so late?

231
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,980
Dad, listen closely.

232
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,050
Please get out of the house right now.

233
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,770
What's happened, Shinichi?

234
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,810
A lot of things...

235
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,710
I can't go home for a while.

236
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,580
Why?!

237
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,930
Tell me everything from the beginning!

238
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,150
Everything?

239
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,930
<i>There's no way I can tell him everything!</i>

240
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,570
<i>But I have to hurry...</i>

241
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,760
<i>If I don't...</i>

242
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,460
Dad, I...

243
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,820
I've been a good son in general, right?
I never really acted out.

244
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,090
I think I'm still a good son, even after Mom died

245
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,350
and it's just the two of us.

246
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,830
So I'm not trying to mess 
around right now, either.

247
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,010
So please, Dad.

248
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,350
Please leave the house right now!

249
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,030
A monster is coming!

250
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,720
It's the one that killed Mom!

251
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,870
And you're safe?

252
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,440
Yes.

253
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,650
All right.

254
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,680
I'll leave.

255
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,610
I trust you.

256
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,110
Thank you, Dad.

257
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,360
I am Hirama.

258
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,910
My sincere condolences 
for your wife and child.

259
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,890
Their bodies are still 
being examined by the M.E.,

260
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,710
but I believe what I saw confirms my beliefs.

261
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,310
Please tell me what you think.

262
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,880
Kuramori-san, let's avenge their deaths!

263
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,130
Avenge?

264
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,590
Yes!

265
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,320
Ever since I was a little boy,

266
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,840
I had a deep admiration 
for great detectives...

267
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,090
Like Sherlock Holmes...

268
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,390
And after many things happened,

269
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,920
I managed to become a 
private investigator, but...

270
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,270
Hey, listen...

271
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,560
You can still become a great detective.

272
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,690
Will I be able to avenge them?

273
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,110
Of course!

274
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,430
I... I have some information...

275
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,130
But my thoughts are all jumbled together.

276
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,960
Can I get something to write with,

277
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,410
and somewhere I can calm down?

278
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,020
Of course.

279
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,150
<i>No, this isn't telepathy.</i>

280
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,410
<i>But how many times has it been?</i>

281
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,440
<i>It's our sixteenth time 
meeting in your dreams,</i>

282
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,530
<i>though you'll forget all about it again.</i>

283
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,700
<i>But you look nothing like 
the Migi I know in reality.</i>

284
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,210
<i>You say the same thing every time.</i>

285
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,420
<i>You don't look anything like the 
Shinichi I know in reality, either.</i>

286
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,920
<i>What, leaving already?</i>

287
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,410
<i>I have learned that there is no way for 
me to communicate with the thirty percent</i>

288
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,330
<i>of my cells that have 
dissipated into your body.</i>

289
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,080
<i>There is no further point in our 
meeting like this in your dreams.</i>

290
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,080
<i>Besides, we really don't have much 
time to lose back in reality.</i>

291
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,480
<i>We don't?</i>

292
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,090
<i>You'll remember once you wake up.</i>

293
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,980
<i>Migi...</i>

294
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,070
<i>Huh?</i>

295
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,250
<i>What was I about to say?</i>

296
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,400
Brr...

297
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,080
Failure on both fronts?!

298
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,170
Inconceivable!

299
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,290
It was failure on my part to let 
you handle dealing with the P.I.

300
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,320
Killing his family without killing him?

301
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,680
You are ignorant of human nature.

302
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,380
The room was dark.

303
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,760
Don't we just need to kill him next?

304
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,390
You all underestimate humans.

305
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,050
Individually, they may appear weak,

306
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,450
but that is not the case.

307
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,080
What we need to recognize

308
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,830
is that humans are a single lifeform 
comprised of millions of individuals.

309
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,560
Besides their individual brains,

310
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,210
humans possess a different 
"brain" of enormous magnitude.

311
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,670
The moment we act in 
opposition to that brain,

312
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,840
we will lose.

313
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,960
<i>Lose?</i>

314
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,160
<i>Are you truly one of us?</i>

315
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,600
<i>Something is different.</i>

316
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,850
<i>Something...</i>

317
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,050
<i>Izumi-kun didn't even show 
up to school today.</i>

318
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,610
<i>He was acting like something really 
bad was going on yesterday, too.</i>

319
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,070
Satomi.

320
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,860
Here, take this.

321
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,520
It's the bag Izumi-kun left behind.

322
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,510
You should go take it to him.

323
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,890
Huh? But...

324
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,220
It'll be a chance to patch things up, too.

325
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,530
If you won't go, I will!

326
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,470
Kuramori-san.

327
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,210
We've been had...

328
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,620
But he's not a suspect.

329
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,930
Why would he run?

330
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,100
Kuramori

331
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,220
Tamura Reiko...

332
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,490
A "partner"?

333
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,890
<i>Youko, Yumi...</i>

334
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,990
<i>I will avenge your deaths 
with my own two hands...</i>

335
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,750
<i>Tamura Reiko!</i>

336
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,410
<i>Tamura Reiko...</i>

337
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>No, she is </i>not<i> one of us!</i>

338
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,740
<i>She's dangerous.</i>

339
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,260
<i>She's a threat</i>

340
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,260
<i>to our kind!</i>

341
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,760
<i>How mysterious.</i>

342
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,050
<i>You are a mystery.</i>

343
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,270
<i>This world is full of mystery.</i>

344
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,880
<i>Why was I...</i>

345
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,980
<i>Why were we born?</i>

346
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,030
<i>Like I thought, he's not home.</i>

347
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,240
<i>Where are you?</i>

348
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,160
<i>Hey, are you safe,</i>

349
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,090
<i>Izumi-kun?</i>

350
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,670
<i>Tamura Reiko, it was you.</i>

351
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,760
<i>You're the one who dragged me into this hell.</i>

352
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,430
<i>Three of them?</i>

353
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,140
<i>Their intent seems less than peaceful.</i>

354
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,750
<i>Where is she going?</i>

355
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,490
<i>No matter.</i>

356
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,150
<i>While I still have time...</i>

357
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,790
Good evening, Tamura-san.

358
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,290
It seems it's more difficult 
to conceal than I'd thought.

359
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,920
Yes, the strongest signal we 
are capable of emanating

360
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,590
is our intent to kill.

361
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,970
That's when we harbor animosity 
toward another, after all.

362
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,030
