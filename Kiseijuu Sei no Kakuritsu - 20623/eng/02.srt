1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,820
I... right hand... fail.

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,200
A dog, huh?

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,980
I suppose it's partially due 
to its maturation environment,

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,390
but it was negligent with its studies.

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,690
Parasyte

6
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,690
The Maxim

7
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,650
Demon in the Flesh

8
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,140
Hey, hey. Are you a college student?

9
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,820
Oh, you're not?

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,630
An office worker?

11
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,700
Seriously?

12
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,800
No way.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,390
You're super hot.

14
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,940
S-Sorry...

15
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,890
Hey, wait a second.

16
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,200
What's wrong with a little fun?

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,020
Yeah, come have fun with us. Just for a bit.

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,650
C'mon, yeah?

19
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,490
Whoa!

20
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,980
I'll walk you home.

21
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,130
You've got some guts to do that to us!

22
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,140
I don't think my stomach 
can hold four at once...

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,480
Four?

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,280
I overdid it and took two swings.

25
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,280
I suppose I should change 
my face, just to be safe.

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,060
You don't feel the need to 
go to the police anymore?

27
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
Yeah...

28
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,650
Without you, I'd be an easy kill

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,760
for those creepy parasitic creatures.

30
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,780
A wise decision.

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,140
Hey, I want to have a name to call you.

32
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,970
I don't.

33
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,150
I am neither a human being nor a pet.

34
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,150
But I can't just keep calling you "you" or "him"...

35
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,900
Then call me Migi.

36
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,280
What? "Migi"?

37
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,170
Yes.

38
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,100
I grew by eating your right <i>(migi)</i> hand,

39
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,280
hence "Migi."

40
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,180
You can be pretty simple-minded sometimes.

41
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,920
I simply lack interest in the concept of names.

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
Nice shot!

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
Izumi-kun's not bad!

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What?

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,520
I g-guess...

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,810
Izumi-kun!

47
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,160
Satomi says she'll forgive you

48
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,740
for what you did if you sink another shot!

49
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,520
Hey, Yuko!

50
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,040
Ow!

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,250
<i>What's with Nagai?</i>

52
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,010
Nagai

53
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,380
Five more seconds!

54
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,890
<i>Here goes nothing!</i>

55
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,730
Yeah!

56
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,390
Thank you, Migi.

57
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,430
That was amazing, huh, Satomi?

58
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,650
Yeah...

59
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,650
Damn Izumi.

60
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,510
Okay, I'll go on ahead.

61
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,410
U-Um...

62
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,370
I'm sorry!

63
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,530
I wasn't trying to touch you when I did.

64
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,750
My right hand just moved, and...

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,630
Um, I'm really sorry!

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,260
Are you truly sorry?

67
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,820
I am!

68
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,050
I seriously am!

69
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,790
Maybe I can forgive you if you'll treat 
me to some pancakes next Sunday.

70
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,310
If you do it again, though, you're toast.

71
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,190
I'll never do it again!

72
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,070
I promise!

73
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,570
All right.

74
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,710
It's a promise, then.

75
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,900
I-It's nothing!

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,170
I-I'm fine!

77
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,630
Izumi-kun.

78
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,660
You <i>are</i> Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,420
Wh-What are you talking about?

80
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,680
Of course I am.

81
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,800
Later.

82
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,190
What the hell was that about?!

83
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,480
I was curious about human mating behavior.

84
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,280
You wanted to mate with 
that female, didn't you?

85
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,860
What?!

86
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,200
Mate?!

87
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,410
It's not like that!

88
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,290
Izumi!

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,420
Come with me.

90
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,450
So were you talking to yourself 
to practice pick-up lines?

91
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,180
Huh?

92
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,830
Not really...

93
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,440
I have to change out of my gym clothes.

94
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,570
Hold it!

95
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,700
You know I like Murano, don't you?

96
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,310
Oh, you do?

97
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,310
Fight me.

98
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,190
Huh?

99
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,570
C'mon, gimme a break...

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,740
Why'd you do that?

101
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,710
What's the matter?

102
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,990
Can't fight back?

103
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,370
<i>If Migi goes all-out like before,</i>

104
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,530
<i>this guy might get seriously hurt.</i>

105
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:26,910
Bastard!

106
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,840
You weakling!

107
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't.

108
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,810
Learn to hold back a little, idiot.

109
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,060
"Idiot"?

110
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,400
That's something you call someone 
who is less intelligent than you.

111
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,090
You'd better not have killed him.

112
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,280
Don't worry.

113
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,410
By the way, Shinichi.

114
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,640
It is not good for your health to 
suppress your excretory functions.

115
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,210
Shinichi.

116
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,460
What?

117
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,840
I told you not to talk to me 
when people are around.

118
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,220
Let me try to cause an 
erection in this sex organ.

119
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,700
What did you say?!

120
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,170
Hey!

121
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,290
What are you doing?!

122
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,140
No!

123
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,820
Stop it!

124
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,380
It's cold, Shinichi.

125
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,350
Shut up.

126
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,660
If you don't keep yourself clean,

127
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,220
you'll trigger the propagation of 
dermatophytes, causing jock itchâ€”

128
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,200
Shut up!

129
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,740
Why are you talking to your Johnson?

130
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,000
The Mincemeat Murders?

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,130
Yeah.

132
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,810
Cases of people being torn 
to pieces are happening

133
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,880
in multiple locations around the world.

134
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,760
There are pretty graphic videos 
being upped to the net, too.

135
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,650
What about the killer?

136
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,700
They haven't caught him yet.

137
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,450
More like, no one person can tear up 
several people at the same time

138
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,530
in different places worldwide,

139
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,190
so I bet it's not just one killer,

140
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,900
but a fanatical cult or something.

141
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,170
Come to think of it, your 
brother's a detective, right?

142
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,510
Yeah, but he won't tell me 
anything about these murders.

143
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,090
If you think about it, wouldn't that mean

144
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,540
the cops and the government are 
already doing something about it?

145
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,920
So are they more of "yours," Migi?

146
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,180
More "Mincemeat Murders" Nationwide

147
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,180
That is certain.

148
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,910
I learned from observing 
the dog the other day

149
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,600
that those with dogs as hosts only eat dogs.

150
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,540
Those with humans as hosts eat humans.

151
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,480
We therefore specialize in cannibalism.

152
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,370
What are you thinking?

153
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,750
Should we really stay silent about this?

154
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,040
What do you mean by "should we stay silent"?

155
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,310
We can't just let them be.

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,130
They're killing people in droves.

157
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,870
What do you mean by "let them be"?

158
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,260
Listen!

159
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,500
Only we know their true nature.

160
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,790
There will only be more victims 
if we don't do something.

161
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,270
That's why...

162
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,380
That's why what?

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,800
If I tell the world about you 
and have them research you...

164
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360
What are you saying?

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,050
I do not understand your logic.

166
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,650
My kind are simply eating.

167
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,310
It's natural for life forms to eat.

168
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,440
Is it so unpleasant to you that 
your kind are being eaten?

169
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,020
Of course it is!

170
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,940
Human life is precious, isn't it?

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,110
I don't understand.

172
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,220
I only value my own life.

173
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,450
I have never considered the 
life of any other being valuable.

174
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm sure.

175
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,460
You are an animal. An insect.

176
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,210
Is that your attempt to be disdainful?

177
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,770
If you were to take actions that would harm me,

178
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,590
I would do everything in 
my power to prevent them.

179
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,780
Oh?

180
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,920
Can you survive if you oppose me?

181
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,350
You're just a parasite.

182
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,680
I will protect your life, of course.

183
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,860
But I am more than capable of 
making you incapable of speech.

184
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,000
I can also rob you of your sight and hearing.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,860
Whaâ€”

186
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,310
Ah.

187
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,240
I sense extreme terror.

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,470
You should rest awhile.

189
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,430
Demon...

190
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,380
More "Mincemeat Murders" Nationwide

191
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,230
Shinichi, upon researching 
the concept of demons,

192
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,140
I believe that, among all life, 
humans are the closest thing to it.

193
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,390
Although humans kill and eat 
a wide variety of life forms,

194
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,450
my kind eat merely one or two kinds at most.

195
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,400
We are quite frugal in comparison.

196
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,680
I don't even want to hear that kind of logic.

197
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,230
<i>People are being killed.</i>

198
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,680
<i>I'm the only one who knows 
what the killers really are.</i>

199
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
We're mincemeat...

200
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
"Mincemeat Murders"

201
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,880
<i>Foolish humans. Why act so surprised when 
you turn cows and pigs into mincemeat</i>

202
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,450
<i>without batting an eye?</i>

203
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,520
<i>Well, now. How rare.</i>

204
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,270
<i>He is one of my kind.</i>

205
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,280
Shinichi.

206
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,520
One's approaching.

207
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Huh?

208
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,000
One of my kind.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,290
It's somewhere among the crowd to our left.

210
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,040
I am certain of it, although 
there are too many people for me

211
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,240
to identify the individual.

212
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,570
We should distance ourselves.

213
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,390
One misstep and we will have to 
fight to the death yet again.

214
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,920
Pick up the pace.

215
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,170
It's coming closer.

216
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,270
Maybe it wants to invite us 
to join Cannibals Anonymous?

217
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,570
Shinichi, where do you think you're going?

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,280
It is approximately 40 meters away, 
immediately behind you.

219
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,800
I want to meet this murderer face-to-face.

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
Don't be an idiot.

221
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,930
You'll get yourself killed.

222
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,970
Then you should protect me.

223
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,290
I doubt it will play out the same way 
it did with the dog last time.

224
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,700
No one will see us here, right?

225
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,730
I find the human psyche 
difficult to comprehend.

226
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,800
Right now, you seem numb to fear.

227
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,810
Why?

228
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,560
Many people have been killed.

229
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,470
<i>If I don't do something, 
even Murano might be...</i>

230
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,260
You're telling me I should 
just stand by and watch,

231
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,290
even if I know who's killing people?

232
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm going to fight for humanity!

233
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,700
For humanity... I see.

234
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,140
And I need your help to do that!

235
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,980
Help me.

236
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,990
C'mon, Migi!

237
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,190
Five more meters.

238
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,730
I see.

239
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,090
So that is why you ran.

240
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,470
This human's brain survived, wholly intact.

241
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,600
He is certainly a danger.

242
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,110
Shut up, you monster!

243
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,380
What?

244
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,640
Stop right there!

245
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,200
If you attack this human, I will kill you!

246
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,020
Now, wait.

247
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,330
I see.

248
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,170
I understand where you're coming from.

249
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,960
But, Mr. Right Hand, you know 
you can simply move over to me.

250
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,570
Move over?

251
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,960
Relocation should not be possible at this point.

252
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,420
What?

253
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,760
You still have a lot of learning to do.

254
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
As you say, relocation from 
a simplistic structure

255
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,360
like the arm to the more 
complex head is not possible.

256
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,530
But from an arm to an arm? Easy.

257
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,030
Well?

258
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,580
I made a spot especially for you.

259
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,110
Now do you believe me?

260
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,190
Now, come over and become my right arm!

261
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,880
We'll be stronger if we inhabit the same host.

262
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,870
What's the matter?

263
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,970
Hurry up and kill that human, and come over.

264
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm losing valuable blood.

265
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,130
If we manage this body together,

266
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,760
we should be able to live 
for at least 140 years.

267
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,770
M-Migi...

268
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,820
You try my patience.

269
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,590
But you won't have a choice once 
I cut off that human's head.

270
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,360
<i>Hold on!</i>

271
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,430
A-Are you mad?!

272
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,930
H-How dare you?!

273
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,400
M-My... body...

274
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,590
My...

275
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,970
M...y...

276
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,340
Migi...

277
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,480
Did you save my life?

278
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,310
I was simply uncertain as to 
whether relocation was possible.

279
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,480
I value only my own life.

280
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,710
I am tired now. Going to sleep.

281
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,700
M-My body...

282
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,580
M...y...

283
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,400
<i>Migi prioritized my life over that other one.</i>

284
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:13,500
<i>Migi may have just wanted to 
save his own life, but...</i>

285
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,920
Hey, Migi...

286
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,370
Mm. Yummy!

287
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,030
Yeah.

288
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,780
What's with the lack of enthusiasm?

289
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,720
Huh?

290
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Oh, that's not what I meant...

291
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,660
Mm! Yummy!

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,420
That just sounded forced.

293
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,040
My parents are real uptight right now 
about me even leaving the house.

294
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,810
Huh? Why?

295
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,490
Well, because of everything going on,

296
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,250
like the Mincemeat Murders.

297
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,380
Oh...

298
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,600
I'd hate to be turned into mincemeat.

299
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,260
Yeah...

300
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,470
<i>If Murano ever found out about Migi,</i>

301
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,100
<i>I bet she'd freak out.</i>

302
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,910
Is something wrong?

303
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,410
You like animals, right?

304
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,540
Sure, I do.

305
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,500
I don't do snakes, though.

306
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,910
Are you okay?

307
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,510
Yeah...

308
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,510
Let's play in the sandbox!

309
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,160
Man, so close!

310
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,200
You suck.

311
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,150
My turn.

312
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,910
You missed.

313
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,310
That's horrible!

314
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,330
Yeah...

315
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,210
Let's go.

316
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,940
I don't want to watch.

317
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,980
Yeah.

318
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,000
What's with him?

319
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,000
Cut it out, you guys.

320
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,000
Wha?

321
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,310
Izumi-kun...

322
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,170
It's just a game.

323
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,010
No one asked you to butt in!

324
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,520
Animals aren't toys!

325
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
They're alive, just like you.

326
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,860
Corny!

327
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Are you kidding me?

328
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,740
Watch out!

329
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,900
<i>Want me to eat you?</i>

330
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,230
Let's go.

331
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,880
O-Okay.

332
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,060
<i>Just like Migi said,</i>

333
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:21,910
<i>maybe humans are the closest 
things to demons alive.</i>

334
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,640
Izumi-kun.

335
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,250
Yeah?

336
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,540
You <i>are</i> Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?

337
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,190
Yeah, of course.

338
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,010
The Feast

339
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,300
Next time:

340
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,680
"The Feast."
