1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,310
Where is he?!

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,310
Hey, you okay?

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,320
Did you just wake up?

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,360
<i>Tachikawa...</i>

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,990
Where are you going?

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,380
Izumi, where do you think you're going?

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,690
Parasyte

8
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,690
The Maxim

9
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,510
You shouldn't move.

10
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,600
It'll only hurt more if you do.

11
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,850
What Mad Universe

12
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,900
Paint Thinner

13
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,770
Hey, look.

14
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,420
Hey, are you okay?!

15
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,910
<i>What is this?!</i>

16
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,720
<i>Shit!</i>

17
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,240
<i>I morphed without thinking, 
and some of it got inside me.</i>

18
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,990
There was something up there, wasn't there?

19
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,180
Yeah. Let's check it out!

20
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,910
That sound came from the Fine Arts room.

21
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,320
He's on the move.

22
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,100
To where?

23
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,820
Something's not right.

24
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,350
Is this really Shimada?

25
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,610
His thoughts are disjointed...

26
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,490
Or, rather, completely incoherent.

27
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,870
Hey, what was that sound?

28
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,100
I think there's something 
in the Fine Arts room.

29
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,250
"Something"?

30
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,060
All right, I'll go take a look.

31
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,370
You guys go back to class.

32
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,370
Aw, no way.

33
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,250
Come on, Sir.

34
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>I must...</i>

35
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,600
<i>I must restore my human appearance...</i>

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,910
<i>I can't...</i>

37
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,260
<i>The cells on the surface are...</i>

38
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,470
<i>My body is maintaining attack formation...</i>

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,100
<i>How can I restore my human appearance?</i>

40
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,140
<i>Wait, "attack"?</i>

41
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,400
<i>I can't contact my cells due to 
interference from the dead cells.</i>

42
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,690
<i>I have to unify my thoughts first.</i>

43
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,280
Huh?

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,010
<i>What?</i>

45
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,030
<i>What am I doing?</i>

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,550
Hey, what's going on?

47
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,910
What's that you're wearing 
on top of your head?

48
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,960
Oh.

49
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,800
What's wrong?

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,210
He just killed about three of something.

51
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,250
O-Over there!

52
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,100
O-O-Over there!

53
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,980
What is he talking about?

54
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,250
C-C-Call the police!

55
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,570
O-Okay!

56
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,770
Where is he, Migi?

57
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,720
Wait.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,490
Shimada's signal is scattered to the extreme.

59
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,370
He's moving quickly toward your classroom.

60
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,520
What?!

61
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,300
I can't get through here.

62
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,400
Combat will be impossible 
in these circumstances.

63
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,640
For now, let's evacuate with the others.

64
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,000
Didn't something like this happen before?

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,520
You mean Killer A?

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,480
What now?

67
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,830
Obviously it's Killer B.

68
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,530
What are you doing?!

69
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,590
Go! Now!

70
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,530
Go! Hurry!

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,080
Is Sasaki okay?

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,290
He looks more dangerous 
than whatever's going on.

73
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,800
Students are to go home immediately once you

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,040
confirm that everyone in your class is here!

75
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,470
But what about our belongings?

76
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,170
Get them tomorrow, okay?

77
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,880
Oh, Vice Principal.

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,660
None of the Class 3-3 students are here.

79
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,300
What?!

80
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,510
<i>That's Murano's class.</i>

81
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,590
Aren't the police here yet?!

82
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,010
Now that you mention it, 
they are rather late.

83
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,530
Migi, what is Shimada's position?

84
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,060
Are we going to fight him, then?

85
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm more worried about Murano's class right now!

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,320
Shinichi!

87
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,920
It's Class 3-3!

88
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,580
<i>I don't see her.</i>

89
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,460
<i>Don't tell me... Murano...</i>

90
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,240
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

91
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,390
<i>Was that our last conversation?</i>

92
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,820
<i>No way.</i>

93
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,780
<i>I can't accept that.</i>

94
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,640
Shimada's on the third floor.

95
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,290
Calm down, Shinichi!

96
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,300
Shinichi, control your breathing!

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,010
<i>What have I...</i>

98
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,670
<i>What have I been doing all this time?!</i>

99
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,340
<i>I'm breaking.</i>

100
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,390
<i>My heart's breaking...</i>

101
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,310
<i>It's about to split in two.</i>

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,930
You're fine.

103
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,810
You should be fine.

104
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,510
<i>I can't...</i>

105
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,500
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

106
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,030
Izumi-kun, you've changed.

107
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,950
Are you... made of steel?

108
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
...steel?

109
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,430
Have you calmed down?

110
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,510
Yeah.

111
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,420
<i>I'm going to protect Murano.</i>

112
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,910
<i>To do that, I will kill him.</i>

113
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,960
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

114
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,380
Migi, how far are we from Shimada?

115
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,020
About 60 meters.

116
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,270
He's on this floor.

117
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,300
There are two people far away,

118
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,930
and three relatively close by.

119
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,990
And one "animal."

120
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,020
You have excellent hearing.

121
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,050
It's coming from over there.

122
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,830
Are you okay?

123
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,400
Are you hurt?

124
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,210
Murano...

125
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,510
It's okay now!

126
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,420
It'll be okay.

127
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,010
Wh-Where did you come from?

128
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,610
Can you get up?

129
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,650
I guess not.

130
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,330
All right, let's go together.

131
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,900
G-Go where?

132
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,610
I came from over that way.

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,300
Let's go back there.

134
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,110
What?!

135
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,860
B-But that's where...

136
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,140
That's where everyone's dead.

137
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,680
Right now, it's safe.

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,700
He's not there.

139
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,370
N-No way!

140
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,710
You said you came from over there, right?

141
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,390
Are you...

142
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,710
human?

143
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,770
Don't!

144
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,920
Come back!

145
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,060
<i>He's right there...</i>

146
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,740
<i>This is his true nature!</i>

147
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,760
<i>He said they were looking for 
ways to coexist with humans,</i>

148
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,990
<i>but in the end, all he can 
think about is killing them!</i>

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,490
<i>He's coming!</i>

150
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,710
It's okay!

151
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,580
I'm going to jump one more time!

152
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,590
It should be safe here.

153
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,040
I-Izumi-kun, I...

154
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,370
I know.

155
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,220
Anyone would panic when something 
this messed up happens.

156
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,710
I'm fine.

157
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,920
Please take care of her.

158
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,480
I-Izumi-kun.

159
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,620
You'll be safe now.

160
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,780
<i>There's something I have to do.</i>

161
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,090
We can't go in now.

162
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,190
You still want to fight him?

163
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,200
We knew what Shimada was,

164
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,290
yet we did nothing and left him alone.

165
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,810
I think we're partly responsible for this.

166
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,240
I guess I'm saying...

167
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,180
We're responsible for ending it.

168
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,780
You're saying peculiar things again.

169
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,520
Let the police handle this.

170
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,840
Under the circumstances, they will win.

171
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,440
Don't move!

172
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,940
This is the police!

173
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,240
Damn it!

174
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,370
You monster!

175
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,000
They're shooting at him.

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,990
He won't die from a few small rounds.

177
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,610
They'll need to decapitate him

178
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,260
or destroy his heart.

179
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,020
Still, if injured enough, 
he will eventually succumb.

180
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,530
He's heading to the roof?

181
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,350
All right.

182
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,280
But don't approach him carelessly.

183
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,850
Migi, do you think Shimada is at fault?

184
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,760
"Fault"?

185
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,020
That is for humans to decide 
with their arbitrary metrics.

186
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,390
I think we should finish this.

187
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,280
How?

188
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,220
With this.

189
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,820
But we will need to keep a 
distance of at least 300 meters,

190
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,910
or Shimada will sense us.

191
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,110
Yeah.

192
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,360
<i>Shimada, this isn't just about you.</i>

193
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,530
<i>There's also Tamiya Ryoko and A.</i>

194
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,120
<i>For what purpose did you 
all come into existence?</i>

195
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,880
Just add my strength to yours.

196
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,560
Yeah.

197
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,490
You know where to aim, right?

198
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,630
Of course.

199
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,450
Izumi...

200
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:22,230
One Week After Student Massacre

201
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:22,230
Nishi Fukuyama High School

202
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,470
<i>A week has now passed since the 
massacre that resulted in 17 victims.</i>

203
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,760
<i>Circumstances surrounding the identity 
of the presumed killer, a student</i>

204
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,320
<i>with a drug addiction, are suspect.</i>

205
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,230
<i>Police have found his identity to be forged.</i>

206
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,600
Why are the police trying 
so hard to hide the truth?

207
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,610
They should just show Shimada's body.

208
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,410
Even if they did show it,

209
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,010
and made it public knowledge

210
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,240
that there exist sentient 
life forms who eat humans,

211
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,620
what would that accomplish?

212
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,310
Accomplish?

213
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,190
Well, there'd be an uproar

214
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,240
and calls to capture all the parasites.

215
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,910
How would they catch them?

216
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,450
Huh?

217
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,280
Humans can't do it alone.

218
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,260
We'll have to cooperate with the police.

219
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,640
I refuse.

220
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,020
Migi...

221
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,810
I am my own ally.

222
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,630
I am not an ally to the human species.

223
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,950
I know that, but...

224
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,670
Even if humans find a parasite 
camouflaged as a human being,

225
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,430
it can assume another identity right away.

226
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,220
Humans will not be able to catch them.

227
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,150
That's why we'll chase them down, and...

228
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,270
Kill them?

229
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,790
Shinichi, I do not possess human emotions,

230
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,790
Crime and Punishment

231
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:32,170
Crime and Punishment

232
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,250
so killing my kind has no 
psychological effect on me.

233
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,170
But what if you were in my position?

234
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,690
<i>Saying this distresses him.</i>

235
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,690
<i>This is what humans are.</i>

236
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,460
Until now, we have been keeping their 
existence a secret to avoid panic.

237
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,230
However, perhaps it is now time 
to make it public knowledge.

238
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,080
But going public will only lead to further chaos.

239
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,580
There are rumors that they're trying 
to weaponize parasites in the U.S.

240
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,600
Let's go public.

241
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,400
What?

242
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,560
And how do you intend to go about it?

243
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,790
By public,

244
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,360
I don't necessarily mean revealing 
the parasites' existence,

245
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,410
but rather, implicitly suggesting 
the means of distinguishing

246
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,830
between human beings and parasites.

247
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,930
And how will we do that?

248
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,370
Wait, we have a way to do that?

249
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,430
To tell them apart?

250
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,240
I'll let Dr. Yui explain.

251
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,760
I'll now explain what we've uncovered so far

252
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,560
regarding the parasite's physiology.

253
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,790
This parasitic life form has the ability
to serve as the human brain;

254
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,720
that is, the command 
center of the entire body,

255
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,930
and to push it beyond its physiological limits.

256
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,460
Their cells resemble neurons,

257
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,590
but could be characterized as sentient muscle.

258
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,970
Huh. "Sentient muscle"...

259
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,840
However, they are capable of much more.

260
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,660
They can morph in an instant

261
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,200
to stretch like rubber or become as hard as steel.

262
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,980
Then, how can such an alien cell type 
form connections with the human body?

263
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,050
That is accomplished by instantaneous 
fusion between the two cell types.

264
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,440
It's likely made possible by compounds 
similar to polyethylene glycols,

265
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,660
which act on the cell membrane toâ€”

266
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
Professor, please tell us how 
to tell them apart first.

267
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,000
What?

268
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,100
Ah.

269
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,620
So...

270
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,180
Although they are sentient muscle,

271
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,020
when enough of their cells assemble,

272
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,120
they possess intelligence 
on par with that of humans.

273
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,880
But if there aren't enough, 
what do you think happens?

274
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,890
Physiology of Parasitic Life Form

275
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,470
If they cannot secure blood circulation,

276
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,960
they shrivel up and die,

277
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,550
so they try to fuse with 
other cells of their kind.

278
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,570
Should they become a fragment 
about the size of a hair,

279
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,440
they may writhe out of survival instinct,

280
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,890
but they are too small to possess the 
necessary intelligence to rejoin their kind.

281
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,680
When you pull out human 
hair, nothing happens.

282
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,810
But if you pull out hair from 
a camouflaged parasite,

283
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,940
the "hairs" will writhe for several seconds

284
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,280
before the cells separate and die.

285
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,410
In other words,

286
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,790
pulling out a strand of hair is 
one way to identify a parasite.

287
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,540
Well done, Professor.

288
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,130
But what if they wear wigs?

289
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,900
If you harbor any suspicions,

290
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,100
you can try eyebrows, or even nosehairs.

291
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,640
The idea is to isolate a hair-sized 
mass from the main body.

292
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,800
I see.

293
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,020
If that's the case...

294
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,790
Now, I do apologize for the intrusion,

295
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,310
but before you all leave this room,

296
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,770
I ask that you allow me to 
pull out a strand of your hair.

297
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,010
Although the possibility that 
one of them is among us is low,

298
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,340
it is not zero.

299
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,780
<i>After a time, our school reopened.</i>

300
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,660
Murano...

301
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,580
Izumi-kun.

302
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,660
Are you doing okay now?

303
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,910
Yeah.

304
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,250
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your messages.

305
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,050
It's okay.

306
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,790
Shall we go?

307
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,010
Yeah.

308
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,180
How is Tachikawa?

309
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,810
Yuko's better, too.

310
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,800
She said she'll come to school today.

311
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,690
I see.

312
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,380
It sounded like she had a hell of a scare.

313
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,490
She's always been a strong person.

314
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,720
Yeah...

315
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,140
I've been wanting to thank you.

316
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,210
If you hadn't been there...

317
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,000
It's all in the past.

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,250
Let's try to think of other things.

319
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,450
Okay.

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,590
But are you okay?

321
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,690
You jumped down from pretty far up.

322
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,300
Yeah, I guess it was an 
adrenaline rush or something...

323
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,650
I'm surprised, myself.

324
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,720
I see.

325
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,740
But I really mean it.

326
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,990
Thank you.

327
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,320
Sure.

328
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
Morning!

329
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,490
Morning!

330
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,220
<i>In the end, the government did 
not make a public announcement</i>

331
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,440
<i>about the parasites' existence.</i>

332
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,260
<i>But a fad began in which</i>

333
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,130
<i>people would greet each other by 
pulling out each other's hair.</i>

334
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,010
The Blue Bird

335
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,830
Next time:

336
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,940
"The Blue Bird."
