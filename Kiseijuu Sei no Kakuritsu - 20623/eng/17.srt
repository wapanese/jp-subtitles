1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,610
Good evening, Tamura-san.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,110
It seems it's more difficult 
to conceal than I'd thought.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,350
Yes, the strongest signal we are capable 
of emanating is our intent to kill...

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,730
Or just hostility.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,540
Why didn't you run, then?

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,740
I was curious.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,560
I let it get the better of me.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,300
Are there any others who support this decision?

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,340
It is just us three.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,970
Neither Hirokawa nor Gotou are aware.

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,370
I see.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,900
What is your reasoning?

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,100
My intuition.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,400
You will pose a great threat to us all in the future.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,070
I see.

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,230
You're like A.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,910
"A"?

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,150
We parasites behave and think in ways

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,920
that are very logical and clearcut.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,520
I had thought it would be easy enough 
for us to create a united organization,

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,960
but it appears I was wrong.

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,550
However, it makes me happy to 
realize that parasites, myself included,

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,400
have come to possess individual 
differences of this magnitude,

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,530
or should I say, individuality.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,670
In fact, I am quite moved by 
your decision to lynch me.

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,860
Well, this is farewell, then.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,360
Did you truly believe you could beat 
me if there were three of you?

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,340
Don't let her get away!

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,230
Kill her!

30
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,700
Parasyte

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,700
The Maxim

32
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,700
The Adventure of the Dying Detective

33
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,940
My body's muscle strength exceeds yours.

34
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,660
Even in single combat, I would win.

35
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,700
Ignorance is bliss.

36
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,680
Not fast enough!

37
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,660
You can keep that.

38
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,290
Why'd she split in two?

39
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,350
I'll go after her!

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Tamura has entered his body?

41
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,630
You okay?

42
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,620
Yeah.

43
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,930
There she is.

44
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,690
That's her.

45
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,130
H-Hey.

46
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,940
Huh?

47
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,680
Why're you putting pebbles in your bag?

48
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,130
To protect myself from perverts.

49
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,710
Sorry, we mistook you for someone else.

50
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,700
We saw this lady who only had half her head,

51
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,130
and you're dressed the same as 
she was, so we just thought...

52
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,980
Half her head?

53
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,690
Huh, that's weird.

54
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,830
But my head's empty!

55
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,100
<i>She's beyond reason.</i>

56
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,750
<i>Tamura is no longer capable of rational thought.</i>

57
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,740
<i>Besides, I doubt half a parasite 
can maintain her bodily functions.</i>

58
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,980
<i>What she's doing is suicide.</i>

59
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,410
<i>Pointless.</i>

60
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,050
<i>Is this how Tamura Reiko, 
the one known for her intellect,</i>

61
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,030
<i>will meet her end?</i>

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,900
My legs...

63
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,370
My lower body!

64
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,710
What are you doing?!

65
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,810
It's not me!

66
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,270
It's not... me!

67
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,740
<i>One of us died?</i>

68
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,230
I see.

69
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,300
You can survive if you burrow inside.

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,580
But can you really take over 
when there's only half of you?

71
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,810
Can you really win against 
me in that damaged body?

72
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,000
Stop!

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,190
It's my body!

74
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,450
Don't!

75
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,110
Stop!

76
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,260
Who's speaking?

77
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,350
Is it Hikawa?

78
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,700
Or is it Tamura?

79
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,130
Please stop!

80
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,570
I'm on your side!

81
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,450
If that's true, why are you approaching me?

82
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,190
Shit!

83
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,330
I've lost control of everything below my neck!

84
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,850
Give it up!

85
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,830
Die along with that fragment of Tamura Reiko!

86
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm on your side!

87
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,770
How dare you...

88
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,710
How dare you?

89
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,230
How dare you?!

90
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,140
How dare you?!

91
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,680
This is your strategy?

92
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,970
The body you tried to take over is in shreds!

93
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,340
Come out!

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,130
How long do you intend to hide in there?

95
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,240
When did you...

96
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,500
Given that our human bodies are our weakness,

97
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
you should strike them down in a single 
blow without making a show of it.

98
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,710
Even if our human bodies are destroyed,

99
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,060
parasite cells continue to survive 
for a certain length of time

100
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,730
and emit signals,

101
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,350
as you are now experiencing firsthand.

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,370
The strongest signals we emit are animosity

103
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,230
and our intent to kill.

104
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,010
It is an important means of distinguishing

105
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,900
whether a parasite we 
cannot see but can detect

106
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,490
is friend or foe.

107
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,120
However, you decimated Hikawa's 
body despite her being an ally,

108
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:45,110
and consequently spread fragments of 
flesh emanating animosity around you.

109
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,750
That's right.

110
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,070
Those fragments acted as camouflage

111
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,340
and masked my signal as I approached you.

112
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,870
Impossible...

113
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,070
Even that... was part of your plan?

114
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,520
Where have we come from? 
Where are we going?

115
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,770
Have you ever thought of such 
things, like a human might?

116
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,440
Goodbye, Kusano-san.

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,430
Cannibalism, then...

118
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,250
<i>It's unlocked.</i>

119
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,590
To Mother-
 Come to Hikari Park 1 
tomorrow at 5 PM 
-Detective Sherlock Holmes

120
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,380
You're more formidable than 
I'd thought, Detective.

121
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,180
Huh? He left?

122
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,820
He's not staying at your hotel?

123
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,990
Dad?!

124
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,410
Why are you at home?!

125
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,800
He hasn't been here.

126
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,420
Why are <i>you</i> there?!

127
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,010
Good morning.

128
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,780
Are you there to kill him?!

129
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,560
I have no time for that.

130
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,160
I wanted to contact you 
regarding a personal matter.

131
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,520
Do you know where Hikari Park 1 is?

132
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,000
I'd like you to be there today at 5:20 PM.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,570
What are you talking about?!

134
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,380
There's something I'd like to give you,

135
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,950
because you're someone who's halfway 
between human and parasite.

136
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,260
<i>A mother, huh?</i>

137
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,290
Who are you?!

138
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,800
Ryoko.

139
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,720
Where is Ryoko?!

140
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,110
<i>No one's home again.</i>

141
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,050
<i>I wonder what's going on.</i>

142
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,180
Y-You're Izumi-san, right?

143
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,520
Um, where's Shinichi-kun?

144
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,140
He's not here.

145
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,130
Oh, um...

146
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,810
Are you... his mother?

147
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,430
No. Do I look that old to you?

148
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,890
Oh, no.

149
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,970
Would you please tell me what happened?

150
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,700
Isn't Shinichi-kun involved in 
something really dangerous?

151
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,950
Something really dangerous?

152
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,420
I mean...

153
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,200
I can tell something's going on, at least.

154
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,830
Izumi-kun never says anything, but...

155
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,000
I see you're worried about him.

156
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,090
I'm envious...

157
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,970
Huh?

158
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,240
Don't worry.

159
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,350
He's much tougher than he looks.

160
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,220
He'll come back soon, perfectly fine.

161
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,980
When is "soon"?

162
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,230
<i>I've seen her somewhere before...</i>

163
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,430
I wonder where Izumi-kun's gone off to.

164
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,220
I can't believe his nerve.

165
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,750
He has no idea how worried we are.

166
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,610
<i>He'll come back... soon.</i>

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,670
<i>It might even be today.</i>

168
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,640
You'll come back, right?

169
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,300
<i>He'll come back!</i>

170
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,650
Hey.

171
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,900
It's going to be okay. Don't worry.

172
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,500
<i>He'll come back.</i>

173
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,910
<i>I'm sure of it!</i>

174
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,180
What's wrong?

175
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,530
Sorry! Go on without me!

176
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,270
<i>I think this is where Kana-san lived.</i>

177
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,030
<i>I wonder if Kana-san knew</i>

178
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,030
<i>the things about Izumi-kun that I don't know.</i>

179
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,770
Hey, wait!

180
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,680
Ugh!

181
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,150
Damn it, she's so quick on her feet!

182
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,070
Hey!

183
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,850
Don't do that!

184
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,880
A young girl like you shouldn't 
say such things so loud!

185
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,570
Oh...

186
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,330
To Mother- 
 Come to Hikari Park 1 
tomorrow at 5 PM 
 -Detective Sherlock Holmes

187
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,270
What's this?

188
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,410
Oh, there, there, there.

189
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,420
Peek-a-boo!

190
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,070
You're good with babies.

191
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,690
My wife was the breadwinner for a time.

192
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,460
I did a lot of babysitting.

193
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,210
There, there, there.

194
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,350
Peek-a-boo!

195
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,360
I got here too early.

196
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,770
Then walk around.

197
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,550
I'd like to check out the terrain.

198
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,090
All right.

199
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,870
Hikari Park 1

200
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,850
So even a cold-blooded monster 
values her own child.

201
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,010
I have been researching humans.

202
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,140
I can somewhat understand 
your irrational behavior.

203
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,210
Oh?

204
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,730
That's good to hear.

205
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,440
But you still can't understand!

206
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,070
You don't know what it means to be human...

207
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,980
What it means to be a parent!

208
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,010
The enormity of the happiness you've 
created for yourself in your life!

209
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,200
The crushing weight of grief 
when you've lost everything!

210
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,450
None of you know!

211
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,850
Even if I killed this baby right here and now,

212
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,210
you wouldn't grieve.

213
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,990
You'd just think, "Oh, okay."

214
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,220
Am I wrong?

215
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,840
Besides, this is not your baby.

216
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,220
It is a human baby.

217
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,880
<i>What is this?</i>

218
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,890
<i>I've never sensed such a signal 
coming from one of my kind.</i>

219
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,700
<i>It is Tamura Reiko, but...</i>

220
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,070
<i>What is this emotion?</i>

221
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,830
You'll never understand.

222
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,490
You just can't.

223
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:11,770
But if you could at least experience 
one iota of the grief I've felt...

224
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,730
I-It was just a joke...

225
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,720
As if a human...

226
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,660
could kill a... human baby...

227
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,840
Who knew that a monster like you would...

228
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,270
What... a surprise...

229
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,390
I'm surprised, myself.

230
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,150
Tamura Reiko is on the move.

231
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,890
She's headed for the opposite corner.

232
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,220
So she's coming this way.

233
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,320
Seriously, what am I doing,

234
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,240
coming all the way out here?

235
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,080
There's...

236
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,930
Th-There's a man over there!

237
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,320
Kuramori!

238
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,600
Kuramori!

239
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,070
Hey, hang in there!

240
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,090
Oh, Detective...

241
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,190
Are they here?!

242
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,450
Are they up there?!

243
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,100
Go!

244
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,640
If you identify one on sight,

245
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,870
don't hesitate!

246
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,830
Yes, sir!

247
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,760
It was Tamura Reiko, wasn't it?!

248
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,970
Is she the only one here?!

249
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,090
Does Hirokawa not know?!

250
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,290
She's... wearing white...

251
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,830
Holding a baby...

252
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,470
The baby's clothes have
some of my blood on them...

253
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,320
Got it!

254
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,480
We won't let her get away!

255
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,200
Tell me one more thing!

256
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,650
The "partner" you spoke of in your report...

257
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,240
Who is it?!

258
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,540
Is he human?!

259
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,490
Tell me his name!

260
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,740
He's... a human being...

261
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Like  me... he had a small family...

262
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,290
It was taken away from him...

263
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,000
He suffered pain...

264
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,480
Please!

265
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,750
Tell me his name!

266
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,280
Youko...

267
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,270
Yumi...

268
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,550
I'll be with you soon.

270
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,530
Kuramori-san?!

271
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,160
Stay with me, Kuramori-san!

272
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm glad...

273
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,020
I didn't kill... the baby...

274
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,720
Hey!

275
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,650
Kuramori-san!

276
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,440
Kuramori!

277
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,790
<i>You did well.</i>

278
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,460
<i>You may even become a hero 
after all this is over!</i>

279
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,720
<i>I </i>will<i> avenge your death, Detective!</i>

280
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,240
Understood!

281
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,630
White clothes and a baby...

282
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,900
What's your name?!

283
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,800
Answer me, now!

284
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,890
<i>I pray Hirokawa's group has 
no idea what we're up to!</i>

285
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,310
<i>We cannot let Tamura Reiko get away!</i>

286
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,690
<i>We have to finish her now!</i>

287
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,290
Next time:

288
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,030
More than Human

289
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,730
"More than Human."
