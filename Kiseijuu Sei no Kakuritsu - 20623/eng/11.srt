1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,250
Gosh, I drank way too much!

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,130
Well, I should get going.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,240
Hey, wait.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,910
What's the hurry?

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,660
Hey, Katou-san, you're so 
handsome and dependable.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,910
You've put me on the spot.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,000
You're really my type.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,290
Hey, do you know about this?

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,220
Oops, sorry.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,190
I didn't mean to pull out three—

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,390
No way.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,190
You've put me on the spot...

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,150
The hair gave me away.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,070
Help me out.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,650
I don't care for meat that contains alcohol.

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,660
Parasyte

17
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,660
The Maxim

18
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,770
You saved my life.

19
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,540
The Blue Bird

20
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,630
<i>I can't believe he did something like that...</i>

21
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,510
How are Izumi and I similar?

22
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,270
I mean, whatever you're sensing

23
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,640
might be weird wavelengths given 
off by dangerous guys like him.

24
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>But Izumi? Could he be...</i>

25
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,510
You shouldn't do that without warning.

26
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,110
Sorry.

27
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,420
If you want to pluck one 
of my hairs, go ahead.

28
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,160
Really?

29
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,480
Then I will.

30
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,390
Satisfied?

31
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,720
Ah...

32
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,520
Wait!

33
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,950
Remember how you warned 
me before about Shimada?

34
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,010
Did you know who he was from the start?

35
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,570
No, not really.

36
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,700
I guess that makes sense.

37
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,380
You wouldn't know a mass murderer like him.

38
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,580
Why the serious look?

39
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,260
<i>This girl's special.</i>

40
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,010
<i>Maybe I should just tell her everything.</i>

41
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,560
<i>But Migi's awake...</i>

42
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,670
<i>Shinichi, I know what you're thinking,</i>

43
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,520
<i>but that female is no ally of mine.</i>

44
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,890
Your name is Kana, right?

45
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,470
Huh?

46
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,600
Um, yeah.

47
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,900
You said you have some mysterious 
telepathic ability to sense me,

48
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,730
but even if you feel that I'm close, 
you should stay away.

49
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,870
Why?

50
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,480
You might run into a monster.

51
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,710
A monster?

52
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,870
Yeah.

53
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,100
Why do you think that?

54
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,450
Aren't you a normal human being?

55
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,630
Of course I am.

56
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,870
Then if I get that feeling from anyone,

57
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,670
I'll just pluck out one of their hairs.

58
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,390
Then I'll know if they're a monster or—

59
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,220
No! You can't do that!

60
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,720
What's wrong?

61
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,010
Sorry.

62
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,480
But seriously, it's too dangerous.

63
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,890
You're worried about me?

64
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,360
That kind of makes me happy.

65
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,880
Shinichi.

66
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,910
I need to talk to you.

67
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,140
Oh, I just remembered something I have to do.

68
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,200
Sorry, later.

69
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,890
Huh?

70
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,510
Oh, you're...

71
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,290
Hello.

72
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,550
Shinichi, don't talk to that female anymore.

73
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,260
I can't agree to that.

74
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,870
If I leave her be,

75
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,800
she'll get herself into danger for sure.

76
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,060
But the way you talk to her
gives her all kinds of hints.

77
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,930
I'll be more careful.

78
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,060
I expect nothing less.

79
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,540
Um, I know asking you this out of 
nowhere might seem weird, but...

80
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,400
What is it?

81
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,850
Don't you think Izumi-kun has 
changed a lot from before?

82
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,230
It's hard for me to compare.

83
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,040
It's not like I see him that often.

84
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,790
I'm talking about when you first 
met him, compared to now.

85
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,040
Did you guys have a fight?

86
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,440
You like him, right?

87
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,740
H-He's just different somehow.

88
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,930
It's not noticeable when we're talking, but...

89
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
H-He saved my life, too.

90
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,480
Saved your life?

91
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,310
You have dreams like that, too?

92
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,180
Huh? Dreams?

93
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,410
Uh, I mean...

94
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,120
I can't see any difference.

95
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,860
In a way, I feel like he was always like that.

96
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,330
He kind of has this ferocity to him.

97
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,480
If you don't get that mopey look off your face,

98
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,250
you'll lose him.

99
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,870
<i>Maybe I still have a chance...</i>

100
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,470
I'll be back in ten.

101
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,700
All right.

102
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,340
But couldn't you have tried to blend in a little?

103
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,230
The clothes will get soiled anyway.

104
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,530
You need something?

105
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,330
How many of you are inside?

106
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,660
You stupid or something?

107
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,450
Beat it, before you get yourself hurt!

108
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,550
I see.

109
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,420
The yakuza are very belligerent, aren't they?

110
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,230
Sometimes you run into people 
who get the silly idea

111
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,360
that the yakuza can't harm 
civilians because of anti-gang laws!

112
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,690
Who are you?!

113
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,020
Wh-What?!

114
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,190
Who the hell is he?

115
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,960
What's the matter?

116
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,910
Come at me.

117
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,290
Ah...

118
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,050
That's one.

119
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,480
You m-monster!

120
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,480
Two.

121
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,570
We got him.

122
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,730
Three, huh.

123
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,690
No way...

124
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,610
I failed to avoid three.

125
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,870
I guess that's about par.

126
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,620
M-Monster...

127
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,120
Wh-What the hell are you here for?

128
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,780
This is an experiment

129
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,560
to see how far we can go against

130
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,880
a group with guns and edged weapons.

131
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,290
Did something happen?

132
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,840
There's a body over there.
His head's been bashed in.

133
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,350
I just heard gunshots, too.

134
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,210
Seriously?

135
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,150
Hey, he's running away!

136
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,190
After him!

137
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,950
Huh? He's gone.

138
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,190
That's weird.

139
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,280
I know he came this way.

140
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,570
Drop it.

141
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,860
We wouldn't want to get 
drawn into a gang war.

142
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,680
Should we at least call the cops?

143
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,130
I'm sure someone already has.

144
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,080
What is it?

145
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,740
Oh, it's just that you look 
very different from before.

146
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,990
A massacre at a yakuza office...

147
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,710
They say there were 22 casualties,

148
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,980
which includes everyone who was at the office.

149
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,000
A lot of scary things are 
happening one after another.

150
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,120
Yeah...

151
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,030
<i>Was it a parasite?</i>

152
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,130
<i>No, they shouldn't kill like this 
for reasons other than feeding.</i>

153
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,140
Just In 
22 Gang Members Dead

154
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,680
<i>The Metropolitan Police just held 
an emergency press conference.</i>

155
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,560
<i>They stated that they will release</i>

156
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,460
<i>security camera footage of a male 
suspect seen fleeing the scene.</i>

157
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,860
You didn't hold back at all.

158
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,010
It was good exercise, boss.

159
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,790
Izumi-kun!

160
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,490
Thanks for coming.

161
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,610
No problem.

162
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,890
Thanks for the invite.

163
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,420
What are you up for?

164
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,170
Let's watch a movie for starters.

165
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,410
Okay!

166
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,000
Sadako 2D                    Blood Will Be Defeated

167
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,940
I still have dreams about 
what happened that day.

168
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,950
Even after I wake up, I can't stop shaking.

169
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,630
Does that ever happen to you, Izumi-kun?

170
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,200
Sometimes.

171
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,610
But by the time morning comes, 
I've forgotten most of it.

172
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,810
That must be nice.

173
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,970
My dreams are so vivid and colorful

174
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,280
that I remember them pretty clearly.

175
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,550
My friend once told me this.

176
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,490
He said to think of people like cattle and pigs.

177
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,250
When you do that,

178
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,120
you realize that people eat 
chopped up animals every day,

179
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,070
so you shouldn't have anything 
to be afraid of after that.

180
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,020
That's unusual.

181
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,320
What kind of person is he?

182
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,010
Oh, well...

183
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,070
I don't know about "person," but...

184
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,850
I wonder if your friend's 
one reason you've changed.

185
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,720
I don't think so.

186
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,310
Oh, sorry.

187
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,080
You've changed, but it's nothing 
you need to worry about.

188
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,840
<i>I wonder if it's from back then...</i>

189
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,150
<i>Maybe Izumi-kun hasn't really come 
back since he left on that trip.</i>

190
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:20,020
I-Izumi-kun, remember when your dad 
got injured while on a trip, and...

191
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,110
Let's go.

192
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,850
<i>I guess I shouldn't have asked him about it.</i>

193
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,330
Oh. So cute!

194
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,210
Come here!

195
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,510
That must be his mom.

196
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,420
Must be.

197
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,680
Are they strays?

198
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,190
I guess not.

199
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,930
She's wearing a collar.

200
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,180
Oh, Izumi-kun?

201
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,730
It's a nice day.

202
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,890
It's not even that cold.

203
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,180
You're talking like an old man, Izumi-kun.

204
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,080
Hey, that was mean.

205
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,390
Mommy!

206
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,320
Hey, Mommy!

207
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,170
Wait for me!

208
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,870
Come on, let's go.

209
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,370
Hurry up, now.

210
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,570
Stupid Mommy!

211
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,760
Why...

212
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,010
Why would you say that?

213
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,510
I hate you, Mommy!

214
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,830
Hey, it's not like...

215
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,520
It's not like I...

216
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,890
I hope you die!

217
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,070
Come on, let's go.

218
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,830
Izumi-kun?

219
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,240
A hole...

220
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,240
There's a hole...

221
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,300
A hole?

222
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:06,830
Oh...

223
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,060
What's wrong?

224
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,110
Are you okay?

225
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,840
Uh, I had a hard time 
breathing, all of a sudden...

226
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,150
Maybe I'm just getting old.

227
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,140
Oh, c'mon.

228
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,260
You're really acting like an old man now.

229
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,350
<i>Sometimes, I feel as though 
my body's being ripped apart.</i>

230
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,960
<i>But that feeling goes away after a while.</i>

231
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,260
<i>That's when I feel as though some part 
of Migi's become a part of my heart.</i>

232
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,740
<i>But I still do like her.</i>

233
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,540
<i>I really care about her.</i>

234
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,750
<i>That feeling is mine alone.</i>

235
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,000
<i>When things are going well with me and her,</i>

236
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,760
<i>I always wish you would stay asleep,</i>

237
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,860
<i>Migi.</i>

238
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,490
See you later.

239
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,120
Okay.

240
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,420
<i>You're Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?</i>

241
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,970
<i>If only...</i>

242
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,040
<i>If only we'd gotten closer much sooner.</i>

243
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,940
I could believe that you <i>are</i> Izumi-kun

244
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,520
without any doubt...

245
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,640
<i>You stupid girl.</i>

246
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,410
<i>You knew this from the start.</i>

247
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,410
<i>But...</i>

248
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,330
Why are you going to 
the trouble of seeing her?

249
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,510
I can't ignore her when she says 
it's the last favor she'll ever ask.

250
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,440
I find this incomprehensible.

251
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,520
Maybe I'm a little early.

252
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,990
Shinichi, I sense my kind.

253
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,880
Not just one, but three...

254
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,420
No, five?

255
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,370
How many are there?!

256
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,290
They're that way.

257
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,600
What needs to change is our individual mentality.

258
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,020
Debating global environmental conservation...

259
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,570
It appears they are aware of our presence,

260
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,930
but they aren't taking any action.

261
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm suddenly realizing

262
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,840
that we're kind of like Kitaro and 
his dad, from the cartoon.

263
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,800
They are approximately 60 meters away.

264
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,330
Eight of them total.

265
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,000
Two are close to the ground,

266
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,060
and six are high up...

267
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,530
Perhaps on a stand of some sort.

268
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,460
Hirokawa Takeshi 
Global Nature Consensus: Restore a Productive Coexistence Between Us and Nature!

269
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,360
Would you be willing to forego your cars 
in order to prevent polluting the air?

270
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,410
It is difficult in the extreme 
to consider reversing

271
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,260
the progress we have made as a civilization.

272
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,580
However, if we do not, 
at least in some aspects,

273
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,970
The six of them up there...
They're all parasites?!

274
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,450
we are putting Earth itself at risk.

275
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,720
Two below, too.

276
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,540
At this distance, it is difficult to identify them,

277
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,680
but we may be able to if we make eye contact.

278
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,690
<i>Did he see us?!</i>

279
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,610
<i>But in this crowd...</i>

280
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,010
He saw us.

281
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,610
Our eyes met,

282
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,580
but they do not seem to 
be very interested in us.

283
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,410
Now that we've seen a rare sight,

284
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,070
let's get out of here for now.

285
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,020
Yeah.

286
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,150
<i>A parasite, running for mayor?</i>

287
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,710
<i>What are they planning?</i>

288
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,820
Oh! Izumi!

289
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,020
Wh-Why are you here?!

290
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,500
Why?

291
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,870
I live in this neighborhood,

292
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,040
and I'm the one who asked 
you to meet me here.

293
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,880
Oh... Right.

294
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,990
...but it is at the municipal level that

295
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Revolutionary

296
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,090
environmental issues can be 
addressed in a practical sense,

297
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,870
rather than at the national level.

298
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,970
<i>This isn't good...</i>

299
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,640
Next time:

300
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,070
Kokoro

301
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,520
"Kokoro."
