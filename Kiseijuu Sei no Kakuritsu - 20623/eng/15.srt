1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,280
They've just parted ways.

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,410
Which one should I follow?

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,450
Okay, got it.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,910
I'll follow the man.

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,800
Picking up a woman, huh?

6
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,350
Oh, man...

7
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,980
I'm so dense that I didn't even notice.

8
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:05,680
Parasyte

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,680
The Maxim

10
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,250
Something Wicked This Way Comes

11
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,380
I need your help.

12
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,520
The last thing he said was that he was going

13
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,890
into the basement of this building.

14
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,200
But I lacked the courage 
to go down there myselfâ€”

15
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,420
That's why we told you

16
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,020
that you're in way over your head!

17
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,370
Well?

18
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,830
Do you sense anything?

19
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,410
No.

20
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,780
None of my kind are nearby.

21
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,490
There's no one here.

22
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,980
Something smells awful.

23
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,760
Huh?

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,050
<i>It can't be...</i>

25
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,760
<i>No way.</i>

26
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,220
Shinichi, one incoming!

27
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,730
200 meters, 180 meters...

28
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,380
It's fast.

29
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,090
It's probably in a car.

30
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,570
If we go out now, we'll come 
face to face by the entrance.

31
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,650
Crap!

32
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,900
We've got to hide!

33
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,730
It's brought lunch.

34
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,920
Yuck. What is this place?

35
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,580
Never mind that.

36
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,910
Just stand over there, will you?

37
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,610
Like this?

38
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,060
Yeah, that's great.

39
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,970
What's this about? You're kind of weird.

40
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,180
Don't go out there, Shinichi.

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,260
<i>Why is it hiding there?</i>

42
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,540
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,370
So...

44
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,070
<i>The moment of truth when they eat humans...</i>

45
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,400
Stop!

46
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,410
Wh-What?

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,370
You're not one of us?

48
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,580
Watch out!

49
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,290
He's not human!

50
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,960
Get away from him!

51
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,480
Huh?

52
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,620
Hurry!

53
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,890
Run, now!

54
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,260
Why, you...

55
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,770
Humans!

56
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,650
Listen, Shinichi.

57
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,480
Forget that I'm here.

58
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,150
If we take the time to discuss 
strategy and whatnot, we'll lose.

59
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,690
You can see his blades' movements, right?

60
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,620
Yeah!

61
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,750
I-It's incredible.

62
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,210
They're so fast!

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,790
Just keep dodging his attacks.

64
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,880
Don't try to defeat him 
barehanded like you did before!

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,050
And that'll be enough to win?

66
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,040
Good. Your moves aren't bad.

67
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,230
I think I'll win by having the better mount.

68
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,940
Who're you calling a "mount"?

69
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,300
My kind's weakness lies below the neck:

70
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,730
the human portion.

71
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,530
We'll eventually win, as long as 
we keep that part protected.

72
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,540
<i>I couldn't save her...</i>

73
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,010
This is nothing new, though.

74
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,640
I knew what was going on.

75
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,300
I knew,

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,930
and yet I did nothing for so long.

77
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,210
In any case, we've got trouble.

78
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,940
Given the male's attitude,

79
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,780
this must be one of the dining areas 
coordinated by Hirokawa's group.

80
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,530
That means our actions constitute

81
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,530
an act of war against them.

82
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,820
Are you listening, Shinichi?

83
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,920
I was wrong.

84
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,890
What?

85
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,800
I was wrong to...

86
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Anyway, we need to get clear of 
this place as soon as possible.

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,690
Kuramori-san, you're not 
going to stop now, are you?

88
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,580
There's a detective I've met before.

89
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,070
I think his name is Hirama.

90
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

91
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,620
He even suspected me of 
being one of the monsters.

92
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, don't get any strange ideas.

93
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,020
What's so strange about it?

94
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,000
We're about to fight Hirokawa's group.

95
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
Do you hear yourself?

96
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,510
We may be in an extremely 
precarious situation right now.

97
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,850
We'll use the footage Kuramori-san 
recorded as evidence

98
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,390
to get the police to search 
the building from top to bottom.

99
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,910
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,640
We're in that footage, too.

101
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,150
I can't stand this anymore!

102
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,730
Do you want your father to be killed, too?

103
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,130
What?!

104
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,230
What do you mean by that?!

105
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,420
Don't worry.

106
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,980
I was wrong.

107
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,870
Like you all said, I'm in over my head.

108
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm a small-timer.

109
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,130
I shouldn't have gotten involved in all this.

110
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll destroy all the evidence 
I've gathered so far.

111
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,170
But why?

112
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,850
You saw what happened!

113
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,220
Didn't that mean anything to you?!

114
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,470
Of course it did!

115
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,510
My teeth are still chattering!

116
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,400
Anyone who saw that and still thinks 
they can fight them is crazy!

117
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,570
You're no longer a normal human being!

118
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,520
Even that fight...

119
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,450
It was basically two monsters 
trying to kill each other.

120
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,060
I'm just a weak human being.

121
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,630
I have neither the strength nor 
the courage to protect myself.

122
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,590
I'm not you, okay?

123
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,280
From this day on,

124
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,180
I'm going to forget about 
monsters, Tamura Reiko,

125
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,570
and you.

126
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,370
Don't look at me like that.

127
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,330
I have a wife and child.

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,210
I know I made a grandiose speech about the 
good of humanity and all that to you before.

129
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,890
Well...

131
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,990
That's a normal human being for you.

132
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,560
Shut up.

133
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,000
You're no longer a normal human being!

134
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,210
<i>He's right.</i>

135
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
<i>I'm not normal.</i>

136
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,890
<i>What can I do?</i>

137
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,520
<i>What </i>can<i> I do?</i>

138
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,840
Shinichi.

139
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,830
I've said this to you many times already,

140
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,490
but let's not engage in futile resistance.

141
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,400
Futile?

142
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,130
I'm not so sure.

143
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,320
We were able to win today.

144
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,220
That's right! We can win, if it's one-on-one!

145
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,660
With my cooperation, you mean.

146
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,950
<i>Yes, I </i>can<i> do this.</i>

147
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,730
<i>I can do anything if I put my mind to it!</i>

148
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,170
<i>Looking back...</i>

149
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,910
<i>One by one...</i>

150
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,520
<i>Right, I can get them one by one!</i>

151
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,250
<i>I won't ask for help from any other human.</i>

152
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,550
<i>I'll do this alone.</i>

153
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,860
<i>Migi would help me for sure, then.</i>

154
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,320
<i>No, I will </i>make<i> him help me!</i>

155
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
<i>Call it human ego, or whatever you want,</i>

156
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,440
<i>but I just want to save 
as many people as I can!</i>

157
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,860
<i>That'd mean a safer world for Murano, too.</i>

158
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,800
Satomi, did you have a fight 
with Izumi-kun or something?

159
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,870
I don't think I've seen 
you two together lately.

160
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,170
It wasn't really a fight, but...

161
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,470
I guess we just can't trust each other...

162
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,500
Huh?

163
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,130
He doesn't look like he can't trust you.

164
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,290
I don't get him at all!

165
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,410
Wait, Satomi!

166
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,920
Uh-oh.

167
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,340
<i>I will protect</i>

168
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
<i>as many people as I can!</i>

169
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,140
The enemy is formidable.

170
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,060
We must deal with him.

171
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,330
Killing him would be a waste,

172
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,810
although I couldn't care less about the P.I.

173
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,160
Nonsense.

174
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,310
He is, without a doubt, a dangerous foe.

175
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,310
Why would you defend him?

176
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,270
We are not human.

177
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,070
Why are our opinions so incompatible?

178
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,040
Tamura-san,

179
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,060
I've heard that you are 
rearing a human child.

180
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,950
Is that affecting your judgment?

181
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,450
Isn't it time to dispose of it?

182
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,710
I can't do that just yet.

183
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,120
In any event, Izumi Shinichi killed 
one of us in our dining area.

184
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,560
We clearly cannot let this go.

185
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,590
We should eliminate him.

186
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,890
I suppose it's unavoidable.

187
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,490
However, I would like his body 
to be brought back intact.

188
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,600
Why?

189
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,630
I would like to dissect him.

190
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,440
That was impressive, Gotou-san.

191
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,400
Was it Mozart?

192
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,420
Chopin.

193
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,060
Our target is said to be a formidable match.

194
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,340
I do think it should be you 
who handles him, but...

195
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,640
If Miki wants to do it,

196
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,440
I'll let him.

197
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,690
He just needs more experience.

198
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,670
<i>What is this?</i>

199
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,710
<i>Who are you?</i>

200
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,710
<i>I've got my hands full.</i>

201
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,060
<i>You're... a monster?!</i>

202
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,390
<i>Ah...</i>

203
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,550
<i>So that's how I appear to you.</i>

204
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,400
<i>But look who's talking.</i>

205
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,080
<i>Take a look.</i>

206
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,420
Wh-What a nightmare.

207
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,010
<i>Killing parasites, one by one...</i>

208
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,500
<i>How will I convince Migi to help me?</i>

209
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,210
<i>Maybe the path of least resistance 
will be to create a situation</i>

210
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,990
<i>where we have no other choice but to fight.</i>

211
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,280
What?

212
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,390
I'll be late to class.

213
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,770
No time for that.

214
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,630
My kind, incoming.

215
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,400
What?

216
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,250
Again?!

217
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,190
<i>This is my chance!</i>

218
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
Okay, let's fight.

219
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,070
Where is it right now?

220
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,940
Don't be so eager.

221
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,290
We're the target.

222
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,950
They're coming straight for 
us with the intent to kill us.

223
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,210
And there are three.

224
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,370
Three?!

225
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,700
Fight or flee?

226
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,000
You seem to be spoiling for a fight.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,210
If so, this is the ideal location for it.

228
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,540
Don't be ridiculous!

229
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,920
I won't do this at the school!

230
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,140
Izumi-kun!

231
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,000
It's okay.

232
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,980
You'll be safe.

233
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,140
Huh?

234
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,190
It's okay!

235
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,740
You'll be safe now.

236
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,820
Is he...

237
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,910
Nishi Fukuyama
High School
Main Gate

238
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Izumi-kun?

239
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,330
Stop! I've lost them.

240
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,560
They've put more than 300 meters between us.

241
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,580
It seems they are on foot.

242
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,920
Three coming for us at once?

243
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,430
In this scenario,

244
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,230
we should think about taking 
them out one by one,

245
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,590
and not all three at once.

246
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,760
One by one...

247
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,440
Okay, let's give it a try.

248
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,790
No, never mind.

249
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,340
Forget that strategy.

250
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,910
Why?

251
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,310
I'm sleepy.

252
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,690
I'll be out for four hours.

253
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,820
Why now?!

254
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,140
I can't help it.

255
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,320
It's a physiological phenomenon.

256
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,410
You should just stay on the move...

257
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,950
In a straight line, when possible.

258
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,810
That's our only option right now.

259
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm on my own, for four hours?!

260
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I guess I can take a small breather.

261
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,120
Two more hours...

262
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,480
I think I can manage to shake them off.

263
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,490
A taxi?

264
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,750
No way!

265
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
Oh, keep the change.

266
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,550
<i>Just one?</i>

267
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,580
<i>Can't be them, then.</i>

268
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,190
Hello!

269
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,090
This place is nice.

270
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,090
No one around, and it's quiet.

271
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
<i>He's smiling.</i>

272
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,590
<i>He can't be a parasite, then...</i>

273
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,600
But you really took off in a panic, huh?

274
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,600
And I'd heard that you're a tough one...

275
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,660
What, what?

276
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,700
Hey, isn't your right 
hand's signal a bit weak?

277
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,120
Oh, hey!

278
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,610
Wait!

279
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,070
<i>It's the first time I've met</i>

280
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,120
<i>a parasite who's so expressive!</i>

281
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,960
<i>He's slower than I'd expected.</i>

282
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,210
<i>I thought parasites were able to maximize
the physical potential of their host.</i>

283
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,130
<i>But maybe the other two are close by!</i>

284
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,460
<i>I can't let my guard down!</i>

285
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,600
Where are you heading to?

286
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,980
Want a ride, sonny?

287
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,530
Oh, thank you.

288
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,150
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

289
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,690
<i>This old man...</i>

290
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,830
<i>Could the dog be a parasite, too?!</i>

291
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,120
<i>No, it's too small.</i>

292
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,120
You sure you want off here?

293
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,170
Yes, thank you.

294
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,440
<i>Thank God he wasn't a parasite.</i>

295
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,770
<i>It's been almost four hours now.</i>

296
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,640
<i>I guess they gave up.</i>

297
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,780
Maybe I was wrong...

298
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,940
Migi...

299
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,920
Migi!

300
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,670
Migi!

301
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,520
Huh?

302
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,630
Oh, Shinichi.

303
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm glad you're okay.

304
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,810
Three!

305
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,300
Yeah.

306
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,060
I still don't know where the other two are.

307
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,470
That's not what I mean.

308
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,690
There are three of them in his body!

309
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,560
What?!

310
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,820
So is it "Migi" because 
he's on your right hand?

311
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,070
That's so simplistic. You're just like me.

312
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,080
Oh, I'm "Miki."

313
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,080
(Note: "Miki" means "three trees")

314
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,460
This is a surprise.

315
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,680
We've won this fight.

316
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,030
Happy Family

317
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,080
Next time:

318
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,330
"Happy Family."
