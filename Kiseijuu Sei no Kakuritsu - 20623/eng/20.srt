1
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,350
Huh?

2
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,090
One died.

3
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:48,660
Parasyte

4
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,660
The Maxim

5
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,520
We did it!

6
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,190
Crime and Punishment

7
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,190
<i>We took one down...</i>

8
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,510
Retrieve the body.

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,480
Switch the route.

10
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,120
Yes, sir!

11
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,070
<i>They are not life forms.</i>

12
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,190
<i>They are machines operated by demons.</i>

13
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,410
<i>To stop a machine,</i>

14
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,080
<i>we need only destroy the "motor."</i>

15
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,220
<i>The key factor in ensuring 
the destruction of the heart</i>

16
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,220
<i>is not the penetrating power of each round,</i>

17
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,170
<i>but the force of each shot's overall spread.</i>

18
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,930
<i>What we need</i>

19
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,660
<i>are shotguns loaded with shells 
containing 16 8mm lead shots.</i>

20
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,680
What was that sound?

21
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,540
Wasn't it gunshots?

22
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,310
No way.

23
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,720
Hey, what's going on, huh?

24
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,610
Please keep your voices down, everyone!

25
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,200
The rooftop shooter is just firing 
warning shots to intimidate us.

26
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,320
We're still fine!

27
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,090
Just in case, we'll wait a few 
minutes to assess the situation

28
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,700
before resuming evacuations.

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,670
<i>Damn humans...</i>

30
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,710
<i>They're pretty efficient.</i>

31
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,290
<i>Well, what now?</i>

32
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,430
We'll now resume evacuations.

33
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,180
None here.

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,310
None here, either.

35
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,320
<i>What's going on?</i>

36
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>This can't be right.</i>

37
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,920
<i>Are they onto us?</i>

38
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,430
Captain.

39
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,940
The murdered P.I.'s notes 
mentioned something relevant,

40
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,540
although they were rather vague...

41
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,990
Telepathy?

42
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,210
Yes, I remember reading about that.

43
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,060
We should take all necessary 
precautionary measures.

44
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,220
I'll send Uragami in.

45
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,650
Please use him.

46
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,740
But that man is...

47
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,770
One moment, please.

48
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,660
What is it?

49
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,610
Well, it's Hirokawa.

50
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,440
There are civilians in the 
second floor conference room?

51
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
That's right.

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,020
We had a town meeting planned today.

53
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,370
They probably didn't hear the announcement.

54
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,250
There's no need for concern.

55
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,250
We've sent men to verify 
whether anyone's still there.

56
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,610
No, if they see your armed men,

57
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,330
I'm sure they'll be frightened.

58
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,240
It'll invite further chaos.

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,330
He's right.

60
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,040
We'll go up to the second floor

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,510
and escort them here.

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,930
They're making their move.

63
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,330
Don't let them leave the building.

64
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,650
Stall them.

65
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,240
Yes, sir!

66
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Sorry about that.

67
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,280
Bring over that psychic killer of yours.

68
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,860
Hey, c'mon.

69
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,780
Uncuff me.

70
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,820
What am I supposed to do if anything happens?

71
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,790
I won't run.

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Besides, how am I supposed 
to make a run for it

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,440
with all these cops around?

74
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,520
All right, fine.

75
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,460
Hey, Migi.

76
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,730
We should help, too.

77
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,050
We can tell them apart.

78
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,040
No.

79
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,680
No. Please cooperate.

80
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,810
How dare you point guns at civilians?!

81
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,590
Um...

82
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,320
I want to evacuate.

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,840
Huh?

84
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,570
Right...

85
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,310
I see.

86
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,920
So it's this vehicle.

87
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Wait!

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,740
They're all on top of each other.

89
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,680
How am I supposed to tell who's what?

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,350
Please stay in line.

91
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,450
Walk in single file, please.

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,310
What's the matter?

93
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,060
They're all lined up!

94
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,890
One, two...

95
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,110
Wait, stop!

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,250
No, no.

97
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,070
That one's human.

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,410
Oh, boy. He's a goner.

99
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,260
How...

100
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,070
How could you...

101
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,340
Please stay back!

102
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,990
Huh?

103
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,380
Please get back in line!

104
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,140
W-Wait...

105
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,260
U-Um...

106
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,010
Shoot him now!

107
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,010
Kill him!

108
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:35,890
Huh?

109
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,890
Shit!

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,150
Our equipment got hit by friendly fire!

111
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,530
The sensing system's down!

112
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,900
Quiet, everyone!

113
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,270
Please calm down!

114
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,250
Calm down!

115
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,220
Shit!

116
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,340
Don't shoot!

117
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,400
Wait!

118
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,480
Where are you going?!

119
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,490
Forget it, let them go!

120
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,650
Everybody down!

121
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,950
Hands behind your head!

122
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,680
You have five seconds! Now!

123
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,250
Don't stand up, no matter what!

124
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,800
Stand without permission 
and we'll shoot to kill!

125
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,560
Hey, wait a minute!

126
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,730
Who're you to tell usâ€”

127
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,250
Hmph.

128
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,430
A human.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
M-My God...

130
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,360
There are several parasites in this city hall.

131
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,430
We are going to neutralize them.

132
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,040
Listen up!

133
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,760
If you believe yourselves to be human,

134
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,630
do exactly as we say!

135
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,270
<i>Isn't there anything we can do?</i>

136
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,640
<i>Anything?!</i>

137
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,290
We will now expand our hunting grounds.

138
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,020
Kisaragi Squad, you'll take this area.

139
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,630
If you see anyone suspicious, shoot to kill.

140
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,500
Yes, sir!

141
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,170
Surviving members of the 
Mutsuki and Satsuki Squads

142
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,950
will join my Shingetsu Squad to 
clean up the rest of the building.

143
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,420
Roger.

144
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,260
Hey.

145
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,760
The killer will come with me.

146
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,780
Huh?

147
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,050
I'm counting on you to ID the monsters.

148
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,050
Look who's talking.

149
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,430
Right?

150
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,360
Is it justifiable self-defense?

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,890
Or... Is it obstruction of justice?

152
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,780
This is an emergency, so...

153
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,780
Huh? What're you going on about?

154
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,710
Hands behind your head!

155
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,210
Stop!

156
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,100
Why aren't you trying to escape?

157
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,110
You should be able to get through 
the cordon easily enough.

158
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,490
The same goes for you.

159
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,470
I intend to watch how the enemy 
fights for a while longer first.

160
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,250
What about you?

161
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,700
Good question.

162
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,510
I feel there's no real point 
in running at this point.

163
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,460
Oh?

164
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,420
<i>Well, I'll just do what I want.</i>

165
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,740
I know.

166
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,780
So, where is Hirokawa?

167
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,120
The Uzuki Squad made contact 
with Hirokawa's group

168
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,050
while en route to the city council wing.

169
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,770
We lost them in the connecting 
corridor on the second floor.

170
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,030
We'll split up here.

171
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,530
Shingetsu Squad, go to the main wing.

172
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,270
Mutsuki and Satsuki Squads, 
go to the council wing.

173
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,050
Yes, sir!

174
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,800
Killer,

175
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,210
you'll accompany the joint team formed 
by the Mutsuki and Satsuki Squads.

176
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,680
The name's Uragami.

177
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,190
You're a killer, too.

178
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,680
But that means you won't 
be able to ID the enemy...

179
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,730
Don't worry.

180
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,260
I'm starting to get the hang 
of telling the monsters apart.

181
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,520
Uzuki Squad located.

182
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Looks like they made contact 
with Hirokawa's group,

183
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,500
and then got wiped out.

184
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,350
Ugh, yuck.

185
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Stupid.

186
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,620
They're both human.

187
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,060
What the hell are you guys 
doing in a crisis like this?!

188
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,470
Sorry!

189
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,120
Ignorance is bliss.

190
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,250
But if I hadn't been here, 
they'd be full of holes by now.

191
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,670
Oh, thank God.

192
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,850
Please help me.

193
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,190
Shoot.

194
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,370
What? But...

195
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,160
How did you know?

196
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,960
He wasn't in the first floor entrance hall.

197
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Huh?

198
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,110
In any case,

199
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,970
just shoot anyone you find.

200
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,310
<i>Humans had the upper hand from the start.</i>

201
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,850
<i>The assault troops' objective was never 
the protection of civilian lives...</i>

202
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,960
<i>It was the elimination of the enemy.</i>

203
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,460
<i>By making that strategic priority explicit,</i>

204
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,220
<i>we prevented a panic.</i>

205
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,490
<i>And while several human lives were sacrificed,</i>

206
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,830
<i>we were able to methodically 
eradicate the parasites.</i>

207
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,740
We are fragile.

208
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,350
We are merely a life form that 
cannot survive on its own.

209
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,180
So don't bully us.

210
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,570
Hey, wait. I'm practically in the lead here.

211
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,630
What'd be the point of having you at the rear?

212
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,580
Stop!

213
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,910
W-Wait.

214
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,450
I'm not one of them!

215
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,850
Shoot.

216
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,480
H-Hey!

217
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,420
What's the holdup? C'mon!

218
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,350
Where are you even aiming?

219
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,300
Go! After him!

220
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,710
So they're using large shotgun 
rounds to destroy the body.

221
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,080
Seems to be pretty effective.

222
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,630
What about him?

223
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,450
He looks the type.

224
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,970
Fine, fine. Man, what a drag.

225
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,810
Just shoot everyone already. I don't care.

226
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,210
Hey! Uragami!

227
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,730
Where do you think you're going?

228
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,690
Follow me.

229
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,800
We'll have more room this way.

230
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,580
Uragami!

231
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,840
Bastard! So running was your plan all along!

232
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,190
Y-You saw him, didn't you?!

233
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,860
Did he look human to you guys?

234
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,790
What?!

235
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,030
Oh, only this many?

236
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,030
I'll give you two minutes.

237
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,910
Fire!

238
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,730
Why won't he fall?

239
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,220
H-He's not bleeding at all!

240
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,560
What's that sound?

241
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,360
It's coming from inside him!

242
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,990
You sure gave me a lot.

243
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,000
It can't be... Shotgun pellets?

244
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,790
His arm!

245
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,480
Oh, one's still alive.

246
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,490
I see.

247
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,430
It's thanks to their body armor.

248
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,130
In situations like this,

249
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,330
does one say, "insolent fool"?

250
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,140
I'll give you another thirty
seconds to wrap things up.

251
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,970
What?

252
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,270
It appears the Mutsuki and Satsuki 
joint team has been wiped out.

253
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,850
Understood.

254
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,730
Send the Yayoi Squad to the council wing.

255
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,730
C'mon.

256
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,740
Let's get you back there, Uragami!

257
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,440
You've got to be shitting me.

258
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,740
That's enough.

259
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,350
Hello, everyone.

260
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,700
Next time:

261
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,030
Sex and Spirit

262
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,990
"Sex and Spirit."
