1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,080
Delicious, 
Yet Robust!

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,080
Tasty 
New Brew

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,080
Let's embark on a pilgrimage to see the fall foliage

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,080
Autumn Journey

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,450
Hey, you, behind me and to my right.

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,610
You, wearing the gray coat.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,660
I would like you to stop manhandling 
other people's bodies.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,540
Ew, a molester.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,290
I-I didn't!

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,410
She's lying!

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,980
Hey, take that back!

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,810
Where's your proof that I laid hands on you?!

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,420
Hey, are you listening to me?!

14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,720
Parasyte

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,720
The Maxim

16
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,510
Feast

17
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,870
Looks like they've chosen the winner of 
the Kayama Fantasy Literature Award.

18
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,070
<i>The Seventh Transformation </i>
by Yoshimi Dai, right?

19
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,370
Oh, you've read it?

20
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,540
It's about a guy who gained 
the ability to talk to reptiles.

21
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,480
It's totally implausible.

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,120
Not again...

23
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,970
This makes 84.

24
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,520
Mincemeat Murders?

25
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,110
It doesn't even surprise me anymore.

26
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,970
Thanks for breakfast.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, you didn't even eat half.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Y-Yeah...

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,270
<i>I may be the only person in the whole world</i>

30
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,250
<i>who knows the truth behind those murders.</i>

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,890
Izumi-kun.

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,660
Morning.

33
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,860
Hey...

34
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,880
You know, you've changed recently.

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,510
Huh? Me?

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,290
Yeah.

37
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,810
I don't think so.

38
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,840
Shinichi.

39
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,770
<i>I know I just heard a voice...</i>

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,550
Right here.

41
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,370
Migi?!

42
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,180
I was just thinking something tickled...

43
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,720
What's wrong?

44
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,720
Oh, nothing.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
One of my kind is near.

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
Again?

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,980
Pedestrians
Cyclists
Only

48
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,980
It's slowly coming closer.

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,740
But there haven't been any 
Mincement Murders around here.

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,240
It's possible they just haven't found any bodies yet.

51
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,490
It's about 70 meters away from us.

52
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,200
60 meters.

53
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,750
Don't tell me...

54
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,750
It's inside this building.

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,860
Inside here...

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,350
<i>Where is it?</i>

57
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,350
<i>Who is it?</i>

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,850
<i>A guy?</i>

59
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,360
<i>A girl?</i>

60
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,450
Approximately 30 meters away.

61
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,610
I am certain it's someone in here.

62
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,110
30 meters?

63
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,210
Don't make eye contact.

64
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,210
It'll find you.

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,470
It's looking for us, too,

66
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,530
but thanks to the crowd, 
it seems unable to locate us.

67
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,940
Good morning, everyone.

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,590
I'd like to introduce a new math 
teacher who'll be subbing in

69
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,550
for Matsuyama-sensei, who's been 
hospitalized after a traffic accident.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,010
Come on up, Tamiya-sensei.

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,660
My name is Tamiya Ryoko.

72
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,520
It's nice to meet you all.

73
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,660
It's her.

74
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,650
What?!

75
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,980
In addition, Yamamoto-sensei will 
become the new homeroom teacher

76
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,150
for class 3-3...

77
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,660
<i>Class 3-3?</i>

78
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,770
<i>That's her class.</i>

79
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,660
...and Tamiya-sensei will be 
the assistant homeroom teacher.

80
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,160
Don't look, Shinichi!

81
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,030
She's looking at me.

82
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,960
Our eyes met.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,950
She's quite the looker.

84
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,590
Yeah.

85
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,930
<i>She found me...</i>

86
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,580
Listen up.

87
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,290
After doing five laps around the field,

88
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,850
stretch again to loosen up your muscles.

89
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,360
Then we'll split into two groups and play a match.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,610
I hope you've all read up on the rules.

91
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,990
What a surprise.

92
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,750
They might be on the next exam.

93
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,750
Even after taking over the head,

94
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,860
she managed to retain and maintain the 
host's specific position in society.

95
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,510
Not to mention, she's teaching humans.

96
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,370
She is very gifted.

97
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,640
Why are you putting her on a pedestal?

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,580
We have to do something.

99
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,900
What do you mean by that?

100
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,250
Well, don't we?

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,580
She's going to eat everyone.

102
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,380
No, that's unlikely.

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,760
She desires to blend into human society.

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,390
She will not use humans in her 
immediate social circles as food.

105
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,850
They should be safe.

106
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,450
How are you so sure?

107
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,770
Well, let's just monitor the situation for now.

108
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,330
<i>How can Migi sleep at a time like this?</i>

109
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,130
<i>Right now, if she were to...</i>

110
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,770
All right, use this formula

111
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,590
to solve problems six through twelve.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,670
Izumi-kun.

113
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,470
<i>She's here!</i>

114
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,970
What's wrong?

115
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,720
You don't seem to be making any progress...

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,920
Huh?

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,650
Oh, um, well...

118
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,820
Sorry.

119
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,190
Bow!

120
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,610
Izumi-kun, come to the guidance 
office later, would you?

121
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,710
All right?

122
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,460
Hey, did you do something?

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,200
No...

124
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,450
I'm jealous!

125
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,420
I'd love to get a personal 
lesson from a babe like her.

126
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,020
Hey, there's a babe right here.

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,200
Right, Izumi-kun?

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,660
Nah, you've got nothing on 
Tamiya-sensei's mature beauty.

129
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,680
But I guess she prefers guys like Izumi.

130
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,220
Who'd have thought?

131
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,700
What are you talking about?!

132
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,150
You don't have a clue!

133
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,220
What are <i>you</i> talking about?

134
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,160
You're the one without a clue.

135
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,110
Shinichi.

136
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,070
She's approximately 10 meters away.

137
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,410
You're awake now?

138
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,420
Guidance Office

139
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
Excuse me.

140
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,710
Come in, please.

141
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,450
Izumi Shinichi-kun,
I believe you know what I am.

142
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,540
Yeah...

143
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,820
"Yeah"?

144
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,940
That's no way to speak to your teacher, is it?

145
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,020
There's no need to be so tense.

146
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,950
Your right hand should know that 
I have no intention of killing you.

147
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,480
Besides, if we were to fight 
in such close quarters,

148
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,740
we would both end up mortally wounded.

149
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,050
I would like to talk some more with you.

150
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,240
Can you make time to meet after school today?

151
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,850
All right.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
What if it's a trap?!

153
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,670
I want nothing to do with this!

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,510
Why are humans so irrational?

155
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,260
What?!

156
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,110
If I wanted to kill you,
 I already would have.

157
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,890
Huh?

158
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,650
I am curious about you.

159
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,890
You are the first case of this 
nature I have come across.

160
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,760
That's why I want more data.

161
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,660
I'd like to exchange information

162
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,910
and discuss the future with you.

163
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,950
The future?

164
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,960
Well, that's all I wanted to say.

165
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,040
Tamiya-sensei.

166
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,670
Yes?

167
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,790
Uh, do you have any plans today?

168
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,800
Yes, I am counseling some students.

169
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,110
I see.

170
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,380
Excuse me.

171
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,060
Hey, come with me to the bookstore.

172
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,730
Sure.

173
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,820
Hey, that's...

174
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,920
Shinichi, roll up your sleeves.

175
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,900
Why?

176
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,530
It's not like we're going to fight.

177
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,130
Because there are two people coming.

178
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,800
Huh?!

179
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,140
Or should I say, two of my kind?

180
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,950
So it <i>was</i> a trap?!

181
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,140
We don't know that yet.

182
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,970
More importantly, Shinichi,

183
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,810
slow down your heartbeat some, will you?

184
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,060
You're making me anxious.

185
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,320
Easy for you to say!

186
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,110
Sorry for the wait.

187
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,210
Allow me to introduce you to A-san.

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
"A-san"?

189
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,810
He doesn't have a name.

190
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,210
Who the hell is he?

191
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
How can we consider him one of us?

192
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,480
Stop it.

193
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,300
There is no advantage in trying 
to kill each other here.

194
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,590
I see.

195
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,510
So you have only met those two types so far.

196
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,440
Yeah.

197
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,180
So, Izumi-kun.

198
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,320
What do <i>you</i> think we are?

199
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,230
Man-eating monsters.

200
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,820
What else should I think?

201
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,750
Well, you see, A-san and I tried having sex.

202
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,040
S-Sorry!

203
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,910
Excuse me!

204
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,170
What do you think happened as a result?

205
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes. I became pregnant.

206
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,570
So, here's a question for you:

207
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,060
The "thing" that's growing inside me 
now... What do you think it is?

208
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,130
W-Well...

209
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,060
A normal human being, no?

210
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,580
Well done.

211
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,360
Yes, an ordinary human baby.

212
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,200
Then, what does that make us?

213
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,520
I don't know.

214
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
That's what I'd like to ask, too.

215
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,710
You eat other humans in order 
to keep your human host alive.

216
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,710
That's like cannibalism.

217
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,130
Why would you do something like that?

218
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,720
Did you try asking that to your right hand?

219
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,470
I receive nutrients directly 
through Shinichi's blood.

220
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,220
I consequently do not experience hunger,

221
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
nor do I know the reasons for cannibalism.

222
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,330
We have no reproductive capabilities,

223
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,580
and endlessly engage in 
quasi-cannibalistic activities.

224
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,780
Do such life forms exist anywhere else?

225
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,240
I thought that strange, as well.

226
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,990
Do you count as a life form or not?

227
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,420
Either way,

228
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,200
I find it difficult to believe you're of this world.

229
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,650
I'm leaving.

230
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,940
Knowing what I am will not change anything.

231
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,730
I will eat when I feel hungry,

232
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,990
and I will eliminate any who stand in my way.

233
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,380
That's all there is.

234
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,330
He is dangerous.

235
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,030
He should be eliminated.

236
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,010
Perhaps it's a difference in 
our maturation environments.

237
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,520
So...

238
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,850
Humans can take illogical actions at times,

239
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,180
so I feel I should give you a warning.

240
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,150
Supposing you choose to see me 
as an enemy and cause a scene,

241
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,960
you are at a greater disadvantage 
since you cannot change your face.

242
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,730
I prefer to safeguard my current 
"human" identity, as well,

243
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,720
so I do not intend to do anything extreme.

244
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,610
However, if I so choose, I can 
take on an entire classroom...

245
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,730
and massacre everyone in three seconds.

246
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,640
You have friends in my class, do you not?

247
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,400
Shinichi, are you home?

248
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,470
Impressive.

249
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,580
I did not expect her to elicit such terror from you.

250
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,230
That's cold!

251
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,840
Why must you do that, Shinichi?

252
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,340
You took the bus yesterday evening, didn't you?

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,360
Where'd you go?

254
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,420
Satomi was worried about you, too.

255
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,850
Oh, nowhere really.

256
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,400
Shinichi, we are under attack.

257
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
I sense nothing but killing intent from it.

258
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,900
Huh?

259
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,190
Sensei?

260
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,030
What's wrong?

261
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,650
Fool.

262
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,200
S-S-Someone, help!

263
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,200
Hey, are you all right?!

264
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,080
W-We have an intruder...

265
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,490
Call the police!

266
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,460
Evacuate the students!

267
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,450
You will now study on your own.

268
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,510
We're under attack? From who?

269
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,680
Most likely the male we met yesterday.

270
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,830
Hold it!

271
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,910
Why did you enter the school 
grounds without permission?!

272
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,050
Come with me!

273
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,840
He just neutralized three obstacles.

274
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,790
You mean he killed people?

275
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,460
I am not sure,

276
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,770
but he is certainly brash.

277
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,660
A knife?

278
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,550
Dear God... The intruder has a knife?!

279
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,810
Th-This is an emergency announcement!

280
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,300
There is an intruder in the building!

281
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,420
Huh?

282
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,790
Students are to follow their teachers' instructions

283
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,550
An intruder?

284
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,030
Evacuate?

285
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,240
and evacuate to the school grounds

286
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,560
I don't remember them saying 
there'd be a safety drill today.

287
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,570
in groups according to class.

288
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,390
I repeat: there is an intruder in the building.

289
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,590
Damn it!

290
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,590
I can't believe he's doing this in broad daylight!

291
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,750
Students are to follow their teachers' instructions

292
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,660
He's optimistic about his 
chances and lacks forethought.

293
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,450
and evacuate to the school grounds

294
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,260
He's not at all like Tamiya Ryoko.

295
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,260
in groups according to class.

296
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,570
Hey, where is she, anyway?

297
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,790
She is approximately 150 meters away.

298
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,080
It appears she intends to observe our fight.

299
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,710
Guess that's better than her joining the enemy.

300
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,770
Evacuate using the stairs near Wing C

301
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,210
and do not approach Wing A 
under any circumstances.

302
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,250
Tamiya-sensei!

303
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,420
She's not here?

304
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,220
All right, come with me.

305
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,410
Don't push!

306
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,720
Don't push. Stay in line and keep moving.

307
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,570
We should fight, Shinichi.

308
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,540
Fight?

309
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,220
Why?

310
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,480
Our opponent strode in without any 
regard for witnesses in broad daylight.

311
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,020
Even if we run, he will come after us.

312
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,570
It's better to take him out now.

313
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,740
But...

314
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,490
Besides, we currently have the advantage.

315
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,740
I have a plan.

316
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,370
A plan?

317
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,190
Hey, who've you been talking to?

318
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,460
Huh? Oh, just thinking out loud.

319
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,540
Hey, think that's the intruder?

320
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,670
Huh? Where?

321
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,420
Over there. That middle-aged dude.

322
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,630
No way!

323
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,130
There really is an intruder!

324
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,640
Hey, stay in line!

325
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,630
He is attempting to pinpoint 
your—no, my location,

326
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,640
but this crowd is preventing him.

327
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,190
If...

328
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,650
If he finds us, what will happen?

329
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,610
He will attack us, of course,

330
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,650
along with everyone around us. 
He will not hold back.

331
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,880
But that is also what we want.

332
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,530
What we want?

333
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,420
As he scythes down the people around you,

334
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,540
I will move swiftly to pierce his heart.

335
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,020
It's simplistic,

336
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,880
but it has a high probability of success.

337
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,050
The people around me?!

338
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,550
<i>That's</i> your...

339
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,240
Yes, that's my plan.

340
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,540
You are being protected by a shield—
a "wall of meat," you could say.

341
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,690
To A, it should pose a most 
inconvenient obstacle.

342
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,320
A "wall of meat"...

343
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,220
I had forgotten what you are!

344
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,750
Murano!

345
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,750
Izumi-kun!

346
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,240
Did you forget something?

347
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,030
I'll come with you!

348
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,440
Don't come near me!

349
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,860
Get away from me!

350
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,570
What?

351
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,570
Oh, um...

352
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,410
Sorry!

353
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,080
Just get out of here and take refuge fast!

354
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,220
What's the matter, Shinichi?

355
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,530
You did not find my plan to your liking?

356
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,800
Of course not!

357
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,340
How many people do you intend to kill?

358
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,170
But it's to protect myself.

359
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,220
You sacrifice other lives so 
that your own life can continue.

360
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,680
That is how animals live.

361
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,560
Your Japanese is really good.

362
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,010
You understand human speech so well,

363
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,490
yet why do you...

364
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,500
I remember now.

365
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,740
Humans are one-of-a-kind 
creatures that commit suicide.

366
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,740
It's not that I want to die.

367
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,380
What are you doing?

368
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,250
This is a better option 
than using a wall of meat.

369
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,930
Class 3-2!

370
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,250
Stay in line!

371
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,980
Are you upset, Migi?

372
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,380
Upset?

373
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,250
I do not have time for that.

374
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,760
I must think of our next move.

375
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,390
Shinichi, what do you 
think separates us from A?

376
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,700
What separates us?

377
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,390
He's a killer,

378
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,450
and I'm a morally upright high school student.

379
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,150
He can become someone else.

380
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,150
I can't.

381
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,150
He's one.

382
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,030
I am two.

383
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,690
Is that true?

384
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,240
Huh?

385
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,120
Does A perceive us as  
being two distinct entities?

386
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,270
What do you mean?

387
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,670
Here's your weapon, Shinichi.

388
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,950
"My" weapon?

389
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,880
That's right.

390
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,580
A and I are just about evenly matched.

391
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,760
So there is only one solution.

392
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,180
You must join in the fight.

393
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,450
If you become flustered and hold me back,

394
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,360
we will lose.

395
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,690
On the other hand, if you fight 
effectively, we will win.

396
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,870
"Effectively"?

397
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,690
How?

398
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,840
We delegate roles.

399
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,570
See...

400
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,880
Will that really work?

401
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,600
Well, let's try it out.

402
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,360
Conceal that weapon.

403
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,390
<i>It's true that Migi is far more 
of a combat expert than I am.</i>

404
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,280
<i>He's already killed two of his kind.</i>

405
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,110
<i>Right. I just have to trust him.</i>

406
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,590
He's coming, Shinichi.

407
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,850
A is within three meters of us.

408
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,980
Three meters?!

409
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,740
Wh-Where?!

410
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,350
I don't see him!

411
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,230
He's directly below us.

412
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,960
Was that meant to be a barricade?

413
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,710
You've only cut off your escape route.

414
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,030
Disheveled Hair

415
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,260
Next time:

416
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,820
"Disheveled Hair."
