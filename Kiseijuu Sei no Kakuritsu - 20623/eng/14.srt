1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,740
Izumi-kun, your eyes...

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,360
They're so empty.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,610
<i>Goodbye.</i>

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,690
Parasyte

5
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,690
The Maxim

6
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,750
The Selfish Gene

7
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,000
Shinichi, you had me worried back there.

8
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,330
It was just as well.

9
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,350
If that man had been watching us again,

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,760
he'd start treating Murano 
like a monster, too.

11
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,850
That man?

12
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,370
Yeah, the man we ran into before...

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,980
He was watching me this afternoon.

14
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,160
Why didn't you say so sooner?

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,600
You would've tried to kill him if I had.

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,440
I have shifted my thinking.

17
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,100
He is continuing his investigation 
of you, isn't he?

18
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,450
If the same individual is continuing the 
operation despite his cover being blown,

19
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,850
it may mean that the enemy is 
surprisingly small in number.

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,240
We might as well track down everyone 
involved in their investigation, and—

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Kill all of them?

22
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,270
No.

23
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,410
I have come to realize just how much you 
reject the notion of killing other humans.

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,090
We must work together.

25
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,860
Yeah, right.

26
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,180
So we should table killing for now

27
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,510
and just investigate him.

28
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,350
How?

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,100
We'll call an ally and enlist their help.

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,540
An ally, huh?

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,230
Where can we find an ally 
in the whole wide world—

32
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,110
Oh!

33
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,430
Thank you for coming all the way here.

34
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,620
Fukuyamadai Station

35
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm sorry to get you involved in all this.

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,450
No need to apologize!

37
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,840
You're the only one I know 
who's in the same boat as me!

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,330
We have to help each other!

39
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,590
But you've already helped me before.

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,170
Yeah, no shit.

41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,700
I didn't ask for any of this!

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,720
Th-That wasn't me.

43
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,350
Yeah.

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,740
I see.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,850
But you should just off that guy already.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,160
It's not that easy, okay?

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,630
So do you have any leads 
on who's behind all this?

48
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,110
Well, kind of.

49
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,910
Assuming the enemy is not an organized entity,

50
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,030
we do have an idea.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,590
Well, supposing we just catch the 
guy instead of offing him,

52
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,290
I hope you at least know his face.

53
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,580
I remember it well.

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,460
He looks like this.

55
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,290
Okay, got it.

56
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,840
F-For now,

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,170
I'll stay in the business 
hotel by the train station.

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,780
Okay.

59
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,180
Oh, by the way.

60
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,530
About his name: we decided 
"Parasite" was too confusing

61
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,480
because they use that term 
on TV and on the web,

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,330
so we're calling him Joe now.

63
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,190
"Joe" for "jaw"?

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,140
Yeah.

65
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,740
Heh, who gives a shit about names?

66
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,550
That's right.

67
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,640
Names are unimportant.

68
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,450
You look exhausted.

69
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,580
Investigation Report

70
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,580
You should go see a doctor.

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,960
I did go to a doctor, see?!

72
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,460
That's not what I meant.

73
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,830
Of course you don't believe me.

74
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,390
A right hand stretching out and attacking me?

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,790
But I actually did get hurt.

76
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,250
This is real, isn't it? Isn't it?!

77
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,970
Please calm down.

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,590
I may not look it, but I've 
calmed down quite a bit.

79
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,520
And I've thought long and 
hard about what's happened.

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,250
About what that thing was.

81
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,030
But I haven't been able to find 
an answer that makes any sense.

82
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,870
I'll pay you for your work up to this point,

83
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,660
but let's stop here.

84
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,230
Stop?

85
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,470
When we're right in the thick of things?

86
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,050
But what about me?

87
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,400
What about everything going through my mind?

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
I still haven't figured out what that thing was!

89
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,390
Asking me to believe your story 
is far more unreasonable.

90
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,560
Well...

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,120
Oh, I know!

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,970
You said something

93
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,670
about Izumi Shinichi's right 
hand before, didn't you?

94
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,480
Did I?

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,240
You did!

96
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,660
You definitely did!

97
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,550
I see it now!

98
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,320
You knew it, too!

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,270
That's right!

100
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,780
That's the real reason you 
asked me to investigate him!

101
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,230
What <i>is</i> that monster?

102
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,550
Please, tell me the truth!

103
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,410
Please stop this.

104
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,550
I'm leaving now.

105
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,530
W-Wait!

106
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,140
You can't fool me!

107
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,750
Ow...

108
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,640
<i>It seems this is as far as 
I can go with human help.</i>

109
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,280
<i>In the end, little was accomplished.</i>

110
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,150
<i>Should I get rid of that 
private investigator?</i>

111
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,790
<i>Was I laughing?</i>

112
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,420
<i>This is the first time I've 
felt a natural urge to laugh.</i>

113
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,170
<i>When I saw how flustered 
that human was...</i>

114
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,940
<i>I forgot the corresponding facial expression.</i>

115
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,330
Kuramori

116
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,930
<i>She's already asleep.</i>

117
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,760
Man, I'm exhausted.

118
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,100
Well, well. Making yourself comfortable?

119
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,230
Want some?

120
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,440
Thanks, but no thanks.

121
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,870
Are you wrapped up in 
something dangerous lately?

122
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,820
Huh?

123
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,400
You're having bad dreams at night.

124
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,800
You cry out.

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,410
You got injured, too.

126
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,000
Nothing's really going on.

127
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,930
Hey, are you sure this job

128
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,920
is just a background check?

129
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,210
What're you implying?

130
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,150
Just saying there's nothing 
to gain by sticking your nose

131
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,600
into things that're beyond you.

132
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,700
So you are going to drink.

133
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,320
If it's a risky job,

134
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,630
there are cops for that sort of thing.

135
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,430
You're a small-timer, remember?

136
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,280
You should know your place.

137
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,690
Know my place, huh?

138
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,860
Yup, stay small.

139
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,740
I'm your husband, for crying out loud.

140
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
The Japanese Mystery Genre   The Western Mystery Genre   Mystery Anthology

141
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,010
<i>Just watch.</i>

142
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,090
<i>I'm gonna surprise everyone!</i>

143
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,780
Parasites can sense others of their kind

144
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,260
who are nearby through their signals.

145
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,020
They can't quite talk to each 
other like on a phone call,

146
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,180
but if they agree on predetermined 
signals in advance,

147
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,260
simple communication is possible.

148
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,950
Shinichi.

149
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,170
They found him.

150
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,940
Okay.

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,520
We'll meet up at the next corner.

152
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,440
Got it.

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,800
Good.

154
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,120
I wasn't sure you'd show up again.

155
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,340
Please keep quiet.

156
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,000
Please get in.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,350
He's with you?

158
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,420
What do you intend to do with me?!

159
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,620
We don't intend to cause you any harm.

160
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,340
We're just going somewhere we can talk.

161
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,210
<i>He doesn't have to be so terrified...</i>

162
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,730
There are a lot of things we want to ask you.

163
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,240
But first, we'd like you to 
hear our side of the story.

164
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,930
S-Sure, I'm all ears!

165
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,830
But who's that guy?

166
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,580
His face's shape is all wrong!

167
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,100
He's modified his face so that you 
won't learn what he looks like.

168
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,910
Um, okay.

169
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,440
First, please listen carefully 
to what I tell you.

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
My life is at stake.

171
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,030
S-Sure.

172
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,840
<i>I told him everything that had happened</i>

173
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,760
<i>since the day Migi burrowed into my hand.</i>

174
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,810
<i>At first, the P.I. was taken aback,</i>

175
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,580
<i>but he regained his calm as I told my story.</i>

176
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,030
<i>But the doubt never left his eyes,</i>

177
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,510
<i>even at the very end.</i>

178
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,280
I see.

179
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,430
I now know where you're coming from.

180
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,000
Your story's so absurd that

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,440
I'd never believe it under 
normal circumstances,

182
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,040
but given that there's a 
monster right in front of me,

183
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,920
I have to at least believe some of it.

184
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,020
So?

185
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,400
What do you want me to do?

186
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,110
I'd like you to keep quiet about us.

187
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,610
Please.

188
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,350
But based on what you said,

189
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,920
there are other monsters, too, right?

190
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,560
You want to just leave them be?

191
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,190
If you really care about 
what's best for humanity,

192
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,350
you should come forward,

193
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,610
even if it would mean becoming a lab rat!

194
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,340
Even if it would mean sacrificing yourself,

195
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,500
you should think of the good of humanity!

196
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,590
Isn't that what it means to be human?!

197
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,500
Let's just off this guy!

198
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,520
You're right.

199
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,540
Wait!

200
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,040
Self-sacrifice, my ass.

201
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,490
Listen up!

202
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,680
If you have the right to live,

203
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,230
so do we.

204
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,680
Granted, I believe "rights" are a 
concept unique to the human species.

205
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,860
In any event, we will do 
anything necessary to survive.

206
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,280
I cannot allow him to come 
forward and become a lab rat.

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,740
If that means you will become our enemy,

208
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,230
I'm prepared to kill you anytime.

209
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,160
Take a good look at him.

210
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,910
He's only a high schooler in his teens.

211
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,160
He's only a child from your 
perspective, isn't he?

212
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,490
But his mother's been murdered.

213
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,130
He's stepped over a pile of corpses,

214
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,590
and endured so much more.

215
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,920
He's still trying his hardest to live.

216
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,430
Where is your pity?

217
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,570
Compare his life to yours.

218
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,340
Could you have endured what he's endured?

219
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,010
<i>Migi's not sounding like himself at all.</i>

220
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,480
<i>I'm sure he's saying it all to 
achieve a certain effect, but...</i>

221
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,730
Um, I really don't want to kill you.

222
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,900
Get out of here! Hurry!

223
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,030
Yeah, I know.

224
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,200
I have one more question for you.

225
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,160
Who asked you to investigate Shinichi?

226
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,970
That's...

227
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,290
That's the one thing I can't tell you!

228
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,650
Heh.

229
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,420
So you're sticking with the whole 
"a P.I. never reveals his clients" thing, huh?

230
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,760
We have a pretty good idea.

231
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,940
I'll be blunt.

232
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,960
Your client is a parasite.

233
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,260
Wh...

234
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,380
What'd you say?!

235
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,530
She was mentioned in his story.

236
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,140
It's the female teacher who vanished 
from his high school, Tamiya Ryouko.

237
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,300
T-Tamiya?

238
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,250
She's already changed her name,

239
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,280
but perhaps your client's 
name sounds like hers?

240
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,770
Tamiya Ryouko...

241
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,890
Tamura Reiko...

242
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,220
Yeah, we're pretty half-assed 
when it comes to names.

243
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,480
If you refuse to back down,

244
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,250
it won't be us, but your 
client who'll kill you.

245
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,040
<i>It can't be...</i>

246
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,750
Incoming Call 
Unknown Caller 
Decline  Answer

247
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,010
Is that you, Izumi?

248
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,280
You're...

249
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,360
I didn't expect her to come calling so soon

250
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,770
after we figured it might be her.

251
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,350
She even wants to meet on the 
roof of a university building.

252
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,020
What's she trying to pull?

253
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,120
We are currently 130 meters 
away from Tamiya Ryouko.

254
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,400
She must be somewhere behind that building.

255
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,680
Don't tell me she's now a university lecturer

256
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,260
after her stint as a high school teacher.

257
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,910
Altruism in Animals: 
Unanswered Questions

258
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,910
"Altruism" is behavior undertaken 
for the benefit of another.

259
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,830
It is the opposite of "selfishness."

260
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,250
At first glance, altruistic behavior 
poses no advantage for the self.

261
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,770
Rather, it is behavior that 
helps others despite posing

262
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,550
a distinct disadvantage to the self.

263
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,060
It is perhaps not so rare among human beings,

264
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,260
It's a baby!

265
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,610
So cute.

266
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,560
but altruistic behavior has also been observed

267
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,650
among a number of animal species.

268
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,870
For example, honeybees 
will sacrifice themselves

269
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,150
to protect the hive when predators appear.

270
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,650
This behavior may be instinctive.

271
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,410
However, there exists a 
prime example of behavior

272
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,160
that does not serve to 
protect one's own species:

273
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,160
infanticide.

274
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,410
Why do animals kill offspring 
of their own species?

275
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,170
The prevailing theory in recent years

276
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,150
is the "selfish gene."

277
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:10,180
Selfish Gene

278
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,880
In a nutshell,

279
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,180
the body of an animal is 
merely its DNA's puppet.

280
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,280
What matters is not its species, but itself,

281
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,430
and its own offspring who 
will inherit its DNA.

282
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,680
If we apply this theory more broadly,

283
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,730
it can explain a wide variety 
of altruistic behavior,

284
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,880
such as caring for others in a herd,

285
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,730
familial love, marital love,

286
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,440
and even maternal love.

287
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,010
This would mean that there is 
no such thing as compassion or love.

288
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,430
All behavior that appears to stem from love is,

289
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,460
in fact, merely behavior to better the 
transmission of an individual's DNA.

290
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,930
Of course, this theory is 
not without its problems.

291
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,360
There are multiple cases observed 
in nature where animals help others

292
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,660
who will have no impact on the 
transmission of their own DNA

293
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,970
and even others who are of an 
entirely different species.

294
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,200
In addition,

295
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,020
it's uncertain whether complex human thought

296
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,730
can be captured in full by this theory.

297
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,360
In that sense,

298
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,040
it may be interesting to consider 
whether human efforts in the realm

299
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,060
of environmental and nature conservation

300
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,640
are altruistic or selfish in nature.

301
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,850
<i>It's almost time.</i>

302
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,590
Who holds their baby like that?

303
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,250
I don't know...

304
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,860
I'm glad you came.

305
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,080
You look well.

306
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,010
Why here?

307
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,090
I chose this location

308
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,390
because others of my kind are rarely present.

309
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,460
There was also a lecture here I wanted to attend.

310
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,790
I see it's true.

311
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,770
You are very different from before.

312
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,160
How did you two mix?

313
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,450
What happened?

314
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,150
I find it difficult to believe 
it happened on its own.

315
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,160
Is that baby yours?

316
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,690
Yes, it is.

317
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,500
I haven't done anything to it yet.

318
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,500
Done... anything?

319
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,290
Your right hand...

320
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,980
"Migi," was it?

321
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,100
Why don't we exchange information again?

322
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,260
It'll benefit us both.

323
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,560
I'd first like to confirm

324
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,390
that it was you who hired the 
private investigator.

325
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,090
Did it not occur to you

326
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,890
that doing so entailed a 
certain amount of risk to yourself?

327
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,980
I can handle myself.

328
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,400
I can just assume another 
identity, if necessary.

329
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,060
You know about the mayor, 
Hirokawa, don't you?

330
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,010
What're you all planning, 
making a monster into a mayor?

331
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,130
I don't know much about it, either.

332
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,240
But we are evolving as a species.

333
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,830
We have realized that just going around

334
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,710
killing and eating humans is not safe for us.

335
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,910
We have to consider how to 
coexist with humans from now on.

336
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,690
Coexist, huh?

337
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,320
Shimada Hideo said the same 
thing, but in the end...

338
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,300
For example,

339
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,940
can't it be said that, in a certain sense, 
humans and livestock coexist?

340
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,990
Of course, they are not equal.

341
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,440
From a pig's perspective, humans are 
merely monsters who feed upon them.

342
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,550
See, it is the human species who are 
making grandiose statements like,

343
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,730
"All life on Earth must coexist."

344
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,950
There may be some truth 
to what you're saying,

345
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,070
but I...

346
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,040
I have reasons why I absolutely 
can't forgive your kind!

347
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,920
What happened?

348
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,090
You no longer seem like a normal human being.

349
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,420
I'm not sure how to describe it, but...

350
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,250
Mother and child...

351
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,790
I heard your mother has gone missing.

352
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,440
Was she killed?

353
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,370
Shinichi, calm down!

354
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,470
I see!

355
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,530
One of us fed on her!

356
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,870
Well, well... Impressive.

357
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,050
It's as if your rage is moving the air itself.

358
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,300
I'll kill you!

359
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,550
I think I will lose if I fight you now.

360
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,310
I'll just have to use this child as a shield.

361
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
What are you doing?

362
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,300
<i>It appears human children are more 
perceptive than adults.</i>

363
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,270
Quiet.

364
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,280
<i>Why is that bitch...</i>

365
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,910
<i>Why?!</i>

366
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,600
Out of the way, humans!

367
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,760
What's the matter with you, Shinichi?

368
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,170
Why can't you calm down?

369
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,010
<i>I can't forgive her.</i>

370
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,140
<i>I just can't! Not her!</i>

371
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,100
I'll just have to use this child as a shield.

372
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,850
I haven't done anything to it yet.

373
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,110
Hey, you there.

374
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,000
You!

375
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,540
Fortune Teller

376
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,240
That's right, you.

377
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,540
Come, let me take a look.

378
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,070
What's going on?

379
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,690
You look like you've been through a lot.

380
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,580
Show me your hand.

381
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,130
Your hand.

382
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,800
<i>The left hand?</i>

383
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Fortune Telling

384
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,370
Right now,

385
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,300
you have a hole in your heart, don't you?

386
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,010
Huh?!

387
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,120
How'd you know that?

388
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,560
Oh, it's a huge, gaping hole.

389
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,960
How can I, um...

390
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,180
How can I close it?

391
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,060
Meet the person.

392
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,690
Huh?

393
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,270
Meet the one who opened that hole again.

394
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,950
Meet that person, and talk 
everything over to bring closure.

395
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,770
Listen well.

396
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,100
That person is the only one

397
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,700
who can seal that hole.

398
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,280
I killed that person.

399
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,490
Next time:

400
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,070
Something Wicked This Way Comes

401
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,180
"Something Wicked This Way Comes."
