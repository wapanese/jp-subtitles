1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,730
If I recall correctly,

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,180
your host is physically in its late teens, yes?

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,110
Yeah, that sounds about right.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,280
Then I believe I'll ask you to do this.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,580
I'd like you to keep a close eye on the boy

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,870
and observe without killing him.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,120
Is there any point to that?

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,210
Yes.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,760
He poses some danger to us,

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,400
but he is also a valuable asset in determining

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,940
our future as a species.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,020
Izumi Shinichi, huh...

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,710
Parasyte

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,710
The Maxim

15
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,200
Freezing Point

16
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,300
Yo.

17
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,490
Mitsuo!

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
Kana.

19
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,080
You going to see <i>him</i> again?

20
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,480
"Him"?

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,860
The guy trying to pretend he's a hero.

22
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,550
Let me through. I'm going home.

23
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,270
What's with you, Kana?

24
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,090
You're hurting me. Let go.

25
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,760
Don't tell me you're actually into him.

26
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,140
That's none of your business.

27
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,440
Kamijo, look.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,440
<i>Mitsuo?</i>

29
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,200
Hey, you bum.

30
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,960
Are you back to nab another girl?

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,330
Is he here?

32
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,950
"He"?

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,580
That poser called Izumi or whatever.

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,840
What gives you the right to...

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,710
Hey, there he is.

36
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,210
Hey, Izumi!

37
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,710
Mitsuo wants a word with you!

38
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,880
Oh, you again.

39
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,390
Who the hell are you?

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,730
Here again?

41
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,530
Can you keep it brief?

42
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,100
I have to meet up with someone.

43
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,990
Did you bang Kana?

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,830
Huh?

45
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,490
Oh, Kana's that girl—

46
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,040
Don't play dumb, you bastard!

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,340
You've got it all wrong.

48
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,000
I haven't even seen her recently,

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,900
and I was away on a trip before that.

50
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,380
A trip?

51
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,500
Anyway, there's your answer.

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,360
Screw that!

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Don't.

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,240
It's not going to go like it did last time.

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,220
Why, you...

56
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,620
Hey, are you okay?

57
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,240
Izumi-kun!

58
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,920
I heard about what's going on from 
Kamijo-kun at the school gate.

59
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,710
It's fine. Nothing's going on.

60
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,550
I'll leave your shoe here.

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Hey, want to stop in here?

62
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,230
I'm starving.

63
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Izumi-kun, did something happen on your trip?

64
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,340
Huh?

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,510
You're so different now.

66
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,990
I was just using my dad's injury as 
an excuse to ditch school for a bit.

67
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,640
Izumi-kun...

68
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,760
You <i>are</i> Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?

69
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,130
Well, I wonder about that.

70
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,110
Oh, c'mon.

71
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm me, of course.

72
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,890
And you're Murano Satomi-san, right?

73
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,920
Yup!

74
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,270
<i>Oh!</i>

75
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,580
<i>I can sense it...</i>

76
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>He's coming closer!</i>

77
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,290
<i>Why do I know that?</i>

78
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,540
<i>Soon, he'll come up those stairs...</i>

79
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,240
<i>See, I knew it!</i>

80
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm home.

81
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,850
Dad.

82
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,570
Oh, Shinichi.

83
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,470
Hungry?

84
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,680
I ate something.

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,530
What about you?

86
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,950
I'm not hungry.

87
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,720
Try to go easy on the drinking.

88
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,770
You should eat something, too.

89
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,960
Yeah...

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,490
I looked it up online,

91
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,960
and they recommend hiring a 
housekeeper in this kind of situation.

92
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,210
In what kind of situation?

93
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,210
Well, like...

94
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,520
When your mom—

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,000
When someone who used to handle your meals

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,890
suddenly isn't around anymore...

97
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,250
How can you even think of...

98
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,300
Never mind.

99
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,160
If you think hiring a housekeeper 
is a good idea, go ahead.

100
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,200
I wonder if something's wrong with my heart.

101
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
Like what?

102
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,670
I can't cry anymore.

103
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,040
Oh, that's all?

104
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,210
I feel like I've lost something.

105
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,790
Something that's an important 
part of being human.

106
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,430
That's senseless.

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,190
<i>Since Migi's cells scattered throughout my body,</i>

108
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,870
<i>my senses have become very acute.</i>

109
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,040
<i>My hearing is one example.</i>

110
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,140
<i>If I focus...</i>

111
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh, my! Hashimoto-san's son?

112
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,720
Yes! Isn't that shocking?!

113
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,700
Moving on to traffic information...

114
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,000
Metro Expressway 4

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,130
is currently experiencing a 10-kilometer 
traffic jam due to an accident...

116
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,130
Pigs!

117
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,340
accident... accident... accident... accident...

118
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,340
Pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs!

119
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,300
What's wrong?

120
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,980
Oh, nothing!

121
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,430
<i>I just heard something...</i>

122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,890
Izumi-kun?

123
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,450
Sorry, can you go on ahead without me?

124
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,960
<i>It's calling...</i>

125
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,570
<i>Calling for help.</i>

126
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
Can we save him?

127
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,910
Its internal organs are mush.
 They're irreparable.

128
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,340
It'll die within ten minutes.

129
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,450
<i>Sorry...</i>

130
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,860
<i>We can't help you.</i>

131
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,610
<i>But this is better than dying in 
a noisy place like that, right?</i>

132
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,100
Izumi-kun...

133
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,360
This guy's about to die.

134
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,000
Izumi-kun.

135
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,870
I was kind of scared.

136
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,370
Huh?

137
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,670
I thought that you'd changed.

138
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,120
I mean, you used to be a 
bit more nervous before.

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,380
But that's what I found 
kind of cute about you.

140
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,380
It made me feel safe.

141
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,660
But since the trip, I thought you had become...

142
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,510
kind of cold.

143
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,390
I guess I was just imagining it, though.

144
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,890
You're being so kind now.

145
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,890
It's dead.

146
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,390
What?

147
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,340
Its heart's stopped beating.

148
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,020
Let's go.

149
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,750
We're already late, though.

150
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,370
I-Izumi-kun?!

151
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,580
Huh?

152
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,860
How could you?!

153
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,040
I can't believe you did that!

154
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,990
You threw the puppy in the garbage!

155
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,360
Oh, do you think the janitor will be mad?

156
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,380
That's not what I'm talking about!

157
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,280
The puppy!

158
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,750
The poor puppy!

159
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,760
Poor? But it's dead.

160
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,810
But...

161
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,010
But that's not...

162
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,090
It's dead.

163
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,750
A dead dog isn't a dog anymore.

164
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,010
It's a dog-shaped lump of meat.

165
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,020
You're different.

166
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,430
Murano...

167
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,510
You <i>are</i> different!

168
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,570
The Izumi-kun I knew wouldn't...

169
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,650
He wouldn't...

170
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,860
Murano?!

171
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,470
<i>"Different"?</i>

172
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,290
<i>Have I changed?</i>

173
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,220
Migi.

174
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,120
Migi!

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,960
What?

176
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,450
You've been listening, right?

177
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,690
I apparently said something strange to her.

178
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,970
What did I say wrong?

179
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,660
You said nothing wrong...

180
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,200
Not from my perspective, anyway.

181
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,470
But you are quite different 
from the way you used to be.

182
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,940
"A dog-shaped lump of meat"...

183
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,980
That's something I'd be more likely to say.

184
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,190
I see.

185
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,460
Thanks, Migi.

186
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,470
<i>The dog's body will break 
down and become nutrients</i>

187
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,190
<i>that will be absorbed by this tree.</i>

188
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,690
<i>If I'd done this in the first place,</i>

189
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,110
<i>Murano wouldn't hate me now.</i>

190
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,210
Murano.

191
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,630
<i>I guess I won't get anywhere today.</i>

192
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,640
<i>I should give her space and talk to her later.</i>

193
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,010
Shinichi.

194
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,950
One of my kind is here.

195
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,910
What?!

196
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,710
Don't tell me, Tamiya Ryoko's back?

197
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,970
No, this one seems like a different individual.

198
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,850
It can't be Uda-san and Parasite, right?

199
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,540
Is it here to kill me?

200
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,490
I don't sense any hostility.

201
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,510
What should we do?

202
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,530
For now, let's meet it in a public place.

203
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,050
Meet an enemy?

204
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,130
It may not be our enemy.

205
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,960
Despite reacting to our presence,

206
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,330
it's continuing to calmly approach us.

207
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,530
I believe this one may 
be the Tamiya Ryoko type,

208
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,980
as in, the type you can reason with.

209
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,730
Reason with? What do you even mean by that?

210
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,120
It's coming.

211
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,130
Hey. Izumi-kun, right?

212
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,880
Who're you?

213
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,750
You're different from how I imagined you'd be.

214
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,320
You seem quite strong.

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
Why are you at school?

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
What're you here for?

217
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,390
Hey, Izumi. What're you arguing about?

218
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,270
I haven't seen you around.
Are you a transfer student?

219
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,440
You're interfering.

220
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm Shimada Hideo.

221
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,560
I recently settled on that as my name.

222
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,400
I thought I should start off

223
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,690
by becoming friends with you—
or should I say, the two of you.

224
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,610
<i>What the hell is up with this guy?</i>

225
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,760
Oh, I must go.

226
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,120
Izumi-kun, can you show me to Class 3?

227
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,380
<i>Class 3?</i>

228
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,870
<i>That's Murano's class.</i>

229
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,770
I'm looking forward to gym.

230
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,030
I think it's a joint session between our classes.

231
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Izumi

232
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,260
<i>If I went all-out, I'd set a world record.</i>

233
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,390
T-Ten point eight seconds?!

234
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,230
It's unusual to transfer schools at this time of year.

235
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeah, he said he had to move 
because of his dad's job.

236
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:26,800
Murano      Suzuki      Tachikawa

237
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm jealous.

238
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,200
I wish I was in the same class as Hide.

239
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
"Hide"?

240
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,240
Hide for Shimada Hideo.

241
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,550
I thought you liked Izumi-kun.

242
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,350
What? Like you don't.

243
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,060
Huh? Quit teasing me.

244
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,390
But Izumi-kun's with Satomi, right?

245
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,160
Huh?

246
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,870
Well, um...

247
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,380
Sports are very good.

248
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,690
The more you play, the better 
you become at using your body.

249
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,140
Why drag this out?

250
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,520
Are you planning to kill me 
once I let my guard down?

251
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,490
You misunderstand me.

252
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,030
Is that what your right hand thinks, as well?

253
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,530
Didn't Tamiya Ryoko send 
you to get rid of me?

254
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,430
Tamiya Ryoko?

255
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,060
Oh, she has a different name now.

256
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,360
But yes, she's the one who told me about you.

257
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,290
That's not what this is about, though.

258
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,570
I have no intention

259
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,930
of harming you, or anyone around you 
at this school, for that matter.

260
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,930
Actually, I haven't harmed 
any humans in recent memory.

261
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,130
I subsist on a diet similar to that of humans.

262
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,970
If parasites learned to exist without killing 
humans, there'd be no problem, right?

263
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,690
You expect me to believe you?

264
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,780
We're starting to look for a way

265
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,850
to coexist with humans in human society.

266
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,670
We wanted the two of you to think about that,

267
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,900
given that you're somewhere 
between humanity and our kind.

268
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,830
Interesting.

269
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,460
The things you say always 
manage to pique my interest.

270
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,270
Don't they?

271
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,840
However, I am only inclined to 
believe half of what you're saying.

272
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,680
Oh, okay.

273
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,130
Well, I don't desire conflict, either.

274
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,980
Let's call it a day.

275
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,180
Let's go, Shinichi.

276
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,910
Huh? Why now?

277
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,220
What's going on?

278
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,240
We weren't even done talking.

279
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,000
Shinichi, I'm going to sleep.

280
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,820
You're drowsy again?

281
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,330
I'll be out for about four hours.

282
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,120
If he learns of this weakness, 
who knows what he will do?

283
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,500
<i>Izumi-kun...</i>

284
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,170
<i>I was really shocked when you did that,</i>

285
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,300
<i>but most people wouldn't have given 
that puppy any thought at all.</i>

286
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
<i>That's right.</i>

287
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,310
<i>I shouldn't have said that 
he's cold and unfeeling now.</i>

288
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,120
<i>What should I do?</i>

289
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,320
<i>If he's really thinking about 
coexistence with humans,</i>

290
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,070
<i>maybe we can figure out a clever workaround...</i>

291
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,790
<i>No, how I can trust them?</i>

292
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,280
<i>They're merciless!</i>

293
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,170
<i>They may be highly intelligent,</i>

294
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,720
<i>but emotionally, they're just like insects.</i>

295
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,670
<i>That's right...</i>

296
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,030
<i>How could I forget?</i>

297
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,410
<i>Forget...</i>

298
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,460
<i>I'll expose them someday!</i>

299
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,820
H-Hi...

300
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,630
About the other day, um...

301
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,250
I-It's okay.

302
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,740
Talk to you later.

303
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,070
Huh? Um...

304
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,880
You jerk.

305
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,230
Why'd you have to scare Murano?

306
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,840
<i>I have a super power,</i>

307
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,730
<i>and it lets me sense my soul mate.</i>

308
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,360
<i>Here he comes...</i>

309
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,780
Hello.

310
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,680
What can I do for you?

311
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,160
Sorry, wrong person.

312
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,270
That's strange.

313
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,930
I thought you were Izumi.

314
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,210
Izumi?

315
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,210
What do you mean by that?

316
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,590
Huh?

317
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,070
When you mistake someone for another person,

318
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,340
it's because they look similar in appearance, right?

319
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,590
How are Izumi and I similar?

320
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,850
Hey, I said "sorry."

321
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,600
Hey! What are you doing?!

322
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,850
<i>That sounds like...</i>

323
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,300
Let me go!

324
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,850
I just want to talk to you for a bit.

325
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,360
You! What do you think you're doing?

326
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,650
Help!

327
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,440
I just wanted to talk to her.

328
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,330
She seems to be rather perceptive.

329
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,720
If anything happens to anyone I know,

330
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,460
I'll kill you first.

331
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,960
You think I'm not capable of doing that?

332
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
You're a scary one.

333
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,970
Like I said many times, I have 
no intention of fighting you.

334
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,590
What's with him?

335
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,220
His eyes don't look right.

336
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,960
<i>His right hand seemed to 
have a really weak signal.</i>

337
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,220
<i>Was I imagining it?</i>

338
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,230
Izumi, are you sure you aren't actually strong?

339
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,330
Huh?

340
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,700
Hey, Izumi, can you walk 
me to the train station?

341
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,930
I'm scared that guy might be there.

342
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,910
Oh, sure.

343
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,410
<i>Not again... God, this sucks!</i>

344
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,260
What's wrong?

345
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,120
Telepathy?

346
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,060
Yeah.

347
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,530
I can somehow tell when you're close.

348
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,170
I don't know why I got it 
wrong just now, though.

349
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,680
Well, it's not like I was totally off 
since you came along right away, I guess.

350
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't think that's really a good thing.

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,560
Huh?

352
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,220
I mean, whatever you're sensing

353
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,510
might be weird wavelengths given 
off by dangerous guys like him.

354
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,880
So you're a dangerous guy, too?

355
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,950
S-Sure, I am, too.

356
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,160
So don't go near guys like him anymore.

357
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,420
<i>I guess I'll use this face as bait today.</i>

358
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,970
<i>That female has had a healthy lifestyle.</i>

359
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,630
<i>Her skin has a nice sheen to it, too.</i>

360
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,030
Hey, are you lost?

361
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,040
Um, I...

362
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,000
I can help you if you'd like.

363
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,190
Dad.

364
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,110
I know.

365
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm going to bed.

366
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,450
Goodnight.

367
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,700
Shinichi.

368
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,960
When did you become so strong?

369
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,670
Are you...

370
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,470
made of steel?

371
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,140
Sorry.

372
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,450
There.

373
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,450
I think it came out pretty good.

374
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,030
Beyond Good and Evil

375
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,870
Next time:

376
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,210
"Beyond Good and Evil."
