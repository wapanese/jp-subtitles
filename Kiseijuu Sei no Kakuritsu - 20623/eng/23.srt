1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,480
<i>There's no way I can pinpoint Gotou</i>

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,260
<i>from the sound of his breathing 
alone, when it's pitch dark.</i>

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,930
<i>I have no chance of winning.</i>

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>Strangely enough, all my emotions...</i>

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,030
<i>My will to live, my fear of 
death, anger and grief...</i>

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,100
<i>They're all numb.</i>

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,180
<i>But I'm heading straight back there,</i>

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,790
<i>as if something urges me along.</i>

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,380
<i>Right now, what's motivating me isn't courage,</i>

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,890
<i>nor any sense of duty telling me to 
fight as a champion of the human race.</i>

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,350
<i>It's just that by tomorrow,</i>

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,720
<i>I may have to witness even more deaths</i>

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,910
<i>caused by the monster I brought with me.</i>

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>It's about time my turn came.</i>

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,030
<i>It's not right that I've managed 
to stay alive for so long.</i>

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,210
<i>I should try to finish this,</i>

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,540
<i>even if it might mean certain death.</i>

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,540
<i>I don't care anymore.</i>

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,360
<i>I'm tired.</i>

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,690
<i>I guess I'm trying to escape reality,</i>

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,300
<i>but why do I feel optimistic?</i>

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,660
<i>I don't even know why, myself.</i>

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,360
<i>I just feel like things might 
somehow work out, if I just go.</i>

24
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,130
<i>I know it'll never work that way, but...</i>

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,490
<i>What a strange feeling.</i>

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,650
<i>My senses are razor sharp.</i>

27
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,130
<i>And then, I found him.</i>

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,690
Parasyte

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,690
The Maxim

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,440
Life and Oath

31
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,020
<i>Is he asleep?</i>

32
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,590
<i>I guess even they sleep.</i>

33
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,140
<i>Migi slept often, too.</i>

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,350
<i>That's right.</i>

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,130
<i>I should've just attacked 
him when he was asleep.</i>

36
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,360
<i>Because I'm not a parasite...</i>

37
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,090
<i>Because Migi's gone, I could get this close without him noticing me.</i>

38
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,130
<i>Maybe this is why I've been feeling 
like things would work out somehow.</i>

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,370
<i>No, there's one more reason.</i>

40
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,780
<i>Migi...</i>

41
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,380
<i>Could you be alive in his body?</i>

42
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,290
<i>If I call out to you now, 
will you answer me?</i>

43
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,890
<i>Migi!</i>

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,070
<i>No way!</i>

45
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,390
<i>I know that's too good to be true.</i>

46
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,290
Shit!

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,070
It didn't work!

48
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,760
Where are you?!

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,540
Show yourself!

50
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,920
A mere human dares to challenge me?

51
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,670
<i>That's right...</i>

52
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,890
<i>Yeah, I'll fight you!</i>

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
<i>I know I can't possibly win,</i>

54
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,680
<i>but I can at least do some damage.</i>

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,740
<i>I'll make him bleed!</i>

56
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,300
<i>Even if I can't win in terms of power 
or speed, I have keener senses.</i>

57
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,190
<i>I can fight him!</i>

58
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,690
<i>As long as I have a plan, I can fight him!</i>

59
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>What should I do?</i>

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,450
<i>How can I hurt him?</i>

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,030
<i>Tell me how, Migi!</i>

62
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,720
<i>Give some thought to as many things, 
as many ideas, as you can come up with.</i>

63
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>Don't give up, no matter what,</i>

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,100
<i>and be flexible.</i>

65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,270
<i>That's right.</i>

66
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,560
<i>Don't give up!</i>

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
<i>Think!</i>

68
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,510
<i>The back of his neck...</i>

69
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,920
<i>Yes! When he's controlling 
the rest of his body,</i>

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,480
<i>that should be his weak spot.</i>

71
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,940
<i>Even if I can't win, I can hurt him.</i>

72
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,240
<i>Deal as deep a blow as possible...</i>

73
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,790
<i>Deep?</i>

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,810
<i>The organs most vital to him 
are packed in his torso.</i>

75
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,050
<i>I don't know where the chinks in his armor 
would be if struck from the side,</i>

76
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,070
<i>but if I strike downwards...</i>

77
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,960
<i>His digestive tract forms an opening from 
his neck down to the organs in his torso.</i>

78
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,250
<i>If I put all of my weight behind 
this weapon and strike...</i>

79
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,520
<i>The angle of attack is critical.</i>

80
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,850
<i>Now!</i>

81
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,710
<i>The cleaver's still lodged there?!</i>

82
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,730
<i>It's in the way!</i>

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,020
Brat...

84
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,130
Last time, you scurried away 
like a lizard that had lost its tail.

85
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,710
Are you trying to pick up 
the fight where we left off?

86
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,960
What do you think a lone human can do?

87
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,480
Monster...

88
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,850
That appearance suits you a lot 
better than a human face did!

89
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,590
Here, there's no need for me to look human.

90
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,800
I'd decided to stay here a while, 
since the air is clean and I feel great,

91
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,400
but I've been a bit bored.

92
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,220
I would welcome a fight,

93
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,880
but when you're the only opponent...

94
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,930
Migi!

95
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,870
Hey, Migi!

96
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,180
Are you in there?!

97
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,370
You're talking about your right hand?

98
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,230
Sorry to disappoint you. There's only me.

99
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,580
Damn you!

100
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,600
How...

101
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,280
How dare you kill Migi?!

102
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,940
I don't understand the way you fight at all.

103
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,450
This little tool, for one.

104
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,020
I've seen humans engage in fistfights, but...

105
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,280
That wouldn't...

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,220
<i>What is this place?!</i>

107
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,480
<i>The trash heap I saw the other day?</i>

108
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,730
<i>This is where I'm going to die?</i>

109
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,570
How disappointing.

110
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,640
I couldn't even call this a fight.

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,670
It could've been more interesting if I were 
fighting Tamura Reiko, who created me,

112
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,000
but she's apparently dead.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,580
Do you know anything about that?

114
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>T-Tamura Reiko?</i>

115
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,310
He is indeed one of our "fragile" kind 
that I created through experimentation,

116
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,850
but he is invincible.

117
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,220
<i>Fragile?</i>

118
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,760
<i>How is he fragile if he's invincible?</i>

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,470
Well, no matter.

120
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,770
Die and become one with the trash around you.

121
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,780
<i>...to as many things...</i>

122
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,280
<i>There's no time to think!</i>

123
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,030
<i>Don't give up...</i>

124
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,900
<i>I have only seconds left, if any!</i>

125
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,540
<i>I'm going to die!</i>

126
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,570
<i>It's okay.</i>

127
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,040
<i>I should've died back then...</i>

128
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,780
<i>Back then...</i>

129
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,530
Let's finish this later.

130
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,980
There is too much interference,

131
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,960
and I am rather tired today.

132
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,890
<i>We can't lose.</i>

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,290
<i>That blood...</i>

134
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,020
<i>What was that blood?</i>

135
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,290
<i>Could that have been the chink in his armor?</i>

136
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,820
<i>Should I try to pierce that gap with this?</i>

137
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,360
<i>No way.</i>

138
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,330
<i>Not with a stick like this.</i>

139
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,820
<i>Would I even manage, given Gotou's speed?</i>

140
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,620
<i>The second I try to get up, Gotou 
will attack, ripping me to shreds.</i>

141
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,100
<i>I have next to no chance at all!</i>

142
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,380
<i>But if I don't try,</i>

143
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,950
<i>I definitely won't have a chance!</i>

144
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,730
<i>It went in!</i>

145
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,490
<i>I did it!</i>

146
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,490
Damn human...

147
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,990
You'll pay for this!

148
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,250
<i>He's here!</i>

149
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,290
<i>But I'm at my limit...</i>

150
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,630
<i>I can't run from him.</i>

151
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,170
<i>But I did pretty good.</i>

152
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,480
<i>It may not amount to much damage,</i>

153
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,880
<i>but I did land a hit.</i>

154
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,990
How did you know where the 
gap in my armor was?

155
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,000
I saw blood there before!

156
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,540
That's all you had to go on?

157
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,760
But you bet everything on that...

158
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,010
Fine. I applaud your effort.

159
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,450
But I can't stand the thought that a 
lone human managed to hurt me!

160
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,640
Die!

161
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,640
<i>I guess this is really the end, then.</i>

162
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,070
Who's that? Miki?

163
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,280
Don't resist me! We can discuss this later!

164
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,870
<i>What is he doing?</i>

165
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,920
<i>If you're going to kill me, 
get it over with already.</i>

166
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,880
<i>I don't want to suffer for too long.</i>

167
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,700
<i>The strike will enter 
through my right shoulder</i>

168
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,910
<i>and exit my left side.</i>

169
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,550
<i>I'll die instantly.</i>

170
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,520
Migi?!

171
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,240
Hey.

172
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,990
M-Migi?

173
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,970
Impossible...

174
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,760
Why do you defy me?

175
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,020
What's going on?

176
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,210
Silence!

177
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,960
Shinichi...

178
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,390
Migi...

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,410
Quite an impressive power struggle.

180
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,810
I will kill you both, right now!

181
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,970
Give it up!

182
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,950
I tore up several vital organs 
on my way back here.

183
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,570
You'll have to repair them 
before you can fight.

184
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,450
Damn you...

185
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,060
What's going on?

186
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,240
A rebellion.

187
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,880
The parasitic cells that don't 
belong to the main leader

188
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,000
have instinctively sensed a threat 
to themselves and wish to flee.

189
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,360
There's a tremendous power struggle going 
on between the "head" and the "rest."

190
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,630
But why now?

191
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,910
It was you, wasn't it?

192
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,260
You drove toxins deep into his body.

193
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,460
Toxins?

194
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,050
Poison!

195
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,720
Poison!

196
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,500
Poison!

197
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,210
Poison!

198
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,210
Poison!

199
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,560
Silence!

200
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,990
You'll pay...

201
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,610
You'll pay for this!

202
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,440
How dare you?!

203
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,190
What fury.

204
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,120
The underlying source of his anger

205
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,280
does not exist within me, since
I never took control of a brain.

206
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,410
It is the drive to devour the human species.

207
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,460
That emotion was amassed and amplified

208
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,050
until a bloodthirsty, war-crazed 
machine was created.

209
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,410
<i>But even that is now...</i>

210
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,510
A single cut in the taut rope 
being pulled in the struggle

211
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,400
was enough to make his entire body explode.

212
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,500
Until toxins were lodged deep within his body,

213
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,620
he was one complete organism.

214
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,310
The dominion of his head was absolute,

215
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,120
allowing him to instantaneously put other 
parasites to sleep and control them.

216
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,130
Were you his slave, too?

217
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,130
Well, it was actually very pleasant.

218
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,220
Though asleep,

219
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,850
it was as though there was a constant flow 
of information streaming through my mind.

220
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,390
And it felt wonderful.

221
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,900
I didn't think I'd mind staying a part of 
this invincible life form, Gotou, forever.

222
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,180
Do you know how sad I was,

223
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,630
thinking you were dead?

224
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,650
I see.

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,640
This is where you picked up the 
stick you stabbed him with?

226
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,410
Yeah, but what's this toxin 
you're talking about?

227
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,590
There's burnt trash...

228
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,410
I am not entirely certain,

229
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,350
but it could've contained hydrogen cyanide

230
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,420
from the combustion of acrylic products.

231
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,410
That's toxic?

232
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,680
Lethally so.

233
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,420
I can't believe they'd just 
dump something like that here.

234
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,390
But that's why you won, right?

235
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,540
In other words,

236
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,940
no one can win against humans.

237
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,920
Shinichi!

238
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,290
Go back to where we were!

239
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,430
This is unexpected...

240
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,450
Gotou is trying to revive himself.

241
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,450
What?!

242
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,210
Look!

243
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,710
The earlier explosion 
expelled the toxin from his body.

244
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,960
The head's desperately trying to 
call the others back together.

245
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,050
But since they were scattered in such 
small fragments, the response is slow.

246
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,970
The possibility of regeneration is 50-50.

247
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,110
And if he succeeds?

248
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,720
Nothing will change.

249
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,160
He might be somewhat less powerful,

250
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,730
but as long as he stays alive, he'll want to kill.

251
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,740
Then we have to kill him.

252
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,700
Yeah...

253
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,280
Migi?

254
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,780
I changed my mind.

255
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,140
From my perspective, he's one of my own kind,

256
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,080
even one I temporarily 
shared the same host with.

257
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,940
If I were to kill him,

258
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,340
from a human perspective, 
it'd amount to murder.

259
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,900
I'll let you handle it.

260
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,100
You can finish him, if you use that 
cleaver to destroy his exposed organs.

261
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,850
Y-You want me to do it?

262
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,540
Do what you want.

263
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,600
If you don't, we can just run far 
away while we have the chance.

264
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,190
But that would mean more people will die.

265
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,110
You're right.

266
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,110
Then what's there to think about?

267
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,870
It's kind of pitiful.

268
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,250
We are fragile.

269
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,600
We are merely a life form that 
cannot survive on its own.

270
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,880
So don't bully us.

271
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,910
<i>But what can I do?</i>

272
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,010
<i>Why were they born?</i>

273
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,150
<i>To kill humans now that 
there are too many of us?</i>

274
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,150
<i>To decrease our numbers after 
we've polluted the Earth?</i>

275
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,530
<i>I know the toxins we produce are driving 
other species close to extinction.</i>

276
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,660
<i>This is proof of that.</i>

277
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,420
<i>Gotou was so powerful,</i>

278
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,910
<i>yet look how easily toxins on 
a stick brought him down...</i>

279
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,610
<i>We are two halves of the same whole.</i>

280
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,950
<i>We and humans are one family.</i>

281
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,010
<i>So from the ecosystem's perspective,</i>

282
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,550
<i>we're the poison, and they're the cure?</i>

283
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,420
<i>Who decides that?</i>

284
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,970
<i>Who decides the relative value 
of human and non-human lives?</i>

285
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,840
Hurry up and decide.

286
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,810
We can't hang around forever.

287
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,560
<i>I don't want to kill him.</i>

288
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,690
<i>To end a life that's trying so hard to survive...</i>

289
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,880
<i>That's right, I don't want to kill!</i>

290
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
<i>Isn't that unwillingness to kill</i>

291
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
<i>the last remaining treasure left in humanity?</i>

292
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,820
What's the matter?

293
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,330
I changed my mind.

294
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,320
You might think that strange,

295
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,590
given all we went through to fight him,

296
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,900
but if his chances of survival are 50-50,

297
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,210
the powers that be should decide, not me.

298
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,780
He's not human.

299
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,350
I don't want to impose human values on him.

300
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,550
I see.

301
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,950
If that's your decision, that's fine by me.

302
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,110
Let's go, then.

303
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,730
<i>I might be about to commit an 
irredeemable sin as a human being,</i>

304
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,850
<i>but can I say that an organism has no 
right to live just because it's harmful?</i>

305
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,580
<i>Even if it is not beneficial to humans,</i>

306
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,340
<i>to Earth, it may actually be...</i>

307
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,220
Shinichi, do you believe Earth is beautiful?

308
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,520
I don't know.

309
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,490
I despise humans who brazenly say

310
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,470
they're doing something "for Earth."

311
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,430
After all, Earth has no emotion.

312
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,350
The first life on Earth was apparently born

313
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,110
in a boiling hot pool of hydrogen sulfide.

314
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,270
<i>Let the powers that be decide,</i>

315
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,050
<i>huh...</i>

316
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,790
<i>I'm just one human being.</i>

317
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,540
<i>I can only hope to protect 
my own small family.</i>

318
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,590
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,600
You aren't at fault.

320
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,530
But... Sorry.

321
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,570
What is it?

322
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,930
What happened?

323
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,070
The monster!

324
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,860
They found the monster's corpse!

325
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,260
What?!

326
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,360
Its corpse?!

327
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,280
<i>Did you do it, Shinichi?</i>

328
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,640
Let's go home.

329
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,520
Next time:

330
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,030
Parasyte

331
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,960
"Parasyte."
