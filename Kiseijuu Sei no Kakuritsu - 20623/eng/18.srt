1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,240
<i>It's the way you look...</i>

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,360
<i>I can't stand the way you look.</i>

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>You look so...</i>

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
Calm down, Shinichi.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,480
We're in trouble if you're short 
of breath when we have to fight.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,620
<i>I know.</i>

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,310
I would have liked to have discussed 
many things with you both,

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,340
but I have a bad feeling about this,

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,130
so I won't drag this out.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,470
I've killed 38 so far.

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,750
Mainly as food,

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,520
but I believe my numbers are 
on the low end among my kind.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,110
I could supplement the lack 
with normal food humans eat.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,820
In other words,

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,530
parasites <i>can</i> survive without eating humans.

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,280
I have also done much research on humans.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,060
What are we parasites to humans,

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,950
and what are humans to us?

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,540
My conclusion is this:

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,810
we are two halves of the same whole.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,150
We and humans are one family.

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,520
We are the children of the human race.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,720
What?!

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,710
What are you talking about?!

25
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,020
Cut the crap!

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,290
That's fine.

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,760
I expect this to be difficult for you to 
comprehend, given human emotions.

28
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,560
However,

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,070
we are fragile.

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,530
We are merely a life form that 
cannot survive on its own.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,530
So don't bully us.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,470
"Bully"?!

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,700
Look who's talking!

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,290
Hmm...

35
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,990
You two are very rare beings.

36
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,450
That is why I wanted you to know my thoughts.

37
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,430
While I'm at it, a word of advice.

38
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,640
About Gotou, the man who 
recently pursued you...

39
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,140
Don't fight him.

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,520
If it had been Gotou instead 
of Miki from the beginning,

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,760
you would be dead by now.

42
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,300
Probably.

43
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,280
He is indeed one of our "fragile" kind 
that I created through experimentation,

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
but he is invincible.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,780
You're contradicting yourself.

46
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,070
<i>She's laughing!</i>

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,300
And regarding the other one, 
the mayor, Hirokawa...

48
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,930
<i>Izumi Shinichi?</i>

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,660
<i>I think that's the detective, Hirama.</i>

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>Wait, so are they all cops?!</i>

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,190
<i>At a glance, they look like a 
nondescript mother holding a baby,</i>

52
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,840
<i>and a boy who had found a parasite's victim,</i>

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,190
<i>but had been ruled out as a suspect.</i>

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,160
<i>Even if we'd seen them separately here 
immediately following a murder,</i>

55
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,950
<i>I would not have felt this much conviction.</i>

56
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,720
<i>Izumi Shinichi...</i>

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,960
<i>There's something more to him.</i>

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,850
<i>And this is her...</i>

59
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,960
<i>The parasite, Tamura Reiko!</i>

60
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,660
Parasyte

61
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,660
The Maxim

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,020
More than Human

63
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,760
<i>The baby's clothes have
some of my blood on them...</i>

64
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,420
Wait!

65
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,160
Don't come any closer!

66
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,160
Tamura-san...

67
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,020
You are Tamura Reiko-san, correct?

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,910
No.

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,460
You killed the man named Kuramori just now!

70
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,670
I don't know what you're talking about.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,420
I'll ask someone else.

72
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,750
Ikeda-kun!

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,440
Why are you here?

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,220
We've met before.

75
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,500
You remember me, don't you?

76
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,740
If you are the same person I met back then,

77
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,890
you should be able to say my name.

78
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,520
Who am I, Ikeda-kun?

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,900
Did you forget <i>my</i> name, Hirama-san?

80
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,540
It seems that one's human.

81
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,160
So, you seem very calm, Tamura-san.

82
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,670
I think you're mistaking me for someone else.

83
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,750
At this distance,

84
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,690
even this should be able to find its mark.

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,260
This isn't funny!

86
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,180
You people are all crazy!

87
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,390
I would be deeply sorry if I were wrong,

88
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,510
but I'm afraid I have no choice.

89
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,850
I can't risk getting any closer.

90
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,810
Everyone keep your eyes peeled 
when I fire this shot!

91
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,350
I'll take full responsibility!

92
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,750
Please stop!

93
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,110
What are you doing?!

94
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,740
H-Hirama-san.

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,580
Well done...

96
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,820
You were correct.

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,350
Fire! Fire!

98
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,220
Stop!

99
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,720
The baby is human!

100
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
Izumi Shinichi, stay back!

101
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,160
Shinichi!

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,650
Get back!

103
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,980
But...

104
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,580
<i>No way...</i>

105
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,590
<i>No way.</i>

106
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,910
<i>It can't be.</i>

107
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,620
<i>You're not involved, right, Izumi-kun?</i>

108
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,210
<i>There's no way Izumi-kun is there!</i>

109
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,070
<i>No way!</i>

110
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,800
<i>I've had enough!</i>

111
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,450
<i>I'm done!</i>

112
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,280
<i>What's the matter?</i>

113
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,610
<i>Why won't she retaliate?</i>

114
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,340
She's coming toward us!

115
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,130
She must have something in mind!

116
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,000
Get back, Shinichi!

117
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,210
Run away!

118
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,000
<i>Shinichi...</i>

119
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,550
<i>Wait, Shinichi.</i>

120
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,810
<i>I can't have you run away right now.</i>

121
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,260
<i>How can I...</i>

122
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,370
<i>How can I speak to your humanity?</i>

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,620
<i>Shinichi...</i>

124
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,650
Mom...

125
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,630
Don't be duped, Shinichi!

126
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,440
It's a trap!

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,290
Remember!

128
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,590
Remember the hole in your heart!

129
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,410
<i>No...</i>

130
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,650
Stop!

131
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,290
Stop fire!

132
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,320
Stop!

133
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
You'll hit the boy!

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,960
Something's not right.

135
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,260
I've been thinking... for a long while.

136
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,830
For what purpose was I born into this world?

137
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,190
Whenever I resolved one question,

138
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,770
another would arise in its place.

139
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,770
I sought the beginning.

140
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,310
I sought the end.

141
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,240
I've just been walking and walking, 
thinking all the while.

142
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,850
Perhaps nothing will change, 
no matter how far I go.

143
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,510
If I'm to stop my journey, that is fine, too.

144
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,070
Even if I were informed that 
everything has reached its end,

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,210
I'd just accept it.

146
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,120
But even so,

147
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,540
I found an answer to yet 
another of my questions today.

148
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,010
Shinichi... This child.

149
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,470
In the end, I didn't do anything to it.

150
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,050
The child is a normal human being.

151
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,850
Raise the child by human hands,

152
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,540
to lead a normal life...

153
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,730
Okay.

154
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,910
Don't worry.

155
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,420
Thank you.

156
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,590
<i>"Thank you"?</i>

157
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,850
I recently imitated a human,

158
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,550
laughing out loud in front of a mirror...

159
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,690
It felt... rather pleasant...

160
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,320
<i>She's dead?</i>

161
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,660
<i>She's dead...</i>

162
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,040
<i>Impossible.</i>

163
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,150
<i>Why?</i>

164
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,770
<i>You could've fought if you wanted to.</i>

165
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,700
<i>Fled, even.</i>

166
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,680
Are you sad?

167
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,170
Of course... Your mom is dead.

168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,820
<i>Dead...</i>

169
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,980
<i>Mom is dead...</i>

170
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,500
<i>Mom...</i>

171
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,410
Shinichi...

172
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,900
Are you all right, Shinichi?!

173
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,460
Did any oil get on you?!

174
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,450
Meet the one who opened that hole again.

175
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,330
Meet the person.

176
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,210
It's dead.

177
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,500
Its heart stopped.

178
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,590
A dream so embarrassing,

179
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,620
I could never tell... anyone...

180
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,740
They're dead.

181
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,050
They're all dead.

182
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,640
Life...

183
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,090
Life...

184
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,210
will return to this tree...

185
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,190
Shinichi-kun!

186
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,210
Y-You'll... come back, right?

187
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,840
You'll come back, right?

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,600
We're home.

189
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,510
Welcome back.

190
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,980
What's wrong, Shinichi?

191
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,450
I just had

192
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,360
a really sad dream...

193
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,320
Izumi-kun...

194
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,650
Shinichi-kun...

195
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,110
Are you back?

196
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,220
My tears are...

197
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,310
Satomi.

198
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,550
How's Izumi-kun?

199
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,300
I think he should be able to 
come back to school soon.

200
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,250
I see.

201
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,950
What happened?

202
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,170
He's been absent since the 
day he just up and went home.

203
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,690
Yeah...

204
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,620
I'm sure there's a lot going on.

205
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,170
Let's go.

206
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,680
<i>What happened in that park 
didn't even make the news.</i>

207
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,180
<i>But...</i>

208
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,940
<i>Izumi-kun came back.</i>

209
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,480
<i>He came back!</i>

210
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,240
Okay, you can have lunch in this room.

211
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,240
Waiting Room

212
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,730
How was it?

213
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,240
Yeah...

214
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,610
I'm tired.

215
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,750
I think he's a tad too composed 
for someone his age.

216
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,330
You're right that he's unusually 
poised in some ways,

217
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,250
but there are kids like him.

218
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,370
But I don't think he has that ability 
the detectives are hoping for.

219
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,530
Not in the same league as that man's, at least.

220
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,250
Ugh... So it's only him, after all?

221
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,060
Unfortunately.

222
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,170
Dogs, cats...

223
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,160
Monkeys, bears, birds...

224
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,140
I don't think there's any point in seeing them.

225
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,840
I never said I could talk with animals.

226
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,040
Just shut up and walk.

227
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,250
So?

228
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,290
Who am I seeing today?

229
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,540
Humans.

230
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,040
Humans...

231
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,640
Oh, that's great!

232
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,300
It means the true test is coming up soon.

233
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,830
I see.

234
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,810
So you're finally going to believe what I say.

235
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,240
Detective, I'm actually innocent.

236
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,640
Please believe me!

237
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,490
No?

238
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,570
That wasn't funny?

239
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,940
Shut your trap!

240
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,780
Get his cuffs.

241
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,760
Yes?

242
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,130
Izumi Shinichi-kun, please come with me again.

243
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,280
Okay...

244
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,510
<i>No matter what they ask me,</i>

245
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,660
<i>I will keep Migi's existence hidden.</i>

246
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,650
<i>I should calm myself down, one more time...</i>

247
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,110
This is the last thing we'll ask of you.

248
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,390
Oh, okay.

249
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,190
Listen, Uragami.

250
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,410
I'm going to have you prove 
your ability once and for all.

251
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,930
Okay, wait in this room.

252
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,750
When they call your name, 
please follow instructions.

253
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,450
Okay...

254
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm going to have you meet five people.

255
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,430
First, find the one of your "kind" among them.

256
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,690
Someone with the same ability as you.

257
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,450
You said you'd know if you met one, right?

258
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,690
Yeah, that's right! I can tell!

259
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,270
I think, anyway.

260
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,150
Second, let us know if one 
of <i>their</i> kind is among them.

261
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,430
Hey, hey...

262
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,590
You're saying one of those 
monsters is a suspect here?

263
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,990
Don't tell me they're just gonna 
troop in here all meek-like!

264
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,490
Hey!

265
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,590
Is this glass gonna keep me safe?!

266
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,660
I'd rather be hung than be 
eaten by those monsters!

267
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,920
It's fine!

268
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,130
Don't worry.

269
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,180
It's thick, bullet-proof glass.

270
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,790
And soundproof to boot.

271
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,690
Let's begin.

272
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,800
Fukami-san,

273
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,400
please enter.

274
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,580
Okay.

275
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,580
Hey, Uragami.

276
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,100
Look at him!

277
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,310
Fine, fine.

278
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,570
What do you think, Fukami-san?

279
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,950
Well... He is not a parasite.

280
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,550
He is responding slightly to my telepathy.

281
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,610
He's walled his mind off,

282
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,810
but I doubt he has the same ability as me.

283
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,100
He's talking up a good game.

284
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,470
I should explain beforehand

285
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,560
that these self-proclaimed 
"psychics" in the room

286
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,990
are probably all frauds.

287
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,360
Even if anyone had this superpoâ€” rather,

288
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,980
this highly honed ability at all, 
it'd probably just be him.

289
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,230
Well, Uragami?

290
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,460
A total fraud.

291
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,110
Tell this dweeb I said,

292
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,720
"Show me a liar, and I will show you a thief."

293
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,410
Look who's talking!

294
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,790
And he's a serial killer.

295
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,370
Next one, please.

296
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,760
What's wrong, Uragami?!

297
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,690
You're cruel, Detective.

298
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,760
You know the kind of life we lead in prison...

299
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,650
How could you put such a hottie in front of me?

300
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,840
Is he actually...

301
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,520
We should probably stop him.

302
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,600
His focus may drop.

303
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,230
Th-There's no mistake!

304
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,400
This man's a parasite!

305
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,270
H-Hey, wait, pretty lady...

306
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,080
What a joke.

307
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,400
Izumi-kun, thank you for waiting.

308
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,670
Please go in.

309
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,430
Okay.

310
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,080
You can't hear each other, 
so there's no need to hold back.

311
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,840
What do you think of that man?

312
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,840
What I think?

313
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,060
I'm not sure...

314
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,120
You seem to run into parasites 
often for some reason.

315
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,810
This time, the parasite named 
Tamura Reiko approached you.

316
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,000
Perhaps you have something 
that attracts them...

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,740
Or perhaps you have an 
ability to tell them apart?

318
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,480
<i>Calm down...</i>

319
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,320
<i>If I calm down, it will be fine.</i>

320
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,820
No.

321
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,540
<i>To me, it seems highly likely 
that you are the partner</i>

322
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,830
<i>Kuramori spoke of with his dying breath.</i>

323
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,510
<i>But mentioning Kuramori to you has no effect.</i>

324
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,140
<i>I find it difficult to believe</i>

325
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,750
<i>that a normal high school student can 
keep lying with a straight face, but...</i>

326
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,010
Inspector, the bastard's asleep!

327
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,840
What?

328
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,270
Hey, Uragami!

329
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,100
Wake up!

330
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,080
I guess I used up my energy...

331
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,600
Huh?

332
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,650
Oh, we're still doing this?

333
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,850
You have a cute face, baby boy.

334
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,570
If you dressed up as a woman, 
you might make good spank material.

335
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,520
Hey, Detective...

336
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,580
Tell him to look me right in the eye.

337
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,450
Izumi-kun.

338
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,290
Yes?

339
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,110
In Cold Blood

340
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,350
Next time:

341
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
"In Cold Blood."
