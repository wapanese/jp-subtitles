1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,620
I'm sorry to sour the mood, Shinichi, but...

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,800
No way.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,490
You must be kidding.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,610
We need to start running right now.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,740
Are you sure it's him?

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,060
These wavelengths are too 
powerful to come from some lackey.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,810
And given the speed of his 
approach, I'd say he's in a car.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,290
Take a right at that corner.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,720
Shit!

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,430
Now I'm a thief.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,170
Is this the time to whine about it?

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,250
When'd you learn to drive, anyway?

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,800
I mastered Japanese in 
a single day, you know.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,460
Migi, I have a favor to ask.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,230
Please go somewhere with 
as few people as possible.

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,940
If we fight him in a city, 
many people will die.

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,940
Very well.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,810
I've thought of something 
that's worth a gamble.

19
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,660
Parasyte

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,660
The Maxim

21
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,540
Quiescence and Awakening

22
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,690
Well?

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,550
It didn't work.

24
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,990
He's alive.

25
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,550
He's tough.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's go.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,820
Go where?

28
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,870
Let's run.

29
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,130
All right, stop.

30
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,090
Why are we stopping?

31
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,380
We can't afford to waste time here!

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,470
Calm down.

33
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,970
Let's strategize until he shows up.

34
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,850
Strategize?!

35
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,210
We might be minutes away 
from being chopped up!

36
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,240
Shinichi.

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,690
I understand how you feel.

38
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,480
Anyone would fear death.

39
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm afraid, as well.

40
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,510
However, this is our moment of truth!

41
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,250
You have a strength normal 
humans don't have.

42
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,230
You can be calm, no matter 
what the circumstance.

43
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,890
Now, put your hand on your chest

44
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,020
and breathe deeply like you always do.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,840
Good, well done.

46
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,440
Listen.

47
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,500
When it comes to ability, 
Gotou surpasses us in every way.

48
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,850
By simple calculations, our odds of 
victory might be zero percent.

49
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,220
But that just means we should approach 
this from a different angle.

50
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,180
If we can't win even by working together,

51
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,360
maybe we should try <i>not</i> working together.

52
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,240
What?

53
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,120
In war, what matters is 
opportunity, not numbers.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,270
Opportunity?

55
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,160
In your pocket is a lighter I found in the car.

56
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,010
They're above...

57
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,010
They've spread out among 
the tree branches to hide.

58
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,890
How unoriginal.

59
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,680
<i>This will be a race against time.</i>

60
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>To a parasite, the body is our lifeline 
as well as our greatest weakness.</i>

61
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,390
<i>My cells that have dispersed in your body</i>

62
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,210
<i>have been completely integrated, 
and are altered,</i>

63
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,910
<i>so Gotou can't detect them.</i>

64
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,720
<i>He will come straight for me</i>

65
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,660
<i>without noticing your presence.</i>

66
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,500
<i>If there is a protracted fight, 
I will shrivel up and die.</i>

67
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,670
<i>This is an extremely reckless strategy.</i>

68
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,670
<i>But that means even Gotou is 
unlikely to anticipate our strategy.</i>

69
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,160
<i>What, no counterattack?</i>

70
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,690
<i>Where is the human boy?</i>

71
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,950
<i>If only I can find and destroy the body, I'll win.</i>

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,580
<i>His body</i>

73
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,580
<i>is protected by semi-hardened parasite cells.</i>

74
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,590
<i>It's unlikely that his entire body is armored,</i>

75
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,280
<i>but there's no time to find where 
the chinks are in his armor.</i>

76
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,950
<i>The part least likely to be armored</i>

77
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,470
<i>and thus most suitable as a target...</i>

78
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,120
<i>is his head.</i>

79
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,930
<i>Unifying the multiple parasites 
in his torso and limbs must</i>

80
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,950
<i>require a tremendous amount of energy.</i>

81
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,960
<i>Thus, the "head" has its hands 
full acting as the control tower.</i>

82
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,630
<i>If we lop the head off,</i>

83
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,930
<i>unity will be lost along with his armor,</i>

84
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,120
<i>which should allow us to destroy his body.</i>

85
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,280
<i>Any time now, Migi!</i>

86
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,120
<i>If you don't hurry, you'll...</i>

87
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,330
<i>I will only have one chance!</i>

88
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,880
<i>If I am to decapitate Gotou when his 
power and speed far surpasses my own...</i>

89
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,510
<i>What is this?</i>

90
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,730
<i>My consciousness is already fading...</i>

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,740
<i>I must hurry!</i>

92
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,890
<i>But the angle of attack is still poor.</i>

93
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,090
Hey! Listen up!

94
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,120
Are you that scared of me?!

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,190
Spreading out in all directions 
isn't much of a camouflage!

96
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,690
Use your brains to fight, not run!

97
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,110
Now! Do it!

98
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,490
<i>Was that my voice?</i>

99
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,240
There!

100
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,290
<i>The surface cells will instinctively disengage</i>

101
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,580
<i>from Gotou's command upon exposure to fire,</i>

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
<i>and as a result...</i>

103
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,670
<i>Damn!</i>

104
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,380
<i>Not deep enough!</i>

105
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,550
Did we fail?

106
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,840
Migi!

107
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Stay back, Shinichi!

108
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,770
We failed!

109
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,430
Well, this is a surprise.

110
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,310
Well done.

111
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Run! Now!

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,330
But...

113
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,360
Don't come any closer!

114
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,980
We don't both need to die!

115
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,110
But, Migi...

116
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,830
What are you doing?!

117
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,620
Hurry up and go!

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,380
<i>Goodbye, Shinichi.</i>

119
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,480
<i>This is farewell, Shinichi.</i>

120
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,880
<i>I'm glad I didn't take over 
your brain when we first met.</i>

121
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,240
<i>Thanks to that, we made many 
good memories as friends...</i>

122
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,480
<i>I'm fading...</i>

123
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,320
<i>I feel oddly sleepy,</i>

124
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,850
<i>yet it's all eclipsed by the 
feeling that I'm so alone.</i>

125
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,440
<i>So this...</i>

126
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,370
<i>is death...</i>

127
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,910
Who's there?!

128
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,910
Oh, sorry.

129
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,350
A... A burglar?!

130
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,410
No!

131
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,660
I'm not... But...

132
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,820
Sure. You can call me that.

133
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,700
Huh?

134
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,710
I did try to drink some water 
without permission, after all.

135
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,550
I see.

136
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,970
Water isn't free, either.

137
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,190
S-Sorry...

138
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,390
Well, uh...

139
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,190
I should go.

140
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,750
I'm sorry for the trouble.

141
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,990
Hang on a second.

142
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,870
Yes?

143
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,390
You're hurt.

144
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,310
Oh...

145
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,540
Well, no, uh...

146
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,070
No, your head.

147
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,030
You lost your right arm a long 
time ago, from the looks of it.

148
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm fine.

149
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,770
I think the bleeding's already stopped.

150
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,400
Just come in and let me take a look.

151
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,410
But...

152
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,740
Hurry up!

153
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,690
A burglar wouldn't be this polite.

154
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,290
Besides, you look like you've been crying.

155
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,550
I worked in retail for a long time.

156
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,890
I can tell a lot about a person from just one look.

157
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:09,260
This injury wasn't from a fair fight, 
was it? You were bullied.

158
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,390
Uh...

159
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,150
The cut's pretty deep.

160
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,140
Some people in this world do terrible things.

161
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,220
I didn't expect so much kindness 
from a complete stranger.

162
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,920
Thank you for everything.

163
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,760
Stay the night.

164
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,480
What?

165
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,340
I couldn't possibly...

166
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,730
Where do you expect to go this late at night?

167
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,050
There are no hotels around here!

168
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,320
Um, do you live here by yourself, Granny?

169
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,890
I don't have any grandchildren your age.

170
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,910
Erm, Auntie?

171
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,400
I don't have any nephews, either.

172
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,400
My name is Mitsuyo.

173
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,910
I'm Izumi Shinichi.

175
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,240
Shinichi, eh?

176
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,220
Shin-chan, then.

177
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,750
Sorry for making you help with the shopping.

178
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,200
Oh, no problem.

179
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,100
I can at least do that much.

180
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,090
Let's just say you're my nephew.

181
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,840
Nephew?

182
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,390
Strange things have been 
happening around here lately.

183
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,480
They're suspicious of outsiders.

184
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,170
Strange things?

185
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,120
This is what I was talking about.

186
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,540
Someone keeps dumping truckloads 
of garbage without permission.

187
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,490
One time, it caught fire and nearly 
set the entire mountain ablaze.

188
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,740
I know they say big cities 
are running out of landfills,

189
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,110
but this is a bit much, don't you think?

190
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,930
Yes...

191
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,270
Those of us who live around here

192
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,840
have been keeping watch day and night,

193
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,500
but they're no-shows when we do keep watch

194
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,490
and come the one day we sleep.

195
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,380
<i>Mitsuyo-san had a sharp tongue,</i>

196
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,860
<i>but she was kindhearted.</i>

197
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,980
<i>Whenever I tried to thank her and leave,</i>

198
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,730
<i>she'd stop me with a machine gun 
barrage of conversation.</i>

199
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,860
<i>With Migi gone,</i>

200
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,550
<i>I had no idea what to do next.</i>

201
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,060
<i>I ended up staying several days.</i>

202
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,830
<i>But I can't impose on her forever.</i>

203
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,870
<i>I should go home tomorrow 
and tell Dad everything.</i>

204
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,300
<i>About why I lost my right arm...</i>

205
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,390
<i>About how I had a friend named Migi...</i>

206
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,540
<i>About the day Migi first showed up in my life.</i>

207
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,390
<i>About the days we spent together.</i>

208
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,730
<i>And about how great a guy he was.</i>

209
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,770
<i>To save my life, he...</i>

210
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,140
<i>His intelligence, his courage...</i>

211
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,430
<i>I can't even hope to come 
close to him in any way.</i>

212
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,650
<i>He is a true hero!</i>

213
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,870
<i>Where am I?</i>

214
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,310
<i>I think I've been here before.</i>

215
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,220
<i>What's that?</i>

216
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,700
<i>Uh, who're you?</i>

217
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,630
<i>What is it?</i>

218
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,210
<i>Are you looking for something?</i>

219
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,080
<i>Looking?</i>

220
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,420
<i>Yeah, I'm looking for a friend.</i>

221
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,750
<i>A friend?</i>

222
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,270
<i>What does this friend look like?</i>

223
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,090
<i>Look like?</i>

224
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,120
<i>I don't really remember.</i>

225
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,430
<i>Then I can't help you.</i>

226
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,580
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

227
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,220
<i>I think he looked like you...</i>

228
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,810
<i>Right! I remember now!</i>

229
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,950
<i>He...</i>

230
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,860
<i>He died.</i>

231
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,830
<i>What? He's dead?</i>

232
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,690
<i>Yeah...</i>

233
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,430
<i>No, he's alive.</i>

234
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,070
<i>What?!</i>

235
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,970
<i>I can tell.</i>

236
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,600
<i>I actually know his name, too.</i>

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,550
<i>His... name?</i>

238
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,300
<i>His name...</i>

239
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,260
Migi?!

240
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,260
Huh?!

241
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,460
M...

242
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,640
Migi!

243
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,760
<i>Some of his cells are still here!</i>

244
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,370
Hey! It's me!

245
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,500
Do you recognize me?!

246
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,850
Keep it down.

247
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,620
Go back to sleep.

248
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,250
<i>It won't work.</i>

249
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,750
<i>Even if he can make a small eye,</i>

250
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,210
<i>it's not enough to be capable 
of thought or speech.</i>

251
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,930
<i>Migi...</i>

252
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,240
<i>Migi!</i>

253
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,450
I see.

254
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,420
I guess I don't have a choice.

255
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,750
I can't keep you here forever.

256
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,480
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

257
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,580
What's the matter?

258
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,490
Why're you here so early in the morning?

259
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,000
Hey, you!

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,280
Are you really Mitsuyo-san's nephew?

261
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,160
What does it matter?

262
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,540
He's about to leave.

263
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,050
Not so fast.

264
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,790
There are way too many strange 
things happening lately.

265
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,700
The illegal trash dumping,

266
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,050
the car crash between two 
driver-less vehicles,

267
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,300
and now, murder.

268
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,880
What?!

269
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,240
Isn't it always outsiders who commit crimes?

270
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,850
Outsiders like him?

271
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,500
I told you, that thing was 
beyond being an outsider.

272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,740
He's been with me the entire timeâ€”

273
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,190
It wasn't human!

274
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,400
I wasn't just seeing things!

275
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,240
It was at least three meters tall!

276
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,450
And its legs!

277
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah, it had four front legs alone!

278
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,490
It had more than three eyes, too!

279
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,790
<i>It's Gotou...</i>

280
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,200
<i>It has to be!</i>

281
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,230
Yeah, laugh at me all you want.

282
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,750
But see this blood? It's all Kitayama's!

283
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,850
Kitayama was killed and eaten 
by a monster right close by!

284
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,290
So it happened around here?

285
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,430
Th-That's right.

286
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,640
This is horrible.

287
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,650
Wait, something similar's happened before...

288
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,080
The Mincemeat Murders?

289
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,100
I see.

290
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,040
Okay, got it.

291
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,760
A bunch of hunters are going 
to get together tomorrow,

292
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,050
so they should be able to take 
down this "monster" then.

293
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,120
Hunting rifles won't be 
enough to take him down.

294
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,900
Huh?

295
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,050
"Him"?

296
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,310
You know the monster?

297
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,090
He's here because he's after me.

298
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,010
To kill me.

299
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,390
Huh?

300
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,940
Stop talking nonsense.

301
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,240
This is my fault!

302
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,730
I brought him here!

303
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,360
And someone was killed!

304
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,180
Many more will die tomorrow 
if I don't do something!

305
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,410
Shin-chan...

306
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,870
I just wanted to keep myself alive.

307
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,850
Whatever it took.

308
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,150
Friends have died for me, too.

309
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,200
But I can't just keep running away on my own.

310
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,430
Why not?

311
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,900
Why not live?

312
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,810
Why not run?

313
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,980
Run if it's only to save your own life.

314
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,680
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

315
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,150
Mitsuyo-san, I haven't done 
everything I can just yet!

316
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,790
I have to make use of my life 
before a group of people

317
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,280
come face-to-face with 
that monster tomorrow!

318
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,220
You idiot!

319
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,450
Cut the bullshit!

320
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,990
Make use of your life?

321
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,960
How dare you speak so 
lightly of your own life?!

322
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,140
Who do you think you are?!

323
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,880
Use your life?

324
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
Don't make me laugh!

325
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,470
What does a snot-nosed brat 
like you expect to do?!

326
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,650
Look, I don't know your story,

327
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,420
but you should just let adults 
handle this sort of thing.

328
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,610
You're still leaving?

329
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,700
Don't you have someone 
in your life you care about?

330
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,980
Even if it's a stranger,

331
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,080
once I come to know them,

332
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,660
I can't just abandon them.

333
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,200
That's what it means to be human.

334
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,730
But you...

335
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,520
I don't know how much time you have left,

336
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,890
but give some thought to as many things, 
as many ideas, as you can come up with.

337
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,470
If you throw everything away, that's the end.

338
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,100
Don't give up, no matter what,

339
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,780
and be flexible.

340
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,360
Wait.

341
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,810
Isn't there something useful 
you can take with you?

342
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,090
Like a weapon?

343
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,840
This, then.

344
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,420
What, that? It's all rusty.

345
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,600
But I guess it's better than nothing.

346
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,880
<i>Dear...</i>

347
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,320
<i>Please keep him safe.</i>

348
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,510
<i>If Gotou's adopted a totally 
different human appearance,</i>

349
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,480
<i>there'll be no way for me to recognize him.</i>

350
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,530
<i>But I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!</i>

351
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,030
Life and Oath

352
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,670
Next time:

353
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,810
"Life and Oath."
