1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,740
Yayoi Squad has made contact with Hirokawa.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,510
Do not let him get away.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,990
Eliminate him.

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,690
Parasyte

6
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,690
The Maxim

7
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,800
Sex and Spirit

8
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,880
Well, don't just stand around. Take a seat.

9
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,180
You could say your victory 
in this incident is assured.

10
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,850
When it comes to killing,

11
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,140
nothing on Earth can match the human race.

12
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,660
However, the tools you currently hold 
should be put to different use,

13
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,360
for a purpose far greater.

14
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,370
They should be used to protect 
the balance of the biosphere.

15
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,760
That should be your intended mission:

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,180
in a word, culling.

17
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,130
All of humanity will realize soon enough

18
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,380
that human numbers must 
be reduced immediately.

19
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,530
That the crime of pollution

20
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,270
is far greater than the 
crime of manslaughter.

21
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,520
And that our existence is 
of such great importance

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,020
that you will even come to protect us.

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,780
You should place greater 
value on your predators.

24
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,190
And these particular predators

25
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,540
fit perfectly into the 
beautiful hierarchy of nature!

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,040
They fit right above humans!

27
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,790
This will restore the balance at last.

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,880
<i>Hirokawa...</i>

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,430
Someone on Earth had a sudden thought.

30
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,010
"Life must be protected."

31
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,900
Just who do you think you are?

32
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,640
You monster!

33
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,440
Hmph.

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,270
This is why I can never like humans.

35
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,360
If defiance is your final answer, 
don't pretend otherwise at the start.

36
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,400
Environmental conservation measures

37
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,170
are all skewed in favor of 
benefiting the human race!

38
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,530
Why do you refuse to acknowledge that?

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,340
Prioritize the prosperity of all 
life over that of the human race!

40
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,670
<i>That</i> is what would make 
you the superior species!

41
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,790
You fools claim justice is on your side!

42
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,570
But what greater justice is there than this?

43
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,230
We inhabit humans

44
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,590
and take on the role of maintaining 
the balance of all life.

45
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,180
In comparison, humans are the true 
parasitic vermin infesting this planet!

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Or should I say...

47
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,660
Parasitic beasts?

48
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,090
Parasitic... beasts...

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,810
Fire!

50
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,080
What's the matter?

51
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,280
This is a human.

52
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,070
What?

53
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,880
Hirokawa...

54
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
An inscrutable man until the very end.

55
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,980
Tamura Reiko was greatly 
intrigued by this human

56
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,080
and made many plans on his account,

57
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,330
but they are all finished now.

58
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,280
He must have appeared unusual 
in your eyes, as well...

59
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,810
For a human.

60
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,300
Unbelievable.

61
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,580
What could've...

62
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,830
What could've happened here?

63
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,490
Like I said,

64
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,290
it's that guy we just saw.

65
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,400
He has incredible power.

66
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,840
Even firearms are useless against him.

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,100
What is it?

68
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,110
Hirokawa has been neutralized,

69
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,450
but a new parasite seems to have appeared.

70
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,620
We will rendezvous with the Minazuki Squad

71
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,850
and head for the council wing.

72
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,290
U-Uragami...

73
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,610
You bastard...

74
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,280
Man, my arm's all numb.

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,700
I prefer knives.

76
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,340
Oh, wow, it blew his hand right off.

77
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,740
Of course this is how things 
would end, Detective.

78
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,950
Either way,

79
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,970
I was on death row, wasn't I?

80
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,070
<i>I'm gonna get out of here!</i>

81
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,350
<i>If that monster is as good as I think he is,</i>

82
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,850
<i>he's sure to break the cordon.</i>

83
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,460
Come to think of it, Tamura Reiko often asked

84
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,310
for what purpose we have come into existence.

85
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,530
It's of no concern to me now,

86
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,870
but I have realized one thing:

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,720
I live only to fight.

88
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,630
Shinichi, let's go home.

89
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,590
There's no point in staying here any longer.

90
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,680
We have fulfilled our purpose.

91
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,930
You don't know that for sure.

92
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,950
We still have to figure out 
whether Gotou can be defeated.

93
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,370
It doesn't matter.

94
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,190
The humans have won.

95
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,890
If they want to, they can use 
cannons, missiles, napalm balms,

96
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,070
you name it.

97
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,700
What we might want to do as individuals 
no longer has any significance at this stage.

98
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,870
You're acting weird, Migi.

99
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,570
Fire!

100
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,580
How's he moving like that?

101
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,430
Fight smarter.

102
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,050
Humans are supposed to be the most 
intelligent beings on the planet, aren't they?

103
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,930
He's dodging gunfire!

104
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,390
I don't just dodge.

105
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,400
I can use a shield, too.

106
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,280
D-Don't shoot...

107
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,840
Fire.

108
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,020
They're as good as dead.

109
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,510
<i>Shit, that agility of his...</i>

110
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,330
<i>Being indoors limits our firing options,</i>

111
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,980
<i>and we risk friendly fire.</i>

112
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,280
<i>We need to be somewhere more open.</i>

113
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,460
Retreat.

114
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,770
To the roof.

115
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,640
The roof, now!

116
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,850
One more round.

117
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,230
D-Didn't that round finish him?

118
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,050
Don't let your guard down.

119
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,310
We will exercise due caution

120
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,800
and engage the enemy on the roof.

121
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,450
<i>He can navigate walls and 
ceilings as well as any floor.</i>

122
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,240
<i>Indoor combat tactics are useless against him.</i>

123
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,600
<i>This is his lair...</i>

124
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,500
<i>And we are right in the thick of it.</i>

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,630
<i>How ironic that we have lost our advantage</i>

126
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,130
<i>in a man-made structure.</i>

127
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,750
All right, scatter to both sides!

128
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,020
We'll engage him here!

129
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,010
What are you talking about?

130
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Impossible...

131
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,980
You're the only one left.

132
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,740
I cleared out the men behind you.

133
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,490
Or perhaps saying I "scattered them" 
would be more appropriate.

134
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,130
How do you even work?

135
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,500
Don't tell me that your body's also...

136
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,990
That's right.

137
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,510
But I have not armored my entire body.

138
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,190
There are gaps.

139
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,750
I was somewhat careless in this fight, 
given your sheer firepower.

140
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,030
Even if I harden my cells,

141
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,150
deflecting gunshots head-on is not without risk.

142
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,910
That's why I deflect them at an angle, like this.

143
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,490
Y-You dare mock me?!

144
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,760
Also, though I dodge gunfire,

145
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,540
it is not that I can move faster than a bullet.

146
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,680
I predict the direction of fire based on 
the opponent's eye and hand movements.

147
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,570
What was that sound?

148
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,930
I think it came from the roof.

149
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,730
Wh-Who the hell... are you?

150
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,050
I'm what you see.

151
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,910
I'm just a wild organism.

152
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,290
An... organism?

153
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,290
And what are humans, then?

154
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,050
Organisms...

155
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,880
A flamethrower, huh...

156
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,550
Maybe that isn't such a bad idea...

157
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,620
Hey, something just fell out of the sky.

158
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,880
Ow...

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,360
What's wrong?

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I told you so.

161
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,240
Oh, you again.

162
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,540
Gotou...

163
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,350
I see.

164
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,550
So you were also involved.

165
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,900
It was a large battle, to be sure.

166
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,050
It seems all the others have been killed.

167
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,550
And you were a part of it.

168
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,130
The job is not yet finished.

169
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,040
Killing you should bring me closure.

170
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,780
That's right. I should kill you.

171
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,570
Then I will move forward.

172
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,780
"Forward"?

173
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,280
Not bad aim, if you were going for the heart.

174
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,620
Impossible.

175
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,390
Let's finish this later.

176
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,810
There is too much interference,

177
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,060
and I am rather tired today.

178
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,720
H-He flew!

179
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,970
I-Izumi-kun, what exactly are you?

180
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
I don't know!

181
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,350
I have no idea!

182
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,290
Wait!

183
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,930
We suffered heavy casualties.

184
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,270
The majority were men 
under Yamagishi's command.

185
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,700
And all it took was one monster 
to turn the tables on us.

186
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,950
Can you truly claim you knew nothing about this?

187
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,830
You're hiding something again, aren't you?

188
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,120
I don't know!

189
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,540
I had no idea that a single one 
of them could be so powerful!

190
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,590
A head!

191
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,410
Someone's head just fell from the sky!

192
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,720
Shinichi.

193
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,230
Shinichi, that was quite a nightmare.

194
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,610
How do you know what I dreamed about?

195
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,450
It's just a feeling.

196
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,460
Will Gotou come for us?

197
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,980
He most definitely will, and soon.

198
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,870
I sensed his resolve.

199
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,930
So I guess we're going to die.

200
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,610
We can't give up that easily.

201
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,320
We should get help.

202
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,180
Uda, for example.

203
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,200
No.

204
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,930
We can't drag them into something like this.

205
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,400
Humans, then.

206
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,810
We'll pit military forces against him again.

207
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,300
How?!

208
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,250
Even if we do pull that off, 
a lot of people will die again.

209
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,440
And we'll be the ones 
responsible for their deaths!

210
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,950
I couldn't care less.

211
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,200
Migi...

212
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,290
You never change, Migi.

213
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,460
<i>Dad, I might have to say goodbye soon.</i>

214
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,050
<i>Mom, I might be able to see you again soon.</i>

215
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,460
Hey, why don't we run somewhere far away?

216
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,700
Not even Gotou is so obsessed with us that 
he'd follow us all over Japan, is he?

217
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,110
Migi...

218
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,110
Are you asleep?

219
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,120
Oh, I forgot to go to school.

220
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,620
Heh, school...

221
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,060
<i>Wait, he's asleep?</i>

222
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,450
<i>Migi?!</i>

223
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,770
Huh?

224
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,270
If he attacks now...

225
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,200
If he attacks now...

226
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,870
Hey!

227
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,700
Apologize.

228
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,630
S-Sorry.

229
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,630
Wow, he's scared shitless.

230
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,870
Say it on your knees.

231
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,600
Sorry.

232
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm very sorry.

233
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,100
I apologized, didn't I?!

234
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,560
I said "sorry"!

235
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,310
I apologized!

236
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,270
I apologized, okay?!

237
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,310
Izumi-kun.

238
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,540
H-Hey.

239
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,090
Oh, did you skip school today?

240
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,550
Yeah.

241
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,110
I did. I'm a cheat, you know.

242
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,350
I'm a loser.

243
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,490
What's wrong?

244
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,960
You're acting weird.

245
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,410
Hey...

246
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,330
Stop... You're hurting me.

247
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,870
Please let go.

248
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,840
Stop!

249
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,480
Izumi-kun...

250
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,250
Your idea to run far away

251
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,480
may not be a bad one, Shinichi.

252
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,240
Oh, you were awake?

253
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,680
Far away, huh?

254
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,560
And I'm so close to graduating.

255
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,500
Shinichi.

256
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,790
Huh?

257
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,730
Have your senses become dull?

258
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,630
Hello.

259
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,260
How'd you know I'd be here?

260
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,710
You like parks, Izumi-kun.

261
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,020
I can tell because I like them, too.

262
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,860
Sorry about earlier.

263
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,280
I didn't mean to frighten you.

264
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,260
You're a strange guy, Izumi-kun.

265
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,470
I sometimes don't think I know you at all.

266
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,490
Don't you think it's cold out here?

267
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,670
Come over to my place.

268
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,510
Let's talk.

269
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,760
No one else is home today.

270
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,730
<i>When you feel your life's on the line, 
your true nature surfaces.</i>

271
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,730
<i>I'm so pathetic.</i>

272
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,490
<i>All I can think about is how I don't want to die.</i>

273
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,440
<i>I want to live.</i>

274
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,610
<i>I want to keep on living.</i>

275
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,550
<i>I've called Migi cold-blooded a lot,</i>

276
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,630
<i>but I don't have any right to say that.</i>

277
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,290
<i>In the end, I'm trampling over those
around me in order to live.</i>

278
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,470
Shinichi-kun...

279
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,570
You're really pretty amazing.

280
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,470
We've gone through a lot together,

281
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,060
so even if something horrible 
happens again, we'll be okay.

282
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,370
We can't lose.

283
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,200
Satomi, I like you a lot.

284
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,640
I love you.

285
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,780
Izumi-kun,

286
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,110
you always drop quiet bombshells 
like that at the end.

287
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,870
<i>I'm going to live.</i>

288
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,710
<i>No matter what it takes!</i>

289
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,030
Quiescence and Awakening

290
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:47,930
Next time:

291
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,070
"Quiescence and Awakening."
