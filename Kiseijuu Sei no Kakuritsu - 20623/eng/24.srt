parasite

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,570
<i>In the end, no one knows 
what they really are.</i>

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,360
<i>They're still being talked about online,</i>

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,540
<i>but there's been no formal announcement 
from any public agencies.</i>

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,550
<i>Ever since the battle at the city hall,</i>

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,790
<i>there's been no notable parasite 
activity in this area,</i>

Nishi Fukuyama Station South Exit

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,290
<i>or even in the whole world.</i>

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,610
<i>Why did they suddenly go quiet?</i>

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,520
<i>One obvious reason was that the battle 
was effective as an object lesson.</i>

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,070
<i>Another was that they, themselves,</i>

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>became even more adept at 
blending into human society.</i>

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,800
<i>Like Tamura Reiko before them, 
some gradually altered their diet</i>

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,330
<i>to require less human flesh 
and thus become more human.</i>

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>As for the one here...</i>

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,040
<i>Shinichi...</i>

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
<i>Migi, you never change.</i>

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,630
<i>You're so blunt.</i>

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,600
<i>But I'm really glad you're alive, Migi.</i>

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,070
<i>How do I look to you now, Shinichi?</i>

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,260
<i>You look like you.</i>

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>Before, you were totally different.</i>

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,330
<i>Um, I think it was like...</i>

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,290
<i>Never mind.</i>

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,750
<i>I've actually come here today to say goodbye.</i>

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,240
<i>Huh? What do you mean?</i>

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,960
<i>I think I'll go to sleep.</i>

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,280
<i>Sleep?</i>

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>You're always going to sleep anyway.</i>

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,000
<i>It's a different kind of sleep.</i>

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,010
<i>This time, it'll be for a while longer.</i>

33
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,220
<i>It may very well last until I die.</i>

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,250
<i>In other words,</i>

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,940
<i>you can think of it as regaining 
an ordinary right hand.</i>

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,970
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,260
<i>I don't get what you mean!</i>

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,980
<i>My internal structure has been altered yet again.</i>

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,200
<i>In particular, my time spent in a lucid 
dream of sorts within Gotou's body,</i>

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,300
<i>where I felt alone, yet not alone, 
has been a major factor in that change.</i>

41
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,710
<i>But, Migi...</i>

42
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,490
<i>Not only did I obtain a massive 
amount of information at once,</i>

43
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,050
<i>but I also became capable of pursuing 
many lines of thoughts in parallel.</i>

44
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,530
<i>I now want to shut out all 
other information for a while</i>

45
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,850
<i>and see what I can accomplish with the 
material I currently have at my disposal.</i>

46
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,130
<i>So, I will stop all surface 
activity for the time being.</i>

47
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,120
<i>What? I can't believe I'm hearing this.</i>

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,250
<i>You were always so curious.</i>

49
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,700
<i>What's wrong?</i>

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,290
<i>Aren't there still all kinds 
of things you don't know?</i>

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,320
<i>You're right.</i>

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,890
<i>Well, I'll put it this way.</i>

53
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,400
<i>I'm going to try heading in a different direction.</i>

54
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,350
<i>A direction that's slightly 
different from your world.</i>

55
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,250
<i>I don't understand.</i>

56
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,830
<i>Shinichi, I want you to think of me as a dream.</i>

57
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,390
<i>That's why I'm saying goodbye to you in one.</i>

58
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,630
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>

59
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,820
<i>All the days I spent with you,</i>

60
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,610
<i>all the times we helped each other...</i>

61
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,180
<i>They weren't a dream!</i>

62
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,450
<i>You're right.</i>

63
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,900
<i>The horrific events in your vicinity—</i>

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,910
<i>the deaths of many people—
did happen in reality.</i>

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,530
<i>Mom!</i>

66
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,860
<i>Mom!</i>

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,570
<i>Why is Mom here?</i>

68
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,910
<i>It's a mental projection you generated 
upon hearing me talk about deaths.</i>

69
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,870
<i>Oh, so this is how your mother 
appears to you in your mind.</i>

70
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,290
<i>Huh, what?</i>

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,350
<i>What do you mean?</i>

72
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,090
<i>What's this?</i>

73
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,490
<i>They're all very different from how 
I perceived them in my mind's eye.</i>

74
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,310
<i>Show how you see me.</i>

75
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,580
<i>Huh?</i>

76
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,490
<i>What do you mean, "Huh?"</i>

77
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,050
<i>Well, so that's that.</i>

78
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,070
<i>We can pretty much only hope to 
understand each other on certain points.</i>

79
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,060
<i>Even supposing that humans, who 
technically share the same structure,</i>

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,080
<i>could exchange souls with each other,</i>

81
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,080
<i>they would see and hear worlds 
far beyond their imagination.</i>

82
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,410
<i>Well, I should get going.</i>

83
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,350
<i>I'm going to flip the switch.</i>

84
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,710
<i>Wait! How am I supposed to fight 
parasites by myself, if they show up?</i>

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,680
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,730
<i>You should be more wary of traffic accidents.</i>

87
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,850
<i>Wait!</i>

88
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,960
<i>So I can't ever talk to you again?</i>

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,900
<i>Forever?!</i>

90
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,230
<i>Possibly.</i>

91
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,190
<i>But, well, it's not like either of us 
is going to die anytime soon.</i>

92
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,780
<i>Besides, it's not normal for someone 
to talk to his hand, anyway.</i>

93
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,910
<i>This is too much.</i>

94
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,940
<i>How can you spring this on me?</i>

95
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,720
<i>You'll have forgotten all about this 
dream when you wake up, like usual.</i>

96
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,350
<i>I'd like you to have forgotten 
about me along with this dream.</i>

97
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,400
<i>Yes, I'm sure you can.</i>

98
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,780
<i>Listen, when you wake up in the morning,</i>

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,770
<i>what you'll see is an ordinary right hand.</i>

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,270
<i>That's how things should be.</i>

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,280
<i>Migi...</i>

102
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,140
<i>Thank you for everything, Shinichi.</i>

103
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,090
There's no way I could forget!

104
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,400
Idiot!

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,570
You idiot...

106
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,940
Parasyte

107
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,940
The Maxim

108
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,200
Nagai's been annoying lately, 
always following me around.

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,170
Oh, Akiho.

110
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,750
Oh, there he is!

111
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,270
Izumi-kun, long time no see!

112
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,910
Hey.

113
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,750
Did you wait long?

114
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,700
No, Yuuko and Akiho just happened to pass by.

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm going to an art exhibit with Akiho.

116
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,900
Not that I really want to...

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,820
We wouldn't want to be in 
your way, so we'll take off.

118
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,270
Later, guys!

119
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,690
They seem to be having fun.

120
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,280
Yeah, looks like they're enjoying 
college life to the fullest.

121
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,030
I've been left behind.

122
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,030
Hurry up and catch up, then.

123
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,670
I'm waiting for you.

124
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,790
<i>Studying after failing college entrance exams</i>

125
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,380
<i>is like taking a nap in a park on a sunny day,</i>

126
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,800
<i>compared to all the crazy 
stuff that came before.</i>

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,550
<i>Nothing's happened lately.</i>

128
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,560
<i>I haven't come across a single sign 
of the parasites around here.</i>

129
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,560
<i>I talked about what might've happened to them</i>

130
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,510
<i>with Uda-san in Izu over the phone, once,</i>

131
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,700
<i>but I didn't tell him about Migi.</i>

132
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,050
<i>Migi's "disappearance" is unique, 
even among his kind.</i>

133
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,330
<i>Migi... In the end, I never did understand you.</i>

134
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,470
<i>But that's okay.</i>

135
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,000
<i>I'm sure you're walking in places unknown to me.</i>

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,010
<i>The many battles we fought together...</i>

137
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,570
<i>They weren't for the sake of Earth or anything.</i>

138
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,430
<i>It was for humanity... Or, really, 
more for me as an individual.</i>

139
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,590
<i>In the end,</i>

140
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,050
<i>I couldn't see things from the parasites' 
perspective, never mind from Migi's.</i>

141
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,120
<i>Of course not.</i>

142
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,430
<i>It wasn't possible from the beginning.</i>

143
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,300
<i>As two different species,</i>

144
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,050
<i>we may at times take advantage of 
each other and kill each other,</i>

145
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,670
<i>but it's impossible to understand each other.</i>

146
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,080
<i>Actually, you shouldn't even 
think that you've figured out</i>

147
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,170
<i>another species based on your standards.</i>

148
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,890
<i>I think it's human arrogance to think we 
understand how other life forms feel.</i>

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,060
<i>There may be no other life forms 
that are truly a "friend" to man.</i>

150
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,220
<i>Still, even if we can't comprehend them,</i>

151
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,930
<i>they are, without a doubt, 
neighbors deserving of our respect.</i>

152
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,220
<i>We protect other species because humans 
themselves are lonely creatures.</i>

153
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,780
<i>We protect the environment because humans 
themselves don't want to go extinct.</i>

154
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,170
<i>What drives us is simply self-gratification.</i>

155
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,490
<i>But I think that's fine, and that 
it's really all there is to it.</i>

156
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,960
<i>There's no point in despising 
humans by human standards.</i>

157
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,700
That's right.

158
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,040
So in the end, it's hypocritical for us 
to love Earth without loving ourselves.

159
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,720
What's with you?

160
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,100
Huh?

161
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,760
Oh, just...

162
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,690
I was thinking how peaceful 
things have been lately.

163
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,280
Really?

164
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,940
I heard crime's on the rise.

165
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,130
That's it!

166
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,450
<i>That's why they're no longer conspicuous.</i>

167
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,990
<i>Well, maybe they never were 
conspicuous to begin with.</i>

168
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,960
<i>Even murders can be chalked up to
wild beasts feeding themselves.</i>

169
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,870
<i>In a narrow sense, they were our enemies,</i>

170
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,780
<i>but in a broader sense, 
they were our kindred.</i>

171
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,970
<i>All of us were born here on 
this planet, weren't we?</i>

172
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,750
<i>And we've been living our lives 
close to someone else.</i>

173
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,980
Parasyte

174
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,240
Come to think of it,

175
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,800
we've been together for a while, haven't we?

176
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,990
We're together?

177
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,940
Huh?

178
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,500
Just kidding.

179
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,620
Hey.

180
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,970
I forgot what I was about to say.

181
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,720
What?

182
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,470
Huh?

183
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
What now?

184
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,260
<i>Was I imagining it?</i>

185
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
<i>He looked liked that guy.</i>

186
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,810
No, I thought I saw someone I knew.

187
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,650
No Motor Vehicles

188
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,910
<i>No, it </i>is<i> him!</i>

189
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,530
What's wrong?

190
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,550
Can you hold this?

191
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,520
Wait here.

192
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,250
Huh?

193
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,470
I'll be right back!

194
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,690
He went through <i>here</i>?

195
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,040
Is he looking for someone?

196
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,150
He's looking for me.

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,770
Yo.

198
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,440
Satomi!

199
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>What the...</i>

200
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>What the hell?!</i>

201
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,240
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

202
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,830
<i>I should've just pretended I didn't see him!</i>

203
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,670
Let's go.

204
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,710
Yeah.

205
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,050
Hey, what're you—

206
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,180
S-Someone, help!

207
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,900
I won't kill you until later.

208
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,340
I still need to talk to your boyfriend.

209
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,450
Satomi!

210
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,370
Hey...

211
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,590
You didn't waste any time, huh?

212
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,590
Satomi!

213
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,090
Izumi-kun...

214
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,130
Aw, how cute.

215
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,480
She's so scared, she can barely talk.

216
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,590
Don't!

217
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,720
What'd you do to her?!

218
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,200
Nothing yet.

219
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,230
The blood's from that broad.

220
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
Hey, c'mon.

221
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,250
Can you let her go?

222
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,180
Huh?!

223
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,630
Are you stupid?!

224
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,740
Then what do I need to do?

225
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,000
If you'll spare her life,

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,610
I'll do anything.

227
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,530
Is there something you want?

228
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,870
Please tell me what it is.

229
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,530
What do I want?

230
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,980
The cops aren't stupid.

231
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,840
It's only a matter of time before I'll be hanged.

232
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,520
But since I managed to run into you first,

233
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,530
I thought I'd ask for an answer 
that wouldn't come from a human.

234
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,730
Huh?

235
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,380
It makes sense when monsters kill humans.

236
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,870
They're just feeding themselves.

237
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,990
But what about me? What do you think I am?

238
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,000
Nah, I think you know the answer already.

239
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,770
You know <i>I'm</i> the true human here.

240
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,510
Why are other guys so much better 
at keeping themselves in control?

241
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,760
It's human nature to want to 
kill each other, you know?

242
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,260
They're making a big fuss about nothing

243
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,510
when they're all bloodthirsty themselves.

244
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,380
People who don't know who they truly 
are bitch at me about what I do,

245
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,400
but I can tell monsters and humans 
apart just by looking at them.

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,900
I know how unnatural this 
whole world's become, too.

247
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,910
There's no need for monsters!

248
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,210
Humans were created to be 
cannibals in the first place!

249
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,350
We've been like that for thousands of years!

250
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,840
It's because we tried to stop all of a sudden

251
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,810
that our numbers ballooned into the billions!

252
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,800
The world's gonna burst 
if we don't do something!

253
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,840
Everyone's a damn liar,
but you're different, right?

254
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,030
Be honest, like me.

255
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,310
What are you getting at?

256
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,120
Don't play dumb.

257
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,810
You're a mixed breed, aren't you?
You've got monster in you!

258
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,060
What?!

259
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,940
I knew from the first time I laid eyes on you.

260
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,840
It's not in your head, though.

261
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,550
It's somewhere else in your body.

262
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't...

263
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,410
Don't be ridiculous!

264
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,480
You're his girlfriend.

265
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,700
You must've seen his body.

266
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,210
Wasn't there some suspicious mark

267
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,590
that might've been where a 
monster burrowed inside?

268
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,090
Please.

269
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,790
Let her go.

270
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,080
Answer me!

271
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,630
I'm the normal human being, right?

272
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,060
I'm just following my instincts!

273
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,620
I'm the one being true to my nature,

274
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,060
but human society is desperate 
to keep ignoring me.

275
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,470
I'm just asking you for a favor, given that 
you're halfway between humans and monsters.

276
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,200
<i>Izumi-kun...</i>

277
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,680
Halfway between humans and parasites, huh?

278
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,960
Someone said something similar to me before.

279
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,170
Compared to Gotou, you're spun glass,

280
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,680
but I'm not that strong anymore.

281
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,390
If words are all you want, I'll say anything.

282
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,430
So just let her go.

283
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,740
Yeah, you're right!

284
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,120
Like you said, I'm—

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,190
Izumi-kun!

286
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,180
Call the police.

287
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,950
You don't need to listen to this jerk.

288
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,400
How can he be considered 
a normal human being?!

289
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,170
You're even worse than those monsters!

290
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,770
Huh.

291
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,330
You were so scared, you couldn't even talk,

292
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,210
and now look how spunky you are.

293
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,740
I'm not scared of you!

294
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,470
I've been through much worse at school!

295
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,420
S-Satomi...

296
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,350
Both Izumi-kun and I have gone through it.

297
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,790
That's right.

298
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,050
Izumi-kun, you were amazing 
when it all happened.

299
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,920
You carried me and protected 
me with everything you had.

300
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,610
Sure, you might not be "normal,"

301
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,820
but you're human!

302
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,720
Humans think all life is precious!

303
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,500
You're the monster, jerk!

304
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,200
That's enough, Satomi.

305
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,950
Izumi-kun, just go!

306
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,450
Sure, fine.

307
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,330
Go call the cops, kid.

308
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,920
I think this girl's going to be more fun.

309
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,970
I'll have fun taking this toy apart while I wait.

310
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,720
This'll probably be the last fun I ever have.

311
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,220
It's always more fun taking 
apart the spunky ones.

312
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,980
Sh-Shinichi-kun!

313
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,970
I...

314
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,730
I was always trying to catch up with you.

315
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,250
But you're so fast,

316
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,110
you kept walking off into 
worlds I didn't understand...

317
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,990
I was the one left behind.

318
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,420
But now that I've finally caught up with you,

319
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,480
it looks like I might've 
actually gone too far ahead.

320
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,420
Stop!

321
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,130
<i>I'll save her!</i>

322
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,760
<i>I'll get to her in time!</i>

323
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,010
<i>That's right, I'm fast!</i>

324
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,140
<i>I'm not a normal human being!</i>

325
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,640
<i>To me, he looks like he's frozen in time!</i>

326
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,890
<i>With my left, strike his knife hand up</i>

327
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,380
<i>and slam his jaw!</i>

328
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,310
<i>Then with my right...</i>

329
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,570
<i>Toys are so easily broken...</i>

330
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,100
No... It can't be.

331
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,910
This is too much.

332
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,280
Why does it always end like this?

333
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,550
<i>An organism I met in passing and got to know</i>

334
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,370
<i>was suddenly dead.</i>

335
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,830
<i>Why do I get sad when that happens?</i>

336
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,940
<i>Well, that's because humans have 
so much time on their hands.</i>

337
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,360
<i>But that's their greatest merit.</i>

338
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,250
<i>An organism with time to spare in their hearts...</i>

339
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,950
<i>How wonderful is that?</i>

340
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,540
<i>So...</i>

341
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>Quit whining already.</i>

342
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,960
<i>I'm getting tired, so you can do the holding.</i>

343
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,070
Huh?

344
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,090
Satomi!

345
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,940
<i>I got to her in time?</i>

346
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,960
<i>M-Migi!</i>

347
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,360
You okay?

348
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,070
<i>Thanks, Migi.</i>

349
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,490
<i>You're still alive!</i>

350
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,310
<i>Did Satomi see Migi?</i>

351
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,960
<i>Oh, well.</i>

352
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,750
<i>I don't mind if </i>she<i> saw him.</i>

353
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,330
What a beautiful sky.

354
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,500
Do you remember the puppy that died?

355
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,110
I'd thrown him away in a trash can.

356
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,890
I forgot to tell you before,

357
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,510
but after I thought about it for a while,

358
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,270
I moved him and buried him under a tree.

359
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,470
I know.

360
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,390
You did that because you're...

361
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,850
You're Shinichi-kun.

362
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,330
There are three people 
on the ground there, too!

363
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,720
Three, he says.

364
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,390
Yeah, they think we're dead.

365
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,170
<i>We were all born here on Earth...</i>

366
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,130
<i>We try to keep understanding each 
other along these tiny points</i>

367
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,710
<i>until they accumulate.</i>

368
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,440
<i>We try to get closer to someone else</i>

369
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,370
<i>until our lives someday end.</i>
