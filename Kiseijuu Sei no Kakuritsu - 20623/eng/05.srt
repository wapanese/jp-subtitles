1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,840
We've come pretty far.

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,710
Have we?

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,240
Are you busy tomorrow?

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,490
Not really...

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,190
Then let's go a little farther.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,560
There's a spot with a great 
view of the city lights.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,040
What's this belt for?

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,330
C'mon.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,090
Don't tell me this is your first time in a car.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,300
Hey, what are you doing?

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,670
<i>My organs are in shambles...</i>

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,120
<i>This body will die.</i>

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,360
<i>What about the man?</i>

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,700
<i>I see.</i>

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,490
<i>So that's what the belt is for.</i>

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,940
<i>I have no choice but to 
relocate to this man's body.</i>

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,080
<i>I should go for his head.</i>

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,630
<i>Male or female, controlling his
body shouldn't be that different.</i>

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,550
<i>Sever the head,</i>

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,320
<i>fuse, and regenerate.</i>

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,260
<i>I must complete it all in an instant.</i>

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,180
<i>What's the matter?</i>

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,580
<i>Move.</i>

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,350
<i>Move.</i>

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,990
<i>Move...</i>

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,690
Parasyte

27
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,690
The Maxim

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,110
The Stranger

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,780
Ugh, crap!

30
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm running late!

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,380
Why didn't you wake me up?

32
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,070
You slept in

33
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,850
because your body wanted more sleep.

34
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,660
Sleep is beneficial.

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,930
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,140
Your well-being is my well-being.

37
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,150
Although it's minimal, you're no longer pure.

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,150
I wonder what she meant by that.

39
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,420
My physical body

40
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,410
is linked to your brain through 
your nerves and bodily fluids.

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,910
That may be the reason.

42
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,280
Huh?

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,950
What I mean is that your brain may 
be undergoing changes, as well.

44
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,890
Tamiya Ryoko realized that,

45
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,040
and detected something "inhuman" about you.

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,910
"Inhuman"?

47
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,760
Except for my right hand, 
I'm human, aren't I?

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm not so sure.

49
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,570
In particular, it would not be 
surprising if you've changed

50
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,910
at the psychological level.

51
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,500
Tired. Going to sleep.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,770
Hey, hang on!

53
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,170
<i>No longer pure?</i>

54
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,680
Interesting...

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,780
I won't kill you, after all.

56
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,570
<i>No, I am a normal human being.</i>

57
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,700
Something's... Something's changed.

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,950
You know, you've changed recently.

59
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,050
<i>No, I haven't!</i>

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,970
<i>I have no desire to kill and eat people!</i>

61
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,450
Hey, stand up!

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,930
What's the matter? Huh?

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,200
<i>Nagai!</i>

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,220
Quit it!

65
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,130
Who the hell are you?

66
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,860
He's my classmate.

67
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,270
<i>Izumi...</i>

68
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,260
That's your reason?

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,120
I don't know the whole story,

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,170
but isn't this going too far?

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,160
You awake now, Four-Eyes?

72
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,610
Want another one?

73
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,680
Don't. I'm starting to pity him.

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,210
We just want to talk to your buddy here.

75
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,630
One of the most incomprehensible 
elements of the human psyche

76
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,790
is altruism:

77
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,780
doing something for someone else,

78
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,740
even at a cost to yourself.

79
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,490
I just cannot fathom it.

80
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,240
<i>The human psyche?</i>

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,930
Hey, stand up.

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,950
<i>That's right!</i>

83
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,570
<i>Humans are different from parasites!</i>

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,750
I... I said, "stop!"

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,760
If you're going to fight him,
you should do it fair and square.

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Are you being serious?

87
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,020
Y-Yeah.

88
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,980
<i>I might regret this now.</i>

89
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,400
Don't you think that's enough?

90
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,640
Not yet.

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,990
I hate posers like him.

92
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,400
<i>Shit...</i>

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,160
<i>I forgot to warn Migi in advance.</i>

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,540
That's enough!

95
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,300
It's pathetic, beating up someone so weak.

96
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,430
Looks like you get to live.

97
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,050
Why'd you butt in when you're too weak to fight?

98
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,570
Who are you?

99
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,990
Hey, let's go, Kana.

100
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,860
You okay, Nagai?

101
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,340
Are you stupid or something?

102
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,600
Yeah, I think that was pretty stupid myself.

103
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,090
But that's what separates 
us humans from animals.

104
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,150
Hey, what happened to your face?

105
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,330
Oh, nothing worth mentioning.

106
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,740
I asked him, too,

107
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,670
but he won't tell me.

108
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,260
Wait, were you in a fight?

109
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,240
Hey, Izumi.

110
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,990
I heard from Nagai.

111
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,460
You took on Mitsuo's crew?

112
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,880
I didn't "take them on."

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
They took me out.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I didn't have a chance.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,180
They've been throwing their weight around lately.

116
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,810
Let me know if anything happens.

117
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,180
S-Sure...

118
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,170
You're...

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,690
So you have a girlfriend.

120
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,220
You still want something with me?

121
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,750
Why didn't you run away this morning?

122
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,440
Huh? No real reason...

123
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,480
You defended him just because he was 
your classmate and you got beat up.

124
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,580
He's not normal, is he?

125
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,940
What?

126
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,580
That's uncalled for.

127
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,880
Let's go.

128
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,990
Don't be such a poser.

129
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,340
You act all high and mighty,

130
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,210
but who knows what you're 
doing behind our backs?

131
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,470
What's her deal?

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,010
It's nothing.

133
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,570
<i>Kana...</i>

134
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,100
Stop!

135
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,360
Izumi-kun!

136
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,620
Murano!

137
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,150
Izumi-kun!

138
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,750
There you are, poser.

139
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,370
L-Let her go.

140
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,460
I don't think so.

141
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,510
But you can go home.

142
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,630
What?

143
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,260
Ow.

144
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,590
Izumi-kun!

145
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,790
Go home!

146
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,970
Stop acting like a hero!

147
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,900
Stop it!

148
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,300
You're pathetic...

149
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,600
Shinichi.

150
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,480
Migi, go back to sleep.

151
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,170
Don't interfere.

152
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,290
That depends on how far this goes.

153
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,290
Don't worry...

154
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,880
For your reference, I will 
tell you how strong they are.

155
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,400
If your strength is a 10,

156
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,820
he is an 18,

157
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,970
the one on her right is a 13,
and the two on her left are 14 and 12.

158
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,570
What's your point in telling me this now?

159
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,220
Even dogs and cats have the ability
to measure their opponents' strength.

160
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,310
Animals avoid fights they cannot win.

161
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,770
So what?

162
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,900
Stop!

163
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,650
There are times humans can't 
back down from a fight!

164
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,910
That's the difference between us.

165
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,970
Migi, my right hand isn't responsive enough.

166
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,120
Give me full control!

167
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,030
What're you muttering about?

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,550
<i>Why won't he run?</i>

169
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,560
Let her go.

170
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,970
If you refuse...

171
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,210
W-Wait, idiot!

172
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,960
"If we refuse," what?

173
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,320
You'll run and tell your mommy?

174
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,320
Cut it out, Mitsuo.

175
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,600
K-Kana...

176
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,580
Just what do you think you're doing?

177
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,300
Kamijo...

178
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,740
Nagai...

179
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,010
The majority attacking the minority.

180
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,850
They make better animals than you, Shinichi.

181
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,230
We're gonna pay you back in full for what you did.

182
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,220
You think you've won just because 
you've got more people?

183
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,600
Stupid hick!

184
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,230
Shut your damn mouth!

185
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,890
<i>Damn.</i>

186
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,540
<i>These sex organs are structured 
very differently from female ones.</i>

187
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,310
<i>I can't control them very well...</i>

188
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,620
<i>What's the matter?</i>

189
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,800
<i>I can't move...</i>

190
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,420
<i>It's rejecting me?</i>

191
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,100
<i>Damn.</i>

192
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,790
<i>I can't even use a body of 
the opposite sex now.</i>

193
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,190
<i>It needs to be a woman.</i>

194
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,400
<i>Leaving the city was a mistake.</i>

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,330
<i>I need to find another woman</i>

196
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,940
<i>and relocate again.</i>

197
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,510
You don't have to do this.

198
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,440
It's not like I can't walk.

199
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,890
It's okay.

200
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,400
I'll walk you home.

201
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,110
I'm really sorry.

202
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,440
It's nothing you need to 
apologize for, Murano.

203
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,730
Ow!

204
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,220
Huh?

205
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,790
Your right hand isn't even scratched.

206
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,920
See?

207
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,350
Even though your left 
hand's all roughed up...

208
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,910
You're right.

209
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,720
Hey, do you think I'm weird?

210
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,510
What?

211
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,730
Am I not normal?

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,690
Yeah, you're not normal at all.

213
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,020
How?

214
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,930
You're cool.

215
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,820
I don't think normal people

216
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,570
would go that far for someone else.

217
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,470
Is that a compliment?

218
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,870
Of course.

219
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,190
You're the only one I know who'd go that far,

220
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,640
even knowing you can't win.

221
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,670
I see.

222
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,270
I'm glad.

223
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,250
My parents aren't here today.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,900
Do you want to stay over?

225
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,900
Nah, I'm gonna go home.

226
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,740
How disappointing. I thought I would 
get to see human intercourse.

227
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,820
Go back to sleep.

228
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,250
Who're you talking to?

229
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,790
You followed me home?

230
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,490
I just came to apologize.

231
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

232
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,920
It's fine, then.

233
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,220
Oh?

234
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,550
So we're all good, then.

235
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,550
At least, you and I are good.

236
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,430
Um...

237
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,110
Okay.

238
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,400
S-Sorry.

239
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,320
I'm beat.

240
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,050
You should be wary of that woman.

241
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,160
Though weak, it appears 
she has the ability to sense

242
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,920
wavelengths that only we parasites can.

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
But she's human, right?

244
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,390
Murano is also quite perceptive,

245
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,430
but that woman is on another level entirely.

246
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,190
You should stay as far 
away from her as you can.

247
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,970
Okay...

248
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,910
What a beautiful sunset.

249
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,910
Yeah, this was worth rushing over in a taxi.

250
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,410
I'd like to bring Shinichi here someday.

251
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,000
He's never far from your mind, is he?

252
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,420
Nobuko...

253
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,120
What?

254
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,410
Your diet seems unbalanced.

255
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,640
It's not like you can tell how it tastes.

256
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,200
Your mother made nutritionally balanced meals.

257
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,070
I can eat like that again tomorrow.

258
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,560
It's from a public phone.

259
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,660
Shinichi?

260
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,100
Dad.

261
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,750
Y-Your mom...

262
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,340
Huh?

263
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,920
What about Mom?

264
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,420
N...

265
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,420
Nobuko's...

266
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,180
In any case,

267
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,710
I'm going to the police,

268
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,750
and I'll get that monster...

269
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,440
Dad!

270
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,180
Dad?!

271
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,580
"Monster"?

272
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,490
It can't be...

273
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,590
Was Mom...

274
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,350
Shinichi, what's wrong?

275
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,920
<i>Dad...</i>

276
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,880
<i>Mom...</i>

277
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,220
<i>Where are you?</i>

278
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,380
<i>Where is that?</i>

279
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,460
<i>We'll just decide</i>

280
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,060
<i>our next stop as we go along.</i>

281
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,780
<i>It'll be so relaxing to be carefree like that.</i>

282
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,450
<i>Dad...</i>

283
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,300
<i>Where's Mom?</i>

284
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,550
<i>That monster...</i>

285
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,700
<i>She's not a monster! She's Mom!</i>

286
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,760
<i>Shinichi...</i>

287
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,580
<i>Mom!</i>

288
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,510
He hasn't called again since.

289
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,240
If I only knew where they were...

290
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,750
Shinichi, you must rest.

291
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,120
"Monster."

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,840
That's what Dad said on the phone.

293
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,510
That can only mean you guys.

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Wait, Shinichi.

295
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,520
One of my kind has appeared.

296
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,320
It is coming this way.

297
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,050
This is all your fault.

298
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,420
I was against the trip in the first place,

299
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,900
but because you said it'd be fine...

300
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,430
I did not say it'd be fine.

301
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,190
I said that in terms of probability, 
somewhere less populated—

302
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,330
Shut up!

303
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,670
I should've told them when 
you took over my right hand!

304
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,060
I understand that you have many 
things you'd like to say to me,

305
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,830
but right now, please stay 
focused on the battle before you.

306
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
No, you can just be mentally prepared.

307
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,890
I will kill it in one strike 
before it can ascertain

308
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,860
whether we are friend or foe.

309
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,640
I can't face it unarmed.

310
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,660
I'm full of hate right now.

311
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,470
Hate for those damn monsters!

312
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,090
It's stopped moving.

313
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,650
It's already at the front door.

314
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,410
It unlocked the door?

315
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,650
Mom...

316
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,440
Mom?

317
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,690
That man has not returned?

318
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,910
Mom...

319
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,400
Shinichi, no.

320
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,700
It is not her!

321
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,260
Welcome back.

322
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,250
Hey, that's weird.

323
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,070
Mom?

324
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,720
What is going on here?

325
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,330
Why have you taken over his hand?

326
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,970
It took your mother's head.

327
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,630
What? My right hand?

328
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,820
Oh, this...

329
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,900
I should've told you about him earlier,

330
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,910
but... you know.

331
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,790
I mean, this would've really 
freaked you out, right?

332
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,510
Shinichi, she is not—

333
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,510
Shut up!

334
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,040
So that man must have died.

335
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,520
No, I need to go back and 
confirm one more time.

336
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,720
Shinichi, your knife is in my way.

337
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,750
Move it away!

338
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,790
I mean, it's not natural to 
have a talking right hand.

339
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,650
Right, Mom?

340
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,330
The right hand, huh?

341
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,030
How unfortunate.

342
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,410
Unable to take his head, you 
are now under human control.

343
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,180
Mom!

344
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,160
I'll tell you everything 
I've been hiding from you,

345
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,160
so please stop kidding around.

346
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,760
Shinichi, snap out of it.

347
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,160
Your mother is no longer—

348
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,420
Shut up! Shut up!

349
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,700
<i>You're</i> the monster!

350
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,130
Shin—

351
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,550
Keep talking and I'll chop you right off!

352
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,800
Mom...

353
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,550
Mom...

354
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,520
You remember, right?

355
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,680
That scar on your hand...

356
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,310
Seeing it always makes me feel guilty

357
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,890
and makes me want to apologize to you.

358
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,570
Mo—

359
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,200
Shinichi!

360
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,790
M... om...

361
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,030
The Sun Rises Again

362
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,140
Next time:

363
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,260
"The Sun Rises Again."
