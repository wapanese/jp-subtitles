1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,870
Hey, Izumi-kun.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,110
Did you hear about that incident...

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,990
You know, the girl who was recently 
murdered in a neighboring town?

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,510
Oh, I heard about that!

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,720
It's been making the rounds online!

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,030
I heard you were the first one 
to find the victim, Izumi-kun!

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,370
Hey, Akiho!

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,440
You okay?

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,130
Yeah.

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,900
You?

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,520
I'm okay, too.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,800
So, um...

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,450
Yeah...

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,570
That day when we had planned 
to go see a movie... I...

15
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,720
It's awful when so many sad things happen.

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,380
Yeah.

17
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,680
Parasyte

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,680
The Maxim

19
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,330
Regardless of all these dining 
locations we prepared,

20
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,850
Hello Sadness

21
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,650
he intentionally fed outside
of the designated areas

22
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,040
and was killed.

23
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,710
An unfortunate incident, indeed.

24
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,970
He gave in to the immediacy of hunger,

25
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,050
then squabbled with his own kind.

26
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,590
How self-centered... Just like animals.

27
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm glad he's dead.

28
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,470
It's not that simple.

29
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,960
The end result is that we have 
provided humans with another sample,

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,850
and the perpetrator has yet to come forward.

31
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,580
Could it have been the work of a human?

32
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,660
Indeed.

33
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,360
It was he who killed one of us.

34
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,320
The boy who found the dead human.

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,650
Izumi Shinichi.

36
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,080
He most likely snapped when he 
saw that his friend was murdered.

37
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,610
"Friend"?

38
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,840
"Snapped"?

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,830
Is his brain entirely human?

40
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
His brain remains intact,

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,440
and he is coexisting with his parasite.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,880
You could say that he is a valuable sample.

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,340
A sample, huh?

45
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,020
He sounds like he could be a threat.

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,100
I am making an effort to secure 
a better future for all of us.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,540
I ask you to consider my investigation 
of him as being a part of that endeavor.

48
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,650
Very well.

49
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,630
I'll leave the matter of the boy to you.

50
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,610
By the way, Tamura-san,

51
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,680
how is your child?

52
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,620
It is living a normal life,

53
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,830
although I am rearing it with human assistance.

54
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,870
Oh, my.

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,250
There, there.

56
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,770
What's the matter?

57
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,600
I've changed your diaper.

58
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,300
There, there.

59
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,260
Oh, it's Mommy.

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,510
Hello, welcome back.

61
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,060
Quiet.

62
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,560
I have it trained well, don't I?

63
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,710
What?

64
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you for the help.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,910
Please come again tomorrow.

66
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,570
O-Of course.

67
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,320
I... I'll be going, then!

68
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,780
<i>If I were to conduct an 
experiment of some kind,</i>

69
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,410
<i>I would first need to let it grow a bit more.</i>

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,170
I investigated for a solid week,

71
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,430
but found nothing out of the ordinary.

72
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,550
It's of interest that his 
mother has gone missing

73
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,970
and that he's a witness in the 
high school girl's murder,

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,630
but he's truly just an average 
high school student.

75
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,110
Yes, that's right.

76
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,280
I understand.

77
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,720
Please continue your investigation.

78
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,330
An "average high school student," huh?

79
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,990
Human powers of observation 
are less than impressive.

80
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,290
However, there are some things 
only humans are capable of.

81
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,250
I could not test him using Shimada Hideo...

82
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,380
But perhaps I'll try something.

83
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,020
Izumi Shinichi, right?

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,340
Who put you up to this?

85
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,000
A... A w-woman...

86
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,170
A woman?

87
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,400
What's her name?

88
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,540
Don't know...

89
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,000
Just met her today, for the first time.

90
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,880
It's the truth!

91
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,270
Yo.

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,590
Kamijo.

93
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,640
Why the gloomy face so early in the morning?

94
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,090
It's not gloomy.

95
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,670
Things going well with your girlfriend?

96
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,200
What things?

97
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,920
Don't play dumb.

98
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,850
You know what I mean.

99
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,780
Cut it out!

100
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,550
Nothing like that's going on.

101
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,660
Stop joking around.

102
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,420
So... I don't really want to get into this,

103
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,770
but you've heard about Izumi-kun, right?

104
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,490
Huh?

105
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,430
I heard he was the first one to find 
the victim in the recent murder,

106
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,830
and he knew the girl who was killed.

107
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,520
Yeah, I know.

108
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,950
What about it?

109
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,680
Did your brother say something?

110
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,890
Not really.

111
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,440
It's just that, even though 
something like that happened,

112
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,890
he's so calm.

113
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,830
He's acting too... normal.

114
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,490
Morning.

115
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,070
B-Bye, Satomi.

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
What's up with her?

117
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,830
Nothing.

118
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,170
<i>Back when he saved my life,</i>

119
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,090
<i>he was also so calm and strong.</i>

120
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>It was like he was someone else.</i>

121
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,990
<i>But was there really nothing going 
on between him and Kana?</i>

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,460
<i>No, that's not the point.</i>

123
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,700
<i>Even if nothing was going on,</i>

124
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,010
<i>isn't he being a bit cold about all this?</i>

125
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,360
Murano?

126
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,400
Sorry, I have to go take care of something.

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,030
Huh? Uh...

128
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,540
Well, it sure was a shock

129
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,870
to see how fast he could move.

130
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,170
I can hardly believe he's human.

131
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,290
And?

132
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,630
Did you notice anything else?

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,740
What do you mean by that?

134
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,280
Well, did anything else seem unnatural?

135
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,210
Was his right hand moving in 
a peculiar way, for example?

136
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,260
Let me think...

137
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,450
No, nothing really stood out.

138
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,870
<i>So some other specific 
change must've occurred.</i>

139
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,780
I wonder what's wrong.

140
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,220
Maybe what happened to 
Kana is getting to Murano.

141
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,120
Yeah, of course it is.

142
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,770
It'd be weirder if it didn't.

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,070
Considering what happened,

144
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm the one who's strange 
for being so calm about it.

145
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,170
It's not normal.

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,230
What are you going on about now?

147
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,430
You're a perfectly fine human being.

148
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,090
You are not like me or my kind.

149
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,110
Hearing <i>you</i> say that makes me lose 
even more confidence in myself.

150
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,380
Either way, our conversation is 
generating a certain amount of noise.

151
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,590
If you talk out loud on top of that,

152
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,380
your father will become 
suspicious of all the noise.

153
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,330
Dad,

154
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,550
I'm going out for a bit.

155
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,410
Don't stay out too late.

156
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,370
I won't.

157
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,600
<i>Where's he off to at this time of night?</i>

158
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,520
<i>If I recall,</i>

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,650
<i>this is the city where the girl was murdered.</i>

160
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,020
<i>Why would the first one to find the victim</i>

161
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,410
<i>go back to the crime scene?</i>

162
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,470
<i>There's something going on.</i>

163
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,450
<i>Given his actions earlier today</i>

164
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,060
<i>and what he's doing now,</i>

165
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,140
<i>Izumi Shinichi has a big secret!</i>

166
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,850
Shinichi, why are we here?

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
I can't explain it well,

168
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,570
but I think it's true

169
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,660
that I now tend to forget painful 
or sad things really quickly.

170
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,230
And is that wrong?

171
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,580
I wasn't like this before.

172
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,650
I used to obsess over the smallest things,

173
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,920
and worry all the time...

174
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,760
Now, that's what I would call a waste of time.

175
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,880
That's not what I mean!

176
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,270
<i>Who is he talking to?</i>

177
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,080
<i>Himself?</i>

178
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,250
I think Kana approached that monster 
because she mistakenly thought it was me.

179
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,480
And it got her killed.

180
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,030
Because of me!

181
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,910
You should stop thinking like that.

182
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,920
No, for her, I want to...

183
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,750
This might be a strange way to put it,

184
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,420
but I want to mourn her death more.

185
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,500
I don't want to forget how 
sad it makes me feel...

186
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,970
As a human being.

187
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,240
Hmm...

188
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,370
M-Monster!

189
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,110
Migi!

190
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,070
What are you trying to do?!

191
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,290
What else? I'm going to kill him!

192
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,570
Wait! Stop!

193
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,900
Get out of here! Hurry!

194
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,410
Shinichi! Don't interfere!

195
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,390
What are you doing?! Run!

196
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,810
I don't have sufficient weight 
to slice him in half.

197
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,570
Not good.

198
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,570
If he gets any further away...

199
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,570
Someone, help!

200
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,020
Tsk.

201
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,590
Migi...

202
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,340
Hey!

203
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,270
Do you comprehend the 
position you're in now?!

204
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,000
We've been seen by a total stranger!

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,580
With a camera, no less!

206
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,880
Run!

207
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Follow him!

208
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,380
And kill him!

209
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,740
No, we can't kill him!

210
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,760
Migi, stop it!

211
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,090
Many humans in your vicinity 
have already died.

212
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,430
What's one more death?

213
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,140
It's to protect ourselves, no less.

214
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,690
There is no reason to hesitate!

215
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,190
I said, "no!"

216
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,040
We can't do this!

217
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,870
I'm tired.

218
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,610
We can't kill a human being,

219
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,160
no matter what the reason!

220
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,520
He got away.

221
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,340
It's too late to catch up with him now.

222
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,680
You took a while.

223
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,500
Did something happen?

224
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,180
No.

225
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,760
Nothing happened.

226
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,030
I hope not.

227
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,120
That male

228
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,330
appears to have been targeting you 
specifically in his investigations.

229
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,650
It means that, although 
he knows a lot about us,

230
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,000
we know nothing about him.

231
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,110
<i>If he's a journalist,</i>

232
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,810
<i>or, say, a cop or someone 
with the government,</i>

233
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,660
<i>we're finished.</i>

234
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,970
<i>We will become lab rats, without a doubt.</i>

235
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,370
<i>Lab rats...</i>

236
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,230
Izumi-kun...

237
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,080
<i>You monster!</i>

238
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,090
<i>Did </i>you<i> eat people?!</i>

239
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,830
<i>Ugh!</i>

240
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,960
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

241
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,460
<i>Izumi Shinichi is a parasite!</i>

242
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,830
<i>What, Izumi?!</i>

243
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,670
<i>Izumi?!</i>

244
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,970
<i>Izumi!</i>

245
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,070
Izumi!

246
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,340
Hey, Izumi!

247
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,640
Read the next page.

248
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,720
Weren't you listening?

249
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,990
Sheesh.

250
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,150
If you don't want to be here, just go home.

251
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,970
Izumi!

252
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,990
Hey, he actually left.

253
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,100
Izumi-kun...

254
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,520
<i>They'll come.</i>

255
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,490
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

256
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,220
<i>Someone will come to make me into a lab rat.</i>

257
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,220
But before that happens, one 
of my kind may terminate us.

258
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,500
Either way,

259
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,220
Deleted.
Back

260
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,140
we will suffer consequences.

261
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,950
<i>What should I...</i>

262
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,850
<i>What should I do?</i>

263
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,860
<i>Maybe if I cut off this arm now, 
while Migi's asleep...</i>

264
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,360
<i>As if I could do that.</i>

265
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,250
<i>Who was he?</i>

266
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,920
<i>Who's after me...</i>

267
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,750
<i>After us?</i>

268
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,290
<i>Could he still be watching 
us today, right now?</i>

269
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,450
Mom, this way!

270
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,450
Wait, Saki-chan.

271
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,050
Moving on to traffic updates...

272
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,390
Delivery!

273
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,970
Wait!

274
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,730
Listen!

275
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,830
Please, hear me out!

276
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,830
Why?

277
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,120
Why is this happening?

278
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,840
<i>Why is all this happening to me?</i>

279
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,190
<i>I can always calm down right away.</i>

280
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,350
<i>That's how my heart works now.</i>

281
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,570
<i>There's no going back now.</i>

282
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,290
<i>If that's the case, I might as well...</i>

283
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,490
What's wrong?

284
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,620
Why'd you ask to see me out of the blue?

285
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,780
Well, um...

286
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,710
About Tachikawa...

287
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,370
Huh?

288
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,750
I mean, um...

289
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,530
She seems back to her old cheerful self,

290
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,000
and she managed to avoid 
getting a scar on her face.

291
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,660
You called me out here just to say that?

292
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,420
Oh, um, not really.

293
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,380
I wanted to talk to you, that's all.

294
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,020
It's like you don't expect us to meet again.

295
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,250
Th-That's not true.

296
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,150
Izumi-kun, you seem like 
your mind is muddled.

297
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,780
I feel kind of muddled, too, actually .

298
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,890
Can I start?

299
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,720
Sure.

300
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,010
I've been trying not to dwell on it,

301
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,850
but I can't help myself.

302
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,790
It's about Kana-san.

303
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,430
You canceled our date that day

304
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,150
to go meet with Kana-san, right?

305
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,000
It must've been important.

306
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,170
At least, more important 
than seeing a movie with me.

307
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,940
I've been wanting to talk to you 
about a lot of things, butâ€”

308
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,690
Why don't you?!

309
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,620
Why don't you tell me everything?!

310
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,190
You should just tell me everything!

311
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Izumi-kun, something has 
been bothering you, right?

312
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,760
Something besides the thing with Kana-san.

313
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,940
That's not...

314
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,720
I can tell!

315
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,620
It's got you so worried

316
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,210
that not even someone dying

317
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,530
is that big of a deal to you anymore, is it?

318
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,770
That's...

319
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,010
That's not true.

320
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,370
Izumi-kun, you're strong.

321
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,980
You're really strong.

322
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,770
But sometimes, I can barely 
stand to watch you.

323
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,890
You're so desperate to 
keep <i>something</i> in check.

324
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,610
So... What happened?

325
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,920
Don't try so hard to go it alone.

326
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,320
Talk to me.

327
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,830
Murano...

328
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,720
Nothing!

329
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,710
Nothing's going on!

330
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,500
Huh?

331
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,500
How can I believe that nothing's going on?!

332
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,880
I can't even talk to you if 
you're going to be like this!

333
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,640
<i>Don't say that.</i>

334
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,390
<i>If even you say that to me, I...</i>

335
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,640
<i>I... I'll tell you!</i>

336
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,230
<i>I'll tell you, okay?</i>

337
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>Satomi!</i>

338
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,480
<i>My body...</i>

339
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,610
<i>My body has a...</i>

340
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,910
Seriously, nothing's going on.

341
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,490
I guess you don't trust me at all.

342
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,170
I can't do anything about the 
fact that you won't believe me.

343
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,000
Izumi-kun, your eyes...

344
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,720
They're so empty.

345
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,110
The Selfish Gene

346
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,880
Next time:

347
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,150
"The Selfish Gene."
