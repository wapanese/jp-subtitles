1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,670
<i>Someone on Earth had a sudden thought.</i>

2
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:56,700
Parasyte

3
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,700
The Maxim

4
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,390
Metamorphosis

5
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,890
How unfortunate...

6
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,810
I failed.

7
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,480
How unfortunate.

8
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,320
What's... unfortunate?

9
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,480
Shut up!

10
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,320
I guess I was dreaming...

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,370
I feel like I didn't sleep too well.

12
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,940
Hm?

13
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,050
Did you find the "snake"?

14
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,470
It feels kind of numb.

15
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,270
Because you tied your earphone 
cord around it while half-asleep.

16
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,480
Sorry. I'll just have some toast.

17
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,760
No, you need to have a proper breakfast.

18
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,520
I was really shook up last night.

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,830
That's my line.

20
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,810
Ah, hot!

21
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,440
It's just a spider.

22
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,070
When are you going to get over 
that fear of bugs, Shinichi?

23
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,570
The Japanese government

24
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,580
has proposed three reform measures to address

25
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,110
The Ja-pa-nese govern-ment has pro-posed...

26
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,550
the ongoing global economic crisis, said to 
be the worst since the Great Depression,

27
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,310
Dad?

28
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,570
Where's Mom?

29
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,720
at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting.

30
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm hungry.

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,870
Dad?

32
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,680
However, the Chinese government has 
lashed out against the proposal

33
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,680
Where's Mom?

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,720
and the Council is in a heated debate.

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm hungry.

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,790
It is expected to take some time 
before a resolution is reached.

37
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,280
Next up in the news...

38
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,000
Gotcha!

39
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,990
Huh?

40
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,970
Murano?!

41
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,970
That was so fake.

42
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
Wh-What was?

43
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,140
You knew I was coming up 
behind you, didn't you?

44
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,750
No, no way!

45
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,320
Huh?

46
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,840
Huh?

47
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,190
Wh-Whoa!

48
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,380
Th-This is just a misunderstanding!

49
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,700
I mean, um...

50
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,710
You idiot!

51
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Why'd you do that?

52
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,950
Tachikawa...

53
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,650
I have no idea.

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,470
I really don't.

55
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,260
Is something wrong with your right hand?

56
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,760
Oh...

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,550
No.

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,340
It's nothing.

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,050
Ow!

60
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,980
A snake!

61
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,060
Ow!

62
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,610
I-It burrowed into my hand?!

63
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,690
I-It's climbing up my arm?!

64
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,430
What's wrong, Shinichi?!

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,780
Help!

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
What are you doing?

67
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,090
Why'd you tie up your arm?

68
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,850
A snake!

69
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,670
A snake's in my arm!

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,000
What?

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,870
A snake?

72
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,960
Wow.

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,070
You take being half-asleep to a new level.

74
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm serious!

75
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,050
It made a hole in my hand and burrowed in!

76
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,550
Yeah?

77
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,990
So where's this hole, huh?

78
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,460
Look! It's right—

79
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,800
Huh?!

80
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,570
Shinichi, you'd better not be on drugs.

81
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,440
Of course I'm not!

82
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,940
Oh, really now, dear.

83
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,680
Weird...

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,460
It doesn't hurt or anything.

85
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,850
<i>I wonder if that weird creature 
is actually inside my hand...</i>

86
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,210
Izumi-kun!

87
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,790
Playing games during class?

88
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,300
Whatever you were up to,

89
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,570
you know smartphone use 
isn't allowed during class.

90
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,920
But I had it turned off... and...

91
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,790
Oh?

92
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,440
Sorry.

93
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,250
Oh, Murano. About this morning...

94
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,880
Man, she's pretty mad.

95
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,210
Okay, fine.

96
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,830
Out of kindness to an old friend,

97
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,450
I'll go apologize for you.

98
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,700
Really? Thanks a lot.

99
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,510
But what about you? Are you okay?

100
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,830
You've been acting strange all day.

101
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,830
Yeah...

102
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,430
I feel a little off.

103
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,340
I'll talk to the teacher 
and ask to go home early.

104
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>I wonder if it's possible for 
your hand to move on its own.</i>

105
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,720
<i>But if this has anything to do with that 
weird creature I saw last night...</i>

106
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,580
Misaki!

107
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,550
Misaki...

108
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,820
Thank goodness...

109
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,970
Dating 12 Women!!
Popular athlete in 
shocking sex scandal!

110
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,070
Shinichi?

111
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,810
He's home early.

112
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,660
Are you even my own right hand?

113
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm going to test you.

114
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,110
You'd better not dodge...

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,970
How... un... fortunate.

116
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,130
Wha—

117
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,480
I... right hand... fail.

118
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,510
F-Fail?

119
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,980
What about my right hand?

120
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,820
I... a-ate it...

121
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,580
Not... talk good... yet...

122
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,740
Teach me... Shinichi.

123
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,050
What <i>are</i> you?

124
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,320
Tired...

125
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,390
Sleep.

126
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,340
Huh?!

127
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,520
Hang on a second!

128
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,390
I have tons of question I want to ask you!

129
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:46,730
Hey!

130
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,150
Hey, c'mon!

131
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,020
Shinichi?

132
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,480
Is something wrong?

133
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,480
Shinichi, did you hear me?

134
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,740
Don't come in!

135
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,940
Nothing's wrong.

136
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,750
talking right hand

137
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,250
talking right hand

138
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,380
talking right hand w

139
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,540
talking right hand we

140
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:12,670
talking right hand wei

141
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:12,840
talking right hand weir

142
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,000
talking right hand weird

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,210
talking right hand weird s

144
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,380

talking right hand weird snak

147
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,130
talking right hand weird snake

148
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,890
burrow into human

149
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,390
There's nothing that seems relevant.

150
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,430
So I guess no one else has had this problem.

151
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,650
Shinichi, dinner's ready!

152
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,750
I got a call from the school.

153
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,730
They said you left early.

154
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,650
Did something happen?

155
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,730
Not really...

156
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,120
I just didn't feel well.

157
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
Are you okay?

158
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,170
Yeah...

159
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,240
Oh, you're having seconds?

160
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,860
That's unusual.

161
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,590
So you don't feel well, 
but you do have an appetite?

162
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,200
I feel better now.

163
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,160
Does it matter?

164
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,150
<i>I can't tell Mom or Dad about my right hand.</i>

165
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,210
I love you, love you, love ya lots!

166
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,230
Wall slam!

167
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,540
Oops... I had a bit too much...

168
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,780
Drank too much...

169
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,110
Nakamura-san, your laundry...

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,970
<i>No... I can't tell anyone about this.</i>

171
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,530
<i>Even if I went to the cops, 
they'd just think I'm crazy.</i>

172
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,760
<i>If they ran tests at a hospital,</i>

173
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,900
<i>there'd be a huge uproar.</i>

174
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,400
<i>What should I do?</i>

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,900
<i>Hey, wake up already.</i>

176
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,370
It's morning?

177
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,490
It's morning...

178
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,110
It's finally morning, and still...

179
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,600
I'm stuck in a nightmare.

180
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,060
What are you doing?

181
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,720
Just what it looks like.

182
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,820
I'm studying.

183
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,060
Oh, you can talk normally now?

184
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,230
So what are you, anyway?

185
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,830
Don't tell me you're an alien?

186
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,300
"Alien"?

187
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,490
What's that?

188
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,460
That snake-like thing is what 
you really look like, right?

189
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,630
I won't deny that none of the biology 
books I checked had anything about me.

190
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,140
Did you really come from outer space?

191
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,630
I don't know where I came from.

192
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,600
The earliest memory I have

193
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,610
is the sense of how unfortunate it 
was that I couldn't take the brain.

194
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,270
"The brain"?

195
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,580
You don't mean...

196
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,080
Are you going after my brain next?

197
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,550
If that were possible,
I would have done so already.

198
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,820
But it's not.

199
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,070
It's too late now that I've matured 
without having eaten your brain.

200
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,870
It's quite unfortunate.

201
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,080
What would've happened if you'd 
succeeded in taking my brain?

202
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,790
You probably would have become

203
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,460
a life form resembling a human, 
but with a head that morphs.

204
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,070
Gross.

205
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,890
Why me, anyway?

206
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,110
Coincidence.

207
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,070
I didn't choose you specifically.

208
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,710
I guess I have to go to a 
hospital now, uproar or not.

209
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,930
Why would you do that?

210
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,100
To have them cut you off.

211
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,860
That would be undesirable.

212
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,820
I feed on the nutrients carried by 
your bloodstream to survive.

213
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,610
So, if I were to be cut off,

214
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,490
I would shrivel up and die.

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,710
Plus, you would lose your right hand.

216
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,200
It'd be a loss for both of us.

217
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,170
"Both of us"?!

218
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,790
You're the one who ate my right 
hand without even asking first!

219
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,100
How about this?

220
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,590
I'll fine tune the circuitry 
so that, while I'm asleep,

221
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,800
you can control the hand just like before.

222
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,550
What?

223
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,150
That's sufficient, no?

224
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,920
Moving forward, we should 
cooperate and coexist.

225
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,560
That is our only option.

226
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,340
Wha—

227
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,200
Who said you get to decide?!

228
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep.

229
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,140
Wait a minute!

230
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,470
You always do that when things 
get inconvenient for you!

231
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,430
Use me with care...

232
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,310
And I'm supposed to clean this up?

233
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
Where's my bacon and eggs?

234
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,990
You said you didn't want any yesterday.

235
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,920
You said I should have a 
proper breakfast, right?

236
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,010
Can I have more toast, too?

237
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,410
You're so fickle.

238
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,460
Violent incidents are happening
 all over the nation.

239
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,640
Another murder?

240
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,400
Yeah.

241
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,460
A mother and her daughter were killed.

242
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,970
Not only were their bodies in terrible shape,

243
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,740
but it also seems the father is 
the killer, and now he's missing.

244
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,360
There was also a dismembering in Osaka,

245
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,660
and a murder in Miyagi where the 
body was hung up like laundry.

246
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,990
Not when we're eating, Dear.

247
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,990
Oops, sorry.

248
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,860
Hey, Shinichi, look.

249
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,430
You're fine with them now?

250
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,100
Fine with what?

251
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,780
But, you and bugs...

252
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,510
This is a different route from yesterday.

253
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,390
You're awake?

254
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,950
Where are you going?

255
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,830
I decided to talk to the police.

256
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,340
Don't do that.

257
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,020
You'll be isolated and turned into an 
experimental subject, or a sample.

258
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,090
Either way, you won't be able 
to lead a normal life anymore.

259
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,650
What should I do, then?

260
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,170
I already told you this morning.

261
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,400
To cooperate and coexist is our only—

262
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,190
Stop!

263
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,350
Not so loud!

264
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,890
One of mine is close.

265
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,850
What?!

266
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,540
"One of mine" as in another of my species.

267
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,830
What did you say?!

268
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,570
Wait, how can you tell?

269
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,740
I can sense something like brain waves.

270
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,490
It's my first time sensing it,
but I can tell it's one of mine.

271
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,240
It's about 200 meters straight that way.

272
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,780
There are other people who went 
through the same thing as me?

273
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,090
Right.

274
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,410
Go right.

275
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,490
Shinichi?

276
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,990
Okay.

277
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,020
Turn left up ahead.

278
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,720
It seems the other has sensed me, too.

279
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,790
What's wrong?

280
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,660
Go.

281
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,690
You said it's one of you...

282
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,760
Could it be a person who's 
had his brain taken over?

283
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,990
Possibly.

284
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,590
No way.

285
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,820
That's creepy as hell.

286
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,290
I need to know what exactly I am.

287
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,250
That information should be 
valuable to you, as well.

288
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,730
F-Fine.

289
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,200
Twenty meters more.

290
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,260
It's around that corner.

291
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,560
It seems to be eating.

292
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,260
What?

293
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,400
A... A dog's eating another dog?!

294
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,660
You also... failed?

295
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,500
Please stop talking.

296
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,470
You... with your location... in your host.

297
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,900
Me... with my animal host.

298
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,430
Both... dissatisfied.

299
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,710
Run!

300
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,340
What?!

301
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,670
Run! Hurry!

302
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,100
What the hell? You told me to go there, 
and now you tell me to run?!

303
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,940
I sensed that it wants to kill you!

304
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,480
It harbors an intense suspicion toward 
you, because you are still human.

305
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,220
It intends to fight.

306
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,030
We'll fight here.

307
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,750
What?!

308
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,290
Fight?!

309
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,160
If it kills you, I'll die, too.

310
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,930
Here it comes.

311
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,430
What the...

312
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,930
You've gotta be kidding me!

313
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,900
That's way out of line!

314
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,540
I-Is that its heart?

315
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,650
Look.

316
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,540
It's about to die.

317
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,090
It was living off the dog's organs and 
digestive system, as I'd suspected.

318
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,550
I had no idea there were more of you...

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,090
Its core was only the head.

320
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,030
It controls the rest of the body by seizing control of the nervous system,

321
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,950
but because the core itself 
morphed into wings,

322
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,100
its focus was dispersed, 
creating a gap in its defenses.

323
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,940
And you'd finally found one of your own kind...

324
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,210
A dog, huh?

325
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,350
I suppose it's partially due 
to its maturation environment,

326
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,930
but it was negligent with its studies.

327
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,530
That's why I was victorious.

328
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,120
<i>It's like I'm talking with an insect</i>

329
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,110
<i>that doesn't have a shred of empathy.</i>

330
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,220
Shinichi, it's cold.

331
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,090
2 Days Ago

332
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,420
<i>Someone on Earth had a sudden thought.</i>

333
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,200
<i>"Life must be protected."</i>

334
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,490
Next time:

335
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,030
Demon in the Flesh

336
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,270
"Demon in the Flesh."
