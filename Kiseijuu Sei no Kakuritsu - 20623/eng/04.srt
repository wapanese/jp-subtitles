1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,340
Was that meant to be a barricade?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,860
You've only cut off your escape route.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,120
Just give up!

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,260
Without total control over 
that body, you cannot win.

5
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,680
Parasyte

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,680
The Maxim

7
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,860
Aside from your right hand,

8
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,040
Disheveled Hair

9
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,630
your entire body is useless, 
terrified of any pain.

10
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,990
If you become flustered and hold me back,

11
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,510
we will lose.

12
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,190
<i>Flustered?</i>

13
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,720
<i>Is he trying to get me flustered?</i>

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,020
<i>Migi...</i>

15
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>No, I can't just stay scared.</i>

16
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,920
<i>They're so fast, I can't see anything.</i>

17
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,050
<i>Can I really do this?</i>

18
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,630
We delegate roles.

19
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,700
I'll pretend to attack, 
but I'll focus on defense.

20
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,790
That'll make my defense 
practically impenetrable.

21
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,750
Then who's going to attack?

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,250
That'll have to be you, of course.

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,180
Me?

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,170
What A's actions thus far have told me

25
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,310
is that he underestimates human ability.

26
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,930
A will be cautious toward me,

27
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,420
but he most likely will not have 
factored in your abilities at all.

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,580
That is our advantage.

29
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,190
I will be defense and you will be offense.

30
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,970
That is the most effective delegation of roles.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,450
<i>Slowly approach him...</i>

32
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,080
<i>Slowly, as if I'm being 
dragged toward him by Migi.</i>

33
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,400
<i>Trust Migi.</i>

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,270
<i>His defense is impeccable.</i>

35
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,760
<i>That's right, Shinichi.</i>

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,230
<i>What we can do that A cannot</i>

37
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,640
<i>is division of labor.</i>

38
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,680
<i>It's just like Migi said.</i>

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,480
<i>A doesn't think I'm capable 
of doing anything.</i>

40
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,310
<i>All right!</i>

41
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
<i>I'm going to do this.</i>

42
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,530
<i>But he's still human from 
the neck down, right?</i>

43
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,160
<i>It's either him or us.</i>

44
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,810
What is this pipe?

45
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,430
A t-table leg?

46
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,210
We did it.

47
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,270
That much blood means it's fatal.

48
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,860
Impossible...

49
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,030
The weak, cowardly human attacked?

50
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,170
Wait.

51
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,780
Let's see what he'll do.

52
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,420
He seems to be in turmoil.

53
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,700
<i>He got an artery close to the heart.</i>

54
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,250
<i>I must stop the bleeding.</i>

55
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,090
I see.

56
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,650
Pushing the pipe through his 
back gets rid of the "spout."

57
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,990
All right.

58
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,090
Go after him.

59
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's finish him.

60
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,920
N-No!

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,450
I've had enough!

62
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,560
But we shouldn't leave him like that.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,700
If we take this any further, 
I'll become a murderer!

64
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,890
That is not a person.

65
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,710
<i>I'm going to be killed by a human?</i>

66
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,590
<i>Me?</i>

67
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,320
<i>It can't be...</i>

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,210
<i>It makes no sense.</i>

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,710
<i>It's over...</i>

70
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,220
<i>This body is useless now.</i>

71
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,050
<i>I have to relocate.</i>

72
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,870
<i>I don't know if it'll work, but...</i>

73
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,010
<i>Tamiya Ryoko...</i>

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,090
<i>I will share her host.</i>

75
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,110
<i>Where is she?</i>

76
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,620
The police are here!

77
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,000
Science Lab

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,620
<i>Five more meters...</i>

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,930
Oxygen

80
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,930
Oxygen

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,290
Killer Invades High School

82
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,720
How is Shinichi?

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
He still won't get out of bed.

84
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,560
Well, I'm just glad he wasn't hurt.

85
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,260
<i>I can still remember what 
it felt like to stab him.</i>

86
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,770
<i>As time passed and life settled down again,</i>

87
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,060
Identity of Suspect "A" 
in Murder Spree 
Remains Unknown

88
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,880
<i>the school reopened and classes resumed.</i>

89
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,230
<i>Tamiya Ryoko, who most likely killed A,</i>

90
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,120
<i>continues to teach as 
though nothing's changed.</i>

91
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,100
<i>I haven't heard any reports 
of murders in her vicinity,</i>

92
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,650
<i>but she must still be killing.</i>

93
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,370
<i>We can't just let her keep 
doing whatever she wants.</i>

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Staff Conference Room

95
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, how should I put this?

96
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,560
Tamiya-sensei.

97
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,720
Regarding the fact that 
you are... uh, expecting...

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,590
While that is a joyous occasion in itself...

99
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,540
You're a teacher!

100
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,060
And you're unmarried,

101
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,850
and you can't even say who the father is?

102
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,670
I hope it's not that you 
don't know who the father is,

103
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,810
rather than being unable to tell us.

104
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,350
This was unexpected.

105
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,530
I didn't think it would end this way.

106
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,020
I don't want to attract attention 
over something like this.

107
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm done being Tamiya Ryoko.

108
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,050
W-Wait, Tamiya-sensei.

109
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,090
Let's kill Tamiya Ryoko.

110
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,170
I doubt we can win.

111
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,780
Besides, the child within her

112
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,370
is undeniably a human.

113
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,790
Would you be able to kill that baby?

114
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,570
Tamiya Ryoko is no more.

115
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,820
Now there is no particular reason 
to keep the humans around me,

116
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,490
including you, alive.

117
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,790
Why do you kill people?

118
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,720
My right hand is being 
kept alive by my blood.

119
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,360
That means it's surviving on 
normal food for humans.

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,710
Shouldn't the rest of you be able to 
live without eating humans, too?

121
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,860
It's possible, I suppose.

122
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,170
Th-Then...

123
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,410
Flies know how to fly without being taught.

124
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,050
Spiders know how to spin 
webs without being taught.

125
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,980
Why is that?

126
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,130
That's...

127
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,980
Here's what I think:

128
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Flies and spiders are simply 
following a directive.

129
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,610
I believe all life on Earth has 
received a directive of some kind.

130
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,620
What are you talking about?

131
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,300
Do you get it?

132
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,420
So humans have no directive?

133
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,550
Like I said, what are you talking about?

134
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,870
You mean, like, from a god?

135
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,430
When I took over this human's brain,

136
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,630
I received a directive.

137
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,640
It said, "Devour this species."

138
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,110
T-Tell me one thing.

139
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,920
The child you're carrying...

140
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,500
What will you do with it?

141
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,330
I'll give birth to it.

142
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,610
I'm sure I can use it in some experiment.

143
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,380
If I have no use for it, I'll eat it.

144
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,880
Calm down, Shinichi!

145
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,770
We should not engage at this distance.

146
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,590
You're getting on my nerves.

147
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,230
Die.

148
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,350
Shit!

149
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,290
<i>As I thought, she has at 
least two morph patterns.</i>

150
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,930
<i>Not good.</i>

151
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,210
Although it's minimal, you're no longer pure.

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,770
Interesting...

153
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,500
I won't kill you, after all.

154
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,590
H-Hey!

155
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,310
Ryoko!

156
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,250
What's going on with you?

157
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,940
I got a call from your school, so I rushed over!

158
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,750
<i>She must be Tamiya Ryoko's mother.</i>

159
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,510
Sorry, but I have somewhere I need to be.

160
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,090
Can we talk about this later?

161
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,580
Ryoko...

162
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,060
It's nearby, so I'll be back soon.

163
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,840
Wait!

164
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,960
Turn around!

165
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,560
Wh-Who...

166
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,310
Who are you?

167
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,120
It...

168
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,470
It can't be...

169
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,350
No!

170
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,390
Ryoko.

171
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,830
Where is Ryoko?!

172
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,070
Where is she?!

173
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,940
Where'd you put her?!

174
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,230
Oh, no!

175
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,450
I h-have to call the police!

176
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,300
<i>She saw through me in mere moments.</i>

177
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,210
<i>My face and voice should be practically
 indistinguishable from Tamiya Ryoko, yet...</i>

178
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,200
<i>I don't understand.</i>

179
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,470
<i>I doubt this woman had any 
special ability, but...</i>

180
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,230
Migi?

181
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,490
Don't scare me, Shinichi.

182
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,750
What? Y-You...

183
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,110
What's the matter?!

184
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,250
Why did you yell?

185
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,570
Oh, um, a dream! I had a dream!

186
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,010
Man, it was horrible.

187
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,580
Go splash some water on your face.

188
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,430
What are you doing?!

189
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,720
Well, at most it's only three minutes

190
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,470
that I can separate from you.

191
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,540
What was that, a morning walk?

192
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,620
Not a walk.

193
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,210
It was a mobility experiment.

194
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,980
Mobility?

195
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,480
Wait a minute, are you 
going to take over my head?

196
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,030
I told you, I can't do that.

197
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,810
Now that I've matured without eating a brain,

198
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,060
I don't know how to control the entire body.

199
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,040
But perhaps I should give it a try, regardless?

200
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,640
I... I was just joking.

201
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,170
Hey, hang on.

202
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,520
So those of you who've taken over the brain

203
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,100
can technically swap heads?

204
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,340
In theory, yes.

205
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,570
But there can be rejection,

206
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,470
and besides, swapping heads is too dangerous.

207
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,620
I doubt anyone would bother.

208
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,640
A trip?

209
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,500
Yeah, I can finally take some time off.

210
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,790
You'll be holding down the fort for a while.

211
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,490
Your father's such a workaholic.

212
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,810
We've barely gone on any trips together.

213
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,870
But isn't that risky?

214
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,620
You mean because of the Mincemeat Murders?

215
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,470
There haven't been as many recently,

216
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,120
so I don't think there's any need to worry.

217
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,060
That's just what it looks like on the surface.

218
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,250
Why wander around somewhere you've 
never been in times like these?

219
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,530
Are you against it?

220
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,510
Yeah.

221
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,220
Don't tell me you think you'll 
be too lonely staying home

222
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,020
even though you're in twelfth grade.

223
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,350
That's not it!

224
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,140
That's not the reason! It's that they...

225
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,030
"They"?

226
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,540
N-Never mind.

227
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,350
Shinichi, if you're really against it,

228
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,740
we can cancel.

229
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,280
Come now, Honey.

230
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,570
But...

231
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,540
There's something that's been 
bothering me for a while.

232
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,290
Is there something troubling you?

233
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,900
N-No, nothing really.

234
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,390
One of your friends, maybe? Or...

235
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,670
There's nothing, okay?

236
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,450
I have to go to school.

237
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,720
Shinichi.

238
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,090
I shouldn't need to remind you, but...

239
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,100
I know.

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,380
<i>If I told my parents about my right hand,</i>

241
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,600
<i>there's no telling what Migi might do.</i>

242
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,580
<i>He only tries to protect me</i>

243
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,880
<i>because I am his lifeline.</i>

244
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,410
<i>But my parents are a different story.</i>

245
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,990
<i>He'll get rid of them without 
a moment's hesitation.</i>

246
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,310
<i>Migi is not capable of affection.</i>

247
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,220
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>

248
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,000
<i>Migi is no different from A or Tamiya Ryoko.</i>

249
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,280
He's hiding something.

250
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,540
Of course he is.

251
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,410
He's in twelfth grade.

252
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,970
It would only be natural for him to 
be keeping a few secrets from us.

253
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,830
Hell, I'd say he's been 
<i>too</i> good of a kid until now.

254
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,230
He didn't even really have a rebellious phase.

255
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,730
Really?

256
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,200
It could be because of that scar, actually.

257
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,250
What?

258
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,840
Surely not.

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,860
That was so long ago.

260
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,650
Hey, Mom!

261
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,040
Give me a silver plate!

262
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,980
Silver plate?

263
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,590
I'm gonna use it for a science 
experiment in class tomorrow!

264
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,710
Oh, by silver,

265
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,430
you mean the aluminum foil plates?

266
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,970
Yeah, those!

267
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,150
Well, they're up on top of that,

268
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,990
but I'm making tempura right now,

269
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,740
so wait until I'm doneâ€”

270
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,600
I can get it!

271
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,190
H-Hang on, Shinichi.

272
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,550
Watch out!

273
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,570
Ow!

274
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,280
Are you all right, Shinichi?!

275
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,790
Did any oil get on you?!

276
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,100
Nothing hot hit you?

277
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,710
Did you get burned?!

278
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,420
N-No.

279
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,650
Nobuko, your hand...

280
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,220
Huh?

281
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,690
Ouch.

282
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,070
Your mom's hurting more.

283
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,520
Huh?

284
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,050
So I shouldn't be that worried?

285
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,690
Yes. Consider the probability.

286
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,320
My kind tends to congregate in urban 
areas where food is plentiful.

287
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,950
Not to mention, they tend to 
target solitary individuals.

288
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,110
If the two of them are taking 
a trip to the countryside,

289
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,080
they should be even safer than they are now.

290
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,330
I see.

291
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,370
Then I guess I shouldn't 
have been so against it.

292
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,380
Shinichi.

293
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,320
Wh-Wh-What?

294
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,340
Were you talking to someone just now?

295
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,260
J-Just to myself!

296
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,340
What'd you need, anyway?

297
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,850
Um, well, dinner's almost ready.

298
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh, okay.

299
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,940
I'll be down in a bit.

300
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,820
Oh, and Mom?

301
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,980
Please knock before you 
open the door next time!

302
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,430
Don't forget, okay?

303
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,480
Okay...

304
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,310
Excuse me.

305
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,760
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.

306
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,690
A heart attack?

307
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,490
That would be inconvenient.

308
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,760
Shinichi yelled at me.

309
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,630
What, was he spanking the 
monkey or something?

310
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,160
Um, I said this morning that 
I was against your trip,

311
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,390
but I take that back.

312
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,570
I think it's good to get away 
from the crowd sometimes

313
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,870
and go relax somewhere with fresh air.

314
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,690
So, when do you leave?

315
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,280
I don't get it.

316
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,660
I don't get you, Shinichi.

317
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,750
What's going on with you?

318
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,170
You were so against it this morning.

319
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,240
What was that about?

320
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,990
And now, you've done a total 180!

321
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,300
So now you don't even care about your parents?

322
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,440
Th-That's not true.

323
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,550
Mom, what's up with you?

324
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,370
I just don't get it.

325
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,870
I don't get what's going on with you!

326
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,730
Something's... Something's changed.

327
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,620
It's like...

328
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,240
It's like you're not my son...

329
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,300
Nobuko.

330
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,940
Please tell me!

331
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,860
What's happened to you?

332
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,450
Shinichi.

333
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,450
I... I thought I'd be lonely.

334
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,350
At least, I did this morning.

335
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,850
But when I talked to my friends 
about it, they laughed at me.

336
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,470
So I thought things over.

337
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,940
That's why I'm fine now.

338
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,500
If I get lonely, I can just invite a friend over.

339
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,020
That's really all it was.

340
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,620
Th-That's enough, right?

341
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,990
They said it'd be a while 
before the taxi arrives.

342
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,590
You know, this might be the first 
time we've been gone for so long.

343
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,330
Back when we lived in an apartment, 
we didn't have that luxury.

344
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,360
Things were tough back then.

345
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,220
Come to think of it, I also 
got this burn back then.

346
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,850
All right, take care.

347
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,850
Oh, I will!

348
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,810
Don't forget to turn off the 
stove and lock the door.

349
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,770
Right.

350
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,520
And don't worry about us.

351
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,100
Okay.

352
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,380
See you!

353
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,780
It moved...

354
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,030
The Stranger

355
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,300
Next time:

356
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,290
"The Stranger."
