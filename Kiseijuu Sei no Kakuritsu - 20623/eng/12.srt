1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,870
<i>That dream again...</i>

2
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,690
Parasyte

3
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,690
The Maxim

4
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,350
There's certainly a wide 
variety of types, isn't there?

5
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,490
Kokoro

6
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,490
Tamiya Ryoko, the teacher, 
was already a surprise,

7
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,190
but now we have a politician.

8
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,270
He can't possibly get elected without 
a solid grasp of human psychology.

9
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,520
He won't get elected.

10
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,150
He'll show his true colors soon enough.

11
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,410
Wait... Given the town he's in,

12
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,880
Tamiya Ryoko may be involved, too.

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,980
Then is there a connection between 
him and Shimada Hideo, as well?

14
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,830
<i>You're way too worked up over this...</i>

15
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,060
That would mean...

16
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,780
What's his goal?

17
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,290
Yes, exactly!

18
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:36,050
Hirokawa Takeshi

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,300
The first possibility is, 
by assuming a human identity

20
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,500
and studying mankind,

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,050
he developed a real interest in politics...

22
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,200
If that is the case,

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,050
he may actually become a decent mayor.

24
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,550
No way.

25
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,640
The second possibility is,

26
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,060
he wants to secure a safe haven 
and food source for parasites.

27
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,430
You have a point.

28
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,730
Even if they hide the body after they feed,

29
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,890
that still results in missing persons.

30
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,760
If they happen to kill a celebrity,

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,060
there'd be an uproar.

32
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,990
Attaining a position with access 
to information is more advantageous

33
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,690
for preventing such occurrences 
and securing a food source.

34
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,700
So that's his goal...

35
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,190
<i>If they organize,</i>

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,400
<i>they'll become even more dangerous.</i>

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,240
<i>That'd put her at risk, too.</i>

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,500
But it is at the municipal level

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,730
that environmental issues can be 
addressed in a practical sense.

40
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,800
Let's go over there.

41
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,920
That wasn't where we agreed to meet up.

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,260
Why were you there?

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,760
I had a strong feeling that you were there.

44
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,970
I told you not to approach even 
if you had that sensation.

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,170
But it wasn't just you.

46
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,710
I could sense it from the people behind you, too.

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,400
I'd say there were four or five of them.

48
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,370
<i>Migi said there were eight,</i>

49
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,290
<i>so her ability to sense parasites 
isn't as strong as theirs.</i>

50
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,860
<i>But this places her in too much danger.</i>

51
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,410
Shinichi.

52
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,430
Whoa!

53
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,700
What are you thinking about?

54
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,420
N-Nothing!

55
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,500
It's none of your business 
what I'm thinking about.

56
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,130
I was just curious.

57
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,530
Hirokawa Takeshi 
Candidate for Mayoral Election

58
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,530
Energize
Higashi Fukuyama!

59
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,380
From where I stand,

60
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:19,400
Hirokawa Takeshi 
Candidate for Mayoral Election

61
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:19,400
Energize
Higashi Fukuyama!

62
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,740
I would prefer that you do not 
become involved any further.

63
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,100
Even if we were to fight them, we would lose.

64
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,880
I didn't come here to fight.

65
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,810
I just want to know how many 
of them have gathered here.

66
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,400
It's impossible to count their numbers.

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,910
An estimate is fine.

68
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,770
Aren't you curious to know how 
others of your kind have evolved?

69
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,910
Well, sure.

70
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,730
Well?

71
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,380
It's only when you go looking for 
them that you can't find them.

72
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,510
Oh, Izumi!

73
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,700
Hi.

74
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,050
What's up?

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,430
I want to ask you something.

76
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,930
Huh?

77
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,690
About your "superpower"...

78
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,690
Have you ever felt that sensation 
from anyone other than me?

79
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,220
Huh?

80
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,690
Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,610
But only sometimes.

82
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,010
When I find them, they sometimes 
turn out to be a random old dude.

83
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,980
Sorry to sound like a broken record,

84
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,150
but I want you to keep your distance

85
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,790
even if you feel that "signal."

86
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,950
But why?

87
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,660
Is it because it's coming 
from those "parasites"

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,150
that everyone's talking about online?

89
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,730
Are you a parasite, too?

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,610
I... I didn't...

91
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,220
Kana.

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,900
Mitsuo!

93
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,290
I need to talk to Kana.

94
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,970
Okay.

95
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,190
Later, then.

96
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,560
Hey, hang on.

97
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,760
Let's continue this later.

98
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,480
I want to have a serious 
conversation with you.

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,900
What?!

100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
I'll email you.

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,220
You don't need to email.

102
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,810
I can feel you when you're near.

103
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,940
"Feel you"?

104
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,460
But you said I'm not the only one 
who can make you feel that.

105
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,060
"Who can make you feel that"?

106
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,580
Kana, you...

107
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,500
You idiot!

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,110
You've got it completely wrong!

109
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,090
Shinichi...

110
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,270
What is this "serious conversation" 
you mentioned earlier?

111
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,320
Was seeing that female 
your real objective today?

112
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,390
So what if it was?

113
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,890
Over time, my kind has evolved.

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,130
But we will never develop what 
humans call "sympathy."

115
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,400
I know that.

116
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,590
Then I ask that you do not put me at risk.

117
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,750
If you were to tell her too much...

118
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,910
I know.

119
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,560
Do you really?

120
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,510
I'm assuming you wouldn't 
want to observe your own

121
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,580
right hand slicing someone up.

122
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,980
Is that a threat?

123
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes.

124
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,950
You really have no sympathy!

125
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,610
That's what I just said.

126
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,630
<i>I wonder what his "serious 
conversation" is about.</i>

127
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,790
There it is again.

128
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,930
It's close.

129
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,470
<i>I don't think it's him,</i>

130
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,930
<i>but it could be...</i>

131
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,290
<i>It's over there.</i>

132
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,040
<i>Just a little farther,</i>

133
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,730
<i>from around that corner.</i>

134
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,610
<i>It wasn't him.</i>

135
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,280
Izumi.

136
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,360
Why here?

137
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,270
Your email said a place without 
many people around would be best.

138
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,780
Ow...

139
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,320
Okay, he's asleep.

140
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,330
<i>I told her everything I knew about parasites.</i>

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,900
The one I have just happened to mess up

142
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,080
while trying to take over my head, 
and got my right hand instead.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,640
So he will never attack anyone.

144
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,340
Now everything makes sense, right?

145
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,240
I was hoping for something more interesting.

146
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,690
I got my hopes up for nothing.

147
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,930
I know it's not easy to believe,

148
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,520
but everything I just told you is the truth.

149
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,070
If it's true, give me proof.

150
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,600
Show me how your right hand can change shape.

151
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,570
Like I said, he's sleeping right now.

152
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,240
Just come out and say it.

153
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,960
You just don't want to see me anymore

154
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,450
because you don't want that girl, 
Satomi or whatever, to get the wrong idea.

155
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,000
That's not it.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,240
I wouldn't tell you such an elaborate 
lie just for something like that.

157
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,050
"Something like that"?

158
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,460
If you don't like me, just tell me already.

159
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,090
Uh, that's not what this is about...

160
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,100
I have the ability to tell you 
apart from the rest, you know.

161
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,980
Huh?

162
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,020
Just me?

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

164
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,150
I can tell you apart, specifically, 
from the rest of those monsters.

165
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,650
Really?

166
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,130
So I won't approach anyone but you.

167
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,130
That solves the problem, doesn't it?

168
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,660
W-Well, I guess...

169
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,020
I'm the only one in the 
whole world who can do that.

170
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,920
Don't you think that's amazing?

171
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,920
I'm sure it's amazing.

172
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,440
Hey, since I told you my secret,

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,100
I want you to show me 
your secret someday, too.

174
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,400
What secret?

175
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,520
Your right hand.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,940
Otherwise, I don't think I can 
ever really believe your story.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
All right.

178
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,210
It's a promise, then.

179
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,110
Sure, I promise.

180
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,450
Newcomer Hirokawa Elected to Higashi Fukuyama Mayoral Office

181
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,450
He got elected, huh...

182
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,950
Parasites have now secured a 
safe haven and a food source.

183
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,530
<i>They're as intelligent as humans,</i>

184
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,210
<i>and they'd do anything to protect themselves.</i>

185
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,010
<i>She said she can tell me apart from the rest,</i>

186
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,690
<i>but does she really have that kind of power?</i>

187
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,380
<i>Impression</i>?

188
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,140
Yeah, it's supposed to be a really good movie.

189
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,980
Huh.

190
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,000
Both Yuko and Akiho bawled their eyes out.

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,230
I'd really like to see it, too.

192
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,640
All right.

193
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,490
Tomorrow at ten, then?

194
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,120
Sure.

195
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,090
<i>Why can't you sense </i>me<i>?</i>

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,410
<i>We're linked by fate.</i>

197
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,410
<i>I'm the only one who can sense you.</i>

198
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,880
<i>Does she have a power like that?</i>

199
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,380
<i>C'mon, look.</i>

200
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,430
<i>Look at me...</i>

201
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,610
M-Mitsuo!

202
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,610
Don't spook me like that.

203
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,320
What're you doing?

204
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,620
What does it matter?

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,430
This isn't like you.

206
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,450
You're like a stalker.

207
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,710
Aren't you the one acting like a stalker,

208
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,270
following me around?

209
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,710
He's taken already.

210
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,590
He's not right for you.

211
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,080
And you are?!

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,630
Give me a break!

213
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,430
Quit following me around like a lost puppy.

214
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,290
I don't ever want to see you again!

215
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,830
That was harsh.

216
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,820
I didn't know you hated me that much.

217
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,040
Sorry, I went too far.

218
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,400
But I can't help how I feel.

219
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,370
I don't know what to do.

220
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,120
Sorry.

221
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,960
I've decided to tell you.

222
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,630
Huh?

223
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,830
I can't risk your turning against me.

224
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,780
But I wouldn't want you to do 
anything rash while I'm asleep, either.

225
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,860
That female, Kana... 
Her power has grown stronger.

226
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,770
Or, rather, she's begun to emit a signal.

227
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,020
A signal?

228
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,040
It's a signal parasites emit that 
lets us sense each other's location.

229
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,150
I felt hers on our way home 
from school yesterday.

230
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,970
N-No way!

231
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,550
<i>If she sends out a signal like that,</i>

232
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,130
<i>they'll find her,</i>

233
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,690
<i>and she'll get herself killed!</i>

234
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,350
She probably only emits the signal 
when she's concentrating intensely.

235
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,250
Its range is quite small, as well.

236
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,250
Why didn't you tell me right then?!

237
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,160
Never mind.

238
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,890
Thank you for telling me.

239
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,400
Migi, while you were sleeping the other day,

240
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,330
I told her everything about 
the parasites, and about you.

241
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,830
But she wouldn't believe me.

242
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,150
I thought you might've.

243
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,530
Hey, she won't turn against you.

244
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,810
So, because of that...

245
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,190
I want you to show yourself to her.

246
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,140
It'll be fine!

247
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,300
If she tells anyone else,

248
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,440
I can just bluff.

249
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,790
If you just maintain your 
cover as my right hand,

250
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,710
she'll just be dismissed as a high 
school girl talking nonsense.

251
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,110
Okay?

252
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,590
You're right.

253
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,590
We should hurry, then.

254
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,850
How about tomorrow?

255
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,940
Oh!

256
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,490
I have a date with Murano tomorrow.

257
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Shinichi

258
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,690
We got here early.

259
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,090
Migi, I hope you still remember 
your promise from yesterday.

260
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,760
I do.

261
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,330
But we have a problem.

262
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,010
Two of my kind are approaching.

263
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,010
What?!

264
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,470
Incoming Call 
Izumi Shinichi

265
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,730
Hello?

266
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,930
Sorry, I want to change our meeting place.

267
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,860
Whatever you do, don't go near the train station.

268
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,400
I'll call you back.

269
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,890
Huh?

270
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,480
It's those two.

271
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,430
Let's go.

272
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,060
Wait.

273
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,920
It'll raise their suspicions if we move.

274
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,870
Pretend you're making a call.

275
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,680
<i>I'll show you my power 
properly this time, for sure.</i>

276
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,010
<i>My power to sense you alone.</i>

277
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,420
<i>No one—not even that girl, 
Satomi—has that special power.</i>

278
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,270
<i>So you should feel me alone, too.</i>

279
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,490
They acted like we were 
nothing out of the ordinary.

280
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,380
Incoming Call 
Izumi Shinichi

281
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,050
Why isn't she picking up?

282
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,050
There he is!

283
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,060
It's no good.

284
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,190
I can't tell her breathing apart from 
all the other people in this city.

285
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,290
Migi, can't you sense this signal of hers?

286
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,340
That's impossible.

287
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,670
Her signal is weak compared 
to others of my kind,

288
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,450
and she may not be sending one out right now.

289
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,830
<i>I'll see him.</i>

290
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,250
<i>I'll see him soon!</i>

291
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,710
<i>Izumi!</i>

292
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,210
There!

293
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,460
You found her?

294
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,880
No, I detect a signal from my own kind.

295
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,700
That's useless to us right now...

296
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,010
Wait, if Kana detects that signal...

297
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,140
She might approach it.

298
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,640
Which way?!

299
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:46,180
<i>See, Izumi? I can tell you 
apart from everyone else!</i>

300
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,000
A human?

301
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,290
I'd thought the signal was too 
weak to be one of ours, but...

302
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,710
<i>It's okay!</i>

303
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,140
<i>He'll come save me!</i>

304
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,190
Izumi!

305
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,780
Migi...

306
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,380
Handle the defense.

307
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,250
The defense?

308
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,390
Impressive...

309
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
It's too late.

310
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,900
She's lost too much blood.

311
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,900
No...

312
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,580
Kana...

313
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,900
Izu...

314
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,900
Izumi...

315
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,220
I knew you'd come here...

316
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,590
I sensed you.

317
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,840
Hang in there.

318
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,470
I had a dream like this

319
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,450
before, too...

320
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,600
Don't talk.

321
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,100
A dream so embarrassing,

322
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,380
I could never tell... anyone...

323
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,700
Kana...

324
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,940
Shinichi

325
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,730
He's the one who found the victim.

326
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,790
He looks calm, for someone 
who was friends with her.

327
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,800
This is confidential information,

328
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,130
but his mother was also killed by a parasite.

329
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,750
What?

330
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,690
Not very friendly, is he?

331
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,540
He must be tired after all the 
questioning we put him through.

332
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,300
We even pulled out one of 
his hairs, just in case.

333
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
No wonder he was upset.

334
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,120
We can't afford to be considerate.

335
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,680
The victim was killed by a parasite.

336
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,680
But who killed that parasite?

337
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,470
Something tore through the parasite's 
ribs, gouged out its heart,

338
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,410
then slammed it against the wall with 
enough force to destroy the wall itself.

339
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,030
No human could do that.

340
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,440
There must've been at 
least one more parasite.

341
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,750
So two or more parasites had a falling out?

342
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,200
We have to entertain that possibility.

343
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,050
If only I hadn't promised to see Kana that day,

344
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,670
and just went to the movies with Murano, 
this wouldn't have happened.

345
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,180
You've got it wrong, Shinichi.

346
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,230
This was only a matter of time.

347
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,960
There is no need for you to feel responsible.

348
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
How can you say something like that?

349
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,200
Wait!

350
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,240
Why...

351
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,240
Why?!

352
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,750
Why couldn't you protect Kana?!

353
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,450
How can you be so calm?!

354
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,000
Are you...

355
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,080
Are you incapable of shedding 
even a single tear?!

356
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,200
Shinichi!

357
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,710
You're not human!

358
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,750
That's right!

359
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,110
Why do you go down so easily?!

360
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,290
<i>If we take this any further,</i>

361
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,350
<i>we'll just open a hole in 
this guy's heart, too.</i>

362
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,710
<i>"Not human"?</i>

363
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,440
<i>He's exactly right.</i>

364
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,540
<i>Why am I so calm?</i>

365
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,870
<i>Could it be that...</i>

366
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,730
<i>Could it be that my brain's been 
taken over without my noticing it?</i>

367
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,060
<i>Even though Kana's dead,</i>

368
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,310
<i>I can't cry a single tear.</i>

369
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,900
Stop it, Shinichi.

370
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,550
My blood's still red...

371
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,380
For now.

372
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,600
Next time:

373
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,030
Hello Sadness

374
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,210
"Hello Sadness."
