The Apothecary Diaries

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,360
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,490
Sandalwood incense...

5
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,980
Master Jinshi's bedroom...

6
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,730
How did I end up here...?

7
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,510
Oh, you're awake.

8
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,160
Don't push yourself.

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,180
You had fifteen stitches.

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,640
Master Jinshi brought you here, 
since it's better here than at the infirmary.

11
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,100
Here you go.

12
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,370
Thank you.

13
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm sorry to bother you after you just 
woke up, but can you get dressed?

14
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,160
I want to bring everyone in.

15
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,950
Understood.

16
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,660
What in the world is going on?!

17
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,120
Basen!

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,790
Episode 20: Thornapple

19
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,080
<i>I mean, his master's life was at risk.</i>

20
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,630
<i>That said, I don't deserve to be yelled at.</i>

21
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,510
I apologize for my lack of manners.

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,530
Don't worry about it.

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,610
So, how did you end up there,

24
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,360
and how did you know 
the pillar was about to fall?

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,690
Do explain.

26
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,360
Understood.

27
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,410
That was an accident caused by 
multiple coincidences converging.

28
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,840
But it's as if the coincidences 
were drawn together intentionally.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,600
In that sense, it's a conspiracy, 
not an accident.

30
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,900
The first coincidence is 
the death of Master Kounen,

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,410
a high-ranking official 
at the Board of Rites, last year.

32
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,850
Next, the fire at a warehouse,

33
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,680
and the theft of some ceremonial tools 
at a different warehouse.

34
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,640
And the third is the manager 
of ceremonial tools

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,810
falling ill due to food poisoning 
at around the same time.

36
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Those were all caused
 intentionally by someone?

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,920
Probably.

38
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,960
There's also probably 
one more important factor.

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,650
What is it?

40
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,910
The stolen ceremonial tools.

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,920
During the ceremony, the pillar above 
the altar was pulled up by metal wires,

42
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,510
and fixed on to the floor with metal parts.

43
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,970
If the goal was to make this 
appear as an accident,

44
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,430
aiming for those metal parts would be effective.

45
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,510
If someone stole those, 
they'd just make replacements!

46
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,270
Of course they did.

47
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,620
Since they're used in ceremonies, 
I'm sure the design was elaborate.

48
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,440
I can think of one artisan 
who might have been tasked with it.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,940
The metalworker who passed away?

50
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,050
Yes. The stolen ceremonial pieces 
were rebuilt by the metalworker.

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,640
So, what if those metal parts were 
designed to break when heated?

52
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,350
Idiot! What kind of metal would...

53
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,010
Using the late metalworker's secret technique,

54
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,170
the metal could be made to melt 
just by being near an open fire.

55
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,770
Are you saying the metalworker 
was part of this conspiracy?

56
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,020
No, I think he didn't know anything,

57
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,110
and just built the metal parts as ordered.

58
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,780
Perhaps he was asked, "Please build one 
of these, but using that special metal."

59
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,420
But if an accident occurs at a ceremony, 
of course the metalworker would have doubts.

60
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,260
If the artisan is eliminated
 before the incident,

61
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,610
both the identity of his commissioner

62
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,170
and the secret of the easily-melting
 metal vanish with him.

63
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,540
That would have been ideal for the mastermind.

64
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,010
Was he killed?

65
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,300
That I can't tell.

66
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,890
It could be a crime made 
to look like an accident.

67
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,810
The customer who had 
the metalworker remake the parts

68
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,440
knew the technique that 
made that metal possible.

69
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,940
That's all I can say.

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,780
Understood.

71
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,700
<i>Anyway, who would have thought Master 
Jinshi would be at that ceremony?</i>

72
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,410
<i>If that ceremony continued...</i>

73
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,210
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

74
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,490
<i>If he's someone worth trying to kill 
with such a complicated scheme...</i>

75
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,250
<i>Knowing the truth would 
just get me in more trouble.</i>

76
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,070
<i>It has nothing to do with me anymore.</i>

77
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,370
Xiaomao.

78
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,180
Yes.

79
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,020
You have a guest.

80
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,790
About that incident. A court lady named 
Suirei had something to do with it...

81
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,040
<i>Suirei. I knew it.</i>

82
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,960
They found her corpse.

83
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,470
Huh?

84
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,300
When an officer of justice entered her room,

85
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,840
she'd already drunk poison 
and was collapsed on the floor.

86
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,210
The doctors have already finished 
examining her, and she's confirmed dead.

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,670
What next?

88
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,190
I think they're going to cremate 
her corpse tomorrow, coffin and all.

89
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,900
Any other co-conspirators?

90
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,990
Nobody. Just Suirei.

91
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,290
<i>She did all of those 
complicated things by herself?</i>

92
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,460
Anyway, it's solved. See ya.

93
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,840
<i>She poisoned herself and died?</i>

94
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,840
<i>That's really it?</i>

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,800
<i>No, more importantly,</i>

96
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,640
<i>was Suirei the type of person 
to commit suicide?</i>

97
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,170
<i>Was she behaving apathetic and unemotional 
because she knew she had no future?</i>

98
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,440
<i>But the way she spoke, as if testing me...</i>

99
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,410
I'll be planting some morning glories here.

100
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,920
Resurrection medicine...

101
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,500
<i>I can't leave it as conjecture. 
I have to know for certain!</i>

102
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,340
Master Jinshi!

103
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,990
I have a request for you!

104
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,010
W-What is it?

105
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,050
I'd like to speak to the doctor 
who examined the corpse.

106
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,400
At the morgue.

107
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,350
Why are you smiling...?

108
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,270
<i>Curiosity got the best of me.</i>

109
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,030
Master Jinshi, you don't have 
to go in there with her...

110
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,100
If the apothecary is going, I'm going too.

111
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,110
Understood.

112
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,340
Xiaomao, here.

113
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,630
Thank you.

114
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,180
My apologies for the long wait.

115
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,390
<i>I knew it. This doctor did the examination.</i>

116
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,020
<i>A court lady he seemed close to is dead,</i>

117
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,820
<i>and she's accused of crimes on top of that.</i>

118
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,270
<i>No surprise he seems worn out.</i>

119
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,770
<i>But is that really all?</i>

120
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,550
I'll be blunt.

121
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,740
Did the poison ingested by
 the court lady include thornapple?

122
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,040
That's...

123
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,240
The small hill near the stable.

124
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,110
Did she not plant thornapple there?

125
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,730
It has a strong poison, but in right 
amounts, it can work as an anesthetic.

126
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,670
I'm sure the pharmacy stocks plenty.

127
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,990
<i>Thornapple looks like a white morning glory.</i>

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,600
I can't say for certain.

129
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,390
It's quite likely, given the symptoms, 
but I can't say for certain.

130
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,090
Let's confirm with our own eyes, then.

131
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,210
W-What are you doing?!

132
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,250
Just shut up and watch!

133
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,850
S-Stop!

134
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,710
It's open.

135
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,840
That's... not Suirei?!

136
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,850
It can't be...

137
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,020
It was... It really <i>was</i> Suirei...

138
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,520
Are you certain it was Suirei?

139
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,310
There's no way I'd mistake her.

140
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,530
She had no pulse. Her heart wasn't moving.

141
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,860
She was so clean.

142
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,450
In other words, you've been exploited.

143
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,860
You didn't think to cut open her corpse 
to find out what poison she used.

144
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,880
That's what Suirei expected.

145
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,140
You!

146
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,170
It wasn't just thornapple that Suirei took.

147
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,270
If we investigated 
the drug stocks at the pharmacy,

148
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,550
we should be able to tell what she used.

149
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,820
<i>I guess the only thing 
we can fault this doctor for</i>

150
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,080
<i>is not keeping track of the drugs properly.</i>

151
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
What do you mean?

152
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,860
That the corpse is wrong.

153
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,980
Even if the coffin was supposed to be burned,

154
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,380
it would be too suspicious if it was empty.

155
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,620
She must have placed a different corpse 
in a new coffin to replace her.

156
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,310
Then what about Suirei's corpse?

157
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,840
Carrying it out would have caused a scene.

158
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,890
There's no need to carry it out.

159
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,290
What do you mean?

160
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,430
She walked out by herself.

161
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,640
But wasn't she dead?!

162
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,060
There is a certain drug that can 
make a person appear dead.

163
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,980
Are you aware of it?

164
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,580
I've heard about it, but that's just fantasy.

165
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,030
What is it like?

166
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,330
That drug, which is said 
to exist in a faraway land,

167
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,580
is able to kill a person, 
then resurrect them later.

168
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,290
I don't know the details,

169
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,770
but I've heard thornapple and 
pufferfish are used as ingredients.

170
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,310
Xiaomao?

171
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,520
Master Gaoshun, could you 
investigate the empty coffins?

172
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,130
Yes.

173
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,560
Fingernail marks.

174
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,150
That must have been the one 
with the dead Suirei in it.

175
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,740
By the time her rescuer arrived to open it,

176
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,990
she came back to life.

177
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,840
They set up a different coffin 
with another corpse to replace it,

178
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,650
then disguised her as a vendor to walk out.

179
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,670
They employed such a risky method?

180
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,080
If she got caught, she'd get executed anyway.

181
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,170
I'd take that bet any day.

182
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,410
I think with you, it would be different...

183
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,280
Since there's no corpse here, 
Suirei must have won her bet.

184
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,890
If the replacement corpse got burned, 
it would have been a complete victory, but...

185
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,770
<i>Not on my watch.</i>

186
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,110
If she's still alive, I'd like to meet her.

187
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,620
<i>Not to arrest her.</i>

188
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,930
<i>The intellect that allowed her to make 
so many crimes look like accidents.</i>

189
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,040
<i>The courage she had to pull it all off.</i>

190
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,500
<i>Most of all, the nerves of steel it took
 to bet her own life to trick us all!</i>

191
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,920
<i>A person like that dying so
 soon would be such a loss!</i>

192
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,680
<i>Medicine to bring people back to life! 
She </i>will<i> teach me how to make it!</i>

193
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,910
Pardon me.

194
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,100
W-What is it?!

195
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,940
Can we get my leg stitched up again?

196
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,450
I think the wound reopened.

197
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,990
Say that sooner!

198
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,300
Lady Loulan.

199
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,740
<i>We ended up taking care of 
the Suirei incident in secret.</i>

200
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,020
<i>Many things remain unclear 
about the court lady Suirei.</i>

201
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,280
<i>According to the doctor, 
she was backed by his teacher.</i>

202
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,760
<i>He took note of her talents a few years ago 
and brought her in as an adopted daughter.</i>

203
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,080
<i>Not much is known about her past before then.</i>

204
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,580
This is going to take a long time.

205
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,270
I helped Xiaomao get home.

206
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,700
Sorry to trouble you, as always.

207
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,590
We can't let her open up her wound again.

208
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,050
Yes.

209
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,010
<i>But it's not just her wound that worries me.</i>

210
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,100
<i>There's also the matter with Lakan, the weirdo.</i>

211
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,210
<i>It's clear that he's her father,</i>

212
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,520
<i>but given the apothecary's attitude, 
there must be some issues there.</i>

213
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,660
To the rear palace tomorrow, right?

214
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,980
Yes.

215
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,510
There seems to be no problem. 
It's the same as always.

216
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,500
Meaning it tastes bad.

217
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,150
You don't have to drink it 
if you don't like it.

218
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,300
It's a responsibility of mine, as a eunuch.

219
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,130
You shouldn't hold your nose 
like that in public.

220
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,970
It makes you look very young.

221
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,270
I know.

222
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,520
<i>Refined mannerisms, heavenly 
smiles, and a voice like honey.</i>

223
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,540
<i>The "twenty-four-year-old" man who became 
a eunuch when the rear palace</i>

224
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,520
<i>became the current emperor's, five years ago.</i>

225
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,530
<i>That's "Jinshi."</i>

226
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,670
<i>From the day I decided to wear this mask,</i>

227
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,540
<i>I've been drinking this medicine 
to suppress my manhood every day.</i>

228
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,250
It will make you actually impotent one day.

229
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,120
Hey, same with you!

230
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,340
My children are adults now. 
I even have another grandchild.

231
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,560
A grandchild? From your older son?

232
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,010
Yes. My youngest son is ready
 to get married too, but...

233
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,400
By youngest, you mean Basen? He's only nineteen.

234
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,570
Yes, nineteen, just like you.

235
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,250
"Jinshi the eunuch" is twenty-four.

236
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,750
Your look is telling me to 
find a wife and end this work.

237
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,650
I'd like to have time to
 spend with my grandchild.

238
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,950
I'll do my best.

239
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,270
Greetings, Master Jinshi.

240
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,020
Another wonderful outfit, I see.

241
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,520
Thank you.

242
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,050
Master Jinshi...

243
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,960
<i>The emperor does visit
 Concubine Loulan often,</i>

244
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,070
<i>but apparently, he doesn't 
find her very appealing.</i>

245
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,490
<i>Concubine Loulan is very fashionable, 
changing her hairstyle and makeup often.</i>

246
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,360
<i>Apparently, he can't tell who she is 
every time he visits her, and gets confused.</i>

247
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,750
<i>Still, he visits her once every ten days.</i>

248
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,690
<i>Concubine Loulan's father is 
an important high-ranking official</i>

249
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,560
<i>who was the previous 
empress dowager's favorite.</i>

250
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,010
<i>He needs to be careful around her.</i>

251
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,180
<i>In terms of lacking appeal, 
Concubine Lishu is similar.</i>

252
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,630
<i>The current emperor despises his 
predecessor's taste for younger girls.</i>

253
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,370
<i>He doesn't intend to lay a finger 
on Concubine Lishu.</i>

254
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,560
<i>The empress dowager, who gave birth</i>

255
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,670
<i>to the current emperor 
when she was just a girl,</i>

256
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,350
<i>also gave birth to another child, 
some ten-odd years later.</i>

257
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,020
<i>At that time, the doctor spent all his time 
tending to the empress dowager,</i>

258
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,830
<i>so the birth took place without an issue.</i>

259
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,930
<i>However, Concubine Ah-Duo, 
who gave birth at around the same time,</i>

260
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,240
<i>received no attention, 
resulting in the loss of her uterus.</i>

261
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,070
<i>The current emperor's firstborn 
child was lost soon after.</i>

262
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,470
<i>If that child had survived...</i>

263
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,530
<i>No, it's just a silly delusion.</i>

264
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,150
<i>He just needs to make himself a new prince.</i>

265
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,490
Oh, you're here.

266
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,690
You seem exhausted.

267
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,750
All right, back to work with you all.

268
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,480
Y-Yes.

269
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,940
To be honest...

270
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,760
The rear palace?

271
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,800
Yes. Concubine Gyokuyou's 
lunar cycle has stopped.

272
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,660
<i>Lunar cycle. In other words,
 she might be pregnant.</i>

273
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,980
Starting when?

274
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,980
Can you start today?

275
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,240
Yes.

276
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,170
I'm counting on you.

277
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,780
<i>This is a good opportunity for me.</i>

278
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,320
<i>Men aren't allowed in the rear palace.</i>

279
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,410
<i>There's no chance I'd run into that man 
whose name I can't even stand to hear.</i>

280
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,750
<i>Does this mean Master Jinshi
 is looking out for me?</i>

281
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,020
<i>At any rate, more tasting for poisons!</i>

282
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,710
Oh, you're in a good mood.

283
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,260
Huh? No, not at all!

284
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,850
It's unfortunate. I thought I'd finally found 
someone worth cracking the whip on.

285
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,950
Right?

286
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,810
<i>Life at the rear palace 
is similar to the last time,</i>

287
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,100
<i>tasting for poisons every day.</i>

288
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,190
This is safe.

289
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,500
<i>Besides the pause in her menstrual 
cycle, there's no definite evidence.</i>

290
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,490
<i>I'd had this thought during
 the events with Concubine Ah-Duo,</i>

291
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,740
<i>but perhaps he's more than just 
a lewd middle-aged guy.</i>

292
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,750
<i>With Concubine Ah-Duo gone 
as a trusted adviser,</i>

293
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,260
<i>and replaced by a quirky girl who
 could cause political issues, as well...</i>

294
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,750
<i>Someone he can't just ignore, yet would
 cause trouble if she birthed a child...</i>

295
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,780
<i>It all sounds like a headache.</i>

296
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,850
Verdigris House

297
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,810
Hey, did you hear?

298
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:55,810
Verdigris House

299
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,190
What? One of the Three Princesses?

300
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,730
Yes! She's getting bought out!

301
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,980
Bought... out?

302
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

303
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,170

Out a Contract."</i>
