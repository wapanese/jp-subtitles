The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,320
How does one decrease 
the value of a courtesan?

5
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,940
A pregnancy would reduce it to nearly nothing.

6
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,670
Is that the place you're looking for?

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,800
Now, if you'll excuse me.

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
You're leaving now?

9
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,310
Me going in there would ruin all 
the work we put into your disguise.

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,660
Right...

11
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,780
Goodbye.

12
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,080
<i>It's fine. I pulled it off
with no apparent emotion.</i>

13
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,800
Enjoy yourself tonight, good sir.

14
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,420
<i>A dream of the past...</i>

15
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,830
<i>Or rather, from when I was a baby.</i>

16
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,670
Episode 18: Lakan

17
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,130
<i>I bet it's because I talked about it.</i>

18
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,960
Good morning.

19
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,540
Morning, Dad.

20
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,940
What are your plans for today?

21
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,320
Nothing.

22
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,350
If you're not busy, can you 
pay a visit to the Verdigris House?

23
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,150
Sure.

24
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,700
Hmm? Hey, Maomao. Are you off work?

25
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,650
I got a vacation.

26
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,960
You're at the apothecary even on your off day?

27
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,330
Just passing by. It's not 
the main reason why I'm here.

28
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,420
Hold it, Pairin!

29
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,860
Haven't we discussed this enough by now?

30
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,260
Oh? Maomao!

31
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,430
Good to see you back!

32
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,430
You're suffocating me, Pairin.

33
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,710
I'm the one suffocating from our 
old granny nagging me all the time.

34
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm not done with you! 
You have to choose one or the other!

35
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,640
Really?

36
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,480
<i>I don't know what this is about, but it 
looks like Pairin has a lot on her plate, too.</i>

37
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,520
Granny, you're so persistent.

38
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,310
It's your fault for not making
 up your mind. Now decide!

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,580
Besides, you're the one that's making me 
bring these offers to you by hanging around!

40
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,670
I didn't ask! You're always so pushy!

41
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,200
<i>Sneak, sneak, sneak.</i>

42
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,130
What do you mean, pushy?!

43
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,780
Hmm? Was Maomao here?

44
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,620
She's been here for a little while.

45
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,460
Is she going to the annex?

46
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Good morning.

47
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,900
<i>She used to hatefully chase me out,</i>

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,080
<i>but I guess she doesn't 
have the energy anymore.</i>

49
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,410
<i>Or perhaps she's forgotten
 how to talk entirely.</i>

50
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,460
<i>With her illness worsening, 
her memories are in shreds.</i>

51
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,760
<i>Dad's medicine works well, but at this point, 
it won't even provide temporary relief.</i>

52
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,020
<i>Still, giving her the medicine is
 the only treatment we can think of.</i>

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,370
That customer is back again.

54
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,340
He's got a good nose on him.

55
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,320
Get Meimei in here.

56
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,000
<i>The Verdigris House is now 
a reputable establishment,</i>

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,460
<i>but a decade or so ago, 
it used to operate in shame.</i>

58
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,170
<i>This courtesan served 
customers during that era,</i>

59
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,750
<i>and was unlucky enough 
to catch syphilis as a result.</i>

60
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,760
<i>By the time Dad came to the Verdigris 
House, the illness was in incubation.</i>

61
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,760
<i>If he'd known about the illness, 
he might have been able to treat her,</i>

62
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,610
<i>but nobody trusted a eunuch 
who suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</i>

63
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,520
<i>She had to serve customers. 
There was no other way to live.</i>

64
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,460
<i>That was the law of the courtesan.</i>

65
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,080
<i>A few years later, when 
the rashes started to reappear,</i>

66
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,640
<i>the sores spread almost instantly.</i>

67
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,120
<i>Since then, this woman has 
been locked up in this annex,</i>

68
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,560
<i>out of sight of the customers.</i>

69
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,880
<i>It's quite generous. Courtesans who can't work
 are usually just thrown out into a ditch.</i>

70
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,170
<i>This room's pretty stuffy. 
Maybe I'll burn some incense, too.</i>

71
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,790
What is it?

72
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,960
Big Sis told me the weirdo 
with the monocle is here,

73
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,210
so you shouldn't go out there for now.

74
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,830
Right, got it.

75
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,810
<i>As long as I stay put, that man
 won't come out here.</i>

76
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,570
<i>A long-time customer of the 
Verdigris House, an old acquaintance...</i>

77
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,410
Stupid woman.

78
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,860
Thanks for being so patient.
 That guy's gone now.

79
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,220
Meimei, did you spend time with him?

80
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,530
Who else can?

81
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,570
Oh, I'm glad Big Sis seems 
to be doing well today.

82
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,370
Maomao, you're getting <i>that</i> offer again.

83
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,580
I don't see how you put up with him, Sis.

84
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,460
It's not so bad. The old lady 
doesn't care as long as he pays up.

85
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,950
That's probably why she keeps 
wanting to make me a courtesan.

86
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,040
If I didn't have my job, 
I might have been sold off by now.

87
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,150
It's a really good deal, from where I'm standing.

88
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,140
Do you know how rare it is for 
a courtesan to get everything they want?

89
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,230
Since our old lady would easily 
let the weight of silver overrule that.

90
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,610
Who can blame her? She's saving up 
for her boat fare to heaven.

91
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm getting older now. 
I should start taking this seriously.

92
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,710
<i>She's not even thirty yet, but as a courtesan, 
that's retirement age already.</i>

93
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,060
Why not strike out on your own?

94
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,090
Just a while longer.

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll keep working here for just a while longer.

96
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,560
<i>I don't know what's going
 through Meimei's mind.</i>

97
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,310
<i>It's not a rabbit hole I want to delve into.</i>

98
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,070
<i>If it's what everyone knows as love,</i>

99
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,790
<i>that's an emotion I'm sure I left behind,
 in the womb of the woman who birthed me.</i>

100
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,420
Let me scrub your back. 
Haven't done that in ages.

101
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,510
Huh? No thanks.

102
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,970
Come on, come on.

103
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,590
Yeah, it's been a while!

104
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,890
Let her do it.

105
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,390
You're going to be gone again 
for a while, right?

106
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,270
Huh?

107
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,280
I'm doing this as a freebie, so you have 
to help me find good customers, okay?

108
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,840
<i>I didn't expect the meeting place to 
offer services like in the pleasure district.</i>

109
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,610
<i>That wasn't what I was there for.</i>

110
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
Apothecary, do you have a moment?

111
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,190
Yes.

112
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,620
Share this with Suiren. 
It's a souvenir from a weirdo.

113
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,160
From a weirdo? Thank you.

114
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,010
Yeah.

115
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,180
Well then, I'm getting back to work.

116
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,180
Oh, dear.

117
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,570
We're having a vegetarian dinner today,

118
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,680
so Xiaomao, don't eat 
any meat or fish, all right?

119
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,310
You're taking a break, but don't 
completely lose consciousness.

120
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,320
Right, vegetarian!

121
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,320
<i>Dammit, I thought working 
would get my mind off of it.</i>

122
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,040
Also.

123
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,480
No more hiding weird plants in the warehouse.

124
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,630
<i>Yikes. She's sharp.</i>

125
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,410
If you can't find anywhere to put it,

126
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,180
why don't you ask Master Jinshi to 
let you use one of the vacant rooms?

127
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,680
No, I can't use a noble person's 
home as a medicine cabinet.

128
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,920
Xiaomao, you appear apathetic,

129
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,640
but you're actually very keen when it
comes to knowing where you stand.

130
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,980
I am of lowly birth. It's a small 
miracle that I'm even here.

131
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,580
Perhaps.

132
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,630
But remember, just because 
a person is of noble birth

133
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,660
doesn't make them inherently 
different from the start.

134
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,490
Nobody knows how a person's 
life can twist and turn.

135
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,130
Separating everything based only on 
status can lead to missed opportunities.

136
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,630
Really?

137
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,780
Yes, really.

138
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,970
Now, back to work. 
Can you run an errand for me?

139
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,160
Excuse me!

140
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,470
I've come to pick up some medicine!

141
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,040
Yes, wait just a moment.

142
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,400
<i>This is nothing like the rear palace pharmacy 
that the quack doctor was running!</i>

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,240
<i>This place is close to the military, 
so they must get a lot of injuries.</i>

144
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,910
<i>Ah, this smell that leaves 
a bitter taste in my mouth...</i>

145
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,280
<i>I wonder what they have 
in the medicine cabinets?</i>

146
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,310
<i>I'd love to rummage through this whole place...</i>

147
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,170
<i>No. I must control myself!</i>

148
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,590
What are you doing?

149
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,850
<i>She's that...</i>

150
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,980
Just waiting for some medicine.

151
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,510
Suirei!

152
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,770
You're here.

153
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,880
I'm here to resupply 
the medicines at the guardhouse.

154
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,840
Right.

155
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,300
<i>The guardhouse?</i>

156
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,620
How are you? I'm fine.

157
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,620
<i>Come to think of it, the last time 
I saw her was near the military wing.</i>

158
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,460
<i>She must smell like herbs 
because she works there.</i>

159
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,080
<i>I wonder why she seems to dislike me.</i>

160
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,440
Is there anything else you need?

161
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,820
No, nothing else.

162
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,680
A court lady shouldn't be doing this...

163
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,900
F-Forget I said anything! 
You need medicine, right?!

164
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,860
I wonder what kind of medicine this is.

165
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Lick!

166
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,630
Potato flour?

167
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,120
This is for Master Jinshi, right?

168
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,630
<i>Thinking about it, Master Jinshi 
is pretty mysterious.</i>

169
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,130
<i>Not just the work he gets 
assigned every few weeks,</i>

170
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,640
<i>but taking long baths the day before,</i>

171
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,490
<i>and burning incense before leaving...</i>

172
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,600
<i>The vegetarian food, too.</i>

173
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,710
<i>It's like a purification ceremony.</i>

174
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,930
<i>Are eunuchs allowed to 
perform ceremonial rites?</i>

175
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,980
<i>It's not out of place for a noble to do that,</i>

176
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,690
<i>but if he's of such high rank, 
why is he a eunuch?</i>

177
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:35,950
<i>Was he also made a eunuch by the unilateral 
decision of the previous empress dowager?</i>

178
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,230
<i>Like my dad?</i>

179
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,630
The girl's adopted father 
is a eunuch and former doctor.

180
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,650
If she studied under a former doctor, 
it explains why she's so knowledgeable, but...

181
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,920
A eunuch?

182
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,260
Yes.

183
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,920
Did we ever have such a skilled 
doctor among the eunuchs?

184
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,080
Pardon me.

185
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,990
Shall we pick up the discussion 
from the other day?

186
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,990
It seems you played quite a few dirty tricks.

187
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,090
How rude! I don't want to 
hear that from a thief.

188
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,680
I spent a decade convincing that old madam,

189
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,890
and you stole her out from under my nose.

190
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,810
So you want your prize returned?

191
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,490
No, I'll pay whatever you ask.

192
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,770
I'm not keen on repeating my past mistakes.

193
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,440
And if I refuse?

194
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,320
Then there's nothing I can do, is there?

195
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,580
You can count on one hand the number of 
people who can defy someone as high up as <i>you</i>.

196
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,580
<i>As I thought, he does know who I really am.</i>

197
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,540
I'm just concerned about what 
my <i>daughter</i> would think, is all.

198
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,220
<i>Ugh. So that's really what it is.</i>

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
<i>I don't want to admit it,</i>

200
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,710
<i>but Lakan is Maomao's father by blood.</i>

201
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,660
Could you just let her know 
I'll be visiting her sometime?

202
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,590
Bye, now.

203
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,880
Apothecary.

204
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,330
Yes.

205
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,460
There's an official who wants 
to meet you sometime soon.

206
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,300
Who is he?

207
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,260
It's the weirdo I've been telling 
you about. His name is Lakanâ€”

208
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,540
I'll turn him down somehow.

209
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,640
Thank you. I'll get back to work now.

210
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,120
I've never seen her make a face like that.

211
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,460
And I never want to see it again.

212
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,870
<i>So, he found out.</i>

213
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,960
This smell...

214
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,850
It's an herb garden!

215
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,420
Here! And there! And there, too!

216
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,910
You again?

217
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,280
<i>Oh, no. This is way too suspicious.</i>

218
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,790
Don't worry. I haven't taken anything yet.

219
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,160
Is it safe to assume 
from the dirt on your hands

220
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,040
that you were just about to?

221
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm not trying to punish you.

222
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,770
This is an unofficial garden, anyway.

223
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,620
But the doctors know about this place too,

224
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,850
so I'd advise against frequent visits.

225
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,280
Are you in charge of this place?

226
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,110
Who knows? I'm just allowed 
to plant what I want here.

227
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,570
<i>She's pulling up the weeds.</i>

228
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,320
<i>Suirei, I think her name was?</i>

229
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,700
<i>Not that I'm one to talk, 
but she doesn't seem very excitable.</i>

230
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,220
What are you planting?

231
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,710
A medicine to resurrect someone.

232
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,420
Is that...?!

233
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,680
<i>A medicine that can bring 
the dead back to life...</i>

234
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,430
<i>If such a thing exists, 
I want it more than anything!</i>

235
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,430
Just kidding.

236
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,980
A joke...

237
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,690
I heard you're an apothecary. 
Just how good are you?

238
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,020
I don't know.

239
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,360
A little while from now, I'll be 
planting some morning glories here.

240
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,110
Goodbye.

241
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:50,010
Next Time

242
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,740
<i>Next time: "Chance or 
Something More."</i>

243
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,010
Episode 19: Chance or Something More
