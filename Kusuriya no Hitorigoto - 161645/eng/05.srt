The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,530
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,840
Episode 5:  Covert Operations

5
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,880
I yield.

6
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,480
You've improved, Basen.

7
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,580
No...

8
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,130
My brute force is still no match 
for your techniques, Master Jinshi.

9
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,840
But that force of yours is quite astounding. 
You truly carry the Ma clan's blood.

10
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,640
How's the apothecary doing, Gaoshun?

11
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,220
What specifically do you mean?

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,690
Has she gained weight?

13
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,940
I believe she has regained some, yes.

14
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,270
I see. Well...

15
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,860
Don't you understand why this stuff was banned?!

16
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,450
I told you, it's <i>poison</i>.

17
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,470
It was unexpected, seeing that side of her.

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,730
Are you all right, sir?

19
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,490
Hmm? What?

20
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,080
You seem very concerned.

21
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,820
No, it's nothing.

22
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,760
I knew I'd find it!

23
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,630
Yes!

24
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,690
Oh! Over here, too!

25
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,190
And here, too!

26
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,240
Where should I eat it? The kitchen?

27
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,010
But I don't want people 
asking where I found it...

28
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,160
Oh, but before that...

29
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,530
Wow, looks so good!

30
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,200
Thanks as always, Maomao!

31
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,500
It's so kind of your higher-ups to share snacks 
with you every time there's a tea party.

32
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,810
You need to eat more!

33
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,560
Gain more weight!

34
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,410
Don't be shy!

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,890
Oh, did you hear?

36
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,990
Hmm?

37
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,500
I heard a palace servant

38
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,440
was able to seduce a military officer 
who was famous for hating women.

39
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,890
Huh...

40
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,830
Guess how she did it.

41
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,900
Who knows?

42
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,190
They say she used an aphrodisiac!

43
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,190
Aphro...disiac?

44
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,030
<i>That one.</i>

45
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,800
What's wrong, Maomao?

46
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,750
N-Nothing. It's not related. Probably.

47
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,290
Good morning.

48
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, hey little lady! What's going on today?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,940
There's a secret I'd like to discuss with you.

50
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,760
What is it?

51
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,820
This.

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,180
Wow! Those are fresh matsutake mushrooms!

53
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,730
I'm glad to see you seem to like it.

54
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,160
We'll need charcoal! 
And some soy paste and salt!

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,740
<i>Somehow, I've ended up being
 buddy-buddy with the quack doctor.</i>

56
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Oh, how irresistible!

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,490
I think it's ready.

58
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,630
Pour on some soy paste, add some salt...

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
Here.

60
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,550
Delicious!

61
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,410
<i>Now he's an accomplice.</i>

62
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,430
Delicious!

63
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,180
D-Doctor!

64
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,220
A c-curse...

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Can you make a medicine that cures curses?

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
A curse?

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,600
What do you mean?

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,270
It's this.

69
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,140
That's quite a bad rash. 
Maybe an ointment, for starters?

70
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Could you make some?

71
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,450
Understood.

72
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,870
So, what's this curse you mentioned?

73
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,120
It was two nights ago.

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,790
Trash that comes out of the rear palace

75
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,960
is burned in the pit on the west side.

76
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,130
I was doing work as usual that day, when...

77
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,250
What's that?

78
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,810
A woman's dress? The bottoms of the
sleeves are burnt.

79
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,000
And wood writing tablets...?

80
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:25,190
I was a little curious, but I just 
threw it in the fire anyway. Then...

81
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,790
It's a curse! That must be 
what got to my hands!

82
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,090
Was the fire this color?

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,190
Or perhaps this color?

84
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,140
This would do the same thing.

85
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,340
Little lady, what is that?

86
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,630
It's similar to how fireworks work.

87
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,730
Some things change the color 
of a flame when burned.

88
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,030
Then, what about my hands?

89
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,870
There was probably something 
on the wood tablets.

90
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,540
I think it caused the rashes 
when you touched them.

91
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,690
Try this medicine, and let us know how it goes.

92
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,610
Oh, thank you.

93
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,110
The little lady's medicines 
work like a charm!

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,670
You'll be better in no time!

95
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,880
Well done as always, apothecary.

96
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,970
Master Jinshi!

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,610
I'll make you some tea.

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,480
Greetings, Master Jinshi. 
What business do you have with me today?

99
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,440
Do you mean I shouldn't talk 
to you unless I have business?

100
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,820
Of course not.

101
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
Follow me for a moment.

102
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,450
Thank you for waiting, Master Jinshi—

103
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,760
Oh.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,890
How many colors are there?

105
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,830
I can't say specifically.

106
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,460
Then, how does one apply these colors?

107
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,780
With salts, you can dissolve them in water.

108
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,160
Some will dissolve in 
other things, like oil.

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,470
But this is outside my area of expertise.

110
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,310
I see.

111
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,650
If that's all, please excuse me.

112
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,810
Wait.

113
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,070
What is it?

114
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,940
I like them teapot-steamed.

115
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,330
I'm counting on you, apothecary.

116
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,700
<i>So, he knew...</i>

117
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,840
I'll see if I can find more tomorrow.

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,880
Find everyone who's suffered burns 
on their arms recently.

119
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Understood.

120
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,120
The colored wood tablets are 
probably some kind of code.

121
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,720
People would only use something like 
that for... something secret?

122
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,300
What would that be?

123
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,200
None of my business. Nothing a food 
taster should be concerned about.

124
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,450
Thank you. Oh, please take that over there.

125
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,750
I'm back.

126
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,690
Welcome back.

127
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,380
Maomao! Nice timing.

128
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,480
Over there, please.

129
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,180
Try this on, would you?

130
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,380
Huh? I have a bad feeling about this...

131
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,760
What is this?

132
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,600
Isn't it obvious? It's your dress 
for the garden party.

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,090
Garden party?

134
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,770
Twice a year, the emperor and his 
high officials gather in the courtyard

135
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,940
to enjoy food and entertainment.

136
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,900
The emperor isn't married yet, 
so he has no empress consort, right?

137
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,320
In that case, it's customary to bring
 the upper first-rank concubines.

138
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,610
Upper first-rank concubines...

139
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,080
Current Emperor

140
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,080
(Contender for Empress Consort)

141
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,880
Upper First-Rank Concubine

142
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:12,340
The four high-ranking concubines who are 
the best contenders for the empress consort.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,860
Concubine Gyokuyou, Precious Consort.

144
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,060
Concubine Lihua, Wise Consort.

145
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,200
Concubine Lishu, Virtuous Consort.

146
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,180
Concubine Ah-Duo, Pure Consort.

147
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,410
Last time, Lady Gyokuyou 
Lady Lihua couldn't attend,

148
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,650
because they had just given birth.

149
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,600
So this time, they decided 
to invite all four concubines.

150
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,090
And what do we do there?

151
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,020
Well, nothing, actually.

152
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,370
We're invited as guests. 
We just have to follow the emperor.

153
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,170
Some officials come by 
to pay their respects.

154
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,410
So, don't forget to smile.

155
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,370
Huh...

156
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,960
Is everyone required to attend?

157
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,840
Of course!

158
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,480
This is Princess Lingli's 
first public appearance,

159
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,090
and a rare event with all four 
high-ranking concubines!

160
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,720
This is a war! We have to brace ourselves!

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,560
Let's do this!

162
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,920
<i>Lady Gyokuyou has so few 
ladies-in-waiting to start with.</i>

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,750
<i>The newbie can't sit this out.</i>

164
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,990
<i>Besides, if there's a meal, 
the taster is indispensable.</i>

165
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,650
I guess you do need to 
stuff the chest area a little.

166
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,530
I want to bulk up your waist, too. Is that okay?

167
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,790
I'm in your hands.

168
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,410
We'll be doing some nice makeup, too!

169
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,520
You should hide your freckles occasionally.

170
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,000
Staying outside in the strong winds,

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,880
watching the entertainment, eating the food,

172
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,300
smiling at the officials who come by...

173
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,620
I'll definitely need an iron
 bladder for this one.

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,310
In that case...

175
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,670
Good.

176
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,620
That smells nice.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,040
What are you making?

178
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,170
It's candy made of ginger and oranges.

179
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,120
Candy?

180
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,450
Orange peels improve blood flow, 
and ginger warms the body.

181
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,240
Wait, is it for the garden party?!

182
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,300
Yes. I also made this, just in case.

183
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,180
I sewed pockets into my underrobe.

184
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,810
By putting pocket warmers in there, 
it should help me withstand the cold.

185
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,120
Maomao!

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,750
Huh?

187
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,020
Please, make enough for everyone!

188
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,420
S-Sure...

189
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,370
<i>I guess getting too used to custom 
can stifle the simplest ideas.</i>

190
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,490
<i>A little work can make things better.</i>

191
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,120
Come in.

192
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,960
I'd like to ask for one, myself.

193
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,500
Me too, please...

194
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,480
Okay.

195
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,760
Please teach me how to make that.

196
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
Please.

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,890
<i>The emperor's own seamstress and cook, too?</i>

198
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,440
So cold!

199
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,980
Finally finished.

200
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,700
<i>So, it's tomorrow.</i>

201
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,110
Let's make some of those too, just in case.

202
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,110
Regarding the search for those 
with burns on their arms...

203
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,700
No luck yet?

204
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,190
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,390
I hope the garden party goes smoothly...

206
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,190
Wow...

207
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,140
You're beautiful, Lady Gyokuyou!

208
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,700
Crimson looks so good on you!

209
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,900
Such wonderful beauty...

210
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,740
No wonder they say crimson suits her 
better than anyone in all the land.

211
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,960
Yes, you outshine all others.

212
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,380
Thank you. And for you all...

213
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,950
Here. I have to mark you, to make
 sure you don't attract any bad bugs.

214
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,060
Maomao.

215
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,760
Remember, Maomao. You are <i>my</i> lady-in-waiting.

216
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,490
Uhm, thank you.

217
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,270
Got her!

218
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,450
Um, wait.

219
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,430
Makeup time!

220
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Time to become as cute as you can be!

221
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,570
We'll wipe off your face 
and apply some scents.

222
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,160
Then we'll deal with your freckles...

223
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,430
There.

224
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,690
Huh?

225
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,970
Maomao?

226
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,960
No...

227
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
Why?

228
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,920
Maomao, you're...

229
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,460
Ah...

230
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,080
<i>They caught me.</i>

231
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,860
All right, let's go.

232
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,740
Concubine Lishu, I look forward to 
seeing you later in the garden party.

233
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,910
Yes, Master Jinshi.

234
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,660
Last is the Precious Consort, Lady Gyokuyou.

235
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,180
<i>He seems to favor Concubine Gyokuyou.</i>

236
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,380
<i>Could it be because of his favorite toy?</i>

237
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,500
<i>He can be so troublesome.</i>

238
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,440
Maomao, you've helped out quite a bit.

239
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,780
Glad to be of service.

240
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,920
Greetings, Concubine Gyokuyou.

241
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,280
Oh, greetings.

242
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,740
My lady, you certainly 
look wonderful in crimson.

243
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,030
Your gorgeous, yet somewhat mysterious 
style must stem from your jade eyes.

244
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,540
Thank you.

245
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,920
Now, to check in on the princess...

246
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,440
Greetings, Master Jinshi.

247
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,440
Oh, it's you, apothecary.

248
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,320
Are you wearing makeup?

249
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,070
No, I'm not.

250
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,990
Your freckles are gone.

251
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,990
Yes, I removed them.

252
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,950
You covered them with makeup, you mean?

253
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,410
I removed my makeup. That's why they're gone.

254
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,760
That doesn't make any sense. 
You're contradicting yourself.

255
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,260
<i>Ugh, what a bother. 
I should have just nodded along.</i>

256
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,250
Every day, I put dried clay 
on my face to add freckles.

257
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,280
I already had makeup on every
 time you saw me before this.

258
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,270
Cosmetics aren't just for making 
a face more beautiful.

259
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,810
Why would you do such a thing?

260
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,910
You really want to know?

261
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,360
It's to prevent being 
dragged into a back alley.

262
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,000
I lived near the brothels, but not 
every man left sexually satisfied.

263
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,460
Some had empty wallets, violent 
tendencies, and venereal diseases.

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,210
A short, skinny, ugly girl
 rarely becomes a target.

265
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,530
Were you ever dragged away?

266
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,970
Attempts were made. Instead, I got kidnapped.

267
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,320
My makeup was faded. They seemed 
to think I was borderline marketable.

268
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,980
I see.

269
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,480
I'm sorry we couldn't police them.

270
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,840
I don't particularly care.

271
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,080
A buyer can't tell if you were kidnapped, or just sold off
legally so there'd be one less mouth to feed.

272
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,000
Doesn't that make you angry?

273
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:13,170
Obviously, it does. But it's not your fault.

274
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,410
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,410
<i>He's being straightforward for once.</i>

276
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,190
That hurts.

277
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,390
Sorry. It's yours.

278
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,440
See you at the party.

279
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,560
A man's hairpin? Why?

280
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,210
Wow! So nice!

281
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,490
I'm jealous!

282
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,520
I want one, too!

283
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,340
<i>I could give it away, 
but how would I split this?</i>

284
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,660
Oh, you broke our promise already.

285
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,420
You're no longer mine alone.

286
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,070
Um, what does that mean—

287
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,420
It's starting.

288
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,060
<i>The garden party begins.</i>

289
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

290
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,780
<i>Next time: "The Garden Party."</i>

291
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,050
Episode 6: The Garden Party
