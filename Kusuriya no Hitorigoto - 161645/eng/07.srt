The Apothecary Diaries

00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,320
Dad!

5
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,240
Dad!

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,840
Episode 7: Homecoming

7
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,340
I wonder if Dad's doing okay.

8
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,850
Right. Yesterday, after the garden party...

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,310
What are you talking about?!

10
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,100
The minister who ate the poison 
is in terrible condition!

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,640
You're sick. Get lots of sleep!

12
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,550
Thanks to them, I got a good deal of sleep.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,650
But sleeping until noon is too much.

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,180
I can't go without makeup now.

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,370
Oh.

16
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,920
You could have taken a day off.

17
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,080
I can't allow myself to do that. 
Please put me to work.

18
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,420
Oh? Your freckles.

19
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm uncomfortable without them. 
Can I keep them on?

20
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,650
I understand.

21
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,240
Everyone kept demanding to know 
who that lady-in-waiting was.

22
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,080
My apologies.

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,430
It's fine.

24
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,880
Anyway, Gaoshun came by this morning 
and hasn't left. What do you want to do?

25
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,490
He seemed bored, so I asked him 
to pull up some weeds.

26
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,870
Weeds...

27
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,760
<i>Back at the garden party, he was
 in a pretty high-ranking seat.</i>

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,370
<i>I guess he really is caring.</i>

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,140
<i>He must win the hearts of 
the ladies-in-waiting in his own way.</i>

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,090
May I use the parlor?

31
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,120
Sure. Hongniang.

32
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,720
Yes.

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
<i>Is it just me, or is Hongniang 
being sparkly-eyed, too?</i>

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,390
Master Jinshi wanted me to bring you this.

35
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,150
This is the soup that Lady Gyokuyou 
was supposed to drink, right?

36
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,640
Yes.

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,520
How kind of him.

38
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,990
Please don't eat it.

39
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,030
I won't.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,490
Silver corrodes quickly. 
This is oxidized and no longer tasty.

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,060
Tasty...

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,410
Did you pick this up with your hands?

43
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,040
No, I didn't touch the bowl.

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
I only picked up the contents 
in a spoon to see if it was poison.

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,570
<i>Shoop shoop shoop.</i>

46
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,010
After that, I immediately 
wrapped it in cloth.

47
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
One moment, please.

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,040
<i>Clip clip clip.</i>

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,930
<i>Clunk clunk clunk.</i>

50
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,800
Cotton, powder, and a brush.

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,940
Yes.

52
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,440
What will you do with these?

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,740
In the apothecary I used to work at,

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,360
we used to put dyes on containers 
that weren't supposed to be touched.

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,240
This is a similar technique.

56
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,740
It's simple. I put some powder 
on this cotton ball.

57
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,190
I dust the bowl with it...

58
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,140
Finally, I brush off the excess.

59
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,960
And there.

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
There's some white marks.

61
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,530
That's where a human hand made contact.

62
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,380
When you touch this with 
your fingers, it leaves a mark.

63
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,880
It's especially visible on silver, 
which is easily corroded.

64
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,770
That's why you thoroughly 
wipe silver items before use.

65
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,560
In other words, the finger
 marks remaining here

66
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,770
were from people who touched 
the bowl after it was wiped clean?

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Indeed.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,340
The size and placement of the finger marks 
allows us to guess how they held it.

69
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,490
The bowl was held...

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,250
What is it?

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,330
Nothing.

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,280
The bowl was held by four people, I think.

73
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,650
Four people.

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,520
First, three people who touched 
the side of the bowl.

75
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,710
The one who poured the soup,

76
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,950
the one who carried it,

77
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,620
and Lady Lishu's taster.

78
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,640
But there was one more.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,510
An "outsider" that touched 
the rim of the bowl.

80
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,610
I believe this unknown 
person poisoned the food.

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,190
If that's true, why is the taster's finger 
mark on the high-rank concubine's bowl?

82
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:00,110
That's simple. Lady Lishu's taster swapped it 
on purpose as a form of harassment,

83
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,880
not knowing it was poisoned.

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Swapped it?

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,340
It's bullying.

86
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,460
A lady-in-waiting is bullying 
a high-ranking concubine?

87
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,220
Sounds like you can't believe it.

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,350
Can you explain?

89
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,320
Let me first say that this is all 
just conjecture on my part.

90
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,840
That's fine.

91
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,880
Do you remember Lady Lishu's 
dress during the garden party?

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,860
Yes. I believe it was a flashy pink color.

93
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,120
Normally, you'd think that if a concubine

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
picked a color that would clash 
with Lady Gyokuyou's dress,

95
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,440
her ladies-in-waiting would 
recommend another one.

96
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,170
Or, at least, they'd wear something
 that matches it themselves.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,670
However, all of her servants 
were wearing white.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,580
That makes Lady Lishu appear like 
a buffoon who can't read the room.

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,560
Ladies-in-waiting should
 allow their mistress to shine.

100
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,810
Come to think of it, that day...

101
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,540
Have you no decency? A crimson dress?

102
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,420
Lady Ah-Duo's ladies-in-waiting

103
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,170
were scolding Lady Lishu's
servants for not doing their jobs.

104
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,970
The rear palace is full of enemies,

105
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,670
so the only people a concubine can 
truly trust are her ladies-in-waiting.

106
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,790
I suspect the ladies-in-waiting recommended
 that dress to their young Lady Lishu,

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,320
and she wore it without realizing 
they'd done it to humiliate her.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,170
She didn't suspect a thing.

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,240
Not only that, but she also tried to swap 
the food to further harass Concubine Lishu?

110
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes, though she was unaware it was poisoned.

111
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,550
It ended up saving her.

112
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,500
But it's still quite distasteful.

113
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,230
Why would they do such a thing?

114
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,350
Lady Lishu became the previous 
emperor's concubine at a very young age.

115
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,960
Then she left the rear palace 
soon after. Her situation is unique.

116
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,940
A wife must sacrifice everything 
to devote to her husband.

117
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,140
We are all taught this from a very young age.

118
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,440
I guess, from that perspective, 
to wed her deceased husband's son

119
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,750
is an indecency beyond words.

120
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,780
I think the mark near the bowl's edge

121
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,180
was left by the person who added the poison.

122
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,890
They must have held the edge 
while stirring in the poison.

123
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,930
I see.

124
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,320
Your fingers must not touch the area 
that noble lips are supposed to go.

125
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,940
That is the teaching of Hongniang.

126
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,930
That's all I came up with.

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,280
May I ask one more thing?

128
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,370
What is it?

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,950
Why did you try to protect that 
taster yesterday?

130
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,210
I'm just curious. This isn't 
an investigation or anything.

131
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,720
The life of a serving girl is worthless 
compared to that of a concubine.

132
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,850
Especially if that life 
belongs to a food taster...

133
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,050
I'll try to explain this to Master Jinshi.

134
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,160
Thank you.

135
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,740
Well, I should be thankful, since she 
did go out of her way to make the swap.

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,780
I was able to taste that poison thanks to her.

137
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,380
I really should have swallowed that soup.

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,510
That is all.

139
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,560
I see. You always impress me 
with how you word things.

140
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,140
Is that so?

141
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,680
This is clearly an inside job, right?

142
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,060
The situation indicates as much, yes.

143
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,380
You make it sound so simple.

144
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,660
I haven't had time to sleep 
at all because of this.

145
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,470
I haven't even been able to change clothes.

146
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,950
I want to stop thinking.

147
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,860
Your natural self is showing.

148
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,400
Who cares? There's nobody here.

149
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,450
I am here.

150
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,580
Can you cut me some slack?

151
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,120
No.

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,180
Nothing I say will move you, huh?

153
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,950
We've had a long relationship.

154
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,590
It's not easy having someone 
look after you since you were born.

155
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,600
Master Jinshi, you forgot 
to remove your hairpin.

156
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Oh, oops. Totally forgot.

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,730
It was hidden in your hair.

158
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,920
I don't think anyone noticed your true status.

159
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,670
Take care of it for me.

160
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,320
You're treating it roughly again.

161
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,320
It's something only special individuals 
can wear, so please take care of it.

162
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,280
I know.

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,700
You don't.

164
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,160
Excuse me.

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,130
Let's do this...

166
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,580
Oh right, did you get any hairpins?

167
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,430
A few.

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,280
I see!

169
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,180
So, now...

170
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,140
You can get out of the rear palace!

171
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,590
Huh? What did you say?

172
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,660
You can get out of the rear palace?

173
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,030
More details please!

174
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,030
Yes...

175
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,200
You can't meet men from the outside 
while at the rear palace,

176
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,360
but if you get special permission, 
a man can escort a female worker outside.

177
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,880
I see, so that's what the hairpins 
they hand out at the garden party means.

178
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,470
Exactly! You can also use the hairpin to ask 
someone to take you out of the rear palace.

179
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,970
I see. Thanks, Xiaolan. I'll give it a try.

180
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,560
No problem.

181
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,770
Maomao, thanks for the hawthorn!

182
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,940
It was yummy!

183
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,070
<i>I received a total of four hairpins.</i>

184
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,410
<i>Two are from men.</i>

185
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,960
Or rather, since one of the two
 lost his important parts,

186
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,250
maybe I shouldn't call him a "man"?

187
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,290
<i>Apothecary!</i>

188
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,540
Right!

189
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,930
Master Lihaku, a lady from 
the rear palace sent you this.

190
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,530
Oh, understood.

191
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>Yikes, did she take that 
consolation hairpin seriously?</i>

192
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,140
<i>But if it's a pretty lady, 
it would be a waste...</i>

193
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,150
Jade Pavilion
 Maomao

194
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,980
I only gave out one hairpin 
at the Jade Pavilion...

195
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,260
Which means...

196
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,650
That one?

197
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,910
Wonder how I should turn her down...

198
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,620
Excuse me.

199
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you for waiting.

200
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,340
Huh? Who are you?

201
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,310
I get that a lot.

202
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,810
Do people ever tell you that 
makeup changes you drastically?

203
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,380
I get that a lot, too.

204
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,210
But anyway, you called me up...

205
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,140
I'd like to go back to my family.

206
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,380
Your family?

207
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,520
Do you know what this means?

208
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,490
I was told that I could go home temporarily, 
as long as you can vouch for me.

209
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,400
You're quite bold.

210
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,450
You, a mere lady-in-waiting, are demanding 
that I, a military officer, vouch for you?

211
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,900
Yes.

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,280
And you summoned me just for that?

213
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,180
Yes.

214
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,650
I don't know if you're dauntless or clueless.

215
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,510
So, little girl, you're trying to 
exploit me for your homecoming?

216
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,970
No, I believe I can offer you 
something valuable in exchange.

217
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,560
Huh?

218
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,140
Verdigris House - Introduction Letter - Pairin
Verdigris House - Introduction Letter - Joka
Verdigris House - Introduction Letter - Meimei

219
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Could I interest you in a flower-viewing 
session at the Verdigris House?

220
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,340
Th-The Verdigris House?! 
You've gotta be kidding!

221
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,320
A night at that super high-class brothel 
could cost a year of my salary!

222
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,950
If you're worried, you can show them 
one of these introduction letters.

223
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,200
Pairin. Joka. Meimei.

224
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,080
Th-That's even less believable!

225
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,670
Those are the Three Princesses that not even 
the highest-rank officials can afford!

226
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,390
If you can't believe it, that's just too bad.

227
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:25,960
Huh?!

228
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,180
My deepest apologies for
 having wasted your time.

229
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,360
W-Wait...

230
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,400
It's very unfortunate, but I'll just
 have to ask someone else.

231
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,600
Please forget I mentioned this.

232
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,220
<i>She has other contacts?!</i>

233
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,320
<i>Hairpins with rose quartz and silver?!</i>

234
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>They're obviously from 
people who far outrank me.</i>

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,170
<i>Just who is this girl?!</i>

236
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,820
<i>In that case, what she said might be...</i>

237
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,070
<i>No, it's too suspicious!</i>

238
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,580
<i>But if it </i>is<i> true, I'll never get another 
chance to meet the Three Princesses again...</i>

239
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,910
<i>What should I do?!</i>

240
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,750
So, what will it be?

241
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,680
I lose.

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,970
Congratulations, Maomao!

243
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,700
Who would have thought 
you'd go before any of us...

244
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,190
I'm so glad!

245
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,190
You must've met someone nice!

246
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,440
Uh, thank you?

247
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,830
Why are you so casual about this?!

248
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,450
Don't worry, I'll bring back souvenirs.

249
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,560
How'd you meet this guy?

250
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,050
Um, coincidence?

251
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm pretty sure she has no idea 
what the hairpin means.

252
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,330
Yes, I'm sure of it. I feel so 
sorry for a certain someone.

253
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,510
This is so amusing.

254
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,460
I wonder what kind of face he'll make...

255
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,030
I suspect some turmoil in the future...

256
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,210
<i>Jinshi was finally able to finish up 
his work and find time to visit</i>

257
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,850
<i>the day after Maomao had already left.</i>

258
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,140
Maomao took off with someone.

259
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,660
On a three-day homecoming.

260
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,410
<i>The pleasure district where
 I grew up isn't far away.</i>

261
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,170
<i>It's walking distance from the rear palace, 
just beyond the walls and moats.</i>

262
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,920
<i>A carriage? How extravagant.</i>

263
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,740
<i>Well, the Three Princesses 
of the Verdigris House are</i>

264
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,720
<i>idolized by the population. Worshiped, even.</i>

265
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,600
<i>Just being able to meet 
them would be an honor.</i>

266
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,940
Oh, there it is...

267
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,900
The pleasure district!

268
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,460
<i>There are girls who enter the brothels, 
wanting to become like them.</i>

269
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,410
<i>But it's not easy.</i>

270
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,770
<i>Even if they become a serving girl, 
a courtesan-in-training,</i>

271
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,750
<i>there's no guarantee that they'll make it.</i>

272
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,510
So, this is the Verdigris House...

273
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,130
Yes.

274
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,450
Verdigris House

275
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,460
It's very dignified.

276
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,640
It's a long-standing, reputable brothel,

277
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,840
providing everything from middle- 
to super-high-rank courtesans.

278
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,100
Hey, long time no see, Grams.

279
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,350
How has everyoneâ€”

280
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,780
What do you mean, 
"long time no see?!" Stupid girl.

281
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,160
Are you okay?! What's with this old woman?!

282
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,080
This is the old madam, 
proprietor of the Verdigris House.

283
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,200
I remember this used to help me 
spit out all the poison I tried.

284
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,830
So, is this the good customer?

285
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,250
He's got a handsome face and a good build.

286
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,990
I heard you're a rising star, too.

287
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,840
Hey, why say that out loud to his face?

288
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,050
Hey, get Pairin.

289
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,760
She should be making tea today.

290
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,720
Yes, ma'am!

291
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,910
Pairin...

292
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,330
Master Lihaku, how strong are your arm muscles?

293
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,580
I do train pretty regularly.

294
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,940
<i>This could be...</i>

295
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,380
This way, please.

296
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,530
I'm getting nervous...

297
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,350
Make a good impression, okay?

298
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,110
Yeah.

299
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,500
So, why'd you vanish for ten 
whole months without a word?

300
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,240
I had no say in the matter. 
Didn't you read the letter I sent?

301
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,760
Of course I read it! That's why 
I'm taking care of that guy for you,

302
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,820
even though we're introduction only!

303
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:43,100
I know, I know. I got half of my pay at 
the rear palace early, as a special deal.

304
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,150
This isn't enough for Pairin.

305
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,580
Can we say it's enough for just some tea?

306
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,020
Idiot! Pairin won't leave
 those muscles alone.

307
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,000
I knew it. But that's not 
something I can control...

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,970
That won't fly! I'll add it to the tab.

309
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,590
I could never afford that...

310
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,040
In that case, bring more good customers.

311
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Similar to that guy. Young, so that we can 
drain him over a long period of time.

312
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,470
<i>Would a eunuch be an acceptable customer?</i>

313
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,720
<i>No way. The courtesans 
would pull out all the stops</i>

314
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,160
<i>and put the brothel out of business.</i>

315
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,800
<i>But I'd feel bad for Gaoshun
 or the quack doctor...</i>

316
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,260
Maomao, your old man should be 
at home. Go visit him already.

317
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,770
<i>Cross just one street, and the face of 
the town changes dramatically.</i>

318
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,530
<i>Rough shacks, beggars, 
and syphilitic streetwalkers.</i>

319
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,530
Things haven't changed.

320
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,920
I'm home, Dad.

321
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,930
Welcome home. You were out for a while.

322
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,930
I'm finally home.

323
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah, on that day, I was out 
getting dyes for my freckles, when...

324
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,230
I still have time left on my term, so I'll 
go back to the rear palace in two days.

325
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:29,990
I see.

326
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,110
I'm sleepy, but I also want a bath.

327
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,970
You should borrow a bath at 
the Verdigris House tomorrow.

328
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,510
Yeah, I'll do that.

329
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,580
The rear palace? What a twist of fate.

330
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,900
<i>Not just some superficial sweetness</i>

331
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,220
<i>I want more warmth than I can even use, oh</i>

332
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,550
<i>Having these selfish idealistic thoughts</i>

333
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,120
<i>I swallowed them again today 
before putting them into words</i>

334
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,290
<i>Still in my memories, 
the scent of fragrant olive</i>

335
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,410
<i>The color of twilight in the city</i>

336
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,230
<i>We were laughing...</i>

337
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:53,140
<i>Filled with sadness, 
the tears welled up in my eyes</i>

338
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,360
<i>I found a glow during those days</i>

339
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,420
<i>I guess I took everything for granted</i>

340
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:18,460
<i>The wind was so loud I covered my ears</i>

341
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:26,000
<i>I gotta stop being like that</i>

342
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,200
<i>Even if I stumble over the words of love</i>

343
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
