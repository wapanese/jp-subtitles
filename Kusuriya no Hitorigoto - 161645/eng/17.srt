The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,030
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,430
In that case,

5
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,650
can you put makeup on me?

6
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,110
Huh?

7
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>He definitely doesn't need it.</i>

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,040
<i>There are many silly wars in history,</i>

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,570
<i>but several of them were 
caused by beautiful women.</i>

10
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,390
<i>If this man, in all his heavenly
 beauty, were to put on makeup...</i>

11
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,240
Are you trying to topple a nation, or what?

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,310
Where'd that come from?!

13
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,580
Why does your imagination do that?

14
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,520
How do you make your freckles?

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,190
<i>Ah, he wants to be </i>less<i> beautiful, not more.</i>

16
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,200
I make some powder out of dried clay,

17
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,470
then mix that into oil.

18
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,150
Can you do that quickly?

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,330
Yes, preparing it takes just one night.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,620
It's a bit too dark for you.

21
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,670
If only there was a drug that can change faces.

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,110
Applying lacquer to your face would do it.

23
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,050
But that would be permanent.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,300
Sounds about right.

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,720
If you want to pretend to be a commoner,

26
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,270
that can be managed.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,830
Do that for me, then.

28
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,200
I want to look like a completely 
different person.

29
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,640
I wonder what he's up to.

30
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,030
That said...

31
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,810
If I'm doing it, I'm going all the way!

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,870
Episode 17: A Jaunt Around Town

33
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,000
Ugh, so cold.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Good morni—

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,300
Why the bad mood 
first thing in the morning?

36
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Nothing. I'm sure you're 
going to be beautiful all day.

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,180
Is that a new form of sarcasm?

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,190
Master Jinshi, do you really want to 
become a different person?

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,110
That's what I said last night.

40
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,850
In that case, excuse me.

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,260
Oh dear!

42
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,250
W-What are you doing, all of a sudden?

43
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,940
No commoner burns such expensive incense.

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,120
Your current outfit is, at best, 
that of a lower-ranking official.

45
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,760
The most exquisite incense from overseas 
should not be within your reach.

46
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,080
How do you know this?

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,590
I've trained my sense of smell to separate 
medicinal and poisonous herbs.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,890
Do you know how a brothel 
identifies good customers?

49
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,690
No. Is it body build, clothing,
 and things like that?

50
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,400
Those too, but one important thing is smell.

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:28,630
Those with multiple showy scents tend to 
be rich but have venereal diseases.

52
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,710
Those who smell like livestock 
don't bathe and are unclean.

53
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,940
Most new visitors to the Verdigris 
House are shooed away.

54
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,460
Ah.

55
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,920
You should direct that inquiry 
to someone who knows that world.

56
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,470
Master Gaoshun, can you find 
a new set of clothes?

57
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,630
If possible, some that haven't been 
washed yet and still smell.

58
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,650
Oh dear.

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,140
Understood.

60
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,650
Hey.

61
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,270
While he finds that...

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,300
What is that?

63
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,700
Oil and salt.

64
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,830
It dulls the sheen of his hair 
and roughens the texture.

65
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,660
Excuse me.

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,930
That should do.

67
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,770
Goodness, must you use 
a fabric scrap to tie it up?

68
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,860
Commoners use whatever is 
available, as long as it works.

69
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,410
Are you sure this is acceptable?

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,250
Sniff. Sniff sniff sniff.

71
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,450
It could be smellier, but this will do.

72
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,130
Master Jinshi, please take your clothes off.

73
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,740
S-Sure.

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>Even though he's like a heavenly maiden, 
he has a well-balanced, muscular physique.</i>

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,610
May I use those towels?

76
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,570
Of course, but for what?

77
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,010
I'm going to alter his build.

78
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,270
Would you both mind helping me a bit?

79
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,810
Master Gaoshun, over there, please.

80
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,280
Yes.

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,160
Lady Suiren, please take this side.

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,640
Understood.

83
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,480
Now, with clothes on top of that...

84
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
My goodness.

85
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,320
Wow.

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,080
<i>Having Master Jinshi's face on that 
awkward body is quite strange.</i>

87
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,950
Next is the face.

88
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,870
Huh?

89
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,670
I mixed several dark-colored shades.

90
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,630
I'll use them to make a suntanned 
complexion, like a commoner.

91
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,880
Close your eyes, please.

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,780
Yeah.

93
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,560
<i>So needlessly beautiful, even to the touch.</i>

94
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,390
<i>Not a trace of facial hair, 
nor any pores for that matter.</i>

95
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,230
<i>If I applied feminine makeup 
on him, I wonder...</i>

96
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,070
<i>Here it is, the one that Meimei forced on me.</i>

97
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,120
Hey, will this take much longer?

98
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,910
Please close your lips, 
but don't purse too hard.

99
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,550
Huh? Right...

100
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,670
What's wrong?

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,480
<i>I'm glad we were alone here.</i>

102
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,140
<i>If anyone else were here, 
it would have been a disaster.</i>

103
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,510
Hey, is something the matter?

104
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,400
No, there's nothing.

105
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,430
That hurt! What happened?

106
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,610
Nothing happened.

107
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,760
Nothing at all.

108
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,770
Right, nothing happened.

109
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,280
Back on track.

110
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,030
Use makeup to paint blotches on the face.

111
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,650
Add circles under the eyes with dark colors.

112
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:02,120
Add some moles, and draw over 
the eyebrows to change their shape.

113
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,630
The remaining makeup can be applied to 
other body parts to make the skin blotchy.

114
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,630
Push some under the fingernails 
to make the hands look unclean.

115
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,990
<i>Solid, manly hands.</i>

116
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,260
<i>I guess he can't have beautiful lady hands...</i>

117
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,010
<i>Hmm? He has calluses.</i>

118
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,640
<i>What does he use other than 
brushes and chopsticks?</i>

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,900
<i>Does he train in sword or polearm fighting?</i>

120
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,650
<i>Not something a eunuch 
usually needs to do, but...</i>

121
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,150
<i>Well, there's no need to ask 
such a silly question.</i>

122
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,570
Wow, that looks dirty.

123
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,340
Please.

124
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,580
A drink?

125
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,960
Whoa! What is this?

126
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,210
Please drink it slowly, licking it 
like you're wetting your lips.

127
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,140
It will make your lips and throat 
swell, to change your voice.

128
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,880
What is it made of?

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,120
Several different irritants.

130
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,140
It's very spicy, but don't worry, 
it's not poison.

131
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,650
Drink all of it.

132
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,890
The final touch.

133
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,130
Cotton.

134
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,030
Please fill your cheeks with it 
to change your face shape.

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,410
It's finished.

136
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,960
Wow, young master, is that really you?

137
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,060
Please don't call me that.

138
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,120
<i>And yet he's still pretty handsome.</i>

139
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,350
<i>Must be hard to have such natural beauty.</i>

140
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,100
<i>Anyway, I did the best that I could.</i>

141
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,690
Now, time to head home! It's been too long.

142
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,930
Xiaomao, you said you'll
 be returning home today, yes?

143
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,740
Yes, I've been granted leave until tomorrow—

144
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,190
<i>I haven't seen him make that face before.</i>

145
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,410
In that case, Master Jinshi's 
destination is on your way.

146
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,000
<i>Yikes!</i>

147
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,520
Even with his disguise, it would be 
suspicious if he had his usual companions.

148
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,050
Oh, that's true.

149
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,900
Don't you agree, Master Jinshi?

150
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,760
You're right.

151
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,420
It would be great if you could come along.

152
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,480
<i>No! Master Jinshi likes the idea, too!</i>

153
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,190
Unfortunately, I don't think it would 
improve matters much if I w-were there...

154
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,880
Perhaps having a bland attendant accompany 
a bland master would look natural,

155
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,450
but I am also known to be
 your personal servant...

156
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,120
I think it would be fine.

157
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,530
In that case, why don't you also 
wear a disguise, Xiaomao?

158
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,190
Huh?

159
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,960
That's a fine idea!

160
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,710
I have all the tools for putting on makeup.

161
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,250
But...

162
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,010
You just have to look completely different 
from your usual appearance, right?

163
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,970
Ugh...

164
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,590
Right?

165
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,070
Y-Yes...

166
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,640
<i>I have such a bad feeling about this...</i>

167
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,030
Master Jinshi, your posture is too graceful.

168
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,620
You stop addressing me so formally, too.

169
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,640
Also, don't say my name. 
That would ruin everything.

170
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,660
Then what should I call you?

171
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,120
Let's see...

172
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,750
You can call me Jinka, my lady.

173
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,000
Huh?

174
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I believe that would be appropriate, 
given our appearances.

175
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>True, this outfit belongs 
to Lady Suiren's daughter.</i>

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,880
<i>Both the fabric and design are nice. 
Doesn't look outdated or anything.</i>

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,770
<i>I suppose I could come off as 
a young lady from a good family.</i>

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,940
<i>Why is he enjoying this so much?</i>

179
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,510
Here is the map. For Xiaomao...

180
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,580
I will take care of the young lady.

181
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,330
Please.

182
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,780
Well, Master Jinka...

183
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,080
Hmm?

184
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,200
Jinka.

185
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,020
Yes, my lady!

186
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,500
Your posture is too straight.

187
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,480
<i>"Jinka," huh? Not the strangest of pseudonyms.</i>

188
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,440
<i>But to use the character "ka," 
for flower, in the name?</i>

189
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,700
<i>I guess "Jinshi" isn't a very manly 
name to begin with, but still.</i>

190
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,040
<i>Maybe I should have made him 
dress up as a woman, after all.</i>

191
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,460
<i>No, I can't do that, if I want to 
maintain peace in our realm.</i>

192
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,710
Where are we headed?

193
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,860
A restaurant just outside
 the pleasure district.

194
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,930
I'm meeting an acquaintance there.

195
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,680
Why do I have to be the bodyguard?

196
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,270
And while hidden? Why would—

197
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,830
<i>The attendant walking in front of 
the mistress? He has a lot to learn.</i>

198
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,790
Jinka.

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,850
Apologies, my lady.

200
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,930
Good.

201
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,480
<i>Not many leafy vegetables yet, 
given the season.</i>

202
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,050
Hmm?

203
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,580
Now that I have my allowance,

204
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,250
perhaps I'll get a chicken too, 
and boil them together.

205
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,520
Grocery shopping?

206
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,230
In that outfit?

207
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,990
<i>I wanted to feed my dad.</i>

208
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,240
<i>He is an impressive doctor 
and apothecary, second to none.</i>

209
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,750
<i>But for some reason, he has absolutely 
no sense of profit or loss.</i>

210
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,590
<i>That's why he lives in that miserable shack,
 despite having what should be</i>

211
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,250
<i>a lucrative profession.</i>

212
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,560
<i>If he were on the verge of starvation,</i>

213
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,800
<i>the old lady would probably 
force-feed him something, but...</i>

214
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,400
What is it?

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,980
Why are you so silent?

216
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,410
Because there's nothing to discuss?

217
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,370
<i>Was that the wrong answer?</i>

218
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,500
Hmm? This smell!

219
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,250
Chicken skewers!

220
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,240
Wait here a moment!

221
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,120
Mister, two skewers please!

222
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,340
Gotcha!

223
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,680
Here. Eat it before it gets cold.

224
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,500
Sure.

225
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,720
<i>The savory skin, the tasty fat...</i>

226
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,270
<i>You can't get this in the palace.</i>

227
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,190
Aren't you going to eat it?

228
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,620
As you can see, no poison.

229
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,670
No, I...

230
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,610
Ah.

231
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Here.

232
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,340
How is it?

233
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,170
Yeah, it's better than I remember
 at camp. The salt is good.

234
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,680
<i>Camp? I thought that type of thing 
was for soldiers, not eunuchs.</i>

235
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,680
<i>He really does seem to be enjoying it.</i>

236
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Oh, welcome back, Gaoshun.

237
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,990
Please don't touch the suitcase. 
I just applied persimmon tannin to it.

238
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,150
The young master's toys are 
full of memories, aren't they?

239
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,160
Yes.

240
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,240
So, how was he?

241
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,290
He was extremely pleased.

242
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,420
It was a surprisingly good suggestion, for you.

243
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,470
Once the young master found 
a favorite toy, he would never let it go.

244
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,640
If I hid it, he would cry like 
the world was ending.

245
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,590
You worked so hard to find him a new toy 
to get him to settle down somehow.

246
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,760
Fixating on one thing...

247
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,870
That is not a luxury that Master 
Jinshi is allowed to have.

248
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,450
Do we have to rush so much?

249
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,880
I thought you're meeting someone.

250
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,710
Isn't it best to arrive early?

251
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,150
You sound like you want to split 
from me as soon as possible.

252
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,460
Do I?

253
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,300
<i>True, I do want to split from him and go 
back to buy some radishes and chicken.</i>

254
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,600
Is...

255
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,480
Is life at the palace so bad?

256
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,820
I'd think it's better than life 
out in the pleasure district.

257
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,950
It's certainly not bad.

258
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,800
I left for work of my own free will,

259
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,570
and the room I've been given is quite pretty.

260
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,540
However, I worry about my adoptive 
father, who I left all alone.

261
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,400
What's wrong?

262
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,080
I just didn't expect you to care about 
anything other than medicine or poison.

263
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,040
He's also my teacher in the art of medicine.

264
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,840
I need him to stay alive for much longer.

265
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,600
He must be quite the skilled apothecary.

266
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,200
He knows not just Eastern medicine, 
but has studied Western medicine, as well.

267
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,110
I heard he studied abroad, 
in the west, when he was young.

268
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,980
That must mean he was extremely talented.

269
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,150
Only those chosen by the empire 
are allowed to study abroad.

270
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,550
Yes, he's extremely talented.

271
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,980
They say heaven only grants 
a person one talent,

272
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,200
but there are some who receive more than one.

273
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,750
That's quite impressive.

274
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,590
Why is someone so remarkable working 
as a pleasure district's apothecary?

275
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,430
It must be because he's short
 on luck, of all things.

276
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,840
He was given two talents, but lost his manhood.

277
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,220
Are you saying your adoptive 
father is a eunuch?

278
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,900
Yes.

279
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,840
<i>I guess the brothel-style joke didn't land.</i>

280
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Apparently, because of his study abroad,

281
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,900
he was made a eunuch by the previous empress 
dowager, the former emperor's mother.

282
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,050
Eunuch, apothecary, doctor...

283
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,700
<i>Did I fail to mention that?</i>

284
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,760
<i>Oh, is that it?</i>

285
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,170
<i>An inn upstairs from a restaurant.</i>

286
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,280
Come, stop in!

287
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,720
Hey, hey, hey.

288
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,390
<i>I see. Now I get why he had to 
disguise himself and everything.</i>

289
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,600
In that case, you could have just 
come to the pleasure district.

290
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,980
Huh? What do you mean?

291
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,730
Nothing.

292
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,240
Apothecary, do you know the regulars 
at the Verdigris House?

293
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,990
Well, the customers that stand out, yes.

294
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,700
Who are they?

295
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,450
I can't say. I have a duty of confidentiality.

296
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,330
Then...

297
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,090
How does one decrease 
the value of a courtesan?

298
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,880
That's an unpleasant question.

299
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,390
There are many different ways, 
especially with high-class courtesans.

300
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,440
At the Verdigris House,

301
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,550
girls take most of the important 
lessons while working as servants.

302
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,400
At that time,

303
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,900
they are separated into those with 
beautiful appearances and those without.

304
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,400
The latter, after debuting, immediately 
take on customers to sell their bodies.

305
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,920
Those with talent, however,

306
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,290
are taught tea ceremony and given a higher
 education with which to entertain patrons.

307
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,910
Their prices go up and up.

308
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,840
Once high enough, they start 
to appear only very rarely.

309
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,110
At that point, you get 
a top-ranking courtesan,

310
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,920
who costs a year's salary just to have tea with.

311
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,200
Some retain their chastity 
until the day they're bought out.

312
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,800
Their value comes from their purity.

313
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,310
Losing that purity would
 easily halve their value.

314
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,180
In addition...

315
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,730
A pregnancy would reduce it to nearly nothing.

316
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

317
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,470
<i>Next time: "Lakan."</i>

318
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,050
Episode 18: Lakan
