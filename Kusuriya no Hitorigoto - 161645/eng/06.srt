The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,300
There's just no sense of decency.

5
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,870
So picky with her food.

6
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,690
It's not like it's going to 
kill her or anything.

7
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,540
Episode 6: The Garden Party

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,870
So cold!

9
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,600
The pocket warmers certainly help, but...

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,070
Not having anything to do 
in this cold is quite an ordeal.

11
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,400
The wind is so cold!

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,090
<i>Couldn't we get a tent or something?</i>

13
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,850
This arrangement seems made to instill
 rivalry between the four concubines.

14
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,410
Look, that's the Empress Dowager.

15
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,000
She seems very youthful.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,820
She is young. She gave birth 
to the emperor when she was...

17
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,780
<i>Wow, she must have worked 
really hard to give birth...</i>

18
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,290
The Empress Dowager has two children, 
the emperor and his younger brother.

19
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,300
The rumor is that the brother is 
too sick to leave his house.

20
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,820
I think he was here until 
a few moments ago, though...

21
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,890
I see.

22
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,010
Huh?!

23
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,510
Who are you calling basic?!

24
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,380
We ladies-in-waiting serve our mistresses!

25
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,310
What's the point in dressing up?!

26
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,610
Pfft. Did you hear that?

27
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,480
Having ugly servants hurts 
the mistress, obviously.

28
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,360
Grr!

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,820
<i>Those are Lady Lihua's ladies-in-waiting.</i>

30
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,800
Oh, Yinghua. And so, the proxy war begins.

31
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,500
Let's go.

32
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,790
I guess you can't help it, seeing 
how you hired that ugly girl.

33
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,750
<i>"Ugly girl?" Does she mean me?</i>

34
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,300
Having someone like that 
around is truly a shame.

35
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,260
What did you say?!

36
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,600
Yinghua!

37
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,820
Calm down!

38
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:13,100
<i>They haven't noticed? And after all the fun 
we shared at the Crystal Pavilion, too...</i>

39
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,060
If you keep acting up, 
I'll tell my father about you!

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,110
I'll have to do things to your body that
 you'd never tell your father about, then.

41
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,870
N-No!

42
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,540
<i>It was just a bit of courtesan-style humor.</i>

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,640
Apologize to Maomao!

44
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,170
Heh.

45
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
Wh-What, nothing to say all of a sudden?

46
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,680
W-Well, I guess that's enough for now!

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,750
You should thank me!

48
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,640
What's her problem?

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,150
Hey Maomao, are you all right?

50
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,330
Your real face is so pretty, 
but those bullies...

51
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,830
It doesn't bother me. That aside, isn't it 
time to change your pocket warmers?

52
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,300
<i>Not only did she grow up in poverty,</i>

53
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,780
<i>her distrust of men is strong enough 
to make her ruin her own face...</i>

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,460
<i>She endured two months of awful 
bullying at the Crystal Pavilion...</i>

55
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,180
<i>Yet she won't complain at all, 
and instead looks after us...</i>

56
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,560
<i>It's only natural that the benevolent 
Master Jinshi looks after her!</i>

57
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,020
<i>They're being delusional again.</i>

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,490
Have you no decency? A crimson dress?

59
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
Another proxy war.

60
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Ah, the Virtuous and
 Pure Consorts' servants.

61
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,000
They don't get along, either.

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,700
The Virtuous Consort is
 fourteen and arrived later,

63
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,690
the Pure Consort is thirty-five 
and has been here the longest.

64
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,720
No wonder they don't get along.

65
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,470
Besides, they used to be 
daughter- and mother-in-law.

66
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,320
Daughter- and mother-in-law?

67
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,550
Um... It's a bit complicated.

68
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:38,040
Ah-Duo
Pure Consort

69
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:38,040
Previous
Emperor

70
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:38,040
Empress Dowager

71
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:38,040
Current Emperor

72
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:38,040
Lishu
Virtuous Consort

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,890
Before, one was the previous 
emperor's concubine,

74
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,250
and the other was our
 current emperor's concubine.

75
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,450
But the previous emperor passed away, right?

76
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,360
The previous emperor's concubine 
left the palace once,

77
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,060
but returned as the current 
emperor's concubine.

78
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,800
The previous emperor 
passed away five years ago.

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
Back then, Concubine Ah-Duo 
was thirty years old,

80
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,040
30 years old

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,040
and Concubine Lishu was nine.

82
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,040
9 years old

83
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,240
<i>I guess it's all politics, but becoming 
a concubine at nine? Wow.</i>

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,680
Unbelievable, right? Being 
a mother-in-law at nine years old.

85
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,600
Nine... Mother...

86
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,540
M-Mother?!

87
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,620
Ah-Duo
Pure Consort

88
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,620
Lishu
Virtuous Consort

89
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,390
Empress Dowager

90
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,390
Current Emperor

91
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,960
Previous
Emperor

92
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,390
Ah-Duo
Pure Consort

93
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,960
Lishu
Virtuous Consort

94
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,190
The one who was the previous emperor's 
concubine was Lady Lishu?!

95
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,830
So that's the young mother-in-law?

96
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,130
As you probably saw, 
Lady Lishu is still very young.

97
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,590
Yes, I see that.

98
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,860
<i>Normally, a white dress would
 suit the Virtuous Consort,</i>

99
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
<i>but that dark pink color...</i>

100
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,050
<i>It obviously clashes with 
Lady Gyokuyou, the Precious Consort.</i>

101
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,940
<i>Maybe she can't read the room?</i>

102
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,770
Thank you for the pocket warmers. 
We'll certainly need them again.

103
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,600
Yes.

104
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,940
It's freezing...

105
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,080
Hold these if you're cold.

106
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,380
Here.

107
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,300
Here!

108
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,140
You're too kind.

109
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,080
Suggesting sharing the warmers with
 the Crystal Pavilion ladies-in-waiting...

110
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,150
And getting Lady Gyokuyou's permission, too.

111
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,350
Well...

112
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,160
A hairpin?

113
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,280
It's how they try to recruit talented 
workers hidden in this flower garden.

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,520
Huh.

115
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,240
It has another hidden meaning, though.

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
I see.

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,410
I said, there's a <i>hidden meaning</i>!

118
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,000
Meaning, huh?

119
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,470
Please have this, young lady.

120
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,300
<i>I guess he's handing them out to everyone 
to make sure no servant feels ashamed.</i>

121
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
Thank you.

122
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,190
I'm Lihaku! Good to meet you!

123
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,920
Like a big dog...

124
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,700
Woof! Woof!

125
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,280
Did he give you that? Let me see!

126
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,660
Just a participation award.

127
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,250
I believe you should have more.

128
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,380
It's been some time.

129
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Yes, my lady, it has been a long time.

130
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,260
That's all for today.

131
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,580
Lady Lihua...?!

132
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,660
We'll take our leave. Have a pleasant day.

133
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,320
Lady Gyokuyou won't like this.

134
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,400
What an understatement.

135
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,620
What will you do with all these hairpins?

136
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,210
<i>Oh.</i>

137
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,910
<i>He looks pretty good there.</i>

138
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,990
<i>I guess he's higher up than I thought.</i>

139
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,270
<i>He doesn't seem out of place 
among the military officers.</i>

140
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,160
<i>Oh look, that officer from earlier.</i>

141
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,770
<i>He's at the very edge, but given 
his age, I guess that's still impressive?</i>

142
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,710
<i>Our glittering eunuch 
isn't there, but who cares?</i>

143
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,870
<i>More importantly, food tasting.</i>

144
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,630
<i>No clouding on the contact point.</i>

145
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
<i>No strange smells.</i>

146
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,550
<i>But swallowing is part of the job as taster...</i>

147
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,210
<i>Now to rinse out the mouth with water... Hmm?</i>

148
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,390
<i>The life of the food taster is expendable.</i>

149
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,020
<i>I guess I'm the only one 
that enjoys eating poison.</i>

150
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,700
<i>You know what would be good? Puffer fish.</i>

151
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,500
<i>Sneak in some innards in the soup...</i>

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,210
<i>That stinging sensation 
on the tongue is so wonderful.</i>

153
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,930
<i>Oops. Must concentrate.</i>

154
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,180
<i>This vinegar fish-and-vegetable dish 
is the emperor's favorite.</i>

155
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,730
<i>I saw it a few times at the rear palace.</i>

156
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,690
<i>Usually it includes blueback, 
but it's jellyfish today.</i>

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,520
<i>The cook responsible for the emperor's food</i>

158
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,190
<i>would never mistake 
the emperor's favorite ingredient.</i>

159
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,840
<i>Lady Gyokuyou has no prominent
 likes or dislikes, either.</i>

160
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,200
<i>Seems like the server messed up.</i>

161
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,340
<i>I guess she doesn't like fish.</i>

162
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,730
<i>She can't refuse to eat it. 
Not in front of the emperor.</i>

163
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,190
<i>I wish I hadn't seen that.</i>

164
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,730
Did you see that, Lihaku?

165
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,310
One of the food tasters
 is really excitable.

166
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,170
Where's the fun in watching 
someone eat while terrified?

167
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,090
Come on, just look.

168
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,040
Huh? That taster... it's that girl from earlier.

169
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,070
J-Just how delicious is that?

170
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,750
This is poison.

171
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,120
The Precious Consort's soup was poisoned?!

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,090
Poison?! Are you sure?

173
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,090
Concubine Gyokuyou?!

174
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,340
The taster swallowed it!

175
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,520
Minister!

176
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
What are you doing?!

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,300
<i>Formal attire is too tight.</i>

178
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,480
Hey! The minister drank
 the soup and collapsed!

179
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,000
The apothecary...

180
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,990
Phew.

181
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,450
Apothecary!

182
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,870
Good day, Master Jinshi.

183
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,290
Your day seems better than mine.

184
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,960
<i>Oh no, I got too excited about
 the poison. It's like I smiled at him.</i>

185
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,340
What are you doing?

186
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,900
Taking you to the infirmary!

187
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,260
I coughed up the poison. I feel quite well.

188
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,820
<i>I would have loved to swallow it, though.</i>

189
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,020
<i>If I did, the poison would have coursed 
through my body by now, and...</i>

190
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,410
Master Jinshi, uh...

191
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,030
What is it?

192
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,390
Give me the rest of the soup.

193
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,240
You're an idiot.

194
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,020
I'm just eager to improve.

195
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,980
After you left, someone tried the soup to see 
if it was really poisoned, and collapsed.

196
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,490
Who was that stupid?

197
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,090
A minister. Now it's become a huge incident.

198
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,120
Use this, then.

199
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,770
It's an emetic agent.

200
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,150
I made it strong enough to
 turn your stomach inside out.

201
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,600
Isn't that <i>also</i> a poison, then?

202
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,360
<i>A new hairpin?</i>

203
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,920
<i>So the eunuchs gets hairpins, too?</i>

204
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,070
<i>His collar is a little disheveled, too. 
Plus his normal glitter is gone.</i>

205
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,290
<i>Is that why he wasn't at the party?</i>

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,800
<i>But right now, he's acting 
his age more than usual...</i>

207
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,340
<i>Or rather, he looks quite a bit younger.</i>

208
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,000
<i>I prefer him like this, somewhat.</i>

209
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,320
<i>Really does the trick!</i>

210
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,270
<i>The palace infirmary has some good drugs!</i>

211
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,240
Are you all right?

212
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,070
Yes, I'm all empty.

213
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:23,360
Well, let's talk about who 
poisoned Concubine Gyokuyou.

214
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,420
I'd like for you to bring 
someone to talk about that.

215
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,170
Who?

216
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,090
Lady Lishu, the Virtuous Consort.

217
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,510
Master Jinshi, how may I be of service?

218
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,970
I'm sorry to bring you to this inelegant place.

219
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,500
This lady-in-waiting wanted to speak with you.

220
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,790
Huh?!

221
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,330
Hmph. A lady-in-waiting?

222
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,540
Excuse me.

223
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,240
I knew it.

224
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,040
Is it fish that you can't eat?

225
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,080
What is this?

226
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,880
Some people have things they cannot eat.

227
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,240
In my case, I can't have buckwheat.

228
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,630
Yet you eat poison?

229
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,770
Leave me alone. I tried to build a tolerance.

230
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,030
However, it made my throat swell 
and it was hard for me to breathe.

231
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,320
Even a little bit caused rashes, 
so it was hard to adjust the amounts,

232
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,860
and I took a long time to heal.

233
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,860
That's what I mean by "cannot eat."

234
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,870
Lady Lishu, how is your stomach?

235
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,920
I can get you a laxative if you....

236
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,830
How did you know?

237
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,120
It was clear that the rear palace 
prepared the food for the garden party.

238
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,050
However, the vinegar dish used 
a different ingredient from the usual one.

239
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:04,050
It seems like Lady Lishu's dish got swapped 
with Lady Gyokuyou's dish by mistake.

240
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,210
I see.

241
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,350
Is it mackerel that you can't eat?

242
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,240
Yeah...

243
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,680
This isn't about just liking
 or disliking certain foods.

244
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,580
It was just hives this time, but sometimes, 
it can cause difficulty in breathing.

245
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,860
Feeding her this knowingly...

246
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,590
would be the same as poisoning her.

247
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,950
You're her food taster, correct?

248
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,520
Y-Yes!

249
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,820
I've taken note of what to be 
careful of in an emergency.

250
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,070
Of course, avoiding these
 foods entirely is best.

251
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,300
Please take a look.

252
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,120
It's not difficult.

253
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,080
However, if something goes wrong, 
not even the palace doctor could fix it.

254
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,590
It could become deadly.

255
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,700
Please keep that in mind.

256
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,850
<i>That should have scared her enough.</i>

257
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,240
What was that about?

258
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,130
I am of lowly birth. Please don't touch me.

259
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,930
You're the only one that says that to me.

260
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,620
Well, everyone's just being kind to you.

261
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,100
Anyway, I must report to Lady Gyokuyou. So...

262
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,800
Wait. Why did you call the food taster in, too?

263
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,920
What do you mean?

264
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,470
Don't play dumb. You asked me to bring her.

265
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,250
To tell her what to be careful of.

266
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,890
So, you're saying the servers made the error?

267
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,310
I don't know. I'm a mere lady-in-waiting.

268
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,860
At least answer me this.

269
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,450
The target was the Virtuous 
Consort, Lady Lishu, right?

270
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,290
Assuming none of the other
 dishes were poisoned.

271
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,030
I see.

272
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,720
What a day.

273
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,950
Is this related to the matter of 
the wooden tablets from the other day?

274
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,020
The lady-in-waiting who came earlier 
had no burns on her.

275
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,300
Who could it be...?

276
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,900
Not just some superficial sweetness

277
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,220
I want more warmth than I can even use, oh

278
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,550
Having these selfish idealistic thoughts

279
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,120
I swallowed them again today 
before putting them into words

280
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,290
Still in my memories, 
the scent of fragrant olive

281
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,410
The color of twilight in the city

282
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,230
We were laughing...

283
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:53,140
Filled with sadness, 
the tears welled up in my eyes

284
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,360
I found a glow during those days

285
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,420
I guess I took everything for granted

286
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:18,460
The wind was so loud I covered my ears

287
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:26,000
I gotta stop being like that

288
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Even if I stumble over the words of love

289
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

290
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,100
<i>Next time: "Homecoming."</i>

291
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,050
Episode 7: Homecoming
