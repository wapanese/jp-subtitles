<i>Fengxian...</i>

4
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,190
<i>I wanted to be with the daughter she left behind.</i>

This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

6
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,120
<i>That was my only wish.</i>

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,200
<i>It's only natural for her to hate me.</i>

8
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,330
<i>But I still wanted her near me.</i>

9
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,380
<i>At any rate, a bet is a bet. 
I'll have to try again another time.</i>

10
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,890
But that man...

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,920
<i>I'll never forgive him.</i>

13
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,900
He put his hand on my daughter's shoulder 
three times during that match.

16
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,620
Now, I wonder how to take my revenge...

17
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:09,920
Hmm?

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,400
Finally awake?

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,740
I hear you're trying to buy out one of our courtesans.

20
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,080
You realize it'll cost you more than 
a few thousand silver, right?

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,460
I know. If ten thousand isn't enough, 
then twenty, thirty, whatever.

22
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,870
A hundred thousand, though, 
might be a bit much.

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,190
Is that so? Then come this way.

24
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,110
I'll let you have your pick.

25
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,940
Sheesh.

26
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,540
Are you sure you want to include 
one of the Three Princesses?

27
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,230
I told you, you can have your pick.

28
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,630
Of course, you'd have to pay accordingly.

29
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,620
This is troublesome.

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,550
<i>No matter how beautifully they dress, 
they all look like go stones to me.</i>

31
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,970
<i>In that case, I guess I can request Meimei, 
since she's been so good to me.</i>

32
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,130
Master Lakan.

33
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,150
I do hold pride in my work as a courtesan.

34
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,890
If it is me that you desire, 
I will accept without hesitation.

35
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,410
But...

36
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,710
If you're going to choose, please choose well.

37
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,940
Sleep, my baby, sleep.

38
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:15,730
Little cuckoo sings as the sun goes down.

39
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,350
Meimei! I didn't allow you to open that!

40
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,600
What are you doing?!

41
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,450
W-Wait!

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,570
<i>A flower that retains its beauty 
even when withered!</i>

43
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,000
<i>If that was supposed to be a message...</i>

44
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,500
<i>Could it be?!</i>

45
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,500
Sleep, my baby, sleep.

46
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,480
Where is she? She cries.

47
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,980
Little birds are so innocent.

48
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:01,750
Off they fly to somewhere far.

49
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,070
Sleep, my baby, sleep.

50
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:18,290
Sleep now, and I'll see you tomorrow.

51
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,320
What are you doing?! 
This place is for the sick!

52
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,850
Get out of here, now!

53
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,430
Hurry up and pick a courtesan from out there!

54
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,680
Yes. I have to choose, don't I?

55
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,520
Are you listening to me?!

56
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,130
I want this woman.

57
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,530
Stop this nonsense!

58
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,780
You're the one who said 
I can pick anyone I want.

59
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,960
I'll pay whatever you ask. A hundred thousand, 
two hundred thousand, whatever.

60
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,980
What are you talking aboutâ€”

61
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,960
Let's play go.

62
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,220
Oh, so that's your move?

63
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,890
Your moves are always so sudden and unexpected.

64
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,720
Maomao must have gotten that from you.

65
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,900
Big Sister, you should have been 
honest from the start.

66
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,600
Why so late...

67
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,020
I will buy out this courtesan.

68
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,180
<i>This woman, beautiful as a balsam flower.</i>

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,310
Episode 24: Jinshi and Maomao

70
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,470
<i>Basen was the one that accompanied me to the Verdigris House to drop off that man.</i>

71
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>I'm tired.</i>

72
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,030
Hmm?

73
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,850
Dammit, the wicked father-daughter duo.

74
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,850
<i>That's Concubine Loulan.</i>

75
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,250
<i>I guess they stayed out here 
after the garden party.</i>

76
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,260
<i>So that must be her father,</i>

77
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,420
<i>the one that pushed hard to get 
his daughter in the rear palace.</i>

78
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,130
<i>At any rate...</i>

79
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,910
<i>I really wish this guy would quit bad-mouthing
 high-ranked officials in public.</i>

80
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,180
<i>If someone overheard, I might get 
mistaken for saying it right along with him.</i>

81
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,750
<i>I guess he's still young.</i>

82
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,480
Hey.

83
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,690
Master Jinshi wants to see you.

84
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,940
You must be tired.

85
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,070
No, not really.

86
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,820
Oh!

87
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,730
Oh my, you've lost so much weight!

88
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,580
I'm fine.

89
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,420
Here you are, Xiaomao. Eat up.

90
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,550
There's plenty more where that came from.

91
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,930
I thought you hated our master strategist.

92
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,430
Master Jinshi.

93
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,130
It's not that I hate him.

94
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:07,040
After all, I'm here because 
he was able to land that shot.

95
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,310
Was there really no other way to phrase that?

96
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,460
It's just facts. I'm not sure 
how you imagined it,

97
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,420
but she wouldn't have gotten 
pregnant if she didn't want to.

98
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,700
There's drugs to prevent 
or abort pregnancies.

99
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,030
Ending it would have been easy, early on.

100
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,580
She must have given birth 
because she wanted to.

101
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,880
Rather, perhaps he was the one who was tricked.

102
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,920
The strategist?

103
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,790
Women are clever.

104
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,640
It's not hard to make a good estimate of 
when one is most likely to become pregnant

105
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,810
by tracking blood flow cycles.

106
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,270
As a courtesan, she was able to control 
the date of his visits by sending him letters.

107
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,420
<i>That must have been why she lost her
 mind when things didn't work out.</i>

108
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,300
<i>So much so, that she was 
willing to hurt herself.</i>

109
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,070
<i>Not only that, but she sent 
the baby's little finger as well.</i>

110
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,640
Master Jinshi, that man never talks to you 
outside your office, does he?

111
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,610
Now that you mention it...

112
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,890
That man isn't able to recognize human faces.

113
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,130
Unable to recognize faces? What do you mean?

114
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,210
He can tell the shapes of eyes and mouths,

115
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,490
but he's unable to view 
the parts together as a whole.

116
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,020
I hear that everyone's faces 
look the same to him.

117
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,730
That's unfortunate.

118
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,610
Yes, that's what my adopted father 
told me too, when he explained it to me.

119
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,700
He's an unfortunate fellow. 
It has troubled him all throughout his life.

120
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,990
Huh...

121
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,950
But, for some reason,

122
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,970
he's able to discern my face, 
and my adopted father's.

123
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,090
That's why he has that
 strange attachment to me.

124
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,870
Master Jinshi,

125
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,570
if that monocled face came at you and told you,
 "Call me Papa!", how would you react?

126
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,810
I'd be tempted to shatter that monocle.

127
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,680
Right?

128
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,970
He keeps stressing that he's my father, 
but he's a stud-horse, at best.

129
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,570
<i>I wonder if he understood the message 
behind the withered rose?</i>

130
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,970
<i>Well, it's fine if he didn't.</i>

131
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,950
I do dislike him, but I don't hate him.

132
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,980
I'm grateful that I was able 
to become Luomen's daughter.

133
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,210
You seemed pretty disgusted when you saw him.

134
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,970
Master Jinshi, you still have a lot to learn.

135
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,340
When I tried to stop 
that ceremony, he helped me.

136
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,160
I think he had the feeling 
something was going to happen.

137
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,490
The strategist? I didn't think he knew 
anything about it at that point.

138
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,820
He doesn't collect evidence 
to make predictions like I do.

139
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,380
He goes off gut feelings to sense when
something's not right, and he's rarely wrong.

140
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,160
The annoying part is that he's too lazy 
to actually do anything himself.

141
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,550
<i>If that guy actually took action,</i>

142
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,130
<i>I might have had the resurrection 
drug in my hands right now!</i>

143
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,810
<i>I know this is just jealousy.</i>

144
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,480
<i>He's so talented that my dad would 
praise him with no caveats.</i>

145
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,290
<i>He doesn't realize how blessed he is.</i>

146
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,820
Hmph!

147
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,730
He will never become your ally, but you 
shouldn't make him your enemy, if possible.

148
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,990
Understood.

149
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,090
What's wrong?

150
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,600
Nothing, just...

151
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,000
Please remember that 
no father <i>wants</i> to be disliked.

152
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
<i>A few days after returning to the rear palace,</i>

153
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,300
<i>Meimei sent me a package.</i>

154
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,680
<i>Inside was a letter 
describing who bought out who,</i>

155
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,010
<i>and a beautiful shawl.</i>

156
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,630
Listen, Maomao.

157
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,260
When I get bought out, 
you have to dance for me.

158
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,510
<i>To be honest, I wanted to send off Meimei.</i>

159
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,010
<i>That courtesan, kinder than anyone else...</i>

160
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,900
<i>I'm surprised I still remember all of that.</i>

161
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,220
Hey.

162
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,180
Whaâ€”

163
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,520
What are you doing?!

164
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,650
Master Jinshi? Why are you here?

165
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,360
I got a report that another weird 
woman was climbing the outer wall.

166
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,910
I had no choice but to respond.

167
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,570
I thought I was being sneaky, but...

168
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,940
Of course I'd get caught.

169
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,210
Stop causing trouble.

170
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,330
Why'd you have to be the one to investigate? 
They could have just sent someone else.

171
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,680
A kind guard recognized your face 
and came directly to me.

172
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,930
You might think you're keeping a low profile, 
but not everyone agrees. Remember that.

173
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,940
Understood.

174
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,360
Now, your turn. What were you doing?

175
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,300
In the pleasure district, when sending off 
a courtesan who's been bought out,

176
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,700
it's customary for the other 
courtesans to dance.

177
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,380
What is it?

178
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,980
Well, I'm surprised you know how to dance.

179
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,990
I was taught dancing as part of 
the bare minimum of education.

180
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,590
There were rumors on the outside 
that the weirdo was buying out a courtesan.

181
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,430
I'm sure there were.

182
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,250
He also sent a notice of leave.

183
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,570
He's going to take a vacation 
for at least ten days.

184
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,430
What a troublesome man.

185
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,880
My elder sister told me that 
they're hosting a banquet

186
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,610
not just for three days and three nights,

187
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,400
but a whole seven days and seven nights.

188
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,400
<i>There's no way to know how much 
he spent on the courtesan,</i>

189
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,980
<i>but just from the number 
of lamps being put out,</i>

190
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,410
<i>it's only natural to assume 
it's no normal courtesan.</i>

191
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,010
<i>But the actual courtesan being 
bought out is never seen in public.</i>

192
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,590
<i>Rumors of the Verdigris House continue to grow.</i>

193
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,550
<i>Just how old Grams planned it.</i>

194
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,940
By the way, who did 
the strategist buy out, anyway?

195
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,150
Who knows?

196
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,300
You do.

197
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,980
No matter how beautiful, 
she will be no match for you.

198
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,600
That doesn't answer my question.

199
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,530
<i>But you still don't deny it.</i>

200
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,260
<i>The woman who the man 
bought out won't last long.</i>

201
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,580
<i>Nobody told me about the woman who 
birthed me during my days at the brothel.</i>

202
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,330
<i>The old lady probably kept everyone silent.</i>

203
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,590
<i>But those types of things tend to leak out 
from seemingly small cracks.</i>

204
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,340
<i>That I was the reason the Verdigris House 
almost went out of business, once.</i>

205
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,850
<i>My relationship with the woman who always 
chased me off, ashamed for losing her pride.</i>

206
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,600
<i>That nightmare was a thing 
that really happened in the past.</i>

207
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,250
<i>That woman has no memories of being a mother.</i>

208
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,320
<i>All she has now is a crooked little finger.</i>

209
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,860
<i>None of that matters to me anymore.</i>

210
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,550
<i>I'm happy to be Luomen's daughter.</i>

211
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,440
Master Jinshi.

212
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,490
What is it?

213
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,900
You can cut off the tip of a finger 
and it grows back.

214
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,270
Is now the time for that?

215
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,900
Whoa!

216
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,330
W-What happened?!

217
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,600
Looks like my wound opened up.

218
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,230
Sure looks that way to me, too!

219
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,210
I guess the dancing got my body warmed up.

220
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,440
I have a high pain tolerance, 
perhaps due to my drug experiments.

221
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,900
It's fine, I'll stitch it right back up.

222
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,040
Master Jinshi, I can't work like this.

223
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,370
Don't do that here!

224
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,170
Um, Master Jinshiâ€”Whoa!

225
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,840
Please let me down.

226
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,340
You'll open up your wound further.

227
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,500
What if someone sees us?

228
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,240
It's too dark to see, anyway.

229
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,190
Besides, this is the second time 
I'm carrying you like this.

230
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,050
<i>The other time must have been when 
I was knocked out from that injury.</i>

231
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,440
Master Jinshi.

232
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,900
This may not be the best time,

233
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,790
but there's something I've meant 
to say for a long time.

234
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,200
What's this, all of a sudden?

235
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,210
It's a very important thing I have to say.

236
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,190
Out with it, already.

237
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,280
Master Jinshi...

238
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,060
I'd like that ox bezoar, please.

239
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,930
Ow!

240
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,040
Wait, you don't have it?!

241
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,950
Don't be absurd!

242
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,200
I don't even...

243
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,580
<i>How immature, headbutting me out of nowhere.</i>

244
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>But I guess he's easiest to talk to 
when he's being immature.</i>

245
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,610
Maomao!

246
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,780
Master Jinshi's here to see you!

247
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,450
Coming.

248
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,870
Excuse me.

249
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,180
Are you feeling better now?

250
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,440
Yes. Everyone's very nice to me 
at the Jade Pavilion.

251
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,680
So, how may I be of service?

252
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,900
Well, something interesting came up.

253
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,770
I'd like to ask something of you.

254
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,890
<i>Oh, this again.</i>

255
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,420
So, what is it that you 
would like for me to do?

256
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,980
<i>Maomao's story has just begun.</i>

257
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,080
<i>What kind of incident 
will she get mixed up in next?</i>

258
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,050
