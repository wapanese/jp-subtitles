The Apothecary Diaries

00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

Episode 14: The New Pure Consort

5
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,390
Are you serious?

6
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,410
Of course.

7
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,990
Maomao's back. I have to make 
the best of that situation.

8
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,360
That should do for now.

9
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,040
<i>Unlike the rear palace, there are barely 
any herbs growing in the outer court.</i>

10
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,130
<i>I need to work on fixing that.</i>

11
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,500
Xiaomao.

12
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,980
I thought I asked you to clean the office.

13
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,600
Right away!

14
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,530
Don't spend too much time on gardening.

15
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,140
<i>She's tough.</i>

16
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,880
What's going on?

17
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,700
I have no idea.

18
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,660
Crystal Pavilion
  Wise Consort
  Lihua

19
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,660
Jade Pavilion
  Precious Consort
      Gyokuyou

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,340
Hmm.

21
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,810
Excuse me.

22
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:50,910
Hmm?

23
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,320
Do you know about the new Pure Consort 
who just entered the Garnet Pavilion?

24
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,220
Yes.

25
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,380
<i>The replacement for 
Concubine Ah-Duo, who left.</i>

26
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,480
Well, the rear palace wants
 to educate the concubine.

27
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,350
And for some reason, they want
 you to be the teacher.

28
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,270
Teacher
Maomao

29
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Hah, that's a funny joke.

30
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,010
Nobody's joking. Look who recommended you.

31
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,990
Recommended?

32
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,450
Precious Consort
Gyokuyou

33
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,050
And here's another.

34
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,000
Wise Consort
Lihua

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,940
Lady Lihua, too?

36
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,170
Oh...

37
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,430
<i>It was that, huh?</i>

38
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm counting on you.

39
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,560
<i>I can't ignore a request from two concubines.</i>

40
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,800
<i>They were nice enough to clearly
 write the payment amount.</i>

41
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,270
<i>Our old lady is surely 
hiking up that price, though.</i>

42
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,940
<i>Now's my chance...</i>

43
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,650
This is all teaching 
material for your class?

44
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,940
Yes. And here's the invoice.

45
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,970
This seems about right.

46
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,600
I wonder why the ink is
 a different color here.

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,250
<i>Yikes!</i>

48
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,480
<i>She really is tough.</i>

49
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,010
<i>I guess I can't prey on our young master 
while this old maid is around.</i>

50
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
What's inside?

51
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,100
<i>I can't let him see my 
precious teaching material.</i>

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,390
F-Fine, I won't look.

53
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,210
Do you need help carrying it?

54
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,570
I'm fine.

55
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,590
<i>If I have to do it, I'm going all the way.</i>

56
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,320
<i>It's been a while.</i>

57
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>It's relaxing, this weird girly atmosphere.</i>

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
It's Master Jinshi!

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,100
He's so beautiful as always.

60
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,320
This is quite a crowd.

61
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,380
They must have heard 
the rumors about the lesson.

62
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,630
Just so you're all aware, only the high-ranking 
concubines will be attending today.

63
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,470
If you have no other business, you may leave.

64
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,730
<i>Is this eunuch some
 sort of mythical monster?</i>

65
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,700
No!

66
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,290
Why?

67
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,250
Only the high-ranking concubines will 
attend the lesson. You said so yourself.

68
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,210
<i>Dammit, he's built tougher than he looks.</i>

69
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,060
What we'll discuss is a secret 
technique for women only!

70
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,010
<i>Lady Gyokuyou.</i>

71
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,990
<i>Beautiful, as always.</i>

72
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,650
<i>Seems like Lady Hongniang 
hasn't changed, either.</i>

73
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,940
<i>Lady Lishu seems very nervous.</i>

74
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,400
<i>I guess it's natural, seeing how there are 
three other high-ranking concubines here.</i>

75
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,410
<i>As long as that taster is with her, 
she should be better off than before.</i>

76
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,690
<i>Lady Lihua seems to have recovered 
fully to her healthy, voluptuous form.</i>

77
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,550
<i>Hmm? Is that the lady-in-waiting 
from the face powder incident...?</i>

78
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,420
<i>She doesn't have to be so wary of me.</i>

79
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,760
<i>And Concubine Ah-Duo's replacement,</i>

80
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,440
<i>the new Pure Consort, Concubine Loulan.</i>

81
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,970
<i>Is that flashy southern
 outfit her usual style?</i>

82
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,420
<i>Her face seems northern, but I can't tell 
what she really looks like under all that.</i>

83
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,110
<i>Given her age, the emperor 
will most likely spend time with her.</i>

84
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,120
<i>It seems the power balance at the rear 
palace shouldn't be negatively affected.</i>

85
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,940
<i>Eh. Who cares.</i>

86
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,380
My name is Maomao. I will be
 serving as your instructor today.

87
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,460
What I will be teaching you today

88
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,010
is a secret technique 
shared only amongst women.

89
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,480
Please do not share it with others.

90
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,930
Now, here are the learning materials.

91
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,110
Wow!

92
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,690
Oh... Oh...

93
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,480
What's going on in there?

94
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,690
I can't tell.

95
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,660
Phew. Hmm?

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,120
Good work. That took a while.

97
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,030
<i>This guy was eavesdropping for sure.</i>

98
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,560
What's wrong?

99
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,630
What's going on here?

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,090
Goodbye, tired routines!

101
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,260
Do this, then this...

102
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,190
No way. No way, ever...

103
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,140
Lady Lishu!

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,970
I just taught them, as ordered.

105
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,150
<i>At least I made the two who 
recommended me happy.</i>

106
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,740
<i>I couldn't tell what she was thinking at all.</i>

107
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,260
<i>Use the knowledge as you see fit.</i>

108
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,760
Hey, what kind of lecture did you give?

109
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,100
You can ask the emperor later 
if he liked it or not.

110
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,940
Hey.

111
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,310
I'm spent.

112
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,530
Looking forward to that bonus reward!

113
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,140
This way!

114
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,810
I'll stay out of it.

115
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,030
So cold...

116
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,020
Master Lakan! Master Lakan!

117
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,780
Master Lakan, there you are.

118
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,580
Hmm.

119
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,680
Something of interest?

120
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,580
No, nothing at all.

121
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,860
<i>I wonder what that sound was last night.</i>

122
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,230
<i>Even though he's a eunuch, he has work 
outside of the rear palace as well?</i>

123
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,660
<i>It's not like he can just ignore silly bills.</i>

124
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,650
<i>It's good paper. I could sell these 
for a pretty good amount.</i>

125
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,410
<i>What a waste, burning it all.</i>

126
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,260
<i>The trash burning place is over 
by the military offices...</i>

127
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,230
Xiaomao.

128
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,420
It's cold outside.

129
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,090
Thank you.

130
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,510
<i>He's so thoughtful. Shame he's a eunuch.</i>

131
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,490
This is from Master Jinshi! 
I merely delivered it!

132
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,900
I see.

133
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,860
<i>He needs permission just to give warm 
clothes to a servant? What a bother.</i>

134
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,780
Thank you, Master Jinshi.

135
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,870
Don't worry about it.

136
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,240
<i>The outer court is several times 
larger than the rear palace,</i>

137
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,500
<i>yet I see hardly any medicinal herbs growing.</i>

138
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,680
<i>I guess the only notable ones 
are dandelions and mugworts,</i>

139
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,070
<i>which are abundant anywhere.</i>

140
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,640
<i>It's winter, so they're hard to spot, too.</i>

141
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,300
<i>Maybe I'll plant some seeds 
around here as well.</i>

142
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,640
Ooh, red spider lily!

143
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Here too! And there, too!

144
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,360
They're so tasty when 
the bulb root is put in water.

145
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,160
If I fail to remove the poison, it causes 
horrible stomachaches, though.

146
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,860
Hmm?

147
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,910
It's Master Lihaku.

148
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,550
His belt's a different color.

149
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,330
Did he get a promotion?

150
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,710
Hmm? Oh hey, little lady.

151
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,740
Master Lihaku.

152
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,000
Accompanying a concubine or something?

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,340
Rare to see you outside the rear palace.

154
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,340
<i>He doesn't know I got fired.</i>

155
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,820
<i>Master Lihaku. He fell in love 
with Big Sister Pairin,</i>

156
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,800
<i>one of the Three Princesses 
of the Verdigris House.</i>

157
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,860
<i>He's working hard to get a promotion 
for his love. How adorable.</i>

158
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
Hmm?

159
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,930
<i>The cost of a night with Pairin is equal to 
half the annual salary of a commoner.</i>

160
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,790
<i>Since that's too expensive, 
I hear he often visits the Verdigris House</i>

161
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,620
<i>to have tea with the servant girls.</i>

162
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,220
<i>I never ran into him there.</i>

163
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,030
<i>I guess once a man has a taste 
of the heavenly nectar,</i>

164
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,880
<i>he can't help but try to get at least a glimpse.</i>

165
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,460
<i>He's really working hard.</i>

166
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,350
Hmm? What is it?

167
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,530
Nothing. I've been transferred 
from the rear palace

168
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,150
to the personal quarters of a certain official.

169
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,430
Personal quarters? 
Who's crazy enough to do that?

170
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,440
Yeah, I wonder the same.

171
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,820
By the way, were you busy with something?

172
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,980
A little.

173
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,380
Just a small fire, not rare 
at this time of the year.

174
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,490
I've been brought out to investigate 
since they can't determine the cause.

175
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,490
<i>Unknown cause? So that must be 
what the noise from last night was.</i>

176
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,440
Was anyone injured?

177
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,770
Just the warehouseman. 
He's not critically injured, but—

178
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,400
Hey, don't get too close.

179
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,540
Understood.

180
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,550
<i>Why wouldn't you expect me 
to get curious after hearing that?</i>

181
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,430
<i>Soot reaching the adjacent building.</i>

182
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,680
<i>Shrapnel all over the building.</i>

183
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,310
<i>This is more like an explosion than a fire.</i>

184
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,560
<i>I see.</i>

185
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,190
<i>They suspect arson.</i>

186
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,320
<i>That's why Master Lihaku is here, 
not a lower-ranking official.</i>

187
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,850
<i>This isn't just some random warehouse.</i>

188
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>It's the palace, where the emperor is.</i>

189
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,940
<i>Our empire is overall pretty peaceful, 
but there's always someone with issues.</i>

190
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,720
<i>There's the occasional barbarian attack,</i>

191
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,900
<i>and a famine or drought here and there.</i>

192
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,740
<i>Who knows how long peace with 
the neighboring nations will last?</i>

193
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,750
<i>I'm sure some people in some foreign 
countries have some complaints.</i>

194
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,240
Charcoal? No, it's a burnt potato.

195
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,400
What a waste.

196
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,360
So this was food storage.

197
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,500
<i>Ivory? Looks like a smoking pipe.</i>

198
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,070
Quit snooping around by yourself!

199
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,060
A pipe...

200
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,700
<i>An explosion. Food storage. A pipe.</i>

201
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,770
Hey!

202
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,950
Can you hear me?!

203
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,200
I can hear you.

204
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,950
<i>I'm just not listening to you.</i>

205
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,200
Does this warehouse store the same kind
of stuff as the burnt one?

206
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,170
Yeah. The oldest things go in the back.

207
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,300
Can I have this?

208
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,290
I suppose so.

209
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,750
And this, too?

210
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,540
I also need a hammer, a saw, and some nails.

211
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,730
What are you trying to do?

212
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,100
Just a quick experiment.

213
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,830
This will do.

214
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,610
You're strangely good at this.

215
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,030
I grew up poor. I'm good 
at making things I don't have.

216
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,950
That's flour, right?

217
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes. It was in the warehouse.

218
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,800
Is this what you needed?

219
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,350
Yes. And the flame source I asked for?

220
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,830
Right here.

221
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,720
Thank you, sir.

222
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,720
I don't get it.

223
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,380
It's ready. Please stand back. It's dangerous.

224
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,990
Y-Yes...

225
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,200
Master Lihaku, it's dangerous.

226
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
What danger could there be?

227
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,120
Whatever you do, I'm a military 
officer. How can I be at risk?

228
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,450
Understood. But it really <i>is</i> dangerous, 
so please do be very careful.

229
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,400
You have to run right away.

230
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,790
Huh? Run from what—

231
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,880
Put it out!

232
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,700
See? I told you so.

233
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,640
So, what caused the explosion?

234
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,650
It was this.

235
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,900
Flour?

236
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,920
Yes. Fine powder, like wheat 
or buckwheat flour, burns easily.

237
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,950
The particles can catch fire when airborne.

238
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,530
This was likely what sparked it.

239
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,250
A pipe...?

240
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,680
If someone snuck inside to take 
a quick smoke in private,

241
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,300
the outside wind could flow in, 
blowing the powder into the air.

242
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,260
If the pipe was lit at that time...

243
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,380
The flour filling the air would 
catch fire, and cause an explosion.

244
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,520
Please let the warehousemen know 
not to smoke in the warehouses.

245
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,470
How do you know these things?

246
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,780
Once, at the Verdigris House, 
I blew up a room I borrowed.

247
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,030
You...

248
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,960
You stupid girl!

249
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,860
<i>The old lady was real scary back then.</i>

250
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,020
But powders exploding? How strange.

251
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,220
Almost nothing in the world is truly strange.

252
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,300
Anything that feels strange 
is just not yet known.

253
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,460
Achoo!

254
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Please take care to not catch a cold.

255
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,520
If you do, find Luomen in the pleasure 
district. His medicines work well.

256
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,560
Right.

257
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,560
<i>Dad's so bad at marketing. 
I should help him out a little.</i>

258
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,070
<i>Hopefully, he'd pay a visit 
while he's out there for Pairin.</i>

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,380
Well, I'm heading back to work now.

260
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Sure.

261
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,660
Oh, I accidentally brought this with me.

262
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,440
If I clean this up and put a new mouthpiece 
on it, would it be good again?

263
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,670
It might sell for a pretty good price.

264
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,950
That said, it seems too impressive 
for a warehouseman to own.

265
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,770
Might be something precious.

266
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,430
Maybe I'll clean it up and give it back.

267
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,400
Dammit!

268
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,920
I'm worthy, too... Dammit!

269
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

270
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Next time: "Raw Fish."</i>

271
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 15: Raw Fish
