The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,780
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,300
That man can't be trusted!

5
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,080
Episode 9: Suicide or Murder?

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,370
That'd create other issues.

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,420
Drinks! Bring more booze...

8
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,560
Wow, he's changed a lot.

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,080
Seeing his face makes the drinks taste bad.

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,970
On that, I can agree.

11
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey... Thanks.

12
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,360
How much longer are you going to sulk?

13
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,740
I'm not sulking.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,160
Please don't forget that 
you're still on the job.

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,370
I understand.

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,460
<i>He doesn't understand.</i>

17
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,710
<i>The one known as Jinshi does not
 respond in such a childish way.</i>

18
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,050
<i>The one known as Jinshi does not
 attach himself so strongly to a toy.</i>

19
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,470
Here is some more work.

20
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,720
<i>It took considerable effort to get</i>

21
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,860
<i>Concubine Gyokuyou to stop laughing 
uncontrollably and explain.</i>

22
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,490
Misunderstanding...?

23
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,050
<i>The payment she gave in return 
for acting as her guarantor</i>

24
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,700
<i>was a meeting with a star courtesan.</i>

25
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,630
<i>Who knew that girl had such connections?</i>

26
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,860
<i>Who knows what image 
the master had in his mind?</i>

27
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,870
<i>Youth is a scary thing.</i>

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,590
<i>That said, to put so much effort 
into finishing work quickly...</i>

29
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,800
<i>And going out to meet her...</i>

30
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,050
<i>Only to find out she had left 
for home with another man...</i>

31
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,560
<i>That must have been quite a shock, for sure.</i>

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,900
They should put more thought into these...

33
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,920
<i>Many bureaucrats try to pass bills 
that benefit them personally.</i>

34
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,160
<i>I feel sorry for my master, who has to do 
extra work for those useless bills.</i>

35
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,380
Master Jinshi!

36
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,550
It's already after hours. Can this wait?

37
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,510
It's not about work... Well...

38
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,600
Sir Kounen?!

39
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
Master Jinshi.

40
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,850
Let's go!

41
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,860
That's terrible news...

42
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,360
<i>Someone high up bit the dust.</i>

43
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,160
<i>Maybe this is callous, but I can't 
sympathize with someone</i>

44
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,490
<i>who I've never met or heard of.</i>

45
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,250
<i>A man past the age of fifty, 
who died from drinking too much.</i>

46
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,040
<i>Clearly self-inflicted.</i>

47
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,170
<i>Since he went out of the way to make
 the head lady-in-waiting leave...</i>

48
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,880
Apothecary, do you think 
the alcohol was really what killed him?

49
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,960
<i>I knew he'd ask.</i>

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,420
Anyone who likes alcohol should know that 
overindulgence in drink is poison in essence.

51
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,250
Drinking constantly can sicken the organs.

52
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,170
Drinking too much in one
 sitting can lead to death.

53
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,990
It was a party for a group of co-workers, 
and I heard he had a lot to drink.

54
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,610
That could kill him.

55
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,940
But Sir Kounen could 
really handle his drink.

56
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,700
I don't think overindulgence would kill him.

57
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,330
<i>The man who died was named Kounen.</i>

58
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,930
<i>He was a dynamic warrior 
who drank entire jars of alcohol,</i>

59
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,840
<i>and had a well-liked personality, to boot.</i>

60
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,080
Gaoshun.

61
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Yes.

62
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,060
This is the drink from that party.

63
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,220
<i>Ooh, booze!</i>

64
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,600
The specific jar that Sir Kounen drank from

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,270
got dropped on the floor 
and the contents were lost.

66
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,100
So, if that jar had poison in it, 
we'd have no way of knowing.

67
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,980
Indeed...

68
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,120
<i>How modest. He realizes 
he's asking for the impossible.</i>

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,390
<i>He should just be excessively 
shiny like his usual self.</i>

70
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,580
<i>For a while now, Master Jinshi has seemed
much more childish than before.</i>

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,930
<i>It's both sweet and salty.</i>

72
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,510
<i>Like someone took a sweet
 drink and added salt to it...</i>

73
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
What's wrong?

74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,220
It's a distinct taste.

75
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,960
Yes. Sweet, isn't it? 
That's how Master Kounen liked it.

76
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,420
He had a serious sweet tooth.

77
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,170
He'd never lay a finger on even 
the finest smoked meats and rock salts.

78
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,390
Huh...

79
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,330
I heard he used to love spicy foods, but 
suddenly developed a sweet tooth one day.

80
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,490
Even his meals became all sweets.

81
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,370
That'll cause diabetes.

82
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,010
Stop spoiling my nostalgia with reality.

83
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,790
You're having more?

84
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,730
<i>From spicy to sweet, huh?</i>

85
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,340
Were there salts available at the party?

86
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,600
Yes. Rock salts, moon cakes, and dried meat.

87
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,140
Do you want those, too?

88
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,160
No, I'll be done with the drink by then.

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,890
That's not what I meant...

90
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Can you get the jar that 
Master Kounen was drinking from?

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
It's broken and in pieces.

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,240
That's fine.

93
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,800
Also, there's one thing 
I want you to look into.

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,500
Excuse me.

95
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,440
Here is the report.

96
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,930
Thank you.

97
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,000
I knew it.

98
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,960
Here's the bottle.

99
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,940
Is it safe to lick that?

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,260
There's no poison here.

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,540
Salt?

102
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:08,190
Yes. Master Jinshi, you mentioned how Master 
Kounen suddenly developed a sweet tooth, right?

103
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,750
And that he only ate sweet foods after that?

104
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,420
Yes.

105
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,300
Yet this jar contained so much salt
that it left crystals behind when it dried.

106
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,090
Salt is essential to the human body, 
but too much salt can also be poisonous.

107
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,060
So, the cause of his death is...

108
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,840
Given the amount he drank, 
and the salt included,

109
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,570
it's easy to conclude this was the cause.

110
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,140
Yes, but you should be able to tell 
if something tasted this saltyâ€”

111
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,290
But he didn't. Please take a look at this.

112
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,060
It's a report on Master Kounen's lifestyle.

113
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Judging from what's written here,

114
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,390
it seems like Master Kounen 
lost his ability to taste salt.

115
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,470
Oh, no...

116
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Kounen seemed like a serious 
and skilled bureaucrat,

117
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,930
with a stoic personality.

118
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,610
Many years ago, he lost his wife 
and child to an epidemic.

119
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,050
From that day on, he was all work, all day.

120
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,990
His only forms of entertainment 
were drinking and sweets.

121
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,490
There is an illness that 
eliminates the sense of taste.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,310
It can be caused by 
an unbalanced diet or stress.

123
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,900
Serious people will sometimes 
repress their feelings,

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,250
and that stress could lead to illness.

125
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,340
So, who put the salt in the bottle?

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,090
That's not for me to determine.

127
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,100
However, there was also salt 
in the drink I had yesterday.

128
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,770
It could have been put there 
by someone at the party

129
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,150
who didn't like sweet drinks.

130
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,260
Alternatively, there are many who 
resent overly serious coworkers.

131
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,940
Maybe they put some salt in the drink

132
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,240
because they didn't like him and 
wanted to pull a little prank.

133
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,000
But because he kept drinking 
seemingly without issue,

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,180
perhaps they kept adding more, 
hoping he would notice.

135
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,660
Gaoshun.

136
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,360
Yes.

137
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,280
Understood.

138
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,360
<i>I'm a coward.</i>

139
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,500
<i>I've practically named the culprit at this 
point, given the amount of hints I dropped.</i>

140
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,870
<i>But I don't want to be directly
responsible for someone getting punished.</i>

141
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,540
Sorry for your trouble. Thank you.

142
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,150
It's fine.

143
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,150
<i>An obsidian tassel...</i>

144
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,820
<i>He's in mourning.</i>

145
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,410
Was he such a person of high esteem?

146
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,910
Yes. He helped me a lot when I was younger.

147
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,520
<i>He seems like a normal young man.</i>

148
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,410
<i>I guess he is human, after all.</i>

149
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,800
Oh, right.

150
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,560
Huh?

151
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,520
Here's your reward.

152
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,930
A bottle?

153
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,390
Yes. It's not the same 
as the one from yesterday.

154
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,120
Booze!

155
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,410
Don't drink it out in the open.

156
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,380
Yes! Thank you!

157
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,420
You don't seem all that grateful.

158
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,120
Is that so? Perhaps you
 should return to your work.

159
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,830
<i>That reaction... I bet he's slacking off.</i>

160
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,560
Perhaps you should finish it 
before it starts piling up.

161
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,050
I <i>am</i> working seriously...

162
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,380
What kind of work?

163
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,220
For example, there's a certain bill.

164
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,520
The idea is to set an age limit 
for alcohol consumption,

165
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,080
to prevent young ones from
 losing themselves in drink.

166
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,100
Huh?

167
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,860
The bill proposes a ban on drinking 
alcohol until the age of twenty.

168
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,500
Master Jinshi...

169
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,030
Please, please don't pass that bill!

170
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,600
Hmm. Well, it's not something 
I can decide on my own.

171
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
M-Master Jinshi!

172
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,340
Doctor!

173
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,790
This way!

174
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,980
There it is!

175
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,680
We're lucky it's winter now.

176
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,420
She's still in good shape, 
despite being a drowned corpse.

177
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,640
How can you look directly at her?

178
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,010
Where was she found?

179
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,180
She was floating in the outside moat.

180
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,940
From her dress, we assumed 
she was a servant at the rear palace.

181
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,400
<i>I see. That's why they called our doc.</i>

182
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,010
<i>But a doctor in charge of 
autopsies acting like this...</i>

183
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,650
<i>He truly is a quack.</i>

184
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,170
Little lady, can I leave this to you?

185
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,080
Nope.

186
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,850
Huh?

187
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,490
I've been ordered to not touch corpses.

188
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,670
That's unexpected.

189
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,750
Master Jinshi!

190
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,150
Greetings, Master Jinshi.

191
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,150
You don't seem to be 
uncomfortable around corpses.

192
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,130
I've gotten used to them.

193
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,510
The pleasure district is just
 one street away from lawless chaos.

194
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,070
Why can't you touch corpses?

195
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,430
My teacher told me not to.

196
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,710
Is it an aversion to death?

197
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,580
No...

198
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,230
It's because humans can become 
medicinal ingredients, too.

199
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,370
Given your curiosity, once you give that a try,

200
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,720
it wouldn't be long before 
you start digging up graves.

201
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,480
Do not cross that line, ever.

202
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,820
Y-Yes.

203
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,280
I see.

204
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,700
<i>What a rude response.</i>

205
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,070
Doctor, could you please 
do a proper autopsy?

206
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,950
Understood...

207
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,580
Eek!

208
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,260
"Eek," indeed...

209
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,650
<i>She's tall. Hard wooden shoes... 
Bandages on one foot...</i>

210
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,480
<i>Fingers are all red.</i>

211
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,210
<i>It must have been cold in that water.</i>

212
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,680
The girl was a servant and was
 working normally yesterday.

213
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
The guard believes she climbed the wall 
last night and threw herself in.

214
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,280
A suicide.

215
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,750
Suicide...

216
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,200
What do you think?

217
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,920
I can't tell if she committed suicide,

218
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,770
but I think it was impossible 
for her to do it alone.

219
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,090
What do you mean?

220
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:10,880
There were no ladders on the wall, 
and no other climbing tools.

221
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,350
The rear palace walls are at least 
four times my height.

222
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,930
So, you mean she couldn't
 have climbed it without tools.

223
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,980
In most cases.

224
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,300
Strictly speaking, scaling the wall 
without tools is possible.

225
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,330
Do you remember the ghost issue 
from a while ago?

226
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,770
Concubine Fuyou?

227
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,360
Yes.

228
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,750
I was wondering how she climbed the wall,

229
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,660
so I did a thorough investigation of it.

230
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:43,080
That's where I found the protrusions 
that I believe the craftsmen used.

231
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,870
That said, it would be difficult 
for most regular women,

232
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,090
especially those with 
bound feet, like that servant.

233
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,440
<i>Foot binding is a custom where 
small feet are considered beautiful.</i>

234
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,170
<i>It's not done on all women,</i>

235
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,150
<i>but I do occasionally see the distinct 
walking style in the rear palace, too.</i>

236
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,340
If it's not suicide,

237
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,780
are you saying it's murder?

238
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,680
I don't know that.

239
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,160
But I think it's fairly certain that 
she was alive when she fell in the moat.

240
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,380
She must have clawed at 
the walls to try to climb out.

241
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,040
Her fingers were bloodied and red.

242
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,040
Yes...

243
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,100
Suicide, or murder...

244
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,180
<i>I would never think to take my own life.</i>

245
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,390
<i>I'd hate if someone killed me, too.</i>

246
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,480
<i>If I died, I wouldn't be able 
to test any more drugs or poisons.</i>

247
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,130
<i>But if I were to die...</i>

248
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,330
What are you thinking about?

249
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,950
About what kind of poison I would use to die.

250
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,460
Are you trying to die?!

251
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,790
Not at all. But nobody knows when they'll die.

252
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,580
Even if it's not something they 
wished for, a malicious third party

253
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,060
can cause an undesired death.

254
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,890
Like with Master Kounen.

255
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,100
<i>Nobody knows when it could happen.</i>

256
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,730
<i>There is no way to resist fate...</i>

257
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,980
Master Jinshi.

258
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,890
What is it?

259
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,610
If you're ever tasked with executing me, 
can you make sure it's with poison?

260
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,360
Where'd <i>that</i> come from?!

261
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,950
If I made a mistake, you would 
probably be the one to give the order.

262
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,210
<i>Did I step in it just now?</i>

263
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,220
I'm sorry, it's not my place to say.

264
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,550
I won't complain if it's 
a hanging or a beheading.

265
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,820
No, really, why are you saying all this?!

266
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,820
Because I'm a commoner.

267
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,640
My life is easily taken away 
over the slightest mistake.

268
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,270
I would never do such a thing.

269
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,480
It's not a "would-or-would-not" 
type of issue. It's "can-or-cannot."

270
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,540
<i>Looks like I struck a nerve there.</i>

271
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,100
If there's no further 
business, I'll excuse myself.

272
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,320
<i>Later, I heard through rumors</i>

273
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,840
<i>that the dead servant was at the garden 
party where the poisoning took place.</i>

274
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,040
<i>They found a will with
 some relevant content in it,</i>

275
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,870
<i>so the case was closed as a suicide.</i>

276
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,160
The report from the other day is finally ready.

277
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,410
It's been two months since I asked for 
you to find someone with burns on their arms.

278
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,910
You took too long.

279
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,660
I'm very sorry.

280
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,580
So, who is it?

281
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,210
Yes. It's actually higher up than I thought.

282
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,470
Fengming, from the Garnet Pavilion.

283
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,220
Head lady-in-waiting under Concubine Ah-Duo.

284
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,230
I see.

285
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,490
You're excused.

286
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,800
Concubine Ah-Duo...

287
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,900
<i>Not just some superficial sweetness</i>

288
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,220
<i>I want more warmth than I can even use, oh</i>

289
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,550
<i>Having these selfish idealistic thoughts</i>

290
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,120
<i>I swallowed them again today 
before putting them into words</i>

291
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,290
<i>Still in my memories, 
the scent of fragrant olive</i>

292
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,410
<i>The color of twilight in the city</i>

293
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,230
<i>We were laughing...</i>

294
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:53,140
<i>Filled with sadness, 
the tears welled up in my eyes</i>

295
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,360
<i>I found a glow during those days</i>

296
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,420
<i>I guess I took everything for granted</i>

297
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:18,460
<i>The wind was so loud I covered my ears</i>

298
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:26,000
<i>I gotta stop being like that</i>

299
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,200
<i>Even if I stumble over the words of love</i>

300
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:50,010
Next Time

301
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,970
<i>Next time: "Honey."</i>

302
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,010
Episode 10: Honey
