1
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,120
Are you serious?

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,360
So, what would you do?

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,580
After all, you're the gardener 
maintaining my flower garden.

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>He truly is cunning.</i>

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,760
<i>How ironic.</i>

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,440
<i>No matter how hard I try, 
both in intellect and martial arts,</i>

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,780
<i>I can only slightly 
outperform a regular person.</i>

8
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,520
<i>Instead, I am granted an appearance 
more beautiful than anyone.</i>

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,530
<i>The things I truly want 
are so far out of reach.</i>

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,200
<i>I was dissatisfied at first, 
but I've gotten over it.</i>

11
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,680
<i>My sweet gaze, my sweet voice...</i>

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,960
<i>I'll use my superior tools to my advantage.</i>

13
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,770
<i>I'm aware that ultimately, I'm just a child
 floundering on the emperor's palm.</i>

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,880
As you wish.

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,740
<i>I'll manage his rear palace, 
or whatever else he wants.</i>

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,120
<i>That's the only way I can choose my own path.</i>

This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

21
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,300
I don't need this much, Big Sis.

22
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,030
Sure, sure. Take this, this... Oh! And this, too.

Episode 13: Serving in the Outer Court

24
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,290
I'm not going to be using lipstick.

25
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,170
What do you mean? Can't you put in 
the least bit of effort to look proper?

26
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,110
Only courtesans have to get
 prettied up to go to work.

27
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,840
I want to work with herbs...

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,600
Ow!

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,360
You've landed such a nice job at the palace!

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,020
And you're telling me you can't dress up 
appropriately for the position?

31
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,720
You have to be thankful 
for that every day.

32
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,540
Otherwise, you'll lose your great customers.

33
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,790
<i>Meimei is really convincing.</i>

34
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,680
<i>She's old enough to start considering 
retirement as a courtesan,</i>

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>but her popularity hasn't waned at all,</i>

36
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,160
<i>because she has the intellect</i>

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,000
<i>to entertain her customers 
through song, chess, and go.</i>

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,330
Maomao.

39
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,840
Wow, what a huge package.

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,520
Pairin, Joka.

41
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,740
I'm glad you found a good 
workplace. Go make a fortune.

42
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,810
Got it.

43
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,780
If you could bring back some paying 
customers, that would be great too!

44
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,880
Find some good, rich guys.

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Someone with vigor, pretty please!

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Uh, yeah...

Verdigris House

49
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,460
<i>My new workplace... Or should I say, 
the workplace I'm returning to,</i>

50
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,500
<i>is the area in the palace 
called the rear palace.</i>

51
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>It's a garden of women who are there
 to have children for the emperor.</i>

52
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,350
<i>I was supposed to work here 
as a lowly servant girl, but...</i>

53
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,340
You with the freckles, stay here

54
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,330
<i>I solved the mystery of the dying 
infant heirs, which drew attention.</i>

55
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,960
<i>I was promoted to lady-in-waiting 
for Lady Gyokuyou,</i>

56
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,780
<i>then got sucked into various 
troubles as a food taster.</i>

57
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,990
<i>After that, a bunch of stuff happened, 
leading to me getting fired.</i>

58
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,650
<i>Who would've thought I'd be back again?</i>

59
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,580
<i>I succumbed to the allure 
of the caterpillar fungus,</i>

60
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,240
<i>but looking back, that might 
have been careless of me.</i>

61
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,000
<i>Of course, seen from the outside, 
it's a huge lucky break.</i>

62
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,760
<i>I do have some reservations about leaving 
my dad behind to go live elsewhere for work,</i>

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,470
<i>but the rules are a lot less strict this time,</i>

64
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,630
<i>and I'm not treated as missing anymore.</i>

65
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,010
<i>Dad also said I should do as I like, but...</i>

66
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,540
<i>What did he mean by that, I wonder?</i>

67
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,110
I'm home.

68
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,070
They loaded you up, didn't they?

69
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,530
What should I do? I definitely need 
my mortar and pestle, and my notebook.

70
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,580
I can't bring less underwear—

71
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,690
Maomao, you probably can't take those with you.

72
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,380
Huh?

73
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,920
You're not a doctor.

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Having such things would make you appear 
like you're plotting a poisoning.

75
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,820
Come now, don't make that face. 
It was your decision to go.

76
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,240
You can't back out now.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,530
Really?

78
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,880
You should be able to gradually get 
permission to bring more things in.

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,160
Get ready and go to sleep. 
Tomorrow is your first day.

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,650
Fine...

81
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,250
Well, you haven't done this in a while.

82
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,500
I thought you weren't a baby anymore.

83
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,510
Well, it's cold.

84
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,950
We'll be lonely again.

85
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,770
Not really. This time, 
I can come back any time I want.

86
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,400
You're right. You can come 
home any time you want.

87
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,610
<i>I have no mother.</i>

88
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,470
<i>But I have a caring dad, a nosy old granny,</i>

89
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,910
<i>and a lively group of big sisters 
to keep me company.</i>

90
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,540
<i>I can come home any time.</i>

91
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,010
Thank you for waiting, Master Jinshi.

92
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,860
Please take care of our little girl.

93
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,730
We got her all dolled up for you.

94
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,130
Don't you forget, Maomao.

95
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,040
I know. Good customers, right?

96
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,280
Good. Now go on.

97
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,370
What a way to start the morning.

98
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,910
Let's go.

99
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,410
Uh, yeah.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,960
Take care.

101
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,460
I'm off.

102
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,800
She's pretty.

103
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,420
Have you ever seen her at
 the Verdigris House before?

104
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,390
This is your fault, Master Jinshi.

105
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,140
Hmm?

106
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,750
I got a lot of unwanted attention.

107
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,930
That's because you're...

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,270
What is it?

109
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,780
Nothing.

110
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,930
Good work. May we proceed?

111
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,760
Yes!

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,280
Apothecary. While you're here, 
go back to your usual freckled face.

113
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,350
Huh?

114
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,820
Understood.

115
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,110
Hey, I heard the manager of the rear palace

116
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,940
bought out a courtesan 
from the Verdigris House.

117
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,780
The Verdigris House? Is that where 
the famous Three Princesses are?

118
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,910
The Verdigris House?

119
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,660
<i>What is this guy doing?</i>

120
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,020
And this is?

121
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,270
My house.

122
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,050
Huh?! Why?!

123
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,970
This is your new workplace.

124
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,050
Master Gaoshun, I was under the impression 
we were returning to the rear palace...

125
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,990
We fired you once already, so we can't 
just put you back in the same position.

126
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,570
You will be working in the outer court now.

127
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,160
The outer court...

128
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,820
Yes. The rear palace is 
considered the inner court.

129
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,080
The outer court lies outside of that.

130
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,140
There are many public offices there. 
I'll show you around later.

131
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,840
Welcome home. It must have been cold.

132
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,100
I am Suiren, his attendant. 
You must be Xiaomao.

133
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,060
Y-Yes.

134
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,440
<i>Xiaomao?</i>

135
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,340
There are two separate buildings,

136
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,200
one with the office and one 
with the personal residence.

137
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,700
The area ahead is the young
 master's room, but...

138
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,210
<i>"Young master?"</i>

139
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,630
You should be all right.

140
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,880
<i>This room's about the same size as
 the one I used at the Jade Pavilion.</i>

141
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,250
<i>If this place had a stove and a nearby well...</i>

142
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,720
Still, this place seems too well-built 
for a servant girl's quarters.

143
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,320
Xiaomao?

144
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,430
Yes.

145
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,310
I don't intend to make you do servant labor.

146
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,270
Huh?

147
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,390
I told you, you're going to 
work in the outer court.

148
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,900
You're going to take the court lady exam.

149
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,410
C-Court lady exam?!

150
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,470
A cotton garment? That's generous.

151
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,850
Good morning, Lady Suiren.

152
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh, good morning, Xiaomao. 
It's good that you wake up early.

153
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,320
I'll help.

154
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,850
It's fine, I'm almost done.

155
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,410
Can you just help serve?

156
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,240
Yes. Um, where are the other attendants?

157
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,250
There are none.

158
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,340
The office side is fine, but I couldn't let 
anyone handle the personal side.

159
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,840
The young master's food is
 especially out of the question.

160
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,170
So, you do all of this work by yourself?

161
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,950
We had some new girls a few times,

162
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,850
but well, things happen, and they don't last.

163
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,790
<i>Did they lace his food with aphrodisiacs?</i>

164
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,190
<i>Or try to steal things?</i>

165
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,840
I mean, who likes finding 
unfamiliar underwear in their closet?

166
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,540
Huh?

167
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,040
On top of that, it was made of hair.

168
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,640
That sounds like a lot.

169
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,660
Yes, it certainly was.

170
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,910
Come, young master, please wake up.

171
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,990
It's time for breakfast.

172
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,460
<i>So much wasted sex appeal...</i>

173
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,310
<i>I can see why only Master Gaoshun 
and Lady Suiren enter this room.</i>

174
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,760
<i>A woman who saw this would lose herself easily.</i>

175
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,660
<i>A man would pounce on him right away.</i>

176
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,620
<i>He truly has a sin-inducing air about him.</i>

177
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,990
<i>Sort of like an insect in mating season.</i>

178
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,820
<i>I wonder if I could collect this eunuch's 
scent and sell it as an aphrodisiac?</i>

179
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,040
If you want, I can get you a new room.

180
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,680
<i>What brings this about?</i>

181
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,940
<i>I don't get it, but is this my chance 
to get a stove and well?!</i>

182
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,910
<i>He needs to tell me clearly 
if he wants me to understand.</i>

183
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,640
<i>I can manage the stove somehow, 
so for starters...</i>

184
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,640
In that case, how about
 a stable with a well nearby?

185
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,850
A stable.

186
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,020
Yes, a stable.

187
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,730
No stables.

188
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,510
So, shall we?

189
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,420
Yes, please.

190
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,460
<i>Master Jinshi got left behind.</i>

191
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,960
<i>I assumed he had nothing to do, since 
he was always loitering in the rear palace,</i>

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>but he's actually pretty busy.</i>

193
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,720
There are many military officers 
on the east side of this area,

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,020
so please stay away if possible.

195
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,470
Understood.

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,980
<i>The palace he showed me around was huge.</i>

197
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,760
<i>I needed more than all my fingers and toes</i>

198
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,980
<i>to count all the named buildings 
and departments.</i>

199
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,900
<i>Can I learn them all?</i>

200
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,910
<i>My ability to learn about things
 I'm not interested in is below average.</i>

201
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,150
This is the Director of Waters.

202
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,510
It's the department in charge of rivers, 
dams, and water utilization projects.

203
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,540
I see.

204
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,050
<i>The rear palace had more medicinal ingredients.</i>

205
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,050
<i>My dad must have planted them 
while he worked there.</i>

206
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,960
Xiaomao, when you become a court lady, 
the outer court will be your workplace.

207
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,930
Yes.

208
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,730
<i>Court lady, huh?</i>

209
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,920
Oh, good timing, Xiaomao.

210
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,710
Can you take this charcoal to the office?

211
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,530
Yes.

212
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,930
Excuse me.

213
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,670
So, this is Master Jinshi's office.

214
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,260
It's not extravagant, 
but everything here is top class.

215
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,600
How high up is our young master?

216
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,480
<i>Sizing up the new girl? Not a good atmosphere.</i>

217
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,990
<i>The court ladies of the outer court 
are like secretaries.</i>

218
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,990
<i>They have the right qualifications, 
background, and education.</i>

219
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,970
<i>They're nothing like the hodgepodge 
of female officials at the rear palace.</i>

220
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,000
<i>Which explains their high self-esteem...</i>

221
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,500
Hmm?

222
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,740
<i>And therefore, they won't go out of their 
way to clean, since that's not their job.</i>

223
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,680
Just who do you think you are?

224
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,470
<i>I guess they grow well when they're fed well.</i>

225
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,250
Are you listening?!

226
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,310
Why is someone like <i>you</i> assigned 
directly to Master Jinshi?!

227
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,940
<i>I guess staying quiet would irritate them more.</i>

228
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,780
In other words, you're all jealous of me?

229
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,000
Watch your mouth!

230
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
<i>Wrong choice of words.</i>

231
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,660
<i>Fine, then.</i>

232
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,670
Are you implying I'm getting
 special treatment?

233
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,480
There's no way that could be right.

234
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,700
Why would he, a heavenly maiden 
of a person, fall for an ugly girl like me?

235
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,480
Does the noble figure in your 
mind have such bad taste?

236
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,270
Would he go out of his way 
to eat meatless chicken bones,

237
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,490
when there are heaps of delicious abalones 
and boar meat in front of him?

238
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,820
If that's the case, well, he must 
have some <i>interesting</i> proclivities.

239
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,500
I don't really get it myself, 
but does he truly have "special tastes"?

240
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,690
I see, so it's a "special taste"—

241
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,720
T-That's impossible!

242
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,710
R-Right!

243
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,670
Why did he hire you, then?

244
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,050
This is the reason.

245
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,390
<i>I just tried out some burn 
medicine the other day,</i>

246
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,450
<i>so it's really messed up right now.</i>

247
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,810
<i>Stings!</i>

248
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,100
That heavenly maiden 
has a heavenly heart, too.

249
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,280
He gives a person like me 
a way to make a living.

250
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,940
Let's go.

251
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,040
Done and done.

252
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,070
"Interesting proclivities..."

253
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,530
Do you get harassed like that a lot?

254
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,060
Besides, why are you raising your left arm—

255
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,810
I'm off to my next cleaning duty.

256
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,800
Are you studying?

257
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Sneak, sneak.

258
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey!

259
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,770
Sneak, sneak!

260
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,050
Xiaomao.

261
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,120
Please be quiet.

262
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,140
<i>And thus, the day of the exams came.</i>

263
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,230
Why did you fail?

264
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,150
<i>Why did you think I'd pass?</i>

265
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,150
<i>Maomao became Jinshi's personal servant.</i>

266
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,390
What should we do?

267
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,370
What should we do, indeed?

268
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,180
Ow!

269
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,110
There shouldn't be any reason 
for you to go beyond this point.

270
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,140
<i>Could you say that </i>before<i> you hit me?</i>

271
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,900
<i>The scent of sandalwood, mixed 
with another, distinctly bitter smell.</i>

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,720
The military, huh?

273
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:49,930
Next Time

274
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,220
<i>Next time: "The New 
Pure Consort."</i>

275
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,930
Episode 14: The New Pure Consort

276
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,930
