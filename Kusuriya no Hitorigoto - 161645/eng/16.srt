The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,730
This is a bit troublesome...

5
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,740
Huh?

6
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,120
<i>He usually doesn't hesitate 
to bring trouble my way.</i>

7
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,450
<i>How out-of-character for him.</i>

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,620
What is it?

9
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,660
Well...

10
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,880
It's something related to 
an acquaintance of an acquaintance.

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,220
A metalworker who was 
the palace purveyor passed away

12
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,940
without passing on his techniques to 
his sons, who were also his apprentices.

13
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,890
They say some of those techniques 
were completely secret and unknown.

14
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,650
So, you want to figure out 
the metalworker's secret technique.

15
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,770
You make it sound so simple.

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Besides, why are you so
 enthusiastic this time around?

17
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,950
Does it seem that way?

18
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,000
The metalworker's three sons 
were all his apprentices.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,540
As the father died, it's said that one of 
the sons will take his place as the purveyor.

20
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,120
There were distribution instructions 
for the father's mementos in his will.

21
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,210
The workshop shack for the eldest son.

22
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,650
Furniture with excellent workmanship 
for the second son.

23
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,520
A fishbowl for the youngest son.

24
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,400
And one final note: "You all should have 
a tea party together, like old times."

25
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,860
A tea party? What a mysterious will.

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,070
Did he mean a literal tea party? 
Or does that have another meaning?

27
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,200
The sons have no idea after
 hearing the will, either.

28
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,210
The mementos seem very unbalanced, too.

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,810
A shack, furniture, and a fishbowl?

30
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,220
The younger the son, 
the lower the value, it seems.

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,610
What were those items like?

32
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,180
I haven't heard the details. But...

33
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,850
If that piques your interest, 
here is the address.

34
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,370
He said, if it piques your interest, 
you should go take a look.

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,740
<i>How well-prepared.</i>

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,660
<i>It's like he expected this 
to happen. Interesting.</i>

37
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,580
If I can have time tomorrow...

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Yeah...

39
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,460
<i>I'll probably get more work 
on my plate when I get back.</i>

40
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,050
Episode 16: Lead

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,150
Oh, that's...

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,220
<i>Basen, was it?</i>

43
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,340
Like the last time, you're my follower.

44
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,080
Don't do anything unless I allow it.

45
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,100
Understood.

46
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,650
<i>Like last time, he only 
says the bare minimum.</i>

47
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,470
<i>I don't think he likes me much.</i>

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,680
<i>If he's harmless, I don't mind.</i>

49
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,950
Coming.

50
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,670
Master Basen. We've been 
notified of your visit.

51
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,130
Hmm?

52
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,550
Ah, yes, that belonged to my father.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,720
He had a strange hobby, 
collecting weird things.

54
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,180
Huh...

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,700
Is that the workshop shack?

56
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,520
Yes. That said, we do our work 
in the main house now.

57
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,690
The shack is used as a tea house 
for the craftsmen.

58
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,910
Come in.

59
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,820
Hey, I brought the guests.

60
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,580
Yeah.

61
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,040
Thank you for coming out.

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,040
<i>These must be the elder brothers, and 
the first man must have been the youngest.</i>

63
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,600
The furniture is placed strangely.

64
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,840
Hey.

65
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,260
<i>Indeed...</i>

66
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,970
<i>Having things in the center 
like this would get in the way.</i>

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,240
<i>The room still looks kind of nice though,</i>

68
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,360
<i>probably because of how the table
weirdly brings the room together,</i>

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,890
<i>and how classy this chest of drawers looks.</i>

70
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,270
<i>There's metalwork on the corners.</i>

71
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,910
<i>The top row has three drawers. A keyhole 
in the center drawer in the second row.</i>

72
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,330
<i>A different metal is used as an accent here...</i>

73
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,700
Hmm?

74
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,250
<i>Is this bolted in place?</i>

75
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,290
Hey, that's mine.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,540
You're free to look, but don't touch.

77
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,050
<i>Right, the second son was given 
furniture as his memento.</i>

78
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,540
Hmph!

79
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,260
<i>If this chest is the 
aforementioned furniture,</i>

80
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,420
<i>then this man must be the second son.</i>

81
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,680
<i>Which must mean that the 
tall man is the eldest son.</i>

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,750
<i>The window placement is strange, too.</i>

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,520
<i>It's western-style, and strangely tall.</i>

84
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,160
<i>Despite the ample sunlight 
that could have come in,</i>

85
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,990
<i>the huge chestnut tree outside ruins it.</i>

86
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,420
<i>The sunlight that gets in is
 filtered through the branches.</i>

87
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,460
<i>And this is the only spot 
that gets that light.</i>

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,460
Hmm?

89
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,460
<i>This mark. Was something 
placed here for a long time?</i>

90
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,470
Can you really figure out 
what our father left behind?

91
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,490
That's...

92
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,770
You'd have to elaborate on 
your end for us to know more.

93
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,490
It's exactly as you heard.

94
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,170
Our father kicked the bucket without 
giving us the secret technique.

95
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,660
And the only thing he left me is this shack.

96
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,310
And for me, this chest of drawers.

97
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,950
F-For me, this.

98
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,080
<i>Made of glass, so it's expensive.</i>

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,250
<i>I assumed the fishbowl would 
be wooden, or ceramic at best.</i>

100
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,380
<i>In that case, I guess all 
the mementos have some value.</i>

101
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,380
What was he thinking?

102
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,480
Thanks for this gift, but it only has 
one key, which doesn't fit the keyhole.

103
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,640
Doesn't fit the keyhole?

104
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,690
This is probably the key for the center 
row, but it won't fit the keyhole.

105
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,050
The three drawers on top are 
supposed to open with the same key,

106
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,350
but the actual key is nowhere to be found.

107
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,700
What's the point of inheriting it?

108
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,390
I'm in the same boat. What's the point of getting
 this shack if I can't move the chest out?

109
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,150
What a bother.

110
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,410
Dad was...

111
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,340
D-Dad was probably thinking...

112
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,370
I envy you. You got something 
you could easily sell.

113
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,640
Yeah. It's not much, but it'd still be 
worth enough to live off of for a while.

114
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,350
I don't get Dad at all.

115
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,110
What possible benefit could there 
be to having tea party now?

116
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,760
<i>Hmm, now what should we do?</i>

117
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,500
<i>The two elder brothers don't 
seem too fond of the youngest.</i>

118
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,450
All of you, stop this!

119
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,440
That's no way to behave in front of guests.

120
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm so sorry. I don't know when
 they started acting this way.

121
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,000
The two older boys have become so cynical.

122
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,010
And the youngest can't 
even express his opinions.

123
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,510
My husband was worried about 
them until the moment he died.

124
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,370
<i>I guess being worried about your kids,</i>

125
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,810
<i>no matter how old they get, 
is part of being a parent.</i>

126
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,280
Please enjoy the tea. Excuse me.

127
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,870
<i>They all moved. I guess 
they each have a set position.</i>

128
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,360
<i>I suppose it must be just habit, 
in order to not block the window.</i>

129
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,880
<i>This time of day, the sunlight 
comes through the window.</i>

130
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,010
<i>If the sunlight reached a little
 further, it might hit the chest...</i>

131
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,380
<i>But there's no sign of sun
 damage on the chest.</i>

132
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,100
<i>Sun damage...?</i>

133
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,970
Hey.

134
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,060
<i>The sunlight doesn't come in 
for too long of a time.</i>

135
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,200
<i>Is something stuck inside?</i>

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,030
Did you figure something out?

137
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,370
<i>Ah! I was thinking he looked familiar.</i>

138
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,210
<i>He looks like Gaoshun!</i>

139
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,570
So?

140
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,040
The center drawer 
with the lock won't open, right?

141
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,950
It used to open, but apparently 
it got stuck after Dad worked on it.

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,980
And there's only one key?

143
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,160
Just this one.

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,020
Dad said if we broke the lock, 
it would break whatever's inside.

145
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,970
So we can't force it open, either.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,630
<i>The mementos given to each son.</i>

147
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,140
<i>A shack, a chest of drawers, and a fishbowl.</i>

148
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,230
<i>The chest is bolted down in the shack.</i>

149
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>The chest has drawers that can't be unlocked.</i>

150
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,710
And...

151
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,760
"You all should have a tea party 
together, like old times."

152
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,010
Could it be...?

153
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,150
Excuse me. Was the fishbowl 
originally placed there, on that shelf?

154
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,940
Huh? Um, yes.

155
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,380
We used to have a goldfish
 in it, and put it here.

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,950
If it got too cold, the goldfish would die,

157
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,030
so in the winter, we'd only put it here during
tea parties, when the sunlight kept it warm.

158
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,960
Around this time of day, actually.

159
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,960
We haven't had any goldfish 
for the past few years, though.

160
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,610
Hmm.

161
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,490
Hey, you!

162
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,190
I'm going to go ask for some water.

163
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,930
Darting off without my permission again!

164
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,190
You filled it with water, like this?

165
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,610
Yes. This pattern should face this way.

166
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,950
I knew it.

167
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,410
H-Hey! What is this?!

168
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,330
Don't touch that!

169
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,620
I'm sorry. It could blind you 
if it shined into your eyes.

170
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,920
Also, please step back, as you're blocking it.

171
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,630
You won't be able to unlock it.

172
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,480
It seems like the chestnut tree 
is casting a shadow now.

173
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,110
It's hot. Also, there's a strange smell.

174
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,620
Hey, what's the meaning of all this?!

175
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,370
Now, please unlock this drawer with that key.

176
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,470
I told you, it doesn't fit.

177
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,370
Please.

178
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,830
Hmph.

179
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,990
W-What's going on?!

180
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,930
Did your father happen to suffer from
 persistent anemia and stomachaches?

181
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,600
Yes, that's correct.

182
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,600
Nausea and depression, as well?

183
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,810
Those, too.

184
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,850
I don't know much about metalwork,

185
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,510
but do you use solder in this workshop?

186
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,860
Yes, we do.

187
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,740
What does that mean?

188
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:30,700
I just followed the instruction from the will, 
to have a tea party like you used to.

189
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,740
A mold for a key. 
May I remove it from the mold?

190
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,920
S-Sure.

191
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,860
<i>It's still warm, and soft.</i>

192
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,070
<i>The metal stuck in the keyhole 
must have melted from the heat,</i>

193
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,910
<i>and flowed into the mold 
below it before hardening.</i>

194
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,770
It's open!

195
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,650
What's inside?

196
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,110
What is this?!

197
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,780
<i>This bluish crystal seems to be the same
 kind as the one near the entrance.</i>

198
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,970
Dammit! What does he mean, get along?

199
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,510
We all just got played by his final prank!

200
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,750
What a bother!

201
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,410
Lead and tin...?

202
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,880
<i>I knew a grumpy craftsman of a customer who said 
techniques should be seen and stolen.</i>

203
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,800
<i>I took that seriously and tried to make 
my own medicine based on what I saw my dad do.</i>

204
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,700
<i>I ended up poisoning myself, and...</i>

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,850
You should ask first.

206
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,150
<i>That was the lesson he taught me.</i>

207
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,150
<i>It seems like the youngest son was the only 
one who understood his dead father's intent.</i>

208
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,670
<i>I've heard that, by mixing several 
different types of metals together,</i>

209
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,820
<i>solder melts at a temperature lower than 
that of the individual metals originally.</i>

210
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,840
<i>Of the three chunks, two were lead and tin.</i>

211
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,170
<i>Those and whatever this third thing is 
might mix to create a new metal.</i>

212
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,670
<i>Also, the light was 
concentrated by the fishbowl,</i>

213
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,750
<i>but it wasn't heated for very long.</i>

214
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,680
<i>The melting point must be very low.</i>

215
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,860
<i>The differently-sized
 drawers might represent</i>

216
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,190
<i>the ratio at which 
the metals should be mixed,</i>

217
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,940
<i>but I don't need to comment on that.</i>

218
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,690
What kind of will is this? Let's go.

219
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,400
What a waste of time.

220
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,780
Wait, guys!

221
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,030
It's not a prank.

222
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,500
What is it, then?!

223
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,950
Dad really did leave a will to make 
the three of us get along again!

224
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,970
So I want the three of us 
to continue working together!

225
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,520
Together? The three of us?

226
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,940
What a joke. You're different from us.

227
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,400
You have talent. Dad actually 
cared about you, and only you.

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,320
T-That's not true!

229
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,780
Dad always trusted you two!

230
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,540
He always told me...

231
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,080
Chang, you're always so calm 
and accurate with any work you do.

232
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,000
Dad said he could rely on you for anything,
 because you don't make mistakes!

233
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,340
Tzu, you're good at getting to know people.

234
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,060
He said you should be proud of your gift, 
the ability to be friendly with anyone!

235
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,620
Dad viewed the three of us equally.

236
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,570
At least, that's what I think.

237
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,850
Excuse us.

238
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,660
Oh, um, sorry.

239
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,880
<i>Father... Well, it's got nothing to do with me.</i>

240
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,460
Thank you.

241
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,770
<i>But I should tell him just this one thing.</i>

242
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,350
Hey.

243
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,060
There's an apothecary named
 Luomen at a brothel called

244
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,460
the Verdigris House
 in the pleasure district.

245
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,670
He's also a skilled physician.

246
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,180
If you start to feel unwell, 
please pay him a visit.

247
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,660
Y-Yes.

248
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,660
Thank you for the other day.

249
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,760
It turned out quite interestingly.

250
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,420
The youngest son truly was
 the most skilled, after all.

251
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,220
<i>This strategist must have known all along.</i>

252
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,390
He suddenly started to 
show that skill of his.

253
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,940
They say he'll take his father's place and 
begin selling his metalworks to the palace.

254
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:16,530
The older two sons are no longer 
going to work as craftsmen.

255
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,560
Is that...

256
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,980
It can't be all that bad.

257
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,750
They took the hint from 
their dead father, perhaps.

258
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,500
The eldest will take care of bookkeeping.

259
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,170
The second son will find new clients.

260
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,590
They're both going to help 
the family from different angles.

261
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,060
In other words, they all found their place.

262
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,120
<i>I don't know what happened at the mansion.</i>

263
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,860
<i>The apothecary girl must 
know and is keeping silent.</i>

264
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,860
The late metalworker's works 
were truly wonderful.

265
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:04,620
It was a simple metal part, but if used on 
a ritual utensil, it would look fabulous.

266
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,000
Indeed.

267
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,550
<i>What an annoying person.</i>

268
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,250
<i>He must know, given my position, 
ritual utensils don't mean anything to me.</i>

269
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,290
I wonder why, master strategist, 
you brought upâ€”

270
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:23,880
Come now, I just didn't want 
to keep good talent buried.

271
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,600
Elder or younger brother shouldn't matter.

272
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,310
Those with talent should receive attention.

273
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,960
<i>He has a point. Lakan may be a shady man,</i>

274
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,280
<i>but he definitely can 
discern talent in people.</i>

275
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,820
<i>It can be argued that he used that 
ability to climb to his current rank.</i>

276
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,580
By the way...

277
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,060
May I hear the rest of that story from earlier?

278
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,710
Which story?

279
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,040
The one about the courtesan.

280
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,840
Ah, yes! The way to decrease 
the value of a courtesan.

281
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,100
You should direct that inquiry 
to someone who knows that world.

282
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,960
Oh goodness, the time!

283
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,830
My subordinates would scold me 
if I stayed any longer.

284
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,400
Please give this to your serving maids.

285
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,910
It's a good drink, not too sweet.

286
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,580
See you tomorrow.

287
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,320
Master Jinshi.

288
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,630
Hmm?

289
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,590
I'm sorry to bother you 
when you're so tired, but...

290
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,690
Did you need me?

291
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,770
Do you know much about makeup?

292
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,810
Well, yes, the basics.

293
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,350
In that case,

294
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,610
can you do my makeup for me?

295
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,440
Huh?

296
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

297
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,190
<i>Next time: "A Jaunt Around Town."</i>

298
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,050
Episode 17: A Jaunt Around Town
