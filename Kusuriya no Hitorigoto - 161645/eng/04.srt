The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,640
How dare you try to feed 
Lady Lihua such lowly food!

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,490
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,100
Only the most luxurious foods 
suit our Lady Lihua.

6
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,810
I'd hesitate to even <i>show</i> this to her!

7
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,660
Episode 4: The Threat

8
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,830
Who would ever think Lady Lihua 
would enjoy something like this?

9
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,530
<i>Yikes. What a pain.</i>

10
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,160
We know best what Lady Lihua likes to eat.

11
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,560
<i>I'd never have come to the Crystal 
Pavilion if I'd had a choice, but...</i>

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,560
How dare you try to sneak this
 past us, servant. Shame on you.

13
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,800
<i>The night the emperor 
visited the Jade Pavilion...</i>

14
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,780
There is no poison.

15
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,370
Excuse me.

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Wait.

17
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,090
<i>Uh-oh, the emperor directly addressed me
for the first time.</i>

18
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,720
I have a request for the famous apothecary.

19
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,300
<i>Famous? I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,310
Yes.

21
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,870
Concubine Lihua is not well. 
Could you look after her?

22
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,520
<i>By "look after her," he means "cure her."</i>

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,580
<i>The word of the emperor 
is the word of the heavens.</i>

24
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,070
<i>If I declined, that would be 
grounds for my beheading.</i>

25
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,280
<i>Why would he say that in 
front of another concubine?</i>

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,920
<i>His Majesty really is "an emperor" by nature.</i>

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,170
<i>That said, it's pretty incredible that they 
treat me like this. I'm here by imperial order.</i>

29
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,760
<i>Since they serve Lady Lihua, I suppose
 they hate me as a servant of Lady Gyokuyou.</i>

30
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,640
Hmm?

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,220
Get out if you're done cleaning!

32
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,520
<i>Boing boing.</i>

33
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,610
<i>Oh, well. Guess I have to cook it again.</i>

34
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,210
Maomao, are you at the Crystal Pavilion now?

35
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,820
Yeah, I'm looking after Lady Lihua.

36
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,080
I see. Lady Lihua hasn't recovered yet...

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,720
The whitening powder's poison 
must still be in her system.

38
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,490
The poisonous powder, huh? 
I heard it was banned.

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,530
I heard the eunuchs took away all 
the remaining powder in the rear palace.

40
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,880
I see. Good.

41
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:08,600
But a request from the emperor? 
You're awesome, Maomao. I was surprised!

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,600
<i>He must really not trust the doctor 
to rely on a girl like me.</i>

43
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,680
Maomao, you're going 
to the kitchen later, right?

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,870
Yeah.

45
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,800
Good luck with the cooking!

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
Thanks.

47
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,120
Right!

48
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,900
<i>In looking after Lady Lihua, the first thing 
I set out to do was to improve her diet.</i>

49
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,640
Um, excuse me.

50
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,450
Yes?

51
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,940
<i>First I needed to expel 
the poison still in her body.</i>

52
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,120
<i>To do this, a porridge with lots of fiber,</i>

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,580
<i>plus a diuretic tea sounds good.</i>

54
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,090
Not this. Not this either. This one...

55
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,890
And this one, too. But not this one...

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,350
Enough is enough!

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,480
This is no place for lowly girls like you.

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,870
<i>Boing boing.</i>

59
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,110
<i>This is going to take a while.</i>

60
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,360
<i>In that case, let's try...</i>

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,200
This one, that one, the other one, and this.

62
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,670
How many times do I have to tell you?!

63
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,630
Well, first, she needs to eat
 something easy to digest—

64
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,300
No way! Sick people need <i>nutritious</i> food, 
not cheap stuff like that. Obviously.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,590
<i>So that's her usual meal.</i>

66
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,220
<i>Sure, it's nutritious,</i>

67
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,480
<i>but it's too heavy for a sick 
person's weakened stomach.</i>

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,220
<i>That's not hard to understand.</i>

69
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,060
<i>Why won't anyone stop them?</i>

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,540
Lady Lihua, your meal is ready.

71
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,760
We brought you all the things 
you like. Please try to eat.

72
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,130
Lady Lihua?!

73
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,750
Oh no, what do we do?!

74
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,060
Quick, bring water!

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,800
Are you all right, Lady Lihua?!

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,820
Lady Lihua, please have some water.

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,920
This is your fault, lowly servant!

78
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,700
Your presence ruins the atmosphere!

79
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,760
Get out! Now!

80
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,240
<i>Boing boing.</i>

81
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,850
<i>I won't even be able 
to get near her at this rate.</i>

82
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,400
<i>Now, what shall I do...</i>

83
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,490
If I could at least do an examination...

84
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,380
No need. What if you make things worse?!

85
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,910
<i>At that rate, she's bound to wither and die.</i>

86
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,730
<i>People die unless they eat.</i>

87
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,460
<i>She probably lost the will to live 
after losing her child.</i>

88
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,550
<i>How many days do I have left,</i>

89
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,790
<i>before my head bids farewell to my body
for defying the emperor's order?</i>

90
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,770
It seems like you're in a bit of a bind.

91
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,920
Does it appear that way to you?

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,560
It does appear that way to me.

93
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,340
Master Jinshi?!

94
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
What's with that girl?

95
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,950
Why is she with Master Jinshi...?

96
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,080
An annoying misunderstanding...

97
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,750
Let's go inside, for now.

98
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,130
Oh...

99
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,250
M-Master Jinshi?!

100
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,250
Eek!

101
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,690
It's not befitting of beautiful 
and talented ladies like you

102
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,590
to ignore the emperor's arrangements.

103
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,570
Oh! Oh no, we aren't ignoring...

104
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,710
Whoa! Eek!

105
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,140
Right. We were just, um...

106
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,750
H-Hey!

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,490
It's scary how women can change so quickly.

108
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,770
There. Now go.

109
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,270
<i>She does have the will to eat.</i>

110
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,650
<i>But she's weaker than I thought.</i>

111
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,360
<i>Maybe she can handle rice water instead.</i>

112
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,260
Excuse me.

113
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,150
<i>The same shade as before...</i>

114
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Are you the one in charge of 
the concubine's makeup?

115
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,940
Indeed I am.

116
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,310
We want Lady Lihua to always be beautiful.

117
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,990
That is our duty as ladies-in-waiting.

118
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,780
It's all for Lady Lihua. Obviously.

119
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,440
I see.

120
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,990
What's wrong with you?!

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,870
Huh? Just punishing an idiot, obviously.

122
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,980
Ouch! You're hurting me! Stop! It hurts!

123
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,590
The poison will infect your 
whole body after a while.

124
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,390
You should be glad. You'll be pretty too,

125
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,160
just like your beloved Lady Lihua.

126
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,560
Pale, bloodless skin, sunken eye sockets, 
a body unable to even eat...

127
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,610
Don't you understand why this stuff was banned?!

128
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,110
I j-just thought it would 
make Lady Lihua happy—

129
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,680
I told you, it's <i>poison</i>.

130
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,990
There are no thoughts in your head. 
You just think you know everything.

131
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,090
Who would be happy poisoned with
 the same thing that killed their son?!

132
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,790
Go rinse your mouth and wash your face.

133
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,510
Hey! This is bad for the patient.

134
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,370
Clean this floor up immediately!

135
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,950
Y-Yes!

136
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,800
It truly <i>is</i> scary, how women 
can change so quickly.

137
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,230
Oh...

138
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>I've really done it now...</i>

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,020
Let's go.

140
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,700
<i>Lady Lihua's health was worse than I thought.</i>

141
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,110
<i>I started by changing from 
porridge to rice water.</i>

142
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,890
<i>I forced the food into her mouth and 
had her swallow slowly, repeatedly.</i>

143
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,900
<i>No sense in worrying about 
manners at a time like this.</i>

144
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,160
<i>I did some ventilation, which thinned out 
the incense, revealing the smell of the sick.</i>

145
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,880
Those incompetent fools can't even 
wipe down their mistress properly?

146
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,080
How do they even call 
themselves ladies-in-waiting?

147
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,140
There's so much they could have been 
doing before worrying about incense.

148
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,840
Hey. Hot water and cloth, now.

149
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,130
Y-Yes.

150
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,990
You all, get to work.

151
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,050
Y-Yes!

152
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,540
<i>I had her drink tea every chance I could find.</i>

153
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,770
<i>Frequent urination helps flush 
the poison out of her body.</i>

154
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,280
Um, are you sure Lady Lihua isn't in pain...?

155
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,150
It doesn't matter, she must drink.

156
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,000
<i>She began to eat more, so I increased 
the amount of rice grains in the water.</i>

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
When she began to be able to swallow 
them, I added soup and ground fruit.

158
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,630
<i>I heard the lady-in-waiting 
was put in confinement.</i>

159
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,760
<i>Apparently, she'd hid 
the powder for Lady Lihua.</i>

160
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,480
<i>The eunuch who was supposed to recover 
the powder was punished by flagellation.</i>

161
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,490
You seem tired.

162
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,440
Yes. Unlike a certain someone, I'm quite busy.

163
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,380
We brought gifts.

164
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,300
Thank you!

165
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,300
Wow!

166
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
<i>He really knows what I want!</i>

167
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,030
<i>It's considerate people like him 
who become good husbands.</i>

168
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,400
<i>He is a eunuch, though.</i>

169
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,970
<i>Compared to him...</i>

170
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,110
Do you need help with anything?

171
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,720
Well...

172
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,660
What is it? Tell me anything.

173
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,740
Over there, they need help. Someone please.

174
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,440
Everyone, please hurry.

175
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,630
Yes!

176
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,640
A steam bath?

177
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,090
Apparently, sweating is good for her.

178
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,750
Is it useful?

179
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,460
I suppose it is.

180
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,180
We have to use whatever we have.

181
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,720
You... Why...

182
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,260
Yes, what is it?

183
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,230
Why wouldn't you...

184
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,080
let me just die?

185
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,080
You could stop eating, then.

186
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,900
But you eat the porridge 
because you want to live.

187
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,980
I see.

188
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,210
You're right.

189
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,400
You.

190
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:56,180
I was released from confinement and am 
permitted to serve Lady Lihua once again.

191
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,600
I will never make that mistake again. Ever.

192
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,440
I will take your place now. Please rest.

193
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,320
All right.

194
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,610
Lady Lihua.

195
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,340
Lady Lihua.

196
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,550
Ah...

197
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,220
Can you get me some water, if you could?

198
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,570
Yes.

199
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,740
Yes!

200
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,560
<i>After about two months, Lady Lihua 
recovered enough to be able to walk by herself.</i>

201
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,100
<i>She has self-respect, but isn't arrogant.</i>

202
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,300
<i>After that matter with the prince, 
I imagined her as a selfish princess,</i>

203
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,140
<i>but as it turns out, she has 
a personality befitting a concubine.</i>

204
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,830
I will take my leave tomorrow morning.

205
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,690
I see.

206
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,420
I've already spoken to your 
ladies-in-waiting about your food

207
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,400
and other things to be careful of.

208
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,600
Hey. Am I incapable of birthing another child?

209
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,360
I don't know. Perhaps you should try.

210
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,610
But His Majesty's love for me is gone.

211
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,620
I was sent here by a direct
 order from the emperor.

212
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,780
Once I return to the Jade Pavilion, 
perhaps the emperor will visit you.

213
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,560
I ignored those words of 
advice and let my child die.

214
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,780
Will I be able to win 
against Concubine Gyokuyou?

215
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,730
It's not a matter of winning and losing.

216
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,550
There are hundreds, 
thousands of flowers in the world,

217
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,030
but who can decide whether a peony 
or a bellflower is more beautiful?

218
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,180
I have neither her jade eyes 
nor her bright hair.

219
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,040
You have other... assets.

220
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,410
Not just the sheer size, but the shape 
and tension are truly magnificent.

221
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,730
Huh?

222
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,620
Could you lend me your ear?

223
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,170
Y-Yes.

224
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,300
Excuse me.

225
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,170
<i>The knowledge I left with Lady Lihua 
was a secret technique taught to me</i>

226
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,590
Lady Lihua, what's wrong?

227
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,380
Lady Lihua?!

228
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,490
<i>by my big sisters at the brothel.</i>

229
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,310
You should learn this, just in case!

230
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,490
Huh?

231
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,600
<i>Unfortunately, I don't have the sizable 
fruits to employ the technique.</i>

232
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,370
<i>It's perfect for Lady Lihua, though.</i>

233
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,700
I hope it turns out to be useful.

234
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,470
I'm back.

235
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,810
Welcome back.

236
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,230
Maomao, are you all right?!

237
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,480
You've gotten so thin.

238
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,720
It must have been very hard.

239
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,320
<i>She completed the emperor's 
mission all by herself. Impressive.</i>

240
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,640
<i>There was a period after that where 
the emperor's visits to the Jade Pavilion</i>

241
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,300
<i>decreased in frequency quite significantly.</i>

242
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,460
Finally, released from sleep deprivation.

243
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,880
<i>Maomao couldn't keep a straight face, 
but that's another story.</i>

244
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,030
It's a curse...

245
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

246
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,590
Next time: "Covert Operations."

247
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,050
Episode 5: Covert Operations
