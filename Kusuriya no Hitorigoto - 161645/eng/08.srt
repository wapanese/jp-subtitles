This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on

Episode 8: Wheat Stalks

5
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,140
Oh, right, I'm home.

6
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,800
So sticky...

7
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,090
Dad...

8
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,810
Must be out in the field.

9
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,820
I wish he'd stop working the field at his age,

10
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,710
but he just really enjoys making 
medicine out of the herbs he grows.

11
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,040
Don't break it.

12
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,540
I don't know you. Are you 
a servant at a different brothel?

13
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,040
My dad's—

14
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,040
Come with me!

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,740
Hey!

16
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,350
Big Sis! I brought the apothecary!

17
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,010
Hurry!

18
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,220
<i>This smell...</i>

19
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,730
Apothecary! I made them 
throw up already, but...

20
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,570
Right!

21
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,030
The man isn't breathing!

22
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,490
The woman's breathing is too weak.

23
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll check if there's any
 vomit left in their throats.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,750
You check her.

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,250
Y-Yes!

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,580
<i>No pulse. Nothing clogging the throat.</i>

27
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,700
<i>Just saliva.</i>

28
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,150
Bring water!

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,570
No water! Bring charcoal. Charcoal!

30
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,960
Y-Yes!

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,620
Great way to start the morning.

32
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,890
Wow, I need a bath...

33
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,550
Thank you, apothecary. They're both stable now.

34
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,850
Wait, leave that alone.

35
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,010
Even what they threw up on?

36
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,430
There could still be poison in it.

37
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,520
Poison...

38
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,220
I'll go make some tea.

39
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,560
<i>The two who collapsed here were 
a courtesan and her customer.</i>

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,930
<i>The room was filled with 
the scent of alcohol and tobacco.</i>

41
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,280
<i>Two bottles.</i>

42
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,790
<i>Broken glass cups.</i>

43
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,250
This is... a wheat stalk?

44
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,710
<i>A pipe and some tobacco leaves.</i>

45
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,340
They really went out of
 their way to cause trouble.

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,970
I've got the charcoal...

47
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,610
Good. Also, get me a text plate 
and something to write with.

48
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,470
Huh?

49
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,760
My dad should be out in the fields, 
near the southern wall.

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,060
Bring him over here later.

51
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,960
Got it.

52
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,720
You're late, Dad.

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,700
This girl was worried about my leg.

54
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,660
I crushed the charcoal.

55
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,040
Yes, let's mix it with the herbs 
and give it to them immediately.

56
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,090
Can you drink this?

57
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,170
What about him...?

58
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,940
He's safe. He had the medicine, too.

59
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,640
Your treatment's not bad.

60
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,350
"Not bad," huh?

61
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,620
<i>Dad's able to deduce two or three things 
from a single piece of information.</i>

62
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,400
What kind of poison do you think this was?

63
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,640
<i>Here goes!</i>

64
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,450
<i>Dad sometimes tries to 
make me learn stuff this way.</i>

65
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,880
Tobacco leaves are deadly poisons.

66
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,460
That would be what they'd use 
in a double suicide.

67
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,210
You didn't have them drink water, right?

68
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,400
Water would make things worse, right?

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,500
Correct. Gastric juices can prevent
 the intake of poison in some cases,

70
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,470
so diluting it might make things worse.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,270
However, what if this poison 
was already soaked in water?

72
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,980
<i>There are no leaves in the vomit.</i>

73
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,190
<i>I missed that. Maybe I'm still half asleep.</i>

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,100
<i>If the poison was soaked in water, 
sometimes diluting it with more water is good.</i>

75
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,280
<i>Got it. Lesson learned.</i>

76
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,490
Sorry for the trouble.

77
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,100
<i>Serving us snacks reserved for customers? 
That's quite generous of her.</i>

78
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,390
<i>I see, it prevents lipstick 
from getting on the cup.</i>

79
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,500
You really saved us. This is just
 a small token of our gratitude.

80
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,350
Oh no, that's too much—

81
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,870
Dad, can you afford rent this month?

82
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,970
Ah, in that case...

83
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,020
<i>Jeez, you old man...</i>

84
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,530
<i>Must have been a double suicide. 
Not exactly rare in the pleasure district.</i>

85
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>A man who can't afford to buy out a courtesan,</i>

86
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,770
<i>and a courtesan with time left on her term.</i>

87
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,990
<i>People like that often reach 
this same conclusion.</i>

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,500
<i>Still, that man was very well-dressed.</i>

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,270
<i>He had a handsome face, too.</i>

90
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,000
<i>Didn't seem like someone who'd be 
short on money or women.</i>

91
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,090
<i>Dad wouldn't approve of me 
judging through stereotypes, but...</i>

92
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,160
<i>He didn't seem like someone</i>

93
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,220
<i>who'd drink poison with a courtesan 
out of despair for their future.</i>

94
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,310
I'm going to go check on them.

95
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,260
The man seemed to be in worse condition...

96
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,860
What are you doing?!

97
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,330
Don't stop me! This guy deserves to die!

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,720
Wh-What are you doing?!

99
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,150
Apothecary, may I speak with you?

100
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,490
That man was always a problem customer.

101
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,980
He'd sweet-talk a courtesan and 
insinuate that he would buy her out.

102
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,000
When he got tired of her, he'd just dump her.

103
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,500
He was widely hated. Some woman 
tried to stab him, even.

104
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,800
He'd been poisoned in the past, too.

105
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,320
But his rich merchant father pampers him.

106
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,800
He settles everything with money.

107
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,170
Recently, he asked his father to hire 
guards for him to travel to the brothels with.

108
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,230
This girl's older sister got dumped by him, too.

109
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,250
She was so happy she could live with him,

110
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,240
but on the day of the buy-out, 
he suddenly canceled on her.

111
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,790
That's why, I think, she couldn't forgive him.

112
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,500
The courtesan who drank the poison 
today was close to her, as well.

113
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,540
So, you want me to pretend 
I didn't see anything?

114
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,580
If he's such a problem, why not just ban him?

115
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,310
It's the courtesan who fell for him.

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,530
In that case, I suppose 
word of a double suicide

117
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,680
would make matters worse for the brothel.

118
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,940
<i>So, they served us the good snacks</i>

119
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,160
<i>because we prevented a rich merchant's 
son from dying on the premises.</i>

120
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,480
<i>And...</i>

121
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,740
<i>That must have felt unfair to her.</i>

122
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,660
I understand.

123
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,600
<i>I just happened to be home today,</i>

124
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,990
<i>but if the girl shops with us often, perhaps 
she knew when my dad is usually away.</i>

125
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,330
<i>Normally you'd call for
 a doctor at a time like that,</i>

126
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,260
<i>but she went out of her way 
to find a missing apothecary.</i>

127
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,400
<i>That servant girl is scarier than she looks.</i>

128
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,240
It's too bad your homecoming 
turned out this way.

129
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,100
Dad, show me that money from earlier.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,000
Hmm?

131
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,960
Yep, all there.

132
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,970
<i>As expected, including hush money.</i>

133
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,950
<i>Something bothers me, though.</i>

134
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,060
<i>Judging from the stories, 
the man is pretty clever.</i>

135
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,950
<i>Would someone like him join 
a double suicide over romance?</i>

136
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,130
Was it a forced suicide? No, a man who'd
 been poisoned before wouldn't easily—

137
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,430
Maomao, you shouldn't 
speak based on conjecture.

138
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,350
Dad, you already figured out 
what really happened, right?

139
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>Let's try to recall what was at 
the scene and what I might have missed.</i>

140
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,750
<i>Tobacco leaves are deadly poisons.</i>

141
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,840
<i>This would be what they would 
use in a double suicide.</i>

142
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,590
<i>However, what if this poison 
was already mixed in water?</i>

143
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,960
<i>It's the courtesan who fell for him.</i>

144
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,150
<i>This guy deserves to die!</i>

145
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,700
<i>The courtesan who drank the poison 
today was close to her as well.</i>

146
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,080
<i>I see, it prevents the lipstick 
from getting on the cup.</i>

147
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,020
<i>This wasn't a double suicide.</i>

148
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,000
<i>It was murder.</i>

149
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,800
Poisoned water, wheat stalks, 
two separate drinks with different colors...

150
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,070
It's already over.

151
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,950
I know.

152
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,890
<i>Murder, not a double suicide.</i>

153
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,960
<i>And it's the courtesan 
who tried to kill the man,</i>

154
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,460
<i>using drinks laced with tobacco poison.</i>

155
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,810
<i>But the man was cautious enough 
to have guards around.</i>

156
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,080
<i>How did she get him to drink the poison?</i>

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,890
<i>Simple. She took a sip as well.</i>

158
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,600
<i>If the courtesan was safe, 
the man would drink, too.</i>

159
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,150
<i>But if she drank the poison, 
she'd be in danger herself.</i>

160
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,800
<i>That's why she used a trick.</i>

161
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,650
<i>Two drinks, one cup.</i>

162
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,680
<i>Different drinks have varying 
thicknesses and weights.</i>

163
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,370
<i>By pouring a lighter drink 
slowly over a heavy drink,</i>

164
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,790
<i>you can create a pretty-looking, layered drink.</i>

165
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,790
<i>She used that as a small parlor 
trick to impress her guest.</i>

166
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,880
<i>Then, she used the wheat stalk to drink just 
the lower layer, without raising suspicion.</i>

167
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,030
<i>Afterwards, she drank from 
the upper layer as well.</i>

168
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,780
<i>Just a little bit, so it wouldn't kill her.</i>

169
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,140
<i>She didn't want to end up dead herself.</i>

170
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,400
<i>She did the act in the morning to 
increase the odds that he would die,</i>

171
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,630
<i>and she would survive.</i>

172
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,610
<i>And conveniently, someone came to witness it.</i>

173
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,760
<i>She appeared fragile, 
but she's actually quite clever.</i>

174
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,400
What are you doing, Big Sis?! 
You should stay in bed!

175
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,210
<i>The servant girl did
 behave a bit strangely.</i>

176
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,820
<i>In order to make sure the man didn't survive,</i>

177
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,720
<i>she went to an apothecary, not a doctor.</i>

178
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,840
<i>She even took her time 
bringing my dad over.</i>

179
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,870
<i>Wasn't she worried that
 her "Big Sis" would die?</i>

180
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,060
<i>Wasn't she worried that someone close 
to her would die again, like her real sister?</i>

181
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,630
<i>It's almost as if she knew 
the courtesan would survive.</i>

182
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,820
<i>Or am I over-thinking this?</i>

183
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,820
<i>In addition, the other courtesan 
was sympathetic to the servant girl.</i>

184
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,880
<i>Plus, the very generous madam...</i>

185
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,580
<i>Once I start doubting, there's no stopping.</i>

186
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,030
<i>Could they all have been...</i>

187
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,580
I shouldn't speak based on conjecture.

188
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,590
<i>I really missed this pleasure district,</i>

189
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,980
<i>but in essence, it's no different 
from the rear palace.</i>

190
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,350
<i>It's both a garden and a cage.</i>

191
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,090
<i>The stale, trapped air poisons everyone.</i>

192
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,360
<i>The courtesans also eat the poison around them</i>

193
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,900
<i>to become a sweet poison themselves.</i>

194
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,910
<i>I don't know what'll happen to that courtesan.</i>

195
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,190
<i>Maybe the annoying customer 
will assert that she tried to poison him.</i>

196
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,880
<i>Maybe the brothel will accuse him
 of ruining their merchandise instead.</i>

197
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,890
Well, whatever.

198
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,180
You can't live life in this neighborhood 
worrying about every little thing.

199
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,680
Maomao.

200
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,390
Meimei.

201
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,950
You're going back to the rear palace already?

202
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,440
I have a year left on my term.

203
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,070
I also have work to do 
that I can't force on others.

204
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,240
That's too bad. You just got back.

205
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,360
Everyone was worried 
when you suddenly went missing.

206
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,530
Pairin, Joka, and even the old lady.

207
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,660
Really? She never said...

208
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,920
She acted like usual, right? 
It's because you came back.

209
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,820
I see.

210
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh no, did I make you 
all sentimental? There, there!

211
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,970
Come on, Meimei!

212
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,460
Maomao, did you visit the annex?

213
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,880
I'll go later.

214
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,150
Take care of yourself.

215
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,230
You, too.

216
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,120
I'm off.

217
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,040
<i>My three-day homecoming 
was over before I knew it.</i>

218
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,100
I'm so sad to see you go so soon!

219
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,390
Right, Master Lihaku?

220
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,450
Yes! I'm so sad, too!

221
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,560
<i>Looks like he had a good dream.</i>

222
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,730
<i>Once you have a taste of the heavenly dews, 
there's no turning back to reality.</i>

223
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,820
<i>I'm sure they'll squeeze him dry, 
gently but thoroughly.</i>

224
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,820
<i>That said, I'm the one that has to cover 
for the amount that I couldn't pay up front.</i>

225
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,810
Let me know when you're coming home next.

226
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,580
<i>And thus, my next buyer has been determined.</i>

227
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,530
<i>What's with the intense stare?</i>

228
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,940
<i>I'd better make my escape.</i>

229
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,640
I'll go get changed.

230
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,510
Tell us...

231
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,130
Everything...

232
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,500
Later!

233
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,370
I'll be waiting for you in the parlor.

234
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,870
Excuse me.

235
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,740
<i>For some reason, he seems really upset.</i>

236
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,640
<i>Am I over-thinking it?</i>

237
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,660
<i>I hope I'm over-thinking it.</i>

238
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>Let's go with that.</i>

239
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,950
<i>Why are we alone, anyway?</i>

240
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,170
So, you went home, huh?

241
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,030
Yes.

242
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,320
How was it?

243
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,770
Everyone's doing well, 
so I was glad for that.

244
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,450
I see.

245
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,260
Yes.

246
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,030
What is this Lihaku fellow like?

247
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,780
He was my guarantor.

248
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,930
<i>How does he know that name?</i>

249
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,000
Do you even know what that means?

250
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,250
Yes. Only a higher-ranking official with 
a good record can serve as a guarantor.

251
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,470
Did he give you a hairpin?

252
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,190
He was passing out several, 
so I took one as a consolation prize.

253
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,020
So, I lost to a consolation prize, huh?

254
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,860
I thought I gave you one too, 
but I never heard from you.

255
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
<i>Huh?</i>

256
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,860
<i>In other words, he's just unhappy 
because I didn't rely on him instead?</i>

257
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,120
<i>Weird. It's obviously way better 
to not get involved in any trouble.</i>

258
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,870
<i>Is he so bored that he wants attention, 
even if it'll cause problems?</i>

259
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm sorry. I couldn't think of 
a repayment that you'd enjoy.

260
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,430
What repayment?

261
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,710
Did you give something to this Lihaku guy?

262
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,400
Yes, I granted him a night
 of blissful dreams.

263
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,270
A night...

264
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,850
He seemed very happy.

265
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,530
I worked hard, so I'm pleased with myself.

266
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,730
What are you doing?

267
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,910
Let's wipe you off before it stains.

268
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,910
Excuse me.

269
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,670
You should get this washed right away.

270
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,330
I'll clean up the cup right
 away, too. Don't touch it.

271
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,280
Excuse me.

272
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,430
<i>Whoosh.</i>

273
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,270
Ow!

274
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,820
<i>Not just some superficial sweetness</i>

275
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,140
<i>I want more warmth than I can even use, oh</i>

276
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,470
<i>Having these selfish idealistic thoughts</i>

277
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,040
<i>I swallowed them again today 
before putting them into words</i>

278
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>Still in my memories, 
the scent of fragrant olive</i>

279
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,330
<i>The color of twilight in the city</i>

280
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,150
<i>We were laughing...</i>

281
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:53,060
<i>Filled with sadness, 
the tears welled up in my eyes</i>

282
00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:01,280
<i>I found a glow during those days</i>

283
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,340
<i>I guess I took everything for granted</i>

284
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:18,380
<i>The wind was so loud I covered my ears</i>

285
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,920
<i>I gotta stop being like that</i>

286
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:34,120
<i>Even if I stumble over the words of love</i>

287
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

288
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,300
<i>Next time: "Suicide or Murder?"</i>

289
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 9: Suicide or Murder?
