The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,500
Also, regarding today's schedule,

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,360
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,570
there will be a medium 
ceremony in the afternoon.

6
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,440
Yeah...

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,280
I think I know what's on your mind.

8
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,530
But please, don't forget about work.

9
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,340
I know.

10
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,390
Episode 19: Chance or Something More

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,600
Master Lihaku, what's wrong?

12
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,660
We have a problem.

13
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,060
Trouble, is it?

14
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,500
Remember that fire at the warehouse?

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,150
Ah.

16
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,380
Apparently, a thief broke in to a different 
warehouse on the same day.

17
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm sure they were taking advantage
 of all the chaos at the time.

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,070
A looting. What got stolen?

19
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,810
<i>Not something to discuss openly, it seems.</i>

20
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,590
<i>Sneak.</i>

21
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,680
Ceremonial tools. And not just one.

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,090
Were they being managed that haphazardly?

23
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,930
Well, I don't really know.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,480
There's no knowledgeable
 managers right now.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,850
The last one passed away last year.

26
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,750
What about the current manager? 
He must know the basics, right?

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,860
Well, he got food poisoning awhile back.

28
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,500
Food poisoning?

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,090
His favorite seaweed made him
 sick and he hasn't woken up.

30
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,300
He can't come back to work. Trouble, right?

31
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>Where have I heard that before?</i>

32
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,130
Was it that official who likes rare foods?

33
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,910
How did you know?

34
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,840
A lot happened.

35
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,210
Theft at the time of a fire.

36
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,380
The warehouse manager is missing 
due to food poisoning.

37
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,180
It's a bit too suspicious to be a coincidence.

38
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,860
Who was the manager who passed away last year?

39
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,330
Hmm. I remember that he was 
famous for being really by-the-book.

40
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,280
I forgot his name. I remember he had 
a sweet tooth and things like that, but...

41
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,450
Was it Master Kounen, by chance?

42
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,620
Oh, that's it! Hey, how'd you know?

43
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,000
A lot happened.

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,580
<i>Master Jinshi told me about the 
tough official with a sweet tooth.</i>

45
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,970
<i>The man who died of salt overdose.</i>

46
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,700
<i>These are all coincidental?</i>

47
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,060
<i>Each incident looks like an accident,</i>

48
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,190
<i>but if they were all done 
in pursuit of some goal...</i>

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,340
So, what can I do for you?

50
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,260
Right! The main point.

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,650
Remember this? You gave it to me back then.

52
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,420
Ah, from the fire.

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,980
I tried to give it back, 
but the owner declined.

54
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,040
He doesn't want it anymore.

55
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,800
It seems very expensive. 
I assumed it was important.

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,220
Apparently, he got it from some court lady.

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,800
From a court lady?

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,850
Sounds weird, right?

59
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,150
Why give this to a random warehouse guard?

60
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,640
Apparently, the guard escorted 
the court lady outside the castle,

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,550
because she was walking alone in the dark.

62
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,690
She gave him this pipe as a token of gratitude.

63
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,200
Receiving such an expensive item might 
compel him to use it right away.

64
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,080
<i>Start a fire to divert the guards' attention,</i>

65
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,240
<i>and break into another warehouse.</i>

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,110
<i>If the court lady gave the guard 
the pipe for that purpose...</i>

67
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,420
Master Lihaku, about that court lady...

68
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,430
Yeah, I tried to get the details about her.

69
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,880
But she was wearing a scarf 
that hid her face, apparently.

70
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,900
Maybe she was hiding her face intentionally.

71
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,890
Yeah.

72
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,210
But she was "quite tall for a woman,
 and smelled like medicine."

73
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,160
I know it's not you, given the height.

74
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,660
Can you think of anyone else?

75
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,110
<i>A tall court lady smelling of medicine...</i>

76
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,700
Don't speak based purely on conjecture.

77
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,580
Were there any more strange incidents 
other than the events we mentioned?

78
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,340
Hmm. I can't say...

79
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,490
Do you think there's something to find out here?

80
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,590
There could be.

81
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,530
Or there might not.

82
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,760
Which is it?

83
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,940
Two coincidences can often
 occur simultaneously.

84
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,250
Three at once isn't that rare, either.

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,940
But when several of them pile up

86
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,550
and become clearly intentional...

87
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,450
What if a person who fits the description 
of a tall court lady appeared here?

88
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,710
<i>This way, even if Suirei's name 
comes up, it has nothing to do with me.</i>

89
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,400
Wow, you're a lot smarter than you look!

90
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,690
Conversely, Master Lihaku, you're as big
 a brute as you look, so please go easy on me.

91
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,600
Looks like fun.

92
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,850
Looks like fun.

93
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,110
There's nothing fun here.

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,590
I'll take my leave!

95
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,960
You seem very close to that officer.

96
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,910
Do I?

97
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,000
He just came to talk to me 
about some concerns he had.

98
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,930
<i>I can't say for certain that this has 
nothing to do with Master Jinshi.</i>

99
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,050
May I explain the details to you?

100
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,140
What a strange way they connect.

101
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,060
Yes.

102
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,770
So, what do you think is behind them?

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,400
I don't know.

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,260
None of those incidents are certainties.

105
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,530
It's more like setting several traps in 
the hopes that some of them work out.

106
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,410
In that case, do you think 
there are other traps?

107
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,250
I can't say for certain.

108
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,570
It's hard to determine which are 
accidents and which were plotted.

109
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,550
It's still possible that these 
are all just coincidences.

110
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,630
You're not excited?

111
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,330
Excited?

112
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm just a servant. I only do what I am told.

113
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,710
Hmm.

114
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,150
In that case, how about this?

115
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,110
The other day, I visited the trader.

116
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,020
He told me there's 
an interesting item in stock.

117
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,740
Ox bezoar

118
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,740
This is what it was called.

119
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,660
Ox bezoar, a medicinal gallstone from a cow!

120
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,540
The most exquisite medicine 
only found in one in a thousand cows!

121
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,250
Are you going to give me that?!

122
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,090
Ox Bezoar

123
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,090
Really?!

124
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,550
Ox Bezoar

125
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,550
You'd better not be lying!

126
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,680
Do you want it?

127
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,700
I do!

128
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,930
Xiaomao.

129
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,020
Excuse me.

130
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,110
Looks like you're excited now.

131
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,070
Will you really give me this?

132
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,070
Ox bezoar

133
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,060
Depends on how well you work. 
I'll keep you updated.

134
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,070
Understood.

135
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,070
As you wish, Master Jinshi!

136
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,320
And so, Gaoshun, take care of it!

137
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,920
This is the incident from the other day.

138
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,800
<i>The officer who got food poisoning 
was from the Board of Rites.</i>

139
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,670
<i>Which one was the Board of Rites, again? 
The education and foreign affairs one...?</i>

140
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,140
<i>If only I'd studied for
 the court lady exams properly...</i>

141
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,060
I'll leave these here.

142
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,070
Thank you.

143
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,390
No problem. Feel free to ask me 
if you have any questions.

144
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,120
Um, what does this division do?

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,030
Hmm?

146
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,820
They deal with ceremonies.

147
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,930
Ceremonies?

148
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,580
Do you have anything to write with?

149
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,000
Huh? Y-Yeah.

150
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,750
Ceremonies, ceremonies...

151
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,090
<i>The food-poisoned official and Master Kounen 
were both were related to ceremonies.</i>

152
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,220
<i>If the incident with the pipe was 
a way to help steal ceremonial tools...</i>

153
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,490
<i>These events, disguised 
as coincidences, must line up</i>

154
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,980
<i>to form an intentional incident, somewhere.</i>

155
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,650
<i>If someone went through so much 
trouble to steal ceremonial tools,</i>

156
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,140
<i>it has to be a ceremony of some importance.</i>

157
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,070
<i>Medium or higher, most likely.</i>

158
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,710
<i>I should find out when all 
of these ceremonies take place.</i>

159
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,760
<i>Come to think of it, Master Jinshi 
did purify himself often.</i>

160
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,740
If you're interested in ceremonies, 
here's something good.

161
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,530
Is this a picture of a ceremonial building?

162
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,170
Yes. It's at the west end of the outer 
court, and called the Altar of the Sapphire Sky.

163
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,180
Quite an interesting design, don't you think?

164
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,470
There's a large pillar 
hanging from the ceiling.

165
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,730
There are these banners 
hanging above the central altar.

166
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,150
They lower the pillar to 
add festive texts every time.

167
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,900
You're very knowledgeable.

168
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,440
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit it, but 
before I got assigned to the archives,

169
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,250
I was doing more important 
work at the Board of Rites.

170
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,190
I talked back to my superiors once, 
and got demoted to this role.

171
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,830
I used to be worried about the build 
strength, but I'm glad to know it's fine.

172
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,220
What are you talking about?

173
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,500
You see how the pillar is hanging 
from the ceiling like this, right?

174
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,090
It's big, so I was worried 
about it falling down.

175
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,230
When I voiced my concerns
 about the parts' strength,

176
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,350
it got me sent to this place.

177
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,740
<i>That is indeed scary.</i>

178
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,860
<i>If the metal parts fixing the pillar in 
place broke, and the pillar fell...</i>

179
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,290
<i>The person directly underneath performing 
the ceremony would be at the highest risk.</i>

180
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,350
<i>Someone of truly noble birth could be lost.</i>

181
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,960
Strength issue... Strength...

182
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,090
<i>What </i>was<i> the stolen ceremonial tool, anyway?</i>

183
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,180
<i>If something so important went missing, 
surely they'd make a new one.</i>

184
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,600
Make a new one...

185
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,490
Excuse me!

186
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,610
When is the next ceremony 
taking place at this venue?!

187
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,230
When? Well...

188
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,700
Oh, today, actually.

189
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,500
<i>If my predictions are correct, this is a plan 
that was concocted over a long period of time.</i>

190
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,900
<i>Not ever piece is likely to work.</i>

191
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,580
<i>But by placing numerous traps everywhere, 
some are bound to work and overlap.</i>

192
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,130
<i>And finally, it connected to this.</i>

193
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,580
<i>It's just conjecture on my part.</i>

194
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,100
<i>But if I happen to be correct...</i>

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,050
There!

196
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,740
Hey!

197
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,990
What are you doing?!

198
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,370
I need to get inside!

199
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,870
No.

200
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,390
This is an emergency!

201
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,000
What right does a servant like you 
have to interject in this ceremony?

202
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,610
<i>He's absolutely right. I'm just 
a servant with no authority at all.</i>

203
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,470
<i>But if something happens, it'll be too late.</i>

204
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,940
<i>That's always the case with 
things that can't be undone.</i>

205
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,330
There are lives at risk. 
Please stop the ceremony.

206
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,290
That's not a decision for you to make.

207
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,820
If you have something to say, 
put it in the suggestion box.

208
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,140
That will take too long!

209
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,910
No!

210
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,160
A fatal defect was discovered in the altar!

211
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,040
There is reason to suspect 
that someone tampered with it!

212
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,420
If you don't let me in now, you'll regret it!

213
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,220
If, after listening to my 
warnings, you still reject...

214
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,550
Oh, I get it, so that's what it is!

215
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,810
I see. You're obstructing me and
 waiting for the incident to happen!

216
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,060
In other words, you're in league 
with the ones who tampered with the—

217
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,700
<i>I'm about to lose consciousness.</i>

218
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,090
<i>It's only natural for him to get upset, 
hearing a girl talk to him like that.</i>

219
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,580
<i>That was intentional, so it's fine.</i>

220
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,820
<i>It's no use. This isn't a big enough of 
a commotion to stop the ceremony.</i>

221
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,220
<i>I'm fine. I can't lose consciousness now.</i>

222
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,400
Do you feel better now?

223
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,910
Please let me through.

224
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,150
There is a person of the most 
noble birth inside, isn't there?

225
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,380
If something happens, you all will
be the ones to lose your heads.

226
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,000
I won't ask you to cancel the ceremony.

227
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,570
Please just let me through.

228
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,820
Just say a rat got in accidentally.

229
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,850
In that case, the only person 
getting beheaded will be me!

230
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,850
Why should I trust the words 
of a girl like you?!

231
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,020
What about <i>my</i> words, then?

232
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,420
S-Sir, you're...

233
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,500
Now, why would you strike 
a young girl like that?

234
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,670
She's hurt.

235
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,330
At any rate, why don't you just 
go ahead and do as the girl says?

236
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,580
I'll take responsibility.

237
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,200
<i>I don't even want to see who's behind me.</i>

238
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,100
<i>It's perfect timing, as if
 everything was planned...</i>

239
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,590
<i>No, I can't concern myself with that right now.</i>

240
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,150
<i>It doesn't matter who this voice belongs to.</i>

241
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
<i>I must look terrible.</i>

242
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,130
<i>I'll ask Master Gaoshun after all this is done,</i>

243
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,120
<i>and take a nice, long bath.</i>

244
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,200
<i>But first,</i>

245
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,720
<i>I have to avoid getting beheaded.</i>

246
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,170
I made it...

247
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,990
Gotta stitch that...

248
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,060
Hey.

249
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,280
What's going on here?

250
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,110
Master Jinshi...

251
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,700
Can I have the ox bezoar now?

252
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,500
This isn't the time for that.

253
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,290
What's happened with your face?

254
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,450
<i>Why is Master Jinshi here...?</i>

255
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,270
<i>What's that look on his face?</i>

256
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,070
Sorry, I need to stitch up my leg first—

257
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,900
H-Hey!

258
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,370
Hey, wake up!

259
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,870
Wake up! Hey!

260
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,820
Hey! Stay with me.

261
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,680
Hey!

262
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

263
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,610
<i>Next time: "Thornapple."</i>

264
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,050
