ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,870
THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,370
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,920
<i>It was around the first spring breeze</i>

5
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,920
<i>that Lady Gyokuyou’s</i>
<i>pregnancy became a certainty.</i>

6
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,090
Hi!

7
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,350
<i>How mysterious.</i>
<i>Can she tell that there’s a baby inside?</i>

8
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,810
So cute!

9
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,150
I should start thinking about marriage…

10
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,240
<i>Even if she gets proposed to,</i>
<i>they’ll try their best to stop it.</i>

11
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,080
<i>Being too good at your job can</i>
<i>be a problem.</i>

12
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,840
<i>When your days are busy,</i>
<i>time passes quickly.</i>

13
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,170
<i>Although the two months I spent</i>
<i>with Sir Jinshi felt like forever.</i>

14
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,850
Do you want to draw again?

15
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah!

16
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,310
This is woolly milkcap.
It's a poisonous mushroom.

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,070
Draw a regular flower.

18
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,990
<i>A regular flower, huh?</i>

19
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,240
Blue roses?

20
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,490
Yes. You don't know them?

21
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,250
<i>The blue petals stimulate the eyes.</i>

22
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,790
They're very beautiful.

23
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,210
They used to be decorated
all around the court.

24
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,670
Perhaps you were dreaming.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,220
Blue roses don’t exist.

26
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,010
But they do.

27
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,180
I’d love to enjoy them again.

28
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,770
What do you think? Could you pull it off?

29
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,190
I thought there was nothing
you couldn't achieve.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,940
I understand.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,160
If such roses exist,
I’d love to see them myself.

32
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,530
So it’s decided.

33
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm truly looking forward to it.

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,250
Good day, sir.

35
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,750
I’ll see you at next month’s garden party.

36
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,970
You’re already so busy.

37
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,510
-Did you need to take this on?
-Don’t talk about that.

38
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,770
Start by talking to flower shops
around the country.

39
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,240
The flower shops explained that
roses are out of season right now.

40
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,070
I’m sorry for calling upon you
so suddenly.

41
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,160
There’s a plan to view blue roses soon.

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,370
Blue roses?

43
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,750
I work with medicine.

44
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,540
Yes, I know that.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,510
<i>Is he in some kind of trouble?</i>
<i>He looks tired.</i>

46
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,840
<i>Roses, huh?</i>

47
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,140
<i>I have some knowledge, but…</i>

48
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,390
<i>I’ve worked with roses</i>

49
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,140
<i>to earn pocket money</i>
<i>from courtesans. However…</i>

50
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,650
He really said he saw blue roses?

51
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,070
Yes.

52
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,030
He didn’t use any hallucinogens?

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,530
If such a thing was common,
the empire would fall apart!

54
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,280
Sir Jinshi.

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,490
Is it impossible?

56
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
What do I need to do exactly?

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,130
Can you have them
by next month’s garden party?

58
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,920
Next month?

59
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,430
Roses don’t bloom
for at least two more months.

60
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,970
You’re right.

61
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
I’ll tell him I can’t.

62
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,520
<i>Sir Jinshi’s reaction.</i>

63
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,360
<i>This impossible task and pushy tactic…</i>

64
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,360
Could it be that this request
came from a certain military man?

65
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,070
That’s right.

66
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,830
All right. I accept this job.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,660
Really?

68
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,500
I don’t know if I can do it,
but I’ll do what I can.

69
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,960
<i>I don't want to be running away</i>
<i>from him forever.</i>

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,670
<i>I'd love to crack</i>
<i>that smirking monocle of his.</i>

71
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,180
Sir Jinshi.

72
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,300
Can I request some items from you?

73
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,060
Thank you for giving me permission
to use these,

74
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,270
-Lady Lihua.
-It was no trouble.

75
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,270
It was originally something you had made.

76
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,280
<i>It brings me back.</i>

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,910
<i>I requested a steam bath to be made</i>

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
<i>to help Lady Lihua recover from poison.</i>

79
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,990
<i>I'll be borrowing the bath for this job,</i>

80
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,200
<i>but I would feel bad</i>
<i>borrowing it for free.</i>

81
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,620
This is the Emperor's favorite text.

82
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,290
Thank you. This will help.

83
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,800
<i>I'm glad I had it delivered</i>
<i>from the brothel.</i>

84
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,720
-Take care of that.
-Yes, sir!

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,390
Sir Jinshi.

86
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,390
Oh, you're here.

87
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,940
I had this made, like you asked.
But what is it for?

88
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,610
I'm going to confuse the roses.

89
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,360
Confuse the roses?

90
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,610
What does that mean, Apothecary?

91
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,080
I'll add some sunlight

92
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,660
and add some steam into the shed
from there.

93
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,380
We'll grow the roses in a warm room.

94
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,800
The flowers may bloom
ahead of season this way.

95
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,130
So that's what you mean by
confusing the roses.

96
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,140
I'm not certain this will work, though.

97
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,940
Maomao!

98
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,900
-Xiaolan?
-I'll help too.

99
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,660
How's your injured foot?

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,240
<i>Is he a chaperone?</i>

101
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,080
<i>They kept saying</i>

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,790
<i>not to push myself repeatedly.</i>

103
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,380
I'm all right. Thanks for coming to help.

104
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,800
Not at all. It's been so long
since I worked with you!

105
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,550
You're right.

106
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,810
<i>We carried in more than 100 pots of roses.</i>

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,310
This is the last one.

108
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,020
Wow, there are so many!

109
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,900
<i>We got different types of roses,</i>

110
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,240
<i>and selected species that bloom</i>
<i>earlier in the year.</i>

111
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,570
You think they'll all bloom?

112
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,570
I hope so.

113
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,840
<i>We take great care</i>
<i>in maintaining the temperature.</i>

114
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,430
<i>A few people were sent to help us,</i>

115
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,220
<i>but it's a hard task to leave</i>
<i>to someone else.</i>

116
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,390
<i>If you make a mistake</i>

117
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,980
<i>and all the flowers die,</i>
<i>then everything is over.</i>

118
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,530
<i>We put the flowers out on sunny days</i>
<i>so they can absorb sunlight.</i>

119
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,610
Looks like they like the sun!

120
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,450
Yeah.

121
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,990
How is it going?

122
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,740
I brought some food.

123
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,380
Thank you.

124
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,340
This is great! I don't have to work,
and we get snacks!

125
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,630
This is work too.

126
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,050
What's wrong?

127
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,220
I don't know. Maybe they're just curious.

128
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,390
<i>Or, are they trying to see</i>
<i>something scary?</i>

129
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,730
What should we do next?

130
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,190
If there are seedlings with too many buds,

131
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,570
can you pluck some out?

132
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,240
That way, the nutrients gather in one spot
making it easier to bloom

133
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,240
and protects it from diseases.

134
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,210
It's totally fine!

135
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,170
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all!

136
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,390
Hurry up!

137
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,230
They're not budding yet.

138
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,400
<i>On the days the cold returns,</i>

139
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,740
<i>we keep the shed warm all night.</i>

140
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,000
<i>The weather is unpredictable.</i>

141
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,640
You didn't sleep again yesterday?

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,480
I slept at dawn.

143
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,690
That was only moments ago!

144
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,070
I'll do what I can here,
so you should sleep just a little.

145
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,360
I should keep an eye on them.

146
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,820
What?

147
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,370
They're looking over here again.

148
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,580
<i>They do this every day!</i>
<i>Don't they get tired of it?</i>

149
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,710
<i>It's very distracting.</i>

150
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,540
<i>If only I could divert their attention…</i>

151
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,670
Wow!

152
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,640
So these are rouge nails!

153
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,260
Everyone at the pleasure district
does these.

154
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,140
They're very beautiful!

155
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,150
You do your nails too, Maomao?

156
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,150
They're so cute!

157
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,370
They're very trendy these days.

158
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,580
Yes, they are.

159
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,580
<i>High-ranking concubines who receive</i>
<i>the Emperor's affections</i>

160
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,790
<i>are the creators of fashion trends.</i>

161
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,840
They're very inefficient.

162
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,050
<i>Ms. Hongniang cares more about work</i>
<i>than fashion.</i>

163
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,640
I'm done with the food testing,
so I'll head back to the Crystal Pavilion.

164
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,940
So soon?

165
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,270
There's not much time left
until the garden party.

166
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,150
That's true.

167
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,280
That reminds me.

168
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,610
Lady Gyokuyou
will not be attending this party.

169
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,950
She'll be giving up her seat so that
Lady Loulan can introduce herself.

170
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,080
<i>It must be to hide her pregnancy.</i>

171
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,500
I understand. Goodbye.

172
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,750
Hey, are you all right
at the Crystal pavilion?

173
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,380
You're getting skinnier by the day!

174
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,040
Don't push yourself, all right?

175
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,550
Thank you.

176
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,480
Maomao!

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,940
Maomao, come quickly!

178
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,740
It's budding.

179
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,240
I found it just now.

180
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,240
It's our first one!

181
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
<i>If everything goes as planned,</i>

182
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,710
<i>maybe they'll start to bloom…</i>

183
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,040
Maomao?

184
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,300
Any messages from the Apothecary?

185
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,180
No.

186
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,100
I haven't been able to drop by
for a few days.

187
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,560
We were both busy
preparing for the garden party.

188
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,650
Sir Jinshi.

189
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,600
That must be Sir Shishou's daughter,
Concubine Loulan.

190
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,150
How glamorous!

191
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,620
For Concubine Loulan.

192
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,090
If she has any shortcomings,

193
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,090
please let us know.

194
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,470
-Anything at all.
-Oh, dear.

195
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,690
-Blue roses?
-Could it be?

196
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,780
Perhaps it'll be agreeable

197
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,200
to enjoy these buds
and imagine what they will look like

198
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,290
when they bloom.

199
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,290
Yes. They are beautiful.

200
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,340
<i>These glances that are thrown at "Jinshi."</i>

201
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,390
<i>No matter how beautiful he may be,</i>

202
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,890
<i>no official is so unselfish that</i>
<i>they'd enjoy a young eunuch</i>

203
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,850
<i>showing off his abilities.</i>

204
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,940
<i>Lust is easy.</i>

205
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,560
<i>You can use it to your advantage.</i>

206
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,490
<i>Jealousy is easy. It's easy to manage.</i>

207
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,490
<i>What's bothersome is</i>

208
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,660
<i>when you can't read the emotion</i>
<i>behind those eyes.</i>

209
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,160
<i>Shishou. Concubine Loulan's father,</i>

210
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,210
<i>and the man who won</i>
<i>the empress's affection.</i>

211
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,750
<i>The emperor still owes much to him.</i>

212
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,670
<i>That's why our side continues to smile.</i>

213
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,930
<i>And right now, we have someone</i>
<i>more concerning than Shishou.</i>

214
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,300
<i>It's that man, Lakan.</i>

215
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,070
My, how disagreeable.

216
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,490
Are you awake?

217
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,410
Ms. Yinghua…

218
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,910
Don't go to the Crystal Pavilion anymore.

219
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,580
You always come back all skinny and tired.

220
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,130
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,670
You're awake?

222
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,970
I'll be going now.

223
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,430
Stay seated.

224
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,020
It was very hard.

225
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,100
We couldn't get them to bloom in time.

226
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,570
But it's not like
you wanted to impress me, did you?

227
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,730
Huh?

228
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,530
It's nothing. It was more than enough.

229
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,530
How did you achieve this?

230
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,200
I just dyed them.

231
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,830
You dyed them? But there's nothing there.

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,620
It's not dyed on the outside.

233
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,250
It's dyed from the inside.

234
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,420
These roses were all originally white.

235
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,220
<i>We used different types of colored water</i>

236
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,300
<i>and soaked the white buds in them.</i>

237
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,430
<i>So that's why there were many colors,</i>
<i>not just blue.</i>

238
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,390
<i>Yes. The leaves get muddy and dark</i>
<i>when they're dyed,</i>

239
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,810
<i>so we plucked them all in advance.</i>

240
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,280
<i>After that, we fixed some cotton</i>
<i>soaked with colored water so that</i>

241
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,320
<i>the color doesn't come off</i>
<i>during the garden party.</i>

242
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,030
<i>It's very simple.</i>

243
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,080
<i>In actuality,</i>

244
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,620
<i>The truly hard part was getting the roses</i>
<i>to bloom in time.</i>

245
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,120
Yes, it's very simple.

246
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,420
That's why there may be

247
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,090
officials who complain
and make accusations.

248
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,590
I explained the trick
to the Emperor in advance.

249
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,470
<i>He seemed to enjoy knowing</i>
<i>the secret beforehand,</i>

250
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,850
<i>and listened to me explain it</i>
<i>with interest.</i>

251
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,850
So why did he say
he used to see blue roses in the court?

252
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,600
There must've been some bored person

253
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,190
soaking blue-colored water
into the roses every day.

254
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,150
Why would they do such a thing?

255
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,990
Who knows?

256
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,910
Maybe they wanted something
to flirt with women with.

257
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,830
I haven't seen you with dyed nails before.

258
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,620
It doesn't suit me.

259
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,130
If I had some balsam or wood sorrel,
the dye would apply more evenly.

260
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,840
<i>Balsam are known as "rouge nails,"</i>

261
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,260
<i>and sorrel are known as "cat's feet."</i>

262
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,100
<i>If you rub these plants together, it makes</i>
<i>a vibrant red color for your nails..</i>

263
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,890
<i>Though a little nail dye</i>
<i>wouldn't change this…</i>

264
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,890
<i>At least it's better than it used to be.</i>

265
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,360
Sir Gaoshun, do you have
the requested items?

266
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,610
Yes, just as you asked.

267
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,900
Thank you, sir.

268
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,570
<i>Now, the stage is set.</i>

269
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,280
<i>All that's left is to</i>

270
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,910
<i>blow away that despicable man.</i>

271
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,710
<i>I didn't think that</i>
<i>the challenge would end in failure.</i>

272
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,720
<i>Most humans look like Go pieces to me.</i>

273
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,850
<i>Men are the black stones,</i>
<i>and women are the white stones.</i>

274
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,480
<i>Even the men who work</i>
<i>for me in the military</i>

275
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,810
<i>are all just</i> xiangqi <i>pieces.</i>

276
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,150
<i>Most are soldiers, or pawns.</i>

277
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,240
<i>As they rise up the ranks,</i>
<i>they become horses, or cannon.</i>

278
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,070
<i>Working in the military is quite simple.</i>

279
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,080
<i>You simply have to place the pieces</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

280
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,500
<i>Everyone has their roles.</i>

281
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,250
<i>That's how you win most wars.</i>

282
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,670
<i>It's not difficult at all.</i>

283
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,880
<i>Even if you are unskilled,</i>
<i>as long as the pieces fulfill their roles,</i>

284
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,760
<i>they'll finish your job for you.</i>

285
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,390
<i>My eyes hurt more than usual.</i>

286
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,180
<i>I keep noticing red flickering around</i>
<i>in my vision.</i>

287
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,190
<i>Rouge nails, huh?</i>

288
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,230
<i>The rouge nails I remember</i>
<i>aren't a distasteful, flashy red.</i>

289
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,780
<i>It's a subtle red, dyed from balsam.</i>

290
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,330
