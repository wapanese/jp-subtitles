The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,980
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,900
Maomao.

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,250
Hmm?

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,440
Could you deliver some medicine 
to the Verdigris House?

7
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,870
Yeah, got it, Dad.

8
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,570
Be careful out there. 
Kidnappings are on the rise.

9
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,630
I'll be fine. I'll stop by
 the herb plot on my way back.

10
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,880
Yes, please do.

11
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,510
I'm off!

12
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,860
Verdigris House

13
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,200
Huh, is this all you've got?

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,720
It's my life savings! I beg you!

15
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,550
This is a non-starter.

16
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,640
That must be Pairin, one of the famous 
Three Princesses of the Verdigris House!

17
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,510
If you want to gawk, pay up!

18
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,640
Hmm, it's taking too long to heal.

19
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,970
I'll tweak the recipe some.

20
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,730
Oh, Maomao!

21
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,800
Hey, Pairin.

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,030
Hey, you have more wounds again!

23
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,410
It's just my usual drug experiments.

24
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,320
Are you eating well?

25
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,060
You seem to be very well nourished, as always.

26
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,290
Maomao!

27
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,000
You'd better not be setting off explosions 
again for your so-called experiments!

28
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,090
Or, would you like to start
 a career as a courtesan?

29
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,090
Yikes!

30
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,810
Granny, I left your meds here!

31
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,940
Say hi to your old man for me. Sheesh.

32
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,790
Did I just hear Maomao's voice?

33
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,420
Hey, where's Maomao?

34
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,060
She took off.

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,810
<i>That shrewd old bag, always trying
 to make me a courtesan...</i>

36
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,540
<i>Could it be? Kidnappers?!</i>

37
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,300
Dad's gonna be really worried...

38
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,840
The prince is born!

39
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,070
Congratulations, Lady Lihua!

40
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,540
The prince was born safely.

41
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,670
I see. Wonderful.

42
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,880
Three months later

43
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,180
Episode 1: Maomao

44
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,890
I want meat skewers from a stall...

45
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,640
I wonder if Dad's eating properly.

46
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,180
<i>I'm not sure if I was sold off or ransomed, 
but annoyingly, it's already been three months.</i>

47
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,500
The palace and the brothels are really similar.

48
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,410
If I had a choice, I'd have nothing to do 
with the rear palace, ever. But...

49
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,410
Well, what can I do, now that I'm here?

50
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,840
I was living a pretty good life 
as an apothecary, and now...

51
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,500
<i>The rear palace is a garden of women 
who are to give birth to the emperor's children.</i>

52
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,990
<i>No men are allowed to enter.</i>

53
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,220
<i>The only people allowed in here 
are the emperor, his kin,</i>

54
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,850
<i>and eunuchs, "formerly male" individuals 
who lost an important part of their body.</i>

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,620
<i>It's a huge collective of two thousand 
concubines and servants,</i>

56
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,970
<i>and one thousand eunuchs.</i>

57
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,370
<i>Unlike the high, mid, 
and low-ranking concubines,</i>

58
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,370
<i>we serving girls are expendable 
and can lose our lives at any moment.</i>

59
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,960
<i>Next in line are the shut-in, 
low-ranking concubines.</i>

60
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
<i>I guess, at the very least, I get paid.</i>

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,600
Hey, Maomao...

62
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,340
Do you know which room this plate is for?

63
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,430
Oh. This one is Wisteria-9, so over there.

64
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,430
Thank you!

65
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,850
<i>Many of the servants are illiterate.</i>

66
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,100
<i>In order to work in the rear palace,</i>

67
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,010
<i>they're taught the bare minimum 
essentials of etiquette.</i>

68
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,740
<i>But reading and writing 
is a whole different story.</i>

69
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,620
<i>The raise I would get for being literate 
would just get swiped by my kidnappers.</i>

70
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,670
<i>That said, even servants like us 
could become low-ranking concubines.</i>

71
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,620
<i>What's key is...</i>

72
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,380
<i>Looks.</i>

73
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,630
<i>Freckles.</i>

74
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,880
<i>Flat.</i>

75
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,060
<i>Given my skin-and-bones look, 
that's not applicable to me.</i>

76
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,140
<i>If I stood out, my life would be
 at risk. I'm better off just laying low.</i>

77
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,460
<i>All I have to do is work hard. 
I'll be out in two years.</i>

78
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,390
I need a drink.

79
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,680
Hey, did you hear?

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,200
Huh?

81
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,180
I heard there's a super beautiful 
eunuch in the central area.

82
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,500
Everyone's been talking about him!

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,980
I see.

84
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,280
I'd like to get a glimpse of him, 
if he's so handsome!

85
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,170
Am I right?

86
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,950
A eunuch, huh?

87
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,450
She has lost much weight.

88
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,330
Yes.

89
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,340
Xiaoling...

90
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,880
I'm sorry, the physician is busy 
attending to the prince.

91
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,090
I see...

92
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,730
They're only three months and six months old, right?

93
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah, both the prince and Princess Lingli...

94
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,100
Is it really a curse?!

95
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,360
What are you talking about?

96
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,800
You didn't hear, Maomao?

97
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,250
The entire rear palace 
is buzzing about this rumor.

98
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,850
The deaths of all the heirs 
born in the rear palace!

99
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,970
All three of the emperor's children 
born so far grew weak and passed away!

100
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,580
Doesn't that seem weird?!

101
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,970
All three?

102
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,370
And it looks like the same
thing's happening now.

103
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,750
You mean they're unwell?

104
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,890
Yes! And this time, the doctor went to visit 
both Lady Gyokuyou and Lady Lihua!

105
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,220
Huh...

106
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
The emperor doesn't have an empress 
consort, so that makes Lady Lihua,

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,310
who gave birth to the prince, 
the empress consort, right?!

108
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,940
Naturally, I guess.

109
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,170
Since there is no empress consort,

110
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,980
Concubine Lihua gave birth to the prince,

111
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,560
so she should be considered 
the top of the rear palace.

112
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,470
But then, rumor says the emperor 
favors Lady Gyokuyou.

113
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,450
They say that could be 
related to the curse, too.

114
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,040
A power struggle...

115
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,730
Lady Lihua might be worse off, 
since the doctor is always with her.

116
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,330
Lady Lihua herself is sick, too?

117
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,850
Yeah, mother and child both. 
Head and stomach aches.

118
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,300
Nausea too, I think.

119
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,100
Headache, stomachache, nausea...

120
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,230
It <i>has</i> to be a curse!

121
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,250
Curses are stupid.

122
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,900
Huh?

123
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,100
Headache, stomachache, nausea...

124
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Poison is a possibility.

125
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,690
No, if it's over the position of imperial heir,

126
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,900
it doesn't make sense to go after the princess.

127
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,970
Deliberate poisoning is low on the list of possibilities.

128
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,290
Could an illness be more likely?

129
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,660
Perhaps something hereditary?

130
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,220
Why am I taking a rumor so seriously?

131
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,780
It's all just conjecture.

132
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,670
But still...

133
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,100
I guess I can take a quick peek.

134
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,940
Given this is where all the high-ranked 
concubines' pavilions are,

135
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,730
every building is exquisite, 
right down to the individual pillars.

136
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,870
It's your fault!

137
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,330
Lady Gyokuyou!

138
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,960
You're trying to curse my son, 
because your child is a daughter!

139
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,300
You know that's absurd!

140
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,090
My Xiaoling is sick, too!

141
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,110
Lady Lihua is furious.

142
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,180
I feel sorry for Lady Gyokuyou.

143
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,430
Master Jinshi...

144
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,220
That's why I'd like you to examine 
my daughter's state, as well.

145
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,650
Yes... Well... Um...

146
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,510
<i>Is that flustered eunuch 
in the middle the physician?</i>

147
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,240
<i>What a stupid quack.</i>

148
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,740
<i>He seriously still hasn't noticed? After 
spending all that time near the concubines?</i>

149
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,980
<i>Or rather...</i>

150
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,500
<i>Maybe he really doesn't know?</i>

151
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,230
<i>Death of the infants. 
Headache, stomachache, nausea.</i>

152
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,320
<i>And most of all, how 
Lady Lihua seems so worn out.</i>

153
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,760
<i>As I thought, this is no curse.</i>

154
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,020
<i>The only issue is, how do I tell them?</i>

155
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,180
<i>If only I could find something to write with...</i>

156
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,940
<i>Barely a month passed before word got around</i>

157
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,570
<i>that the prince had passed away.</i>

158
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,610
It seems like you have a question for me.

159
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,570
Is that...

160
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,020
The day I visited the Crystal Pavilion 
to ask to have my daughter examined,

161
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,980
I found this on the windowsill, 
tied to this branch.

162
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,850
A rhododendron.

163
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,550
"The white face powder is poison. 
Don't let the baby touch it."

164
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,680
It truly is a sin to be ignorant.

165
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,750
The palace physician would not take 
such a roundabout approach.

166
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,620
Agreed. He never could seem 
to figure out how to treat the prince.

167
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,940
Who could have sent this message?

168
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,940
I'd like you to find out.

169
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,450
<i>Coming to think of it, back then...</i>

170
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,140
If only I could find something to write with...

171
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,960
Understood.

172
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,300
May I keep this for the time being?

173
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,850
I heard the emperor is visiting 
Lady Gyokuyou a lot,

174
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,390
to show his love for 
the surviving princess.

175
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,590
What about Lady Lihua?

176
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,090
Haven't heard anything about her.

177
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,470
How convenient.

178
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,670
Oh, there you are.

179
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,650
You are to report to the Matron 
of the Serving Women immediately.

180
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,850
You're being summoned?

181
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,160
For what, I wonder?

182
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,910
All right, all of you who've 
gathered here, head inside.

183
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,090
<i>Serving girls getting summoned by 
the high officials can't be good news...</i>

184
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,260
<i>Or do they just want more workers?</i>

185
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,480
Thank you all for coming.

186
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,740
<i>Who is this arrogant-looking woman?</i>

187
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,290
I am Jinshi, manager of the rear palace.

188
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,940
<i>That's a man?</i>

189
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,880
<i>Ah, that must be the good-looking 
eunuch that Xiaolan was talking about.</i>

190
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,880
<i>That's a waste. He's so handsome,
but he can't have children.</i>

191
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,890
You with the freckles, stay here

192
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,890
<i>Huh? Freckles? Stay...?</i>

193
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,740
<i>Oh, no!</i>

194
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,720
We're done here. You may
 all return to your rooms.

195
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,530
Huh?

196
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,650
What was that about?

197
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,070
<i>Did I do something to get attention?!</i>

198
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,180
<i>Wait, did the message from the other day...</i>

199
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,110
<i>Ah!</i>

200
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,300
<i>I'm the only servant here who can read!</i>

201
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,750
<i>He wrote that just now to single me out!</i>

202
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,500
<i>Oh no, I have to get out!</i>

203
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,960
Come now, I just told you to stay.

204
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,340
Just keep quiet and follow me.

205
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,010
<i>It was a trap...</i>

206
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,510
This is odd. I looked you up. 
It said you couldn't read.

207
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,400
I am of lowly birth. It must be a mistake.

208
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:13,410
<i>I'll never admit it. Pretending to be ignorant 
makes everything easier in this world.</i>

209
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,690
<i>Besides, how did this man 
find out about the messages?</i>

210
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,660
<i>I made absolutely sure nobody was around...</i>

211
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,130
<i>He's so mistrustful!</i>

212
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,660
<i>Rather, he must have nothing better to do!</i>

213
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,740
Please.

214
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,090
Excuse me.

215
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,960
<i>What will I be punished for?</i>

216
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,260
<i>I hope I make it out of this alive.</i>

217
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,300
I brought her.

218
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,730
Come in.

219
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,900
Thank you for your trouble.

220
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,950
I'm so glad.

221
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,450
So, it was you.

222
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,960
Thank you for saving Lingli's life.

223
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,460
P-Please, I'm not worthy of such kindness!

224
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,810
No, I can't ever thank you enough.

225
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,970
You are my baby's savior.

226
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,750
Perhaps you have the wrong person?

227
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,060
There must be a misunderstanding.

228
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,800
<i>I don't want to get beheaded for lying,</i>

229
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,020
<i>but I don't want to get involved, either!</i>

230
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,110
Concubine Gyokuyou showed me something.

231
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:53,090
The white face powder is poison.
Don't let the baby touch it.

232
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,890
Did you know this fabric is used 
in the clothing for the serving girls?

233
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,050
It does look similar, I suppose...

234
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,990
Yes, for those who work on clothing, I hear.

235
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,090
Like a laundry worker, such as yourself.

236
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,840
Did you rip apart a skirt, perhaps?

237
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,970
<i>So, he figured out that much already...</i>

238
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:07,270
Now, you will explain why you put 
that flower on the windowsill.

239
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,600
Because I figured out what was wrong that day.

240
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,330
That the cause was the makeup powder.

241
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,960
There were many courtesans

242
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,330
who used high-end powder 
in the brothels that I grew up in.

243
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:37,630
Most of them were poisoned 
by it and lost their lives.

244
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,970
They tried to trade life 
for beauty and lost both.

245
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,070
I used to be an apothecary, 
so I know a few things about poisons.

246
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
That face powder...

247
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
It was used by the baby's nurse.

248
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,670
She said it has a better whitening effect 
compared to other powders.

249
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,800
She seemed to have gotten ill too, so I gave 
her a break. I paid her properly, too.

250
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,860
I see.

251
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,510
It truly is a sin to be ignorant.

252
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,100
I should have paid more attention to
 the things that go into my baby's mouth.

253
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,410
I am guilty, as well.

254
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,190
Had I noticed sooner, I might
 have been able to save more lives.

255
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,740
The Prince, too...

256
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,670
When I saw the message, I told 
Concubine Lihua about it, as well.

257
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,000
But it seemed like everything 
I said only made her believe me less.

258
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,780
So...

259
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,760
What can I do for you?

260
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,940
Well, starting today, you'll 
be my lady-in-waiting!

261
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,210
Huh?

262
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,020
<i>There are some things Maomao cannot hold back.</i>

263
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,060
<i>Curiosity, a thirst for knowledge...</i>

264
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,870
<i>And just a smidgen of a sense of justice.</i>

265
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,260
No, no, no, no...

266
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,630
No, if I keep a low profile, 
it shouldn't matter where Iâ€”

267
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,210
Hey, Maomao!

268
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,390
Welcome back, Maomao! How was it?

269
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,520
<i>And thus, Maomao became a
 lady-in-waiting of Concubine Gyokuyou,</i>

270
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>recipient of the emperor's love.</i>

271
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,810
<i>Put simply, it was a big promotion.</i>

272
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,570
Hey!

273
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,840
It's poison!

274
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

275
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,220
<i>Next time: "Chilly Apothecary."</i>

276
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 2: Chilly Apothecary
