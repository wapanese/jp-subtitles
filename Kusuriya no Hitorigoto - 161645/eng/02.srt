The Apothecary Diaries

00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,940
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

Episode 2: Chilly Apothecary

5
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,260
Hey!

6
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,620
It's poison!

7
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,990
Damn you! Who's behind this?!

8
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,170
Wait.

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,210
Tend to the soldiers first.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,390
Poison?

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,630
The food was cooked by the villagers.

12
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,800
The village leader has been put into 
custody for aiding the barbarians.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Please advise.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,250
Understood. Give me a moment.

15
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,050
As you wish.

16
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,450
By the way...

17
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,160
I heard you hired a new lady-in-waiting 
to serve Concubine Gyokuyou.

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,870
Yes. Concubine Gyokuyou 
has only four women serving her.

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,310
It's too few compared to Concubine Lihua,

20
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,420
who also high-ranking and has over ten.

21
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,470
It hurts her dignity as
 a high-ranking concubine.

22
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,280
Yes. However, Concubine Gyokuyou
 is not just bright and gentle,

23
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,600
but also wise and cautious.

24
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,100
She would never hire 
someone of unknown origin.

25
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,170
Being constantly wary of 
everyone around them

26
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,480
is the only way an emperor's 
concubine can survive.

27
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,240
And who is this new lady-in-waiting?

28
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,750
Gaoshun, I found just the right pawn.

29
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,790
It's that freckled servant girl.

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,620
Her knowledge of medicine 
is too valuable to pass up.

31
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,470
I see. But if she were to abuse 
that knowledge...

32
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,420
I'll make sure she can't do that.

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,800
It should be easy.

34
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,690
<i>I suppose I should seduce
 her a little, just in case.</i>

35
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,450
It's so cool that you get to serve 
a high-ranking concubine.

36
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,650
Ugh, I really didn't want to.

37
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,500
Apothecary. Are you ready to move?

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,690
Yes, I'm on my way to the Jade Pavilion soon.

39
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,340
Did you need something?

40
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,000
No, nothing.

41
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,060
Huh?

42
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,880
<i>Why's he here, then? Nothing better to do?</i>

43
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,920
Be sure to serve Concubine Gyokuyou well.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,810
Excuse me.

45
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,810
Good luck, Maomao!

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,310
Ew, gross...

47
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,200
Are you Maomao?

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,530
Oh, yes.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,950
I am Hongniang, 
head lady-in-waiting for Lady Gyokuyou.

50
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,830
For starters, I'll show you around 
the Jade Pavilion. Follow me.

51
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,540
Yes.

52
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,920
Welcome to the Jade Pavilion. 
I've been waiting for you, Maomao.

53
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,930
Looks like Xiaoling is happy to see you, too.

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,330
We're glad to have you around.

55
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,090
Thank you.

56
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,460
This is the parlor, where we bring guests.

57
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,770
So big...

58
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,440
This is the kitchen. You should be able 
to do some simple cooking here.

59
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,780
Wow.

60
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,640
This is the living room.

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,330
Here are the other ladies-in-waiting. 
Let me introduce them to you.

62
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,950
Everyone, gather up.

63
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,200
Yes!

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,250
Nice to meet you, I'm Yinghua. Ask me anything!

65
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,900
I am Guiyuan. Nice to meet you.

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,010
I am Ailan. Very pleased to meet you.

67
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm Maomao. Looking forward 
to working with you.

68
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,380
At the Jade Pavilion, 
we don't hire any serving girls.

69
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,740
So, we do all the work around here.

70
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,030
It's the least we can do to make sure 
Lady Gyokuyou lives comfortably.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,900
Then I'll alsoâ€”

72
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,980
You go ahead and rest in your room.

73
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,750
Huh?

74
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,690
Take it easy.

75
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,420
You have a special task coming up.

76
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,990
Special task?

77
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,080
Maomao, I'll show you to your room.

78
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,330
Um, sure.

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
Did you see her left arm?

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,160
She's hiding it with those bandages, 
but there are scars under them, right?

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,920
She must have been abused 
by her parents back home,

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,360
and sold off to the rear palace...

83
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,980
On top of that, there's that terrible job...

84
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,900
That poor, unfortunate girl!

85
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,740
Wait here until you're summoned, all right?

86
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,610
Hey, um...

87
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,910
I've gotten quite the promotion.

88
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,520
The Jade Pavilion's always 
been run by a select elite.

89
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,130
So of course a newcomer 
wouldn't be totally welcome.

90
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,300
But they all looked so...

91
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,950
Sympathetic? Why?

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,180
Tasting for poison.

93
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,390
That's your job, apothecary.

94
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,400
<i>Poison! Tasting for poison!</i>

95
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,110
<i>Oops.</i>

96
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,040
Food cooked for the concubine changes hands 
a few times before being brought here.

97
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,330
It's possible for it to be 
poisoned during that process.

98
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,110
In fact, when Concubine Gyokuyou 
became pregnant,

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,670
her food was poisoned at least twice.

100
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,470
The taster back then received nerve damage 
and still can't move her hands or feet.

101
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,340
<i>I see. That's why the others 
were sympathetic to me.</i>

102
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,290
So... Here you go.

103
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,480
<i>These bowls...</i>

104
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,860
<i>No suspicious colors. Or scents.</i>

105
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,990
<i>No numbness.</i>

106
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,490
I can't detect any poison here.

107
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:06,170
<i>Back when I lived by the brothels, 
I ran a lot of experiments on my arm.</i>

108
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,670
Mad scientist.

109
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,690
<i>I've gradually trained my body against poisons, 
so many of them have no effect on me.</i>

110
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,350
<i>To be honest, detecting
 poison isn't suited for me.</i>

111
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,570
<i>But in a way, I'm lucky to get this job.</i>

112
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,420
She's laughing...

113
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,990
I think you should switch to silver plates. 
Those react to poisons.

114
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,990
It's like Master Jinshi said. We used
 ceramics on purpose to test you.

115
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,680
<i>That was his idea!</i>

116
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,460
Your knowledge applies to both
 poisons and medicines, then.

117
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,200
I used to work as an apothecary.

118
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,110
If you'd mentioned that you're literate, 
you would have gotten paid more.

119
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,280
I was kidnapped and brought here,

120
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,390
and I'm incensed that part of my pay 
gets sent to the kidnappers.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,800
So, you'd rather take less pay than give 
your kidnappers drinking money, hmm?

122
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,980
Goodness, this was quite expensive.

123
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,400
You couldn't afford it with 
your lady-in-waiting salary.

124
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,000
How will you send money to your family?

125
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,340
In fact, we might need to charge them.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Ah, I'm so sorry.

127
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,970
Please take it out of the money to my family.

128
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,970
If that's not enough,
 from my savings, too.

129
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,240
Yes, I'll arrange the paperwork.

130
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,270
By the way, here's hazard pay 
for your food tasting services.

131
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,230
<i>Almost equal to my regular salary...</i>

132
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,410
<i>Since the kidnappers don't get 
a cut of this, it all goes to me.</i>

133
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,370
Thank you.

134
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,690
<i>She knows how to motivate her workers.</i>

135
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,510
Don't worry about it!

136
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,300
Rest for now.

137
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
We've always been fully staffed.

138
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm bored!

139
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,900
I only get called on as taster for 
two meals and the mid-day tea time.

140
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,290
Now that I have my own room,

141
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,470
if there was a venomous snake or 
something, I could experiment...

142
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,660
Maomao.

143
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,960
Did you need me, Lady Gyokuyou?

144
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,660
He does, actually.

145
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,460
<i>Ugh.</i>

146
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,960
Why won't this work on her?

147
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,960
How may I serve you today?

148
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,680
I received these from a certain 
military officer. Can you taste them?

149
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,300
<i>Baozi</i> buns...

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,520
It has an aphrodisiac in it.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,980
You can tell without eating it?

152
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,910
It's not harmful. Please 
feel free to enjoy them.

153
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,930
Given who I received
 these from, I can't do that.

154
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,620
Perhaps that person 
might visit you tonight.

155
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,240
Hmm. So you can tell by the smell alone?

156
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,460
<i>Did this guy try to make me eat one 
knowing they have an aphrodisiac in them?!</i>

157
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,970
I had one more question for you.

158
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
Yes, what is it?

159
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,330
A squad of soldiers on a mission to attack 
some barbarians was poisoned the other day.

160
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,230
Poisoned?

161
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,140
Yes. Several fell ill after a meal.

162
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,500
They reported nausea, difficulty
 breathing, and other ailments.

163
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,490
Nausea and difficulty breathing...

164
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,860
The meal was prepared in a nearby village.

165
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,870
They arrested the village leader 
for assisting the barbarians,

166
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,910
but an officer diffused the situation,

167
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,580
and has put the decision on hold.

168
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,770
<i>It would be natural to assume 
the villagers poisoned the soldiers, but...</i>

169
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,380
Master Jinshi, where were they eating?

170
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,640
They were at camp, so 
they likely ate outside.

171
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,950
Did the villagers provide 
the plates and chopsticks?

172
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,680
No, the soldiers should 
have provided their own.

173
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,420
Did you notice something?

174
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,710
This is just my opinion. 
Let me share something.

175
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,150
This flower is a rhododendron.

176
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,840
Does it taste good?

177
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,650
No, eating it causes nausea 
and difficulty breathing.

178
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,160
Hey!

179
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,560
As you see, even the rear palace 
has plants with poison in them.

180
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,870
This one has poison in the leaves, but some 
have poison in the branches or roots.

181
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,080
Some wood can even emit poison when burned.

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,710
When burned...?

183
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,810
I see.

184
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,450
It's fortunate the bright
 officer was there.

185
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,340
We could have lost a whole village.

186
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,620
Yes.

187
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,620
If that's all, I'll take my leave.

188
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,220
No, wait.

189
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,570
Is there more?

190
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,660
Can you make an aphrodisiac?

191
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,120
<i>Make? You mean...</i>

192
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,540
<i>Making drugs?!</i>

193
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,000
Given time, the proper ingredients, 
and the right tools,

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,050
I could make something like that.

195
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,760
Master Jinshi, where are you headed?

196
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,650
I'm returning to my office. May I help you?

197
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,720
I was wondering if you'd have
 tea with me in my room...

198
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,400
Unfortunately, I have much work 
to attend to. Please excuse me.

199
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,410
The servants must not be aware

200
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,500
that Master Jinshi serves as a test 
of their loyalty to the emperor.

201
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,660
Just because the emperor does not visit her,

202
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,890
she shouldn't try and lure 
other men to her room.

203
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,530
What an indiscretion.

204
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,970
Indeed.

205
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,520
A concubine cannot simply be 
beautiful or well-educated.

206
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,530
They must be loyal to
 the emperor, and be chaste.

207
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,690
But to place you in the rear palace 
and use your beauty as a test...

208
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,520
Our emperor can be quite severe at times.

209
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,440
We all use whatever is available to us. But...

210
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,030
Not only does she feel no lust
 for me, but that look...

211
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,490
<i>Glare...</i>

212
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,720
<i>I've never been so harshly 
looked down on in my life.</i>

213
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,890
Well then, I will take my leave.

214
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,470
Perhaps that person 
might visit you tonight.

215
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,370
<i>Tonight... Tonight...</i>

216
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,310
I'm leaving now.

217
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,300
Good luck.

218
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,290
Yes!

219
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,600
Pardon me.

220
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,290
<i>The quack doctor, and...</i>

221
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,000
Miss Maomao. Let me reintroduce myself.

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
I am Gaoshun.

223
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,530
I'm Master Jinshi's assistant.

224
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,700
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

225
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,710
Hello.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,770
<i>It can't be easy assisting that guy.</i>

227
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,960
What is this servant girl 
doing in my territory?

228
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,520
This way, please.

229
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I have been told you may use 
anything in this room.

230
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,700
Is that some sort of cursed dance?

231
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,370
<i>What a luxury, being able 
to use paper so freely.</i>

232
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,550
And also, I need...

233
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,050
Over there?

234
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,340
<i>He's really quick to notice things. 
Compared to his master...</i>

235
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,340
<i>If you're not going to do 
anything, just go away.</i>

236
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,290
Here you are.

237
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,430
Thank you.

238
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,980
That's not enough...

239
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,580
What is this?

240
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,800
It's cacao.

241
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,770
If you need more, we'll simply find more.

242
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,900
But it's from the West, 
and the far southern region, too.

243
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,030
I'm sure there's more in
 the trading goods storage.

244
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,530
Milk, butter, sugar, honey, 
and powdered cacao.

245
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,670
That should be enough.

246
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,100
All expensive ingredients.

247
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,570
I wonder what she's making?

248
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,130
A snack, maybe?

249
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,340
What are you all doing?

250
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,350
Get back to work!

251
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,100
We're sorry!

252
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,350
Goodness.

253
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,810
Now to actually make the aphrodisiac!

254
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,990
<i>I had a taste of cacao just once in the past.</i>

255
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,910
This is called "chocolate." Say "ah," Maomao.

256
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,030
Maomao?!

257
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,730
<i>Perhaps a malicious customer wanted to get 
a popular courtesan's attention.</i>

258
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,850
<i>Unfortunately for him, he got
 banned by the shrewd old lady.</i>

259
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,680
Looks good.

260
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,260
There.

261
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,510
Now I just cool it and wait for it to harden.

262
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,310
<i>I have a bit left over. Oh, I know.</i>

263
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,980
<i>This probably doesn't need to be cooled.</i>

264
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,040
<i>I guess I should clean up now.</i>

265
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,790
<i>Wait, medicinal herbs?!</i>

266
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,490
<i>There too?! And over there!</i>

267
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,210
Oops, I got a little carried away.

268
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,230
Sorry for the delay!

269
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,410
At least we know it works.

270
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,890
So, what's going on?!

271
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,390
Well, it is what it is...

272
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,650
It's fine, they didn't go all the wayâ€”Ow!

273
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
So, this is the aphrodisiac?

274
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,110
No, this is.

275
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,450
Then what are the other ones?

276
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,990
A midnight snack for myself.

277
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,960
If you're used to alcohol 
and other stimulants,

278
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,790
it won't have that much of an effect.

279
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,130
Oh, so it won't be a problem if I ate it?

280
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,170
Please don't do that!

281
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,590
Haha, just joking.

282
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,700
<i>What a reprehensible joke to make 
in front of the emperor's concubine.</i>

283
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,080
<i>But if he approached someone with
 an impassioned blush on that face...</i>

284
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,810
<i>It'd immediately captivate
 any person, male or female.</i>

285
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,400
<i>He does have a great face, after all.</i>

286
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,150
It's quite strong, so please
 limit it to one piece at a time.

287
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,870
Too many could excessively increase 
blood flow and cause nosebleeds.

288
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,680
Maybe you can make some for the emperor, 
to avoid things getting too dull.

289
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,410
It should be around three times 
more potent than the usual tonic.

290
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,310
Three times? Does she mean duration...?

291
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,050
Let's pretend I didn't hear that.

292
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,440
Also, please only use it when you are 
alone with the person in mind.

293
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,810
Three times... Three times...

294
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,490
I see.

295
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,600
Well, I'll take my leave now.

296
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,610
So she can make drugs?

297
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,660
How reliable.

298
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,780
It's finally over.

299
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,540
Good work.

300
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,460
Thank you.

301
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
I see.

302
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,720
I hope there aren't any victims.

303
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

304
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,670
<i>Next time: "The Unsettling 
Matter of the Spirit."</i>

305
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 3: The Unsettling Matter of the Spirit
