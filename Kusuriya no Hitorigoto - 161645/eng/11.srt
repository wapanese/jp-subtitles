Episode 11: Reducing Two to One

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,330
A letter from Concubine Gyokuyou?

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,530
Yes. I was ordered to deliver it directly.

7
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,650
Lady Ah-Duo is away on a tea party.

8
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,680
There's something I would like to 
discuss with you, Lady Fengming.

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,780
I understand.

10
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,230
<i>The luggage is all packed up. 
That must mean, as I thought...</i>

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,650
Please.

12
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,820
So, what did you need today?

13
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,170
We've finished cleaning this place.

14
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,000
When are you moving out?

15
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,710
You're a smart one.

16
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,750
The big clean-up was an excuse.

17
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,810
In order to welcome a new high-ranked 
concubine during the new year's celebration,

18
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,060
Concubine Ah-Duo must leave this palace.

19
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,770
Concubine Ah-Duo can't have
 children anymore, can she?

20
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,610
What happened when she gave birth?

21
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,940
I fail to see how that's any of your business.

22
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,910
It is my business.

23
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,790
The doctor who attended 
that birth was my father.

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,700
My guess is the misfortune was 
that Concubine Ah-Duo,

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,330
the prince's concubine at the time,

26
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,050
gave birth at the same time 
as the empress dowager.

27
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,310
When is the doctor coming back?!

28
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,000
He's still at the empress dowager's.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,940
Lady Ah-Duo!

30
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,690
Lady Ah-Duo, it's all right! 
Fengming is by your side!

31
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,160
The empress dowager was given higher priority,

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,950
and Concubine Ah-Duo's childbirth had to wait.

33
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,830
Lady Ah-Duo.

34
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,710
That must have been when 
Concubine Ah-Duo lost her uterus.

35
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,090
The child that was born to Concubine 
Ah-Duo then passed away soon after.

36
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,000
Lady Fengming, are you 
blaming yourself for that?

37
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,560
You must have been the one taking care of 
the baby instead of Concubine Ah-Duo.

38
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,430
You've figured it all out,

39
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,570
despite being the daughter of the quack 
who couldn't help Lady Ah-Duo.

40
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,280
You're right.

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
...Luomen, expelled...

42
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,640
It's thought that the cause 
of the baby's death was

43
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,540
the same toxic make-up
 from the other incidents,

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,130
but that's not the case, is it?

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,840
That doctor you call a quack 
must have banned that powder.

46
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,760
You're a wise person. You wouldn't
 have let the baby die from that.

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,400
The real cause of death was this.

48
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
Many flowers have poison in them,

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
like aconite or azalea.

50
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,110
Their nectar can be poisonous, too.

51
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,610
I am aware.

52
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,350
But back then...

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
you weren't.

54
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,330
You didn't realize regular 
honey with no poison,

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,660
the medicine you thought was good for health,

56
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,790
can be harmful to a newborn baby.

57
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,560
Thank you for your help as always, Fengming.

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,720
It's no trouble at all, Lady Ah-Duo.

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
Please rest and recover soon.

60
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,460
And thus, Concubine Ah-Duo's child passed away.

61
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,810
The cause was treated as a mystery.

62
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,800
My father Luomen, the attending 
doctor at the time,

63
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,800
was blamed for the repeated mistakes, 
including the one at childbirth.

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,740
He was expelled from the rear palace.

65
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,830
But later on, you accidentally learned 
the true cause of the baby's death.

66
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,040
Someone taught you that honey can be 
poisonous to infants, didn't they?

67
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,180
You had to make sure 
Concubine Ah-Duo didn't find out.

68
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,300
She couldn't know you were 
the one who killed her only child.

69
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,310
So, you tried to eliminate them.

70
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,560
That person is...

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,140
Concubine Lishu.

72
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,820
During the previous emperor's reign,

73
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,900
Concubine Lishu was close to 
Concubine Ah-Duo, who was her elder.

74
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,070
Concubine Ah-Duo was also 
fond of Concubine Lishu.

75
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,330
A young girl, taken from her parents,

76
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,780
and a woman who could no longer give birth.

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,930
There may have been a type of 
codependency developing.

78
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,990
During that time, you learned
 from Concubine Lishu

79
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,090
that she almost died eating honey as a baby.

80
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,520
To make sure Concubine Ah-Duo 
never heard that story,

81
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,450
you started to chase Concubine Lishu 
away from the Garnet Pavilion.

82
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,400
Later, the previous emperor passed away,

83
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,650
and Concubine Lishu was forced to leave the
 rear palace, unaware of why she was chased out.

84
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,230
You must have felt quite relieved.

85
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,820
But Concubine Lishu, who you 
thought you'd never see again,

86
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,080
returned to the rear palace.

87
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,520
As another high-ranking concubine.

88
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,060
As a threat to Concubine Ah-Duo's status.

89
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,120
That insolent child tried to visit 
Concubine Ah-Duo many times,

90
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,380
as if trying to be with her mother.

91
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,830
To protect Concubine Ah-Duo, 
who is incapable of childbirth,

92
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,850
and to hide the issue with the honey...

93
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,890
You poisoned Concubine Lishu's soup.

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,610
What do you want?

95
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,940
There's nothing.

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,980
Anything. Just ask.

97
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,660
You must know that's meaningless.

98
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,690
Hey. Do you know what's most precious 
to the person most precious to you?

99
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,000
The moment I met Lady Ah-Duo,

100
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,660
I knew I would never serve anyone else again.

101
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,660
Despite being a woman,

102
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,370
she had a strong will, and the ability 
to speak on even grounds with the prince.

103
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,130
I had nothing but the deepest 
respect for Lady Ah-Duo.

104
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,280
Compared to me, who just followed my 
parents' orders to become a lady-in-waiting,

105
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,840
she was such an astonishing person.

106
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,740
Despite that, I...

107
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,110
I took what was most precious 
to her with my own hands...

108
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,630
I took him away!

109
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,020
The baby that Lady Ah-Duo loved so dearly!

110
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,480
With these hands!

111
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,270
Back then...

112
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,450
Lady Ah-Duo told us this.

113
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,350
Do not blame yourselves for this.

114
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,660
Babies can die for any
 reason until they're seven.

115
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,120
Even the slightest illness 
can easily kill them.

116
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,310
My baby simply followed 
the will of the heavens.

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,150
And yet, I knew she cried 
herself to sleep every night!

118
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,940
<i>What was her mental state like, as she served 
Lady Ah-Duo for the past sixteen years?</i>

119
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,700
<i>Without having her own partner, 
sacrificing everything for Concubine Ah-Duo...</i>

120
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,040
<i>I can't relate.</i>

121
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,960
<i>I don't have it in my heart 
to keep someone so close.</i>

122
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,040
<i>If he hears my story, Master Jinshi 
will surely apprehend Fengming.</i>

123
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,540
<i>There's no way she'd 
escape capital punishment.</i>

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,820
<i>She's a smart woman. She knows all of that.</i>

125
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,390
I have a suggestion.

126
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,860
The only thing I can do is to take 
your two motives and make it one.

127
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,180
It won't change the results.

128
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,240
But if that's still preferable 
to you, please hear me out.

129
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,570
So tired...

130
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,810
A bath... No, it's too late for that.

131
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,430
Guess I can at least get changed.

132
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,380
I wore layers of stiffened 
oil paper, just in case.

133
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,140
Glad I didn't need it.

134
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,890
Getting slashed would hurt.

135
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,900
And so, Fengming turned herself in.

136
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,070
Do you know anything about it?

137
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,950
What do you mean?

138
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,060
I heard you had Gaoshun 
collect some information.

139
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,620
Yes. I'd hoped to figure something 
out, but it was all for naught.

140
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
Fengming's motive, as you said, 
was to try to make sure

141
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,750
Concubine Ah-Duo could stay in the 
position of one of the four concubines.

142
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,510
I see.

143
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,300
But Concubine Ah-Duo has already been 
determined to leave the rear palace.

144
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,010
She'll live in the detached 
palace to the south.

145
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,280
Does this incident have 
anything to do with that?

146
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,520
No, the decision was made a while ago.

147
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,490
It was the emperor's call.

148
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,520
I see.

149
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,150
This flower.

150
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,530
Hongniang came by earlier to put it on display.

151
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,860
Yes, it's out of season.

152
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,590
It's sweet.

153
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,590
Poisonous, though.

154
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,380
It's not lethal. Don't worry.

155
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,060
<i>My suggestion to Fengming, back then...</i>

156
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,780
<i>The poisoning of Concubine Lishu. 
The cause of death for the baby.</i>

157
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,040
<i>If these two motives become one,</i>

158
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,400
<i>she could hide the cause of the baby's 
death from Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

159
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,550
<i>Even if her own death is inevitable...</i>

160
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,490
<i>That was the best I could do, 
as a girl with no power.</i>

161
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,550
I can't sleep.

162
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,510
Maybe I'll take a walk.

163
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,050
<i>Fengming was executed.</i>

164
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,790
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo is set to leave 
the rear palace tomorrow.</i>

165
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,580
Oh, someone beat me here?

166
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,340
You're that girl who came 
to help clean the other day.

167
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,240
I'll leave right away.

168
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,180
No.

169
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,510
Care to join me for a drink?

170
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,220
Whoa! Booze!

171
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,160
Thank you very much.

172
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,440
Pretty masculine, aren't I?

173
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,820
I feel like you're giving
 that impression on purpose.

174
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,250
You're an honest one.

175
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:24,150
After my son left me, I became 
the emperor's friend, not his concubine.

176
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,340
Or rather, I <i>returned</i> to being his friend.

177
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,060
I never thought I'd become a concubine.

178
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,780
I was a concubine in name only, 
given the role out of pity.

179
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,110
I wanted to hand it off to someone 
else as soon as possible.

180
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,360
Why cling to it for so long...?

181
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,350
<i>She probably would have said the same 
things to whoever she'd met up here.</i>

182
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,420
It must have been cold in that water.

183
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,000
It must have been painful.

184
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,920
You're probably right.

185
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,510
Stupid, don't you think?

186
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,870
Perhaps she was.

187
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,330
We're all stupid.

188
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,160
Perhaps we are.

189
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,390
<i>I think I get it now.</i>

190
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,430
<i>That servant was indeed a suicide.</i>

191
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,490
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo noticed that.</i>

192
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,580
<i>Maybe Fengming helped set it up.</i>

193
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,360
<i>To take suspicion away from Concubine Ah-Duo,</i>

194
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,940
<i>the servant chose to sink down 
into the cold water.</i>

195
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,950
<i>To keep her secret hidden,</i>

196
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,650
<i>Fengming chose to step up to the gallows.</i>

197
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,720
<i>Regardless of Concubine
 Ah-Duo's own wishes,</i>

198
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,880
<i>there are those who 
sacrifice their lives for her.</i>

199
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,200
I should go now, too.

200
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
What are you doing?

201
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,320
Ow... Who's that? You startled me.

202
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,020
My bad.

203
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,880
Master Jinshi? Why are you here?

204
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,340
I should ask the same of you.

205
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,340
I'm sorry. I'll get up now—

206
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,770
Could you let go?

207
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,070
Let go, please.

208
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,850
Don't wanna. It's too cold.

209
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,400
You'll catch a cold without a coat. 
Please go back to your room.

210
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,020
Are you drunk?

211
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,610
I had to. I was sharing a drink with someone.

212
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,630
<i>Sharing, huh?</i>

213
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,640
The host invited me to drink,

214
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,440
loaded me up full of booze,

215
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,530
then just took off.

216
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,420
When she finally came back,

217
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
she told me she was satisfied
 now, and threw me out.

218
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,880
<i>I didn't know anyone in this rear 
palace could treat this guy like that.</i>

219
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,040
<i>But that's not related to this right now.</i>

220
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,310
<i>I don't want to put up with a clingy drunk.</i>

221
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:28,620
<i>Wait... Come to think of it, 
he did catch me as I fell.</i>

222
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,030
<i>Maybe it's rude to just make him let go 
of me without even thanking him.</i>

223
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,870
Master Jinshi—

224
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,790
Just a little longer.

225
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,700
Keep me warm, just a little longer.

226
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,060
<i>Neither of them seem hungover.</i>

227
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,480
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo, in order
 to leave the rear palace,</i>

228
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,610
<i>returns the crown signifying 
her as Pure Concubine.</i>

229
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,120
<i>That crown will be bestowed on another girl 
who will join the rear palace later.</i>

230
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,360
<i>Ah, I see.</i>

231
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
<i>I knew she resembled someone.</i>

232
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,460
<i>It's Master Jinshi.</i>

233
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,470
<i>Those two might as well swap outfits...</i>

234
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,470
Swap...

235
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,560
After my son left me...

236
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,560
<i>"Left me," she said. Not "died"?</i>

237
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,510
<i>I can almost interpret that 
to mean he's still alive.</i>

238
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,210
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo's child and 
the then-empress dowager's child...</i>

239
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,230
<i>What if the two babies were swapped?</i>

240
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,250
<i>It must have been clear to Concubine Ah-Duo, 
through her experience in childbirth.</i>

241
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,040
What are you doing?! I must 
tend to Concubine Ah-Duo...

242
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,740
The empress dowager takes priority!

243
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,610
N-No!

244
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,600
<i>After all, she was just a nurse's daughter, 
a childhood friend of the prince.</i>

245
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,800
<i>Her son would live a better life 
as the empress dowager's son.</i>

246
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,270
<i>Maybe she wasn't in a state 
to decide what was right or wrong.</i>

247
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,190
<i>But if the decision resulted
 in her son surviving...</i>

248
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,020
<i>That would have been all that 
Concubine Ah-Duo could have wished for.</i>

249
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,220
<i>What if people found out 
the babies were swapped later?</i>

250
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,440
<i>If that was after the one baby had died,</i>

251
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,120
<i>that would explain why my dad would be 
physically punished for not noticing.</i>

252
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,120
<i>And if that were the case,</i>

253
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,540
<i>it would explain why the emperor's younger 
brother is in a delicate position,</i>

254
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>and why Concubine Ah-Duo, 
who's supposed to be a realist,</i>

255
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,900
<i>stayed in the rear palace for so long...</i>

256
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,630
<i>Complete nonsense. 
An idiotic delusion of a story.</i>

257
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,850
Please, wait!

258
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,190
Lady Lishu!

259
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,730
<i>As always.</i>

260
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,130
<i>As a lonely concubine, to have 
a lady-in-waiting she can trust...</i>

261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,240
<i>How reassuring that must be.</i>

262
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,250
Lady Lishu!

263
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,860
<i>At that moment, her masculine, noble face
 suddenly took on the expression of a mother.</i>

264
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,010
Here is the list of Fengming's family 
and those connected to them.

265
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,820
I heard she was kidnapped and sold off, but...

266
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,030
Jade Pavilion
Maomao

267
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,940
<i>Not just some superficial sweetness</i>

268
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,260
<i>I want more warmth than I can even use, oh</i>

269
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,590
<i>Having these selfish idealistic thoughts</i>

270
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,160
<i>I swallowed them again today 
before putting them into words</i>

271
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,330
<i>Still in my memories, 
the scent of fragrant olive</i>

272
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,450
<i>The color of twilight in the city</i>

273
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,270
<i>We were laughing...</i>

274
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:53,180
<i>Filled with sadness, 
the tears welled up in my eyes</i>

275
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:01,400
<i>I found a glow during those days</i>

276
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,460
<i>I guess I took everything for granted</i>

277
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:18,500
<i>The wind was so loud I covered my ears</i>

278
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:26,040
<i>I gotta stop being like that</i>

279
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:34,240
<i>Even if I stumble over the words of love</i>

280
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:50,050
Next Time

281
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,540
<i>Next time: "The Eunuch 
and the Courtesan."</i>

282
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,050
Episode 12: The Eunuch and the Courtesan
