The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,990
That can't be!

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,280
Episode 3: The Unsettling Matter of the Spirit

6
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,900
A reward?!

7
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
I understand.

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,240
Lady Fuyou!

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,480
Please, wait!

10
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,600
Wow, that's cold!

11
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,980
We've been at the capital for a while now,

12
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,730
but the morning cold 
is still hard to get used to.

13
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,210
I miss the sand and sunlight back home.

14
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,220
The mornings and nights 
were cold back west as well, though.

15
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,000
Ah, the Western Capital...

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,140
It feels like a long time ago.

17
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,200
And yet, Lady Gyokuyou's 
palace entry feels like yesterday.

18
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,400
By the way, my father gave me some good news.

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Apparently, trade between the western
 and central capitals is on the rise.

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,440
The emperor really does love Lady Gyokuyou.

21
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,920
It's the family home of 
the emperor's favorite concubine.

22
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,980
Surely the central officers
 can't ignore that.

23
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,030
Cleaning the kitchen? We'll help.

24
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,800
No, we have to split up or 
we'll never finish the work.

25
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,790
It's not like we can rely 
on other servants.

26
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes, I remember how bad it was 
back when she was pregnant,

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,840
like that time there was 
a poison needle in her dress.

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,290
Part of it is likely because she's 
the princess of a foreign land.

29
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,050
It's fine. We have one extra
 lady-in-waiting now, right?

30
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,520
Maomao, what are you making?

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,970
It's a cold remedy.

32
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,900
Wow, you can make those too?

33
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,860
The new lady-in-waiting is so talented.

34
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,310
Hey, are you sure you don't need anything?

35
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,760
Are you eating well?

36
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,170
Thanks to you, yes...

37
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,680
Please don't keep your troubles to yourself!

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,790
Sure...

39
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,430
By the way, did you hear the new 
rumor everyone's talking about?

40
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,350
No.

41
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,260
They say there's a spirit 
haunting the rear palace.

42
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,970
A spirit?

43
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,800
I heard that one! The ghostly lady
in white, right?

44
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,490
So, it's famous?

45
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,520
All of the servants, eunuchs, 
and concubines are talking about it!

46
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,480
I think it started a few weeks ago.

47
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,820
They say a ghostly lady in white 
dances in the air under the moonlight!

48
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,200
And she appears every night 
at the eastern castle walls!

49
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,700
Huh...

50
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,870
The castle walls completely 
surround the rear palace.

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,590
The only way to enter is through the four 
gates on the north, south, east and west.

52
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,620
The gates are always guarded, 
and the walls are surrounded by a moat.

53
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,590
Sneaking in or out would be impossible.

54
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,680
They say that sunken in the moats are...

55
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,650
The corpses of concubines 
who tried to escape.

56
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,030
In other words, just your typical ghost story.

57
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,980
What should I do if I see the spirit for real?

58
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,970
It's just a rumor.

59
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,120
Excuse me. Could you 
take a look at this medicine?

60
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,130
Hey, little lady. One moment.

61
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,750
<i>To think that he was so wary 
of me just a short while ago.</i>

62
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,550
<i>When he found out I can make medicine, 
he started allowing me to do it here.</i>

63
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,260
<i>He also gives me the ingredients I need.</i>

64
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,180
<i>He even makes me tea.</i>

65
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,770
<i>Should he really be so laid back?</i>

66
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,150
Sorry to make you wait.

67
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,360
Wow...

68
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,360
You like salty better than sweet, right?

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,320
May I have some as well?

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right away!

71
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,530
Good work.

72
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,210
It's the least I could do.

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,330
<i>Does this guy have nothing better to do?</i>

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,690
<i>Shouldn't he be at the Domestic 
Service Department as a eunuch?</i>

75
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,810
<i>Instead, he wanders around the entire 
rear palace like he's on surveillance duty...</i>

76
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
<i>In that case, he must outrank 
the Matron of the Serving Women.</i>

77
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,190
<i>He could be the emperor's guardian, 
but he's too young for that.</i>

78
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,690
<i>Ah. He must be the emperor's 
"personal favorite."</i>

79
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,450
Are you thinking something
 inappropriate right now?

80
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,780
Huh? You're imagining things.

81
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,630
Doctor, could you fetch me this?

82
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,250
So, what do you really want?

83
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,760
Have you heard about the spirit haunting?

84
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,680
A few rumors, yes.

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,050
How about sleepwalking?

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,560
Sleepwalking...

87
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,230
Seems like I got your attention.

88
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,060
How can it be cured?

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,570
I don't know. There's no medicine 
that cures somnambulism.

90
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,070
Is there a cure other than medicine?

91
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,490
My specialty is medicine.

92
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,950
That's too bad.

93
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,460
That's truly, truly too bad.

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,400
<i>Yuck! He's so persistent!</i>

95
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,780
I'll do my best.

96
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,860
<i>This guy doesn't come off like a eunuch.</i>

97
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,740
Lady Maomao.

98
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,070
Please don't call me "Lady." 
You outrank me by quite a bit.

99
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,060
In that case, how's Xiaomao?

100
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,580
<i>A "Xiao" nickname? That was a sharp turn.</i>

101
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,380
Could you stop glaring down at
Master Jinshi like he's an insect?

102
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,210
<i>Yikes, he knows.</i>

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,550
When he returned earlier,

104
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,550
he told me, ecstatically, how you stared 
at him like he was a venomous caterpillar.

105
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,090
I'll be more careful.

106
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,860
If someone unprepared saw him 
like that, they might pass out.

107
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,190
<i>To each their own, I guess...</i>

108
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,270
Over there.

109
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,090
A moonlit cotton rose...

110
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,880
That's a good guess.

111
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,640
That is Concubine Fuyou.

112
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,000
She's a mid-ranking concubine,

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,270
scheduled to be bestowed 
to a military officer as a reward.

114
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,890
It's been two years, I think.

115
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,140
She's a timid princess.

116
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,150
She's supposed to be a skilled dancer, 
but stumbled at her first showing.

117
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,670
The emperor hasn't laid a finger on her, 
and she shut herself in ever since.

118
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,250
I guess some things can't be avoided, but...

119
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,430
Lady Fuyou!

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,360
A bestowal? I feel sorry for her.

121
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,880
<i>She started sleepwalking over the shock
 of being treated as a reward?</i>

122
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,350
<i>They do say illness is a result 
of an unbalanced mind...</i>

123
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,850
<i>No, I need more information.</i>

124
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,770
<i>Maybe I'll take another look at her.</i>

125
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,410
Where is Concubine Fuyou's room?

126
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,370
Her building is on the north side.

127
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,240
Thank you. And thank you for the snacks.

128
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,330
Leaving already?

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,850
I hope she feels better.

130
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,990
I heard she's a princess 
from a small vassal state.

131
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sure she doesn't want to go back.

132
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,460
Go back?

133
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,750
Oh, yes. She's...

134
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,610
I feel sorry for Concubine Fuyou.

135
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,780
Yes, being given away to a military officer?

136
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,480
I shudder at the mere thought.

137
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,120
She seems very different from how 
she looked dancing on that wall.

138
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,240
Yes. I was surprised too, 
the first time I saw her.

139
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,830
She's very unassuming most of the time.

140
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,830
She really is like a cotton rose.

141
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,720
A cotton rose?

142
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Yes.

143
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,140
The fuyou flower, 
also known as the cotton rose,

144
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,370
blooms as a large white flower in the morning.

145
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,340
However, by evening, it turns a deep pink.

146
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,450
So, the flower changes its appearance 
over the course of a single day?

147
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,150
Yes.

148
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,490
The spirit story?

149
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,010
Yeah, I wanted to hear more about it. 
Do you know anything else?

150
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,660
Well, I heard she first 
appeared on the north side.

151
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,910
Huh? The north side?

152
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,050
Xiaolan! Laundry!

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,420
She moved from the north to the east?

154
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,850
Coming!

155
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,880
Gotta go.

156
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,880
Also...

157
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,720
Oh, yes. She's...

158
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,560
I knew it. Concubine Fuyou is...

159
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,230
My dad would tell me not to speak up 
based on just speculation, but...

160
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,200
Not much is known about 
somnambulance, or sleepwalking.

161
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
It is said that it's caused by stress.

162
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,660
The patient moves about 
in their sleep, as if they're awake.

163
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,620
A while ago, at the brothels, 
I saw a courtesan with the same illness.

164
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,460
She was a cheerful person, 
skilled at poetry.

165
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,700
She even received a purchase offer.

166
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,010
However, that offer fell through.

167
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,430
She started roaming the brothel at night, 
as if possessed by a demonic spirit.

168
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,320
Why hello. What's wrong, everyone?

169
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,820
She had no recollection of the night before.

170
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,530
And then what happened?

171
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:55,040
Nothing. When the purchase offer was
 rescinded, the sleepwalking stopped.

172
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,500
So... That courtesan 
didn't want to get sold off?

173
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,800
It's possible.

174
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,470
The offer was made by a wealthy merchant,

175
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,380
but not only did he have a wife and 
children, he had grandchildren as well.

176
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,730
Also, she only had one year left on her term.

177
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,230
Perhaps Concubine Fuyou was the same.

178
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,570
Hmm. Is that really it?

179
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,330
That's it.

180
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,080
Really?

181
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,080
<i>Please, stay calm.</i>

182
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,080
I'll get back to work.

183
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,340
<i>From that day on, Concubine Fuyou 
was forbidden from leaving her room.</i>

184
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,600
<i>Until the day of her bestowal, 
eunuchs were placed to watch her.</i>

185
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,820
I hope it works out.

186
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,510
Isn't Maomao behaving strangely lately?

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,740
Is she?

188
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,710
I can tell.

189
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,080
There must be something.

190
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,060
Concubine Fuyou is leaving today, right?

191
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,890
That is what I've heard.

192
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,900
Hey.

193
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:03,420
You can tell me the truth, you know.

194
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,780
I won't get upset, since I'm the one who asked.

195
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,510
This is all just speculation, 
so could you keep this between us?

196
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,470
My lips are sealed.

197
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,840
Do you remember the story of 
the courtesan I told you before?

198
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,240
The sleepwalker?

199
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,280
Yes.

200
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,660
There was actually another courtesan

201
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,780
whose purchase offer was 
called off for the same reason.

202
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,790
She later received another purchase offer,

203
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,080
but since she was ill, 
the price was cut in half.

204
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,180
However, it was all fraud.

205
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,840
Fraud?

206
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,760
The two men who made 
the purchase offers knew each other.

207
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,660
The woman pretended to be sick
 to call off the first offer.

208
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,610
Then, the real purchaser 
made a bid at half the first price.

209
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,640
If they wanted to be together,
 the man lacked the silver,

210
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,960
and the woman still had time left on her term.

211
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
So, you're saying Concubine Fuyou 
is the same as that courtesan?

212
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,030
Concubine Fuyou and the military officer

213
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,840
are childhood friends 
who grew up in the same homeland.

214
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Huh?

215
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,130
I heard the man showed his valor in 
a battle against barbarians the other day.

216
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,690
When asked what he wished as a reward,

217
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,000
he strongly insisted on
 receiving Concubine Fuyou.

218
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,920
He must have fantasized about it 
even before he left home.

219
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,390
As a military officer, he could never 
propose marriage to a princess.

220
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,460
But then, she was pulled
 into the rear palace...

221
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,400
And the princess also had feelings 
for her childhood friend.

222
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,900
So, that could be why she failed at her dance,

223
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,910
to avoid attracting 
the attention of the emperor.

224
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,130
And as intended, the emperor never 
touched her. Her body is still pure.

225
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,280
That said, it's entirely possible

226
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,570
that the emperor would show 
interest in Concubine Fuyou,

227
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,160
now that she's scheduled to be given away.

228
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,700
And so, she feigned somnambulism...

229
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,930
I can't say anything about 
the emperor. It's entirely possible.

230
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,480
The barbarian battle took
 place in the eastern region.

231
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,560
And Concubine Fuyou's 
nightly dance took place on...

232
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,060
The eastern gate?

233
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,050
She was probably wishing for his safe return.

234
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,400
Again, all speculation.

235
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,600
Hey, Maomao.

236
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,440
Yes?

237
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,220
Would it make me a terrible woman 
if I said I envy Concubine Fuyou?

238
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,080
<i>That night, Concubine Fuyou was beautiful.</i>

239
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,750
<i>She didn't seem at all like the nondescript 
princess I saw during the day.</i>

240
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,930
No, I wouldn't say that.

241
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,730
Let's go.

242
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,040
Yes.

243
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,730
If love makes a woman beautiful,

244
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,850
what kind of medicine would it make?

245
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,050
I have a request for the rumored apothecary.

246
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

247
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,740
<i>Next time: "The Threat."</i>

248
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 4: The Threat
