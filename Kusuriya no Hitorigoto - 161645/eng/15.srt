The Apothecary Diaries

3
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,530
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,730
Hey, did you hear about the fire the other day?

5
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,520
Lihaku did a really good job with it.

6
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,120
I never expected he'd be able to solve it.

7
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,580
Actually, I heard a rumor that 
a servant girl helped solve it.

8
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,030
A servant girl?

9
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,570
They say she's a personal 
attendant of Master Jinshi.

10
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,580
Wow, really?

11
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,400
Didn't Master Jinshi buy out

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,420
a courtesan from the Verdigris
 House the other day?

13
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,390
I hear she's a beautiful 
intellectual with cold eyes.

14
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,350
Yeah, the guys who saw her 
wouldn't shut up about her.

15
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,940
Master Lakan?!

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,310
Mind telling me more about that?

17
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,280
Episode 15: Raw Fish

18
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,840
Xiaomao, could you spare a moment?

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,250
Master Gaoshun. What is it?

20
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,330
There's something 
I'd like you to take a look at.

21
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,880
Records of an old incident.

22
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,240
Ten years ago, at a merchant's home,

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,880
there was a food poisoning incident 
involving a raw pufferfish dish.

24
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,280
Pufferfish poison...

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,990
I love how it tingles and stings.

26
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,850
Oh, I really want some now!

27
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,050
I can take you to a place 
that serves it sometime soon.

28
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,520
So, what about this?

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,280
A while ago, I was officially
 involved with this case.

30
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,710
A colleague asked me for advice, because
 a similar incident occurred recently.

31
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,890
A similar incident?

32
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,340
A bureaucrat ate pufferfish, raw and seasoned 
with vinegar, and fell into a coma.

33
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,330
A coma?

34
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,170
Master Gaoshun, my apologies.

35
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,350
Is it appropriate for me to learn about this?

36
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,520
That won't be an issue. 
You are someone who knows her place.

37
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,230
<i>In other words, stay silent about this.</i>

38
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,320
Besides, this story involves poison. 
Are you sure you want me to stop here?

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,400
Please, do continue.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,700
Pufferfish

41
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,300
In this instance, they served 
parboiled pufferfish skin and meat.

42
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,110
He ate this and fell into a coma.

43
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,420
The meat? Most of the poison is in the gut.

44
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,470
Yes, the skin and the meat.

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,490
The meat isn't supposed 
to have much poison in it...

46
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,480
Maybe it depends on the type of 
pufferfish or the environment it's from.

47
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,450
Nothing seems out of place, then?

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,840
The thing is, in both cases, 
this time and in the past,

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,200
the cook claims they hadn't 
used pufferfish in the dish.

50
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,070
That sounds interesting.

51
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,370
That's not the only thing in common.

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,340
The two who fell ill...

53
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,460
The bureaucrat from this case 
and the merchant from the past one

54
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,800
were both gourmets who loved eating rare foods.

55
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,100
They both often ate raw fish and
 pufferfish was one of their favorites.

56
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,450
After the incident, all of the organs 
and skin were discovered in the trash,

57
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,200
so it was determined that 
the guts were never consumed.

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,660
In both cases, the cooks claimed innocence, said
 the pufferfish was served the night before,

59
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,690
and that on the day of the incident,
 they'd used a different fish.

60
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,040
However, there were 
no witnesses to provide proof.

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,040
The bureaucrat ate all the food served,

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,130
then became intoxicated 
and collapsed half an hour later.

63
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,130
He was discovered convulsing.

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,160
<i>He did a more thorough 
investigation than I'd expect.</i>

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,180
<i>Plenty of other bureaucrats would put
 in zero effort and just make up a suspect.</i>

66
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,780
What do you think?

67
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,800
The symptoms do sound 
like pufferfish poison,

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,190
but I can't say for certain
 without more details.

69
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,900
Master Gaoshun, can you try 
to find more information?

70
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,970
Understood. I will look into it.

71
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,550
<i>At this time of year, it's not rare to 
have food trash sit out for a few days.</i>

72
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,080
<i>The testimony of using different fish 
matches the evidence of the leftovers...</i>

73
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,670
What were you talking about?

74
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,680
That look would wound anyone, even me.

75
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,080
You seemed to be listening 
very eagerly to Gaoshun's story.

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,320
People naturally pay attention to
 stories that are actually interesting.

77
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,430
Wait, hold on. You often
 cut me off mid-speech—

78
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,450
Oh dear, it's getting late. 
With that, I'll take my leave.

79
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,800
Hey, I'm not done talking—

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,780
Oh no, don't move.

81
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,290
Come on, stay still.

82
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,380
Xiaomao, about the discussion 
we had yesterday...

83
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,160
These are the cook's notes.

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,910
According to the servant, it describes 
everything served to their master.

85
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,180
Thank you.

86
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,540
"Parboil the fish. Add cut vegetables. 
Season with vinegar."

87
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,560
The recipe looks normal.

88
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,960
There are several types of 
vinegar mixtures outlined,

89
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,410
but the list of ingredients lack detail.

90
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,500
That must be because the types of fish 
and vegetables available differ by season.

91
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,520
This won't help us understand the key facts 
around what was actually used to cook the dish.

92
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,260
You can't understand?

93
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,570
<i>He wants to join in.</i>

94
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,470
So, what can't you understand?

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,220
It will be mealtime soon.

96
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,930
I know.

97
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,770
<i>That's quite childish.</i>

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,680
When did the incident occur?

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,580
About a week ago.

100
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,360
Meaning winter vegetables, 
so probably radishes and carrots?

101
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,910
Actually, I hear they used seaweed.

102
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,910
Seaweed?

103
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,580
Seaweed.

104
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,930
<i>If he likes rare foods, I guess 
he could have tried strange seaweeds.</i>

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,840
If possible, could I take a look
 at the kitchen involved?

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,740
I'm here under Master Gaoshun's orders.

107
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,010
I'm Basen. I've heard about you.

108
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,440
I am Maomao.

109
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,580
We're heading to the mansion now, 
but remember, you're my follower.

110
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,930
Don't do anything without my permission.

111
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,260
Understood.

112
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,120
Once we arrive, the servant there 
will show us to the kitchen.

113
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,220
Understood.

114
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,840
<i>Master Gaoshun sure does work fast.</i>

115
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,470
<i>That aside...</i>

116
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,130
<i>I've never seen this officer before.</i>

117
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,640
<i>He looks familiar, though.</i>

118
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,900
<i>He doesn't seem to have 
a good impression of me.</i>

119
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,210
<i>Oh, well.</i>

120
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,570
This is the kitchen.

121
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,450
It hasn't been used since the poison incident.

122
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,960
Hmm? Hey!

123
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,800
Who let you in here?! Get out!

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,050
What are you doing?! 
Did you bring these people here?!

125
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,680
I've gotten permission from the mistress, 
and this is official business.

126
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,020
Is that true?

127
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,190
May we continue? Or would that 
inconvenience you in some way?

128
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,340
Whatever.

129
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,150
Who is that?

130
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,240
That is the master's younger brother.

131
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,250
After the master fell into the coma, 
and the mistress took ill from fatigue,

132
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,840
the younger brother manages the mansion.

133
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,590
I see.

134
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,510
Master Basen.

135
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,170
Yeah.

136
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,140
<i>The cook washed all the cooking utensils.</i>

137
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,380
<i>Other than that...</i>

138
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,200
What is this?

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,610
Ah, the master loved that.

140
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,780
It's his favorite. He ate it often.

141
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,970
I don't think it's poisonous...

142
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,460
<i>He doesn't seem to be lying.</i>

143
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,250
So that's that.

144
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,620
If you're done here, please leave.

145
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,760
Indeed.

146
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,090
Sorry to bother you.

147
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,880
Why did you back down so easily?

148
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,140
I don't consider that backing down.

149
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,900
You brought it with you?

150
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,960
This is strange.

151
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,600
This seaweed isn't in season quite yet.

152
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,930
But even if salted and preserved from
 last year, it wouldn't last this long.

153
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,620
I see.

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,530
I don't think it was gathered in our region.

155
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,250
Perhaps it was imported from the south.

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,500
It would be good if we could 
find out where it came from.

157
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,730
<i>I think he gets what I mean.</i>

158
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,570
<i>In that case, I'll do what I have to do.</i>

159
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,230
What's this?

160
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,130
The seaweed I got from the mansion.

161
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,870
I've split it into two 
and put it in some water.

162
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,540
<i>Why is Master Jinshi here?</i>

163
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,160
The seaweed was indeed 
imported from the south.

164
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,010
According to the servant, the master 
never ate that seaweed in the winter.

165
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,960
The cook also said this is the same 
as the seaweed they normally use,

166
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,510
and can't be poisonous.

167
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,140
You can't assume it's not poisonous
 just because it's the same seaweed.

168
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,270
Maybe this seaweed 
isn't eaten often in the south.

169
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,710
Perhaps a merchant learned that 
it's a favorite of this bureaucrat,

170
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,770
and, looking to profit from that,

171
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:48,530
went out of his way to get some locals 
to make a salted version of it?

172
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,160
Why is that a problem?

173
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,920
Sometimes, poisons can become not poisonous.

174
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,220
For example, eels are originally poisonous,

175
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,170
but by bleeding them out or cooking 
them, they become edible.

176
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,890
In the case of this seaweed, I think 
it had to be soaked in limewater first.

177
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:16,010
What I have here is one batch soaked in 
limewater, and one batch without that.

178
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,280
What are you doing?!

179
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,880
It's fine.

180
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,480
Probably.

181
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,310
What do you mean, "probably"?!

182
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,240
Don't worry. I have 
an emetic agent right here—

183
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,440
Don't say that so proudly!

184
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
Gaoshun!

185
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,160
Yes.

186
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,790
Hey—

187
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,830
Vomit, now!

188
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,130
<i>I wanted to test if the detoxification 
could be done overnight...</i>

189
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,050
Um, back on topic.

190
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:54,560
So, the issue is: who suggested that
 the trader bring the salted seaweed?

191
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,470
If the one who ate it imported it himself,

192
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,020
it'd be his own fault, in a sense.

193
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,840
But, if he <i>didn't</i>...

194
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,240
Bringing it in from a region
 that doesn't eat it

195
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,740
is obviously taking a pretty big risk.

196
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,580
I understand.

197
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,140
<i>The people here are smart. 
I don't have to elaborate further.</i>

198
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,090
<i>I guess that settles it for now.</i>

199
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,620
Hey!

200
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,640
The culprit was the official's younger brother.

201
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,670
When we found where he bought the seaweed,

202
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,940
he confessed to being
 the one who'd purchased it.

203
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,420
His motive was that, being 
the younger son, he wasn't treated well.

204
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,670
He wanted to remove his older 
brother from the picture.

205
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,950
A commonplace story.

206
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,500
But how could a person who'd plot to murder 
someone for such a thoughtless reason

207
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,290
have learned about the seaweed poison?

208
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,750
He happened to hear about it from a person 
sitting next to him at a tavern, apparently.

209
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,920
"Happened to," huh? Sure...

210
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,150
In the end, I didn't get to try
the poisonous seaweed...

211
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,520
<i>By the way, what should I use </i>it<i> for?</i>

212
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,900
<i>That mushroom the color of dry leaves
 growing from the dead insect!</i>

213
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,610
<i>Should I make medicinal booze?! A pill?!</i>

214
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,830
Welcome home!

215
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,370
Welcome home!

216
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,920
What's going on?!

217
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,030
It's not my fault.

218
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,420
You seem tired.

219
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,850
I have so much work piled up,

220
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,140
but there's someone 
I just don't get along with.

221
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,940
We just can't see eye-to-eye.

222
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,590
I never would have thought you'd
 ever have trouble with people.

223
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,030
This man's a razor-sharp 
high official in the military.

224
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,500
He comes from a good family, but even 
though he's past forty, he hasn't married.

225
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,360
He adopted his nephew as his son 
and has him handle his household.

226
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,660
A famous weirdo.

227
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,500
<i>A forty-plus, high-ranking
 military officer... and weirdo?</i>

228
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,850
His only interests are go, shogi, and rumors.

229
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,200
He files complaints, barges in,

230
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,250
and keeps extending deadlines 
on decisions that need to be made.

231
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,890
I think he has it out for me for some reason.

232
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,530
He's been camping in my office 
for several days in a row.

233
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,900
<i>Okay, let's forget about this!</i>

234
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,240
<i>No good can come from dwelling on this.</i>

235
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,330
<i>However, no matter how hard I try to forget,</i>

236
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,080
<i>as usual, my bad hunches are correct.</i>

237
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,960
This matter was settled already.

238
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,540
Flower viewing in the winter is difficult.

239
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,170
I thought this would be better instead.

240
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,540
<i>This man is Lakan. He is a strategist.</i>

241
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,680
<i>It seems like the reason 
he's confronting me</i>

242
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,300
<i>is because I made Maomao, who is connected 
to the Verdigris House, my servant.</i>

243
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,980
Come to think of it, I have an old 
acquaintance in the Verdigris House.

244
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,230
<i>That's unexpected. I thought
 he had no interest in romance.</i>

245
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,490
What kind of courtesan is she?

246
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,780
<i>Shoot, I asked without thinking.</i>

247
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,690
She was a good courtesan.

248
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,450
She was very good at go and shogi. 
I could beat her in shogi, but never in go.

249
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,480
Defeating our master strategist? 
She must have been good.

250
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
I considered buying her out,

251
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,550
since I felt I would never meet 
another woman as interesting as her.

252
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,060
But sometimes, things just don't work out.

253
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,560
Two rich men with curious tastes 
endlessly tried to outbid each other.

254
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,560
Is that so?

255
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,380
<i>It's said, at times, 
buying out a courtesan</i>

256
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,180
<i>could cost about as much as a small palace.</i>

257
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,120
She was a strange courtesan.

258
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,580
<i>Where is he trying to go with this story?</i>

259
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,560
She would sell her skills, but never herself.

260
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,920
In fact, she didn't treat 
guests as customers at all.

261
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,090
Even when pouring tea, 
she had an arrogant look,

262
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,470
like she was being charitable 
to a lowly peasant.

263
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,350
But there were many with curious tastes 
who were head over heels for her.

264
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,270
Myself among them, naturally.

265
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,330
That chill down my spine 
was truly irresistible.

266
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,990
Oh, how I wanted to try 
to force myself on her one day.

267
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
In the end, I couldn't give up on her,

268
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,410
so I had no choice but
 to use a bit of a dirty trick.

269
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,420
Meaning?

270
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,780
If something's too expensive,
 you simply lower its value.

271
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,290
I made her less exquisite.

272
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,140
Do you know how I did that?

273
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,580
Why play hard-to-get all of a sudden?

274
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,780
Well, before I get into that, 
I have a favor to ask.

275
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,640
What is it?

276
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,740
I heard that the servant girl you hired
 recently is quite intriguing.

277
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,380
They say she has a strange 
knack for solving puzzles.

278
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,160
I was acquainted with a metalworker 
who was the palace purveyor.

279
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
He suddenly passed away a few days ago,

280
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,890
and failed to name a proper successor.

281
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,520
He had three children who 
were also his apprentices.

282
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,040
Unfortunately, he died before passing on 
his secret techniques to his children.

283
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,470
He left a puzzling will, which might be a hint.

284
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,150
That's been bothering me for a while.

285
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,700
Where are you going with this?

286
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,080
Nowhere special, really.

287
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,290
I just wonder if there's some way
 to learn that secret technique.

288
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,040
Perhaps, for example,

289
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,010
by having your clever servant girl take a look.

290
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,960
Well... I suppose I could hear the whole story.

291
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,440
That's a lot of rain.

292
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

293
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,380
<i>Next time: "Lead."</i>

294
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 16: Lead
