The Apothecary Diaries

Jade Pavilion
Maomao

4
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,190
What should I do...

5
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,500
What should we do?

6
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,030
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

7
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,160
<i>After Fengming's execution,</i>

8
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,360
<i>her family's assets were confiscated,</i>

9
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,850
<i>and all underwent varying degrees
 of corporal punishment.</i>

10
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,410
<i>Fengming was determined to 
be the sole perpetrator,</i>

11
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,470
<i>so fortunately, her mistress 
Concubine Ah-Duo was not blamed.</i>

12
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,980
<i>And now, here is the list of Fengming's family 
members and those connected to them.</i>

13
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,710
The list includes those 
who did business with them.

14
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,690
They had many businesses 
in addition to apiculture.

15
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,610
There are about eighty children of those 
families here in the rear palace.

16
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,310
Eighty out of two thousand, huh?

17
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,030
That's quite a hit ratio.

18
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,800
Jade Pavilion
Maomao

19
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,370
<i>The family that the apothecary was kidnapped 
and sold off to was one such family.</i>

20
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,590
If you wish, we could conceal this.

21
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,820
<i>If "I" wish...</i>

22
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,010
Indeed.

23
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,250
<i>It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong.</i>

24
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>If I say so, it will be done.</i>

25
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,560
<i>Given how she likes to separate 
the commoners from the nobles,</i>

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,390
<i>she'd obey any order, no matter 
how much she disagrees.</i>

27
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,520
<i>It would be simple to give the order.</i>

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,440
<i>I should just simply give the order.</i>

29
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,870
<i>Conceal the facts, and keep 
her at the rear palace.</i>

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,990
<i>But if that goes against her will...</i>

31
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,490
<i>How would she feel, if she learned she'd been 
forced to stay in a place she disliked so?</i>

32
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,300
<i>I'm so afraid of the rift between
 the two of us widening any further.</i>

33
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,100
Master Jinshi.

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,230
I thought she was just a convenient pawn.

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,860
Mass layoffs?

36
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,260
Yep.

37
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,860
Episode 12: The Eunuch and the Courtesan

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,610
The daughters of anyone who did business
 with that family are being let go.

39
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,920
And it seems like there's quite a few of them.

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,330
Huh...

41
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,580
There are girls around who have to quit 
all of a sudden and are in a real bind.

42
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,380
I guess that family really 
did a lot of business.

43
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,670
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,120
<i>Getting fired now would be bad.</i>

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,490
<i>It's just bad timing.</i>

46
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,820
<i>After Lihaku, I haven't been able to send 
any more paying customers to the old lady.</i>

47
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,180
<i>If I go back now...</i>

48
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,860
I'm home.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,560
You have a customer!

50
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,560
<i>She'll sell me off for sure!</i>

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,860
Maomao?!

52
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:32,620
<i>Last I checked, the family on my 
paperwork were merchants.</i>

53
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,970
<i>If Fengming's family ran an apiary,</i>

54
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,680
<i>there might be some sort of connection...</i>

55
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,350
Master Jinshi!

56
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,240
That's rare. You're out of breath.

57
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,820
Uh...

58
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,280
Calm down. You're red all over.

59
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,780
I would like to talk to you!

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,540
Sure. Let's speak inside.

61
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,790
This is about the mass layoffs, I take it?

62
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,810
Yes. What's going to happen to me?

63
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,980
Here's the list.

64
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,510
Jade
Pavilion
Maomao

65
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,010
So, I'm being let go.

66
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,720
What do you want to do?

67
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,230
I thought she was just a convenient pawn.

68
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,410
<i>As Lady Gyokuyou's lady-in-waiting,</i>

69
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,840
<i>I can test for poisons and 
hang out in the medical office.</i>

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>I have to admit I'm enjoying my current life.</i>

71
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,490
<i>But I'm just a servant, after all.</i>

72
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,330
<i>I'm in no position to request to stay.</i>

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,640
<i>I have to make sure 
I don't appear like I'm begging.</i>

74
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,510
<i>I am a mere servant.</i>

75
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,520
<i>I'll do as you order, whether it be 
manual labor, cooking, or tasting.</i>

76
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,890
<i>As I order...</i>

77
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,660
<i>Yes. I'll do my best, if ordered to do so.</i>

78
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,360
<i>If I take a pay cut, so be it.</i>

79
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,650
<i>As long as I can buy time before getting 
sold off, I'll figure something out.</i>

80
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,450
<i>So please, don't fire me!</i>

81
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,540
Understood.

82
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,960
Do you mean...

83
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,420
I'll make sure you're compensated.

84
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,490
Huh?

85
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,720
<i>Negotiation failed. Maomao is let go.</i>

86
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,340
There we go.

87
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,420
How long are you going to stay like that?

88
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,670
Perhaps you should have
 ordered her to stay.

89
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,860
Not another word.

90
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,320
<i>A week after being fired,</i>

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,380
<i>Xiaomao went home to the pleasure district.</i>

92
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,120
<i>I heard she politely went around</i>

93
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,140
<i>saying her farewells to every single 
place she had business with.</i>

94
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,250
You're going to regret this.

95
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:15,890
<i>Finding a new toy to replace his favorite 
one has always been a challenge.</i>

96
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,890
No! I want that one!

97
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,640
<i>Or perhaps...</i>

98
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,150
<i>That girl should not be treated 
as the same as a toy.</i>

99
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,770
<i>He only let her go because 
he didn't want to treat her as a tool.</i>

100
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,860
<i>What a troublesome master he is.</i>

101
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,280
<i>If finding a replacement won't do...</i>

102
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,370
<i>Perhaps I can speak to that military officer.</i>

103
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,040
Wah, wah, boo-hoo, sob, sob...

104
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,550
You do look much better without your freckles.

105
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,460
You can use my lipstick.

106
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,260
I never thought I'd be going 
to a party with Maomao.

107
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,310
<i>My workplace tonight is a noble's 
party outside the brothel.</i>

108
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,830
<i>Calling a courtesan to one's 
own mansion costs quite a sum.</i>

109
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,770
<i>In addition...</i>

110
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,620
<i>A night of drinks with one of
 the Verdigris House's Princesses</i>

111
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,280
<i>costs what most make in a year.</i>

112
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,780
<i>So to call on all three at once...</i>

113
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,290
<i>I guess there's no limit to 
how rich a rich person can be.</i>

114
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm going with you, but just 
so you look better by comparison.

115
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,920
Here you go, Maomao.

116
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,440
<i>Because I was paid more than 
expected when leaving the rear palace,</i>

117
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,950
<i>I was able to avoid getting 
sold off immediately.</i>

118
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,130
That's an important job, too.

119
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,040
Looking forward to it, Maomao.

120
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,810
Oh! So cute.

121
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,390
It's time! Hurry up! Hmm?

122
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,220
Well, well, that's not bad at all.

123
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,860
You could take on customers
 of your own too, you know.

124
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,990
<i>The old lady really wants me 
to become a courtesan.</i>

125
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,700
Go make a fortune!

126
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,380
<i>I can't recite poetry or play the erhu.</i>

127
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,710
<i>Dancing is out of the question.</i>

128
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,730
<i>I'm just an apothecary's daughter, 
with no interest outside of medicine.</i>

129
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,220
<i>So why is she so insistent, 
especially these past few years?</i>

130
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,490
<i>This person sure is loaded.</i>

131
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,280
<i>Every piece of furniture is 
unimaginably expensive.</i>

132
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,250
<i>I'm sure they wouldn't notice
 one thing taken as a souvenir...</i>

133
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,080
<i>No! Knock it off.</i>

134
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,580
This room, please.

135
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,600
<i>I heard Master Lihaku introduced us 
to these high-ranking palace officials.</i>

136
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,430
<i>They're younger than I expected.</i>

137
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,940
Yum.

138
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,780
Come, let's go.

139
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,420
<i>If he knows so many rich people, he should 
have introduced them to me sooner.</i>

140
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,470
<i>With his connections, I could 
have lessened my loan amount.</i>

141
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,740
Anyway, off to work.

142
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,970
<i>Work is work, but staying 
all smiles is quite an ordeal.</i>

143
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,730
<i>Hmm? Is he bored?</i>

144
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,990
Excuse me.

145
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,630
Leave me alone.

146
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,820
I want to be alone.

147
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,570
<i>Huh? Where have I heard this voice before?</i>

148
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,240
Master Jinshi?

149
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,730
Why avoid me?

150
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,880
Please don't touch the courtesans.

151
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,840
Do people tell you that makeup
 changes you considerably?

152
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,620
I do get that a lot.

153
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,890
Besides, why are you dressed like that?

154
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm working part-time.

155
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,020
As a courtesan?

156
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,890
Yes.

157
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,810
Does that mean you're...

158
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>This guy is really prone to 
casting doubt on my chastity.</i>

159
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,400
I don't take personal customers.

160
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,940
Yet.

161
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,760
"Yet..."

162
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,270
So, what if I bought you out?

163
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,850
Huh? What kind of joke isâ€”

164
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,240
That might be a good idea.

165
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,620
Working in the rear palace again 
wouldn't be too bad.

166
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,880
I thought you quit 
because you hated it there.

167
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,030
Huh? When did I ever say that?

168
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,630
I tried convincing you to let me stay, 
but you fired me anyway.

169
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,390
True, there was a lot of trouble.

170
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,800
But where else would I be able 
to perform as a taster?

171
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,400
The only thing I missed 
were my poison experiments.

172
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,780
You should really stop 
experimenting with poison.

173
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,620
<i>He's even more childish today than before.</i>

174
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,730
That's right. That's the kind 
of person you are.

175
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,790
What does that mean?

176
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,670
Do people ever say that you
 don't express yourself clearly?

177
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,000
I do get that a lot.

178
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,130
So why flinch?

179
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,540
Rules are rules.

180
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,110
Can't you bend them a bit?

181
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,910
No.

182
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,410
It's not the end of the world.

183
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,680
It's ending my spirit.

184
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,640
Just one hand. Just the tip of my fingers.

185
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,640
<i>That's right, this guy 
can be really persistent.</i>

186
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,440
Fine, just the fingers.

187
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,220
<i>This guy!</i>

188
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,030
<i>The color sticks!</i>

189
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,760
Goodness, what's this?

190
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,730
Oh, Maomao.

191
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,880
I can't watch.

192
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,770
Come on, big sisters!

193
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,550
Master Gaoshun?! What? Huh?!

194
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,840
<i>I couldn't make sense of any of it.</i>

195
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,550
<i>I don't remember much of 
what happened after that.</i>

196
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,800
So, who was that?

197
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,130
How do you know him?

198
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,890
Not bad, you!

199
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,900
<i>I do remember that it was really hard 
answering all my big sisters' questions.</i>

200
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,160
Verdigris House

201
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,650
And...

202
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,890
I should make some, just in case.

203
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,660
Wandering around without 
my freckles leads to no good.

204
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,910
That was winter last year...

205
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,140
Getting kidnapped was enough of a surprise,

206
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,790
but to be sold off 
to the rear palace, of all places...

207
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,760
Then to get promoted to a lady-in-waiting.

208
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,790
I wanted to lay low until 
my term was over, but...

209
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,320
Maomao. Is it ready?

210
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,860
Yeah, here.

211
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,360
I need you to take a look at
 someone. Can you come with me?

212
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,440
Got it.

213
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,540
<i>The rear palace, huh?</i>

214
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,750
<i>I really wanted to avoid 
that place at all costs.</i>

215
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,510
I wonder if everyone's okay.

216
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,020
Oh, I'll get out.

217
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,470
Take your time. You don't get to 
come here all the time.

218
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,150
Yeah.

219
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,030
What are you going to do from now on?

220
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,920
I'll pay back my loans, I promise.

221
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,640
That's a given!

222
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,100
Are you going back to the rear palace?

223
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,140
I don't know.

224
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,680
But... the rear palace and 
the brothels are pretty similar.

225
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,380
Hmm.

226
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,830
Having trouble sleeping?

227
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,650
I'm going to go get some air.

228
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,300
Take care.

229
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,030
I will.

230
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,680
The rear palace and 
the brothels are no different.

231
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,450
A garden, and a cage.

232
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,690
What's going to happen from now on?

233
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,370
It's freezing.

234
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,710
Verdigris House

235
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,460
<i>A few days later, a beautiful noble 
comes to the pleasure district.</i>

236
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,510
<i>With him, he brings enough cash 
to make the old lady's eyes glisten,</i>

237
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,260
<i>and for some reason...</i>

238
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,140
<i>A strange herb growing from an insect...</i>

239
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,260
<i>And in exchange, he asks for a certain girl.</i>

240
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,990
The Apothecary Diaries

241
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:50,010
Next Time

242
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,340
<i>Next time: "Serving in
 the Outer Court."</i>

243
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,010
