ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,990
THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,450
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,090
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

6
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,970
<i>She cries and cries</i>

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,140
<i>Wondering</i>

8
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,350
<i>Where that child is</i>

9
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,810
MINISTER - SCHOLAR

10
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,860
Will you play with me, sir?

11
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,450
How could I say no?

12
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,710
It's my beloved daughter's request.

13
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,460
We'll play by the standard rules
for five matches.

14
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,130
Whoever wins three matches first wins.

15
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,300
What should my disadvantage be?

16
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,130
Which piece should I get rid of?

17
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,890
There's no need for that.

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,510
<i>She should just accept.</i>

19
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,980
Let's decide what to bet on.

20
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,890
Wow, getting straight to the point!

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,520
If I win, you'll become my child, right?

22
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,820
-You promised not to say anything.
-Yes, but…

23
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,370
That is fine. But I'm
under an employment contract.

24
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,120
So it'll be after my time is up.

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,290
An employment contract?
He really hired you?

26
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,670
Yes.

27
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,840
But in return, if I win…

28
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,350
Will you buy out a courtesan
from the Verdigris House?

29
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,560
I didn't expect you to say that.

30
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,690
I won't say who,

31
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,230
but Grams is looking for a way
to get rid of a certain courtesan.

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,280
I see, that's how you'll play.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,410
If that's what you want,
I'll have to say yes.

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,530
That's all you want?

35
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,870
I'll add two more rules, then.

36
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>It smells like a strong distilled liquor.</i>

37
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,260
<i>I have a really bad feeling about this.</i>

38
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,220
And what is that?

39
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,810
A little bit of this is medicine.

40
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,770
Three mouthfuls, and it's a strong poison.

41
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,110
I'll pour this liquid into three cups,

42
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,570
and mix it up so you don't know which cup.

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,820
After each match,
the winner chooses a cup,

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,620
and the loser drinks it.

45
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,450
That's the first rule.

46
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,160
<i>Her ideas are so frightening.</i>

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,420
And the second rule is,
no matter what the reason is,

48
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,340
if you forfeit the match, you lose.

49
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
Is that all right?

50
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
Yes, that's fine.

51
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,060
<i>Is she trying to throw him off balance?</i>

52
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,060
<i>True, a normal person might</i>
<i>flinch at that. However,</i>

53
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,270
<i>her opponent is a Sir General known</i>
<i>for being eccentric.</i>

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,570
<i>I can't imagine him getting agitated</i>
<i>by such a threat.</i>

55
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,860
<i>What is she thinking?</i>

56
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,620
<i>She lost again.</i>

57
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,120
<i>That's her second loss in a row!</i>

58
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,290
<i>She challenged a general known for</i>
<i>being a chess master</i>

59
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,880
<i>so I thought she had some skill, but…</i>

60
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,760
<i>It seems she only knows the rules</i>

61
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,630
<i>and has no experience in playing matches.</i>

62
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,470
<i>She already drank two cups.</i>

63
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,100
<i>She seemed to enjoy drinking them,</i>
<i>so I can't tell if it's poisoned or not.</i>

64
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,400
May I start the third match?

65
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,480
Sure, of course.

66
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,490
<i>What is she thinking?</i>

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,150
<i>We all know how the third match will end.</i>

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,490
<i>If the two cups she already drank</i>
<i>had poison inside,</i>

69
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,660
<i>it's too dangerous to drink the third cup.</i>

70
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,460
<i>How much of this current situation</i>
<i>has Lakan analyzed?</i>

71
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,290
Checkmate.

72
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,630
You got me.

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,550
I know you let me win,
but it's still a win.

74
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,770
I can't make my daughter take poison,
even by accident.

75
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,560
Which will you choose for me?

76
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,270
Choose whatever you'd like.

77
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,110
Does the medicine have any taste?

78
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,280
You'd notice the bad taste right away
after one swallow.

79
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,370
<i>Lakan is allowed to lose twice.</i>

80
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,910
<i>If one cup of the two tastes different,</i>

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,540
<i>he'll know that his daughter won't</i>
<i>take any poison.</i>

82
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,620
<i>He lost deliberately for that purpose.</i>

83
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,040
<i>He really is a shrewd man.</i>

84
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,290
I'll choose this, then.

85
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,060
It tastes bad.

86
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,440
<i>He drank the poison!</i>

87
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,690
<i>Now, the Apothecary won't drink the poison</i>
<i>for her third cup.</i>

88
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,070
<i>This also means</i>

89
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,450
<i>that Lakan won't have to keep losing</i>
<i>on purpose anymore.</i>

90
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,450
<i>Now, the Apothecary can never win.</i>

91
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,290
If I win, you'll become my child, right?

92
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,290
Also, I feel hot.

93
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,810
What's going on?

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,770
I thought the poison wouldn't harm anyone
with one cup!

95
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,520
I know you hate him.

96
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,360
-But I didn't think you'd poison him!
-It's medicine.

97
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,070
They say sake is the best medicine,
after all.

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,910
Sake? What do you mean?

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,870
Sir Jinshi.

100
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,040
-It looks like he's just drunk.
-What?

101
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,380
He's an extreme lightweight.

102
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,460
Now that I think about it,

103
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
<i>he's always drinking juice.</i>
<i>I've never seen him drink sake.</i>

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
So what was the liquid you poured in?

105
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,850
It was alcohol. All right, then.

106
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,480
Let's carry this man out,

107
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,070
and have him pick out a flower
from the brothel.

108
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,490
<i>Ever since I was born, I couldn't</i>
<i>distinguish people as individuals.</i>

109
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,950
<i>It wasn't just confusing my wet nurse</i>
<i>as my mother.</i>

110
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,870
<i>I couldn't even distinguish between a man</i>
<i>and a woman.</i>

111
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,670
<i>My father got fed up with me,</i>
<i>saying that I would be useless,</i>

112
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,300
<i>and started visiting</i>
<i>his extramarital lover regularly.</i>

113
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,220
<i>My mother was desperate to</i>
<i>get my father back.</i>

114
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,970
<i>That was how I was able to</i>
<i>immerse myself in go and chess,</i>

115
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,440
<i>and live freely,</i>
<i>despite being the first son</i>

116
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,270
<i>of a noble family.</i>

117
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,400
<i>Don't remember people by their face.</i>

118
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,190
<i>Remember them by their voice,</i>

119
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,650
<i>gestures, and body type.</i>

120
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,410
<i>I'm sure you would enjoy chess.</i>

121
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,910
<i>Only my uncle understood me.</i>

122
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,370
<i>Thanks to my tactless yet talented uncle,</i>

123
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,920
<i>I was able to see people's faces</i>
<i>as chess pieces.</i>

124
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,670
<i>When I saw my uncle's face as a Chariot,</i>

125
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,760
<i>I truly understood that he was</i>
<i>a talented and intelligent man.</i>

126
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,430
<i>After I grew up, even though I was</i>
<i>untalented in the art of war,</i>

127
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,060
<i>I was appointed to be a leader right away</i>
<i>because of my background.</i>

128
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,690
<i>Even if I was weak,</i>

129
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,940
<i>I could be successful</i>
<i>if I could use my men efficiently.</i>

130
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,610
<i>Playing chess with real people</i>
<i>as its pieces</i>

131
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,280
<i>was merely a captivating game to me.</i>

132
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,410
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE

133
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,530
<i>While I continued to be unbeatable</i>
<i>in work and in chess,</i>

134
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,120
<i>I ended up playing against a famous</i>
<i>courtesan when I visited a brothel.</i>

135
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,290
<i>Amongst the sea of whites and blacks,</i>

136
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,800
<i>those fingertips had a vibrant glow.</i>

137
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,050
<i>Her name was Fengxian.</i>

138
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,100
<i>An unbeatable courtesan at a brothel,</i>
<i>versus an unbeatable military man.</i>

139
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,060
<i>No matter who lost,</i>
<i>the audience would be captivated.</i>

140
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,900
<i>She is good for sure.</i>

141
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,440
<i>Even so, she is merely a frog in a well.</i>

142
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,860
<i>I lost?</i>

143
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,490
<i>She dominated me completely.</i>

144
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,280
<i>When was the last time I lost like this?</i>

145
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,960
<i>So this is what a human face looks like.</i>

146
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,720
<i>Her eyes are like a balsam fruit,</i>
<i>which could pop</i>

147
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,520
<i>with a single touch,</i>
<i>keeping people at a distance…</i>

148
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,570
<i>I won't lose next time.</i>

149
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,200
<i>For several years after that,</i>
<i>I only met her to play</i>

150
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,330
<i>go and chess.</i>

151
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,710
<i>Fengxian, who was born at the brothel,</i>

152
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,590
<i>had a personality only shaped by pride.</i>

153
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
I do not have a mother.

154
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,590
There was a woman who gave birth to me,

155
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,510
but in the pleasure district,
courtesans cannot be mothers.

156
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,730
<i>Talented courtesans,</i>

157
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,690
<i>once they become popular enough,</i>
<i>become harder to purchase.</i>

158
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,940
<i>This was also true of Fengxian.</i>

159
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,450
<i>Though her stern attitude was not</i>
<i>popular amongst most customers,</i>

160
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,450
<i>there were some with strange tastes</i>
<i>who enjoyed that.</i>

161
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,700
<i>Her price kept increasing more and more,</i>

162
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,830
<i>and I could only afford</i>
<i>to see her once every three months.</i>

163
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,300
A balsam flower and… What is that?

164
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,760
<i>Wood sorrel.</i>

165
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,930
<i>Also known as Cat's Feet.</i>

166
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,430
<i>It's a fresh medicine that works against</i>
<i>poison and insect bites.</i>

167
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,730
<i>Just like the balsam flower,</i>

168
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,360
<i>if you touch its ripened fruit,</i>
<i>the seeds burst and fly away.</i>

169
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,900
I see, how interesting.

170
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,070
When can you come next?

171
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,540
In three months' time.

172
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,370
I see.

173
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,380
<i>It was around that time that I heard</i>
<i>of Fengxian being bought out.</i>

174
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,470
<i>Her price kept increasing more and more</i>
<i>in the bidding war amongst her fans.</i>

175
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,220
<i>Though I had climbed the ranks</i>
<i>as a military man,</i>

176
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,060
<i>my step brothers had taken the right</i>
<i>to inherit the family title.</i>

177
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,770
<i>I could never compete with those prices.</i>

178
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,280
What if we bet on something today?

179
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,360
If you win, I'll give you
anything you'd like.

180
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,410
If I win, I'll take anything I want.

181
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,160
Which board would you like to play with?

182
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,250
<i>That's when a terrible idea</i>
<i>crossed my mind.</i>

183
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,260
-You'd like to play go, then?
-Yes.

184
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,760
-Meimei. I want to focus on the match.
-Yes, ma'am.

185
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,760
<i>Before we realized it,</i>
<i>our hands were placed together.</i>

186
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,390
<i>Fengxian spoke no sweet words.</i>

187
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,650
<i>I spoke none, either.</i>

188
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,070
<i>In many ways, we were very similar.</i>

189
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,820
I want to play go.

190
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,070
<i>I had thought I wanted to play chess too.</i>

191
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,580
<i>Kitty cat</i>

192
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,620
<i>Kitty cat</i>

193
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,090
<i>She cries and cries wondering</i>

194
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,760
<i>Where that child is</i>

195
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,340
<i>The little birds</i>

196
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,390
<i>That know nothing</i>

197
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,060
<i>Flew higher and higher</i>

198
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,400
<i>Up in the sky…</i>

199
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,150
<i>Three months after that,</i>
<i>my talented uncle lost his position.</i>

200
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,990
You became a doctor in the rear palace,
and now you're expelled?

201
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,530
You disgrace the family name!

202
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
<i>He was talented, but remained tactless.</i>

203
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,580
You were close with him.

204
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,380
Leave this house and study abroad
for a while!

205
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,090
-Study abroad?
-It's a needed precaution.

206
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,300
-But…
-What is it?

207
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,050
No, it's nothing.

208
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,560
<i>I could not betray my father,</i>
<i>who was both my parent and a boss.</i>

209
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,810
<i>It was then that Fengxian wrote to me</i>
<i>saying she would not be bought out.</i>

210
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,690
<i>I had falsely assumed that I could return</i>

211
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,700
<i>in six months' time.</i>

212
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,360
<i>Back then…</i>

213
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,790
<i>I had not imagined that</i>

214
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,960
<i>it would take me three years</i>
<i>to return home.</i>

215
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,260
All these are letters from Fengxian?

216
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,610
Dirt? No, are these branches?

217
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,820
And there's two of them?

218
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,120
No! This is…

219
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,580
<i>Finger slicing…</i>

220
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,870
<i>I had heard that</i>
<i>the practice was popular as a curse.</i>

221
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,080
<i>The reason she ended up</i>
<i>not being bought out…</i>

222
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,380
<i>The other small finger</i>
<i>that was inside that bag…</i>

223
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,550
<i>How could I not realize?</i>

224
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
<i>I only had go and chess in mind.</i>

225
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,890
<i>I couldn't even arrive</i>
<i>at such a simple answer!</i>

226
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,890
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE

227
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,770
Where is Fengxian?!

228
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,570
You! Fengxian is not here anymore!

229
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,530
Why are you here after all these years!

230
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,780
You left her for three years!

231
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,160
I bet you don't even care about
what happens

232
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,330
when a courtesan loses her value!

233
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,040
<i>If I had thought for a little bit,</i>
<i>I would've realized it.</i>

234
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,340
<i>Why her buying out offer was rescinded.</i>

235
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,710
<i>Inside Fengxian's belly was…</i>

236
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,220
<i>What happens to a courtesan</i>

237
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,720
<i>when she dishonors her brothel and her</i>
<i>trust and value plummets to the ground?</i>

238
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,520
<i>Like a nighthawk,</i>
<i>she receives any customer,</i>

239
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,020
<i>and eventually…</i>

240
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,570
<i>No matter how much I lament,</i>
<i>time won't turn back.</i>

241
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,530
<i>Everything happened because</i>

242
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,790
<i>I was so short-sighted. It's all my fault.</i>

243
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,090
This is… The Verdigris House.

244
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,510
Are you awake?

245
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,430
Meimei.

246
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,310
Some person of nobility brought you here.

247
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,440
You look very unwell.

248
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,070
Your face is both red and blue.

249
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,320
I didn't plan on being like this.

250
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,030
I didn't think that
the drink was so strong.

251
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,210
<i>Meimei used to be an apprentice</i>
<i>to Fengxian.</i>

252
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,540
<i>I used to play with Meimei quite a lot.</i>

253
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,130
<i>When told she had potential,</i>
<i>she seemed embarrassed but happy.</i>

254
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,380
Speaking of…

255
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,510
What's wrong?

256
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
No, it's nothing.

257
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,810
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

258
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,530
So bitter! What is this!

259
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,490
Maomao made that.

260
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,740
Mix, mix, mix.

261
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,990
I see, Maomao made this.

262
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,240
Also, Maomao made this box.

263
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,010
A dried rose?

264
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,890
Even after it has died,
you can preserve its form.

265
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,890
Big Sis Meimei.

266
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,270
Excuse me, sir.

267
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,300
