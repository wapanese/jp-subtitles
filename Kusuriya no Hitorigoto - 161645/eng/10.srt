The Apothecary Diaries

00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,070
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
 are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
Episode 10: Honey

5
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,380
I heard about the servant 
who drowned. It was a suicide!

6
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,800
She was a servant at the Garnet Pavilion.

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,790
I heard she was the one who poisoned 
Lady Lishu's food at the garden party...

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,900
I wonder if she did it because
 she served Concubine Ah-Duo?

9
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,650
You mean, Pure Consort Ah-Duo?

10
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,650
Yeah. She's going to lose her title 
as one of the four consorts

11
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,690
to be replaced by a new, 
younger concubine, I hear.

12
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,270
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo is one year older 
than the emperor, at 35 years old.</i>

13
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,500
<i>She had a male baby with the emperor once, 
back when he was still a prince, but lost him.</i>

14
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,690
<i>It's too bad, but the whole rear palace 
system is built for creating many babies.</i>

15
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,330
Mother of a dead male baby.

16
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,340
<i>Will the same thing happen to Lady Lihua, 
if she can't have another baby?</i>

17
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,600
<i>There's no guarantee that Lady Gyokuyou 
will continue to have the emperor's love.</i>

18
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,270
<i>Even the most beautiful 
flowers wilt over time.</i>

19
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,940
<i>The flowers of the rear palace are 
meaningless unless they bear fruit.</i>

20
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,260
I gotta go now.

21
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,980
Oh. Take this, too.

22
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,550
They're leftovers from yesterday's tea party.

23
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,570
Thanks!

24
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,340
Enough snacks to have leftovers?
Tea parties are awesome.

25
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,910
I'm not so sure.

26
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>A tea party is definitely a form 
of work for a concubine.</i>

27
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,000
Maomao, help us set up!

28
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,690
Another one?

29
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,260
You're working quite hard for this one.

30
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,420
Obviously. This time, 
it's a high-ranked concubine,

31
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,640
the Virtuous Consort, Lady Lishu!

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,140
<i>The politics of the rear palace 
is well-represented here.</i>

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Welcome, Concubine Lishu.

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,360
Thank you.

35
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,110
<i>Non-stop probing of each other's thoughts.</i>

36
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,120
<i>Is it part of the nature of being a woman 
to be cautious of the same sex?</i>

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,030
<i>To be honest, they seem more wary 
than when the emperor is here.</i>

38
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,430
<i>The way Lady Gyokuyou gleans 
information through polite conversation</i>

39
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,170
<i>shows how skilled of a concubine she is.</i>

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,920
<i>I heard she sends the information 
she gathers to her family back home.</i>

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,840
<i>Being a trade hub, it must be 
important to understand the times.</i>

42
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,640
<i>The taster at the garden party.</i>

43
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,530
<i>I'm glad to see she hasn't been 
too harshly punished.</i>

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,240
<i>I'm not going to bite her head off or anything.</i>

45
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,700
<i>The other servants aren't paying 
attention to their mistress at all.</i>

46
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,750
<i>That said, it doesn't seem like they're 
actively harassing her, either.</i>

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,380
<i>If my report to Master Gaoshun 
was mistaken, that's fortunate.</i>

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,340
Do you have any issues with sweets?

49
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,260
I love sweets.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Great.

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,540
It's cold out, so I was 
wondering if you'd like this.

52
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,300
It's orange peels boiled 
in honey. It'll warm you up.

53
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,520
I hope you like it.

54
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,240
<i>Hmm? She can't handle honey, either?</i>

55
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,300
Is she being a picky eater again?

56
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,530
She won't even eat something served to her?

57
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,850
I know, right?

58
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,930
Lady Gyokuyou.

59
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,890
Oh, my. Ailan, I'm sorry.

60
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,870
I think this one needs to
 be boiled a bit longer.

61
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,720
Let me get you something else.

62
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,740
How about hot ginger water?

63
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, that's fine.

64
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,570
<i>Unfortunately, it seems like 
I wasn't wrong about the bullying.</i>

65
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,970
We'll clean up here.

66
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,100
Maomao, you can rest.

67
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,380
<i>I can clean too, you know...</i>

68
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,500
How was the tea party for 
Concubines Gyokuyou and Lishu?

69
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,100
<i>I thought it was odd how that 
tea party happened so suddenly.</i>

70
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,220
<i>So, it was this guy's idea, after all.</i>

71
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,760
They had a enjoyable time.

72
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,050
I'm not done with you.

73
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,850
Could you please let go?

74
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,870
Did you hear that
 the garden party poisoning

75
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,100
was done by the Garnet Pavilion 
servant who committed suicide?

76
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,030
I heard the rumors.

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,030
Do you think she really committed suicide?

78
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,660
That's not for me to determine.

79
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,380
Why would a common servant 
poison Concubine Lishu?

80
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,840
I don't know.

81
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,400
Well then, can you go help out at 
the Garnet Pavilion, starting tomorrow?

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,500
<i>"Can" I? It's not like I have a choice.</i>

83
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,660
Understood.

84
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,980
<i>Mansions are painted in their 
masters' colors, figuratively speaking.</i>

85
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,550
<i>Concubine Gyokuyou's 
Jade Pavilion feels homey,</i>

86
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,340
<i>while Concubine Lihua's 
Crystal Pavilion felt refined and noble.</i>

87
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,860
<i>The Garnet Pavilion, home to Concubine Ah-Duo,</i>

88
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,820
<i>was practical and simple, 
yet polished and classy.</i>

89
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,840
My apologies for summoning you so suddenly.

90
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,980
I'm looking forward to working 
with you over the next three days.

91
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,720
<i>Master Jinshi didn't tell me 
to do anything specific.</i>

92
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,440
<i>I guess I should just work.</i>

93
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,000
These are new faces.

94
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,920
Fengming, who are they?

95
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,090
Temporary help for our big cleaning day.

96
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,860
I see. Thanks for the help.

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,610
<i>Ah-Duo, the Pure Consort.</i>

98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,550
<i>She's neither showy nor voluptuous,</i>

99
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,720
<i>but she has an androgynous, 
almost gallant kind of beauty.</i>

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
<i>She's really thirty-five?</i>

101
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,370
<i>If she dressed differently, 
she'd pass as a young civil servant.</i>

102
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,570
<i>She'd probably look better in a riding suit, 
instead of her skirt and dress.</i>

103
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,120
<i>Whoa, those longing stares.</i>

104
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,420
<i>Does she remind me of someone?</i>

105
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,950
<i>Lady Fengming, the head lady-in-waiting.</i>

106
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,660
<i>I expected the Pure Consort's 
head lady-in-waiting</i>

107
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,760
<i>to be from an important family,</i>

108
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,450
<i>but she's surprisingly approachable.</i>

109
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,710
Can you air the books out?

110
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,760
You can ask the eunuchs 
to handle the heavy items.

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,320
<i>She really is the oldest
 high-ranking concubine.</i>

112
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,100
<i>Despite the efficient look, 
the mansion has a whole lot of stuff.</i>

113
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,610
<i>Similar to the Jade Pavilion, the servants 
at the Garnet Pavilion are hard workers.</i>

114
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,360
<i>Certain fools who are all talk 
could learn a thing or two.</i>

115
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,910
Phew.

116
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,290
I guess that's it.

117
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,670
Incredible. You did this much already?

118
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,120
And so thorough, too. Can you
 help with the parlor, as well?

119
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,720
Yes.

120
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,510
<i>She's friendly, observant, 
and praises others well.</i>

121
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,040
<i>Seems like she's skilled at handling 
others as head lady-in-waiting.</i>

122
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,780
I haven't done so much 
physical labor in a while.

123
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,460
Good work. Thank you for your help today.

124
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,240
You're welcome.

125
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,910
Oh, I know. You'll be 
staying here tonight, correct?

126
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,120
Follow me, please.

127
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,220
<i>A sweet smell?</i>

128
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,820
Please use this. It'll get cold tonight.

129
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,680
Thank you.

130
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,140
Rest well.

131
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,700
<i>Master Jinshi didn't tell me 
to do anything specific.</i>

132
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,770
<i>But...</i>

133
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,260
<i>Is the mastermind behind 
the poisoning really here?</i>

134
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,100
<i>They really are all hard workers.</i>

135
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,600
<i>Not just the ladies-in-waiting, but...</i>

136
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,270
Lady Fengming! We can take care of that!

137
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,690
Don't worry about it. 
It's just something I noticed.

138
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,430
<i>Lady Fengming is the leading example.</i>

139
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,910
<i>She's well past her prime, 
but would have made a great wife.</i>

140
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,910
<i>I wonder if she never 
considered getting married.</i>

141
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,420
<i>Did she choose to serve 
Concubine Ah-Duo for life?</i>

142
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,820
<i>Strong loyalty is a possible 
motive for the poisoning.</i>

143
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,710
<i>Now that a new concubine is about to enter,</i>

144
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,470
<i>the high-ranking concubine at 
the most risk is Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

145
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,470
<i>But what if a vacancy 
opened up elsewhere first?</i>

146
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,330
<i>The emperor is only interested 
in ripened fruit.</i>

147
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,900
<i>He doesn't visit Lady Lishu.</i>

148
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,830
<i>That's fine, given her age of fourteen,</i>

149
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,990
<i>but one could also claim she's not 
serving her role as concubine.</i>

150
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,490
<i>If someone were to poison 
someone for Concubine Ah-Duo,</i>

151
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,240
<i>it wouldn't be out of the question 
to target Lady Lishu.</i>

152
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,580
Can someone help me out here?

153
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,880
Honey?

154
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,210
Lady Fengming's family runs an apiary.

155
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,970
No wonder there's so much honey here, 
despite it being so expensive.

156
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
<i>That must have been 
the sweet smell from last night.</i>

157
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,770
<i>Lady Lishu?</i>

158
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,520
<i>Accompanied by just the one taster?</i>

159
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,730
<i>Why is she at the Garnet Pavilion?</i>

160
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,530
<i>Coming to think of it, at the tea party...</i>

161
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,540
That's what happened at the Garnet Pavilion.

162
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,410
I see.

163
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,920
And?

164
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,920
That's it. No "and" or "but."

165
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,920
<i>I don't know what he wants. 
I'm just an apothecary.</i>

166
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,180
<i>If he wants a spy,
he's asking the wrong girl.</i>

167
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,650
<i>What's with his casual 
attitude recently, anyway?</i>

168
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,500
Let's change the question, then.

169
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,500
If one of them could contact the outside 
using some special method,

170
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,570
who would that be, you think?

171
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,570
<i>What a roundabout way of asking.</i>

172
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,640
I suppose the only possibility would be 
Lady Fengming, the head lady-in-waiting.

173
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,450
Based on what?

174
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,000
She had bandages around her left wrist.

175
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,000
Those colored text plates were wrapped in 
a woman's dress with burns on the sleeves.

176
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,930
<i>Why would anyone make multi-colored fires?</i>

177
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,970
<i>One possibility is that it was a code.</i>

178
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,720
<i>Honestly, that gentle head lady-in-waiting</i>

179
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
<i>didn't seem like she was 
part of a conspiracy.</i>

180
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,600
<i>But that's just my opinion.</i>

181
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,610
I suppose that's acceptable.

182
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>I'm sure he knew this already, 
eating honey so ostentatiously.</i>

183
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,700
A good child needs to be rewarded.

184
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,050
I r-respectfully decline.

185
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,620
No need to be modest.

186
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,340
No, thank you! Please offer it to someone else!

187
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,300
<i>This guy thinks he can get away with 
anything because he has a pretty face!</i>

188
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,800
<i>Oh, right, that's the kind of 
pervert he's always been!</i>

189
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,100
Master Gaoshun!

190
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,980
<i>He's getting laxatives in his food later!</i>

191
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,980
Do you not like sweets?

192
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,400
I like spicy foods.

193
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,520
But you can eat this, right?

194
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,280
<i>Damn it, he won't listen...</i>

195
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,900
<i>If he weren't so high up, 
I'd kick him in the groin...</i>

196
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,030
<i>Wait, there's nothing to kick there.</i>

197
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,990
<i>Should I just accept this as an order? 
Or escape to maintain my dignity?</i>

198
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,720
<i>If this was aconite syrup, 
I'd have just accepted it.</i>

199
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,940
<i>Do you have any issues with sweets?</i>

200
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,720
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

201
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,740
<i>Honey?</i>

202
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,370
Lady Fengming's family runs an apiary.

203
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,290
<i>Lady Lishu?</i>

204
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,730
<i>Syrup...</i>

205
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,670
Honey.

206
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,100
Apothecary?

207
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,970
What are you doing to my lady-in-waiting?

208
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,180
Concubine Gyokuyou! I was just—

209
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,590
On whose authority are you doing this?

210
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,620
Xiaomao, this was just a prank gone too far.

211
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,160
Could you forgive Master Jinshi?

212
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,630
In that case, next time you can do
 the licking for me, Master Gaoshun.

213
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,040
L-Licking? That's a bit...

214
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,790
Fine, you get the point.

215
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,640
Also, there are a few things 
I want to check on.

216
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,420
Excuse me.

217
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,930
Welcome, I—Oh?

218
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,770
Master Jinshi's not with you?

219
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,140
I'm afraid not. Apologies
 for the sudden intrusion.

220
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,100
So, what do you want, 
Jade Pavilion lady-in-waiting?

221
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,230
I have a question for you.

222
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,960
I remember you from the garden party.

223
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,530
What is it?

224
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,660
Do you dislike honey?

225
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,620
How did you know?!

226
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,230
I saw it on your face.

227
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,280
Did honey upset your stomach in the past?

228
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,350
It's common for someone to get food poisoning 
and have trouble with honey after that.

229
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,240
That's not it. I don't remember.

230
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,890
It was when I was a baby.

231
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,680
I heard it was life-threatening.

232
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,690
Banned

233
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,690
Since then, my nurses told me to not eat it.

234
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,280
Where are your manners? 
Probing Lady Lishu like that.

235
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,520
<i>Says the lady-in-waiting who didn't even 
try to protect her at the tea party.</i>

236
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,820
What's with that look?

237
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,590
There's no need to listen to her.

238
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,290
That's right, she's being rude to 
the Virtuous Consort. We should expel her!

239
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:53,300
<i>So this is how they paint outsiders as the 
villain to pretend they are the only allies.</i>

240
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,940
We're always looking out for Lady Lishu.

241
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,660
<i>It would be easy to trick a naive girl.</i>

242
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,540
Who does she think she is?

243
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,720
<i>The isolated concubine has nobody 
to rely on but her ladies-in-waiting.</i>

244
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,500
<i>Not knowing she's being harassed...</i>

245
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,000
<i>It's a vicious cycle.</i>

246
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,370
I am here on orders.

247
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,570
If you have objections, please take
 them up with Master Jinshi.

248
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,520
To Master J-Jinshi?!

249
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,480
Directly?!

250
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,330
<i>He owes me this much, at the very least.</i>

251
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,290
<i>Let's see what reasons they come up with 
to approach the pervert eunuch.</i>

252
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,700
And one more thing.

253
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,770
Are you familiar with Lady Fengming,

254
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,510
head lady-in-waiting at the Garnet Pavilion?

255
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,230
Xiaomao?

256
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,240
Master Gaoshun, is there 
any way I can learn about

257
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,610
past events that happened 
in the rear palace?

258
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,870
I can search the court library.

259
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,870
Thank you.

260
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,880
<i>What did she figure out this time?</i>

261
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,170
<i>She's a smart girl, especially 
given that she's only seventeen.</i>

262
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,140
<i>Her knowledge and calm composure...</i>

263
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,300
<i>Her ability to logically think through 
and deal with various issues...</i>

264
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,020
<i>She does have some peculiarities, 
but it's still impressive.</i>

265
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,340
Seventeen years ago, when 
the current emperor was still a prince...

266
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,840
<i>He had a son with Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

267
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,660
<i>The baby's already gone, but...</i>

268
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,550
He was born around the same time

269
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,470
as the prior emperor 
and empress dowager's son,

270
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,670
In other words, the current
 emperor's little brother.

271
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
<i>That was the only child 
the emperor had as a prince,</i>

272
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,460
<i>and Lady Ah-Duo was his only concubine.</i>

273
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,830
It says the current emperor and 
Concubine Ah-Duo are foster siblings,

274
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,850
so that explains his attachment to her...

275
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,500
But it's surprising to learn a man that 
lustful only had one concubine back then.

276
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,130
Sixteen years ago, the baby died. 
The baby was delivered by...

277
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,490
Doctor Luomen

278
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,650
<i>I did have that hunch.</i>

279
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:33,820
<i>Several of the herbs growing in the rear 
palace were the same ones I used growing up.</i>

280
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,750
<i>Someone must have transplanted them.</i>

281
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,330
<i>A man who drags his feet like an old woman.</i>

282
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,010
<i>A doctor overqualified for the position
 of a pleasure district apothecary.</i>

283
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,190
<i>A former eunuch with a bone 
removed from one knee.</i>

284
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,940
...Luomen, expelled...

285
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,940
What were you doing,

286
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,580
Dad?

287
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,860
<i>Not just some superficial sweetness</i>

288
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,180
<i>I want more warmth than I can even use, oh</i>

289
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,510
<i>Having these selfish idealistic thoughts</i>

290
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,080
<i>I swallowed them again today 
before putting them into words</i>

291
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,250
<i>Still in my memories, 
the scent of fragrant olive</i>

292
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,370
<i>The color of twilight in the city</i>

293
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,190
<i>We were laughing...</i>

294
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:53,100
<i>Filled with sadness, 
the tears welled up in my eyes</i>

295
00:21:53,630 --> 00:22:01,320
<i>I found a glow during those days</i>

296
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,380
<i>I guess I took everything for granted</i>

297
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:18,420
<i>The wind was so loud I covered my ears</i>

298
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:25,960
<i>I gotta stop being like that</i>

299
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:34,160
<i>Even if I stumble over the words of love</i>

300
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,970
Next Time

301
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,510
<i>Next time: "Reducing Two to One."</i>

302
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,970
Episode 11: Reducing Two to One
