1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,190
Target sighted.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,400
You are my prey.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,620
I-It's strong...

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,050
<i>But that's not all.</i>

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,500
<i>He's... enjoying the fight.</i>

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,630
A head-on battle against an opponent 
whose strength rivals your own!

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,050
Rivals! Rivals! Rivals! Rivals!

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,430
Your core's a lot smaller than I thought.

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,770
Got him!

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,270
That's the vice-captain for you!

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,020
<i>Not yet!</i>

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,900
It got bigger?!

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,240
Its fortitude is rising alongside the heat...

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,700
No way!

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,200
Fortitude...

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,240
9.0!

17
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,020
Episode 10  Secret Revealed

18
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,350
It's massive...

19
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,440
The vice-captain can't handle 
something that size by himself.

20
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,580
<i>The vice-captain?</i>

21
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,630
Hibino-san?

22
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,050
Number Three: Return Slasher!

23
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,860
Your speed won't save you!

24
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,960
Incredible. He's still fighting it, 
even after it transformed. But...

25
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,790
<i>My blades aren't cutting all the way through!
This is why I hate giant Kaiju!</i>

26
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,220
<i>I'll just have to use my speed 
to get to the core in its back.</i>

27
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,010
<i>It's the only way.</i>

28
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,390
<i>Exceeding operational limits.</i>

29
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,100
<i>Cancel maximum release immediately.</i>

30
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,560
<i>I'm overheating?</i>

31
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,810
It's been ten minutes 
since your maximum release!

32
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,110
You have to shut it down!

33
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,240
So I'm down to one minute at best, huh?

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,270
It self-destructed?

35
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,670
<i>That's just like a Kaiju. 
Totally cold-blooded.</i>

36
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,800
<i>They're like living missiles!</i>

37
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,830
<i>But...</i>

38
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,220
<i>It gave me a nice smoke screen.</i>

39
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,350
Number Six!

40
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,830
<i>Limit exceeded. Canceling maximum release.</i>

41
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,580
<i>Seek medical treatment immediately.</i>

42
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,270
Vice-Captain...

43
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,090
Vice-Captain!

44
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Two hundred years ago,
 you would've been considered a genius.

45
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,770
But the era of blades has passed.

46
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,520
You understand that, right, Soshiro?

47
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,780
Give up on joining the Defense Force.

48
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,910
Vice-Captain! Vice-Captain!

49
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,290
Vice-Captain!

50
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,540
Don't worry... I'm still alive.

51
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,460
<i>Oww...</i>

52
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,260
<i>I had my shields set to max... 
That Kaiju hits like a truck.</i>

53
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,850
<i>I lost my maximum release.</i>

54
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
<i>So what now?</i>

55
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,610
<i>What can I do?</i>

56
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,530
What's going on outside?

57
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,450
<i>The civilians are almost fully evacuated.</i>

58
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,660
<i>We're turning the tide against the Yoju, too.</i>

59
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah? Good stuff.

60
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,220
Guess I'd better keep 
fighting till the end, too.

61
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,510
<i>But you can't fight like that!</i>

62
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,690
Hoshina-Style Sword-Slay Technique
 Number One: Air Slasher!

63
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,660
I've figured it out now.

64
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,660
You can't defeat me with those weapons.

65
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,910
<i>You just figured that out?
 I knew it from the start!</i>

66
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,960
Give up, Soshiro.

67
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,630
Your unleashed combat power with guns is low.

68
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,430
These days, that simply won't do.

69
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,510
Give up, Hoshina.

70
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,140
We're seeing more 
and more giant Kaiju every year.

71
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,310
If all you can use is a blade, 
you'll get yourself killed out there.

72
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,030
People have been telling me 
that since I was a kid!

73
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,990
<i>But she told me something else...</i>

74
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,000
Soshiro Hoshina, I'm told
 you're a blade specialist.

75
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,460
Yes, that's right.

76
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,590
<i>Here it comes...</i>

77
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,880
<i>"Give up."</i>

78
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,050
I need your help.

79
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,020
Will you join my force, Hoshina?

80
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,140
We could easily find ourselves facing 
small but powerful foes someday.

81
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,230
And I'm the opposite of you. 
I can't use a blade at all.

82
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,070
I try not to even use kitchen knives.

83
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,820
When it's time for me to shoot my foe,

84
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,830
will you clear a path for me?

85
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,750
<i>She left me in charge of the base.</i>

86
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,010
<i>I'll protect it if it kills me!</i>

87
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,300
Number Two: Cross Slasher!

88
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,430
Number Three: Return Slasher!

89
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,270
Number Four: Wild Slasher!

90
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,950
Number Five: Mist Slasher!

91
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,530
Number Six!

92
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,920
Vice-Captain!

93
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,010
I don't have a choice!

94
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,270
No...

95
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,730
<i>If he transforms here, 
there really will be no escape!</i>

96
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,230
No, Senpai!

97
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,940
<i>I'm sorry, Ichikawa.</i>

98
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,530
<i>My comrades' lives are more important!</i>

99
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,620
<i>Great work, everyone.</i>

100
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,040
That voice...

101
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,540
Hey, Kaiju.

102
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,460
I win this fight.

103
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm the vice-captain of the base.

104
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,730
My job's to pass the baton to her.

105
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,560
Okonogi. This is an emergency,
so I'm skipping the procedures.

106
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,320
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

107
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,940
Time to blow this thing up.

108
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,590
It's regenerating fast!

109
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,760
Captain, the core is in the back!

110
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
Somewhere around the fourth 
to sixth thoracic vertebrae!

111
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,680
Roger!

112
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,230
Damn it!

113
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,530
I guess it's not that easy...

114
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,320
Now, time to give it one more go...

115
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,660
<i>Unleashed combat power, 63%.</i>

116
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,750
Number Four: Wild Slasher!

117
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,050
<i>I'll limit its mobility 
to make it an easier target.</i>

118
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,010
Number Two: Cross Slasher!

119
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,800
This is crazy!

120
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,220
Your suit's already past its limit!

121
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,020
It's regenerating...

122
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,940
<i>My power output's too low. What do I do?</i>

123
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,320
Shinomiya?

124
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,070
Water Skimmer!

125
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,410
Damn it... I'm not even strong 
enough to scratch it yet?

126
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,000
Keep going, Shinomiya.

127
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,710
I'll cut open the shell, 
then you chop into the wounds!

128
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,430
<i>It worked!</i>

129
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,930
Shinomiya!

130
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,810
<i>Overheated?</i>

131
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,480
<i>That's fine, though.</i>

132
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,070
<i>You did well.</i>

133
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,620
Core exposed!

134
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,410
You've got one bullet remaining, Captain!

135
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,210
Support the captain!

136
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,100
Vice-Captain! Sorry we're late!

137
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,310
Don't give it time to regenerate, guys!

138
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,660
<i>Move.</i>

139
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,330
<i>Move.</i>

140
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,260
<i>Don't stop thinking!</i>

141
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,550
<i>Just five more seconds is enough...</i>

142
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,970
<i>Come on, move!</i>

143
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,600
<i>Slice. Slice.</i>

144
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,440
<i>Slice open a path!</i>

145
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,070
<i>That's the only way I have to leave my mark!</i>

146
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,330
Thank you, Hoshina.

147
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,540
I was right to make you my vice-captain.

148
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,090
<i>Unleashed combat power, 96%.</i>

149
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,180
Now it's time for me to shoot my foe.

150
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,770
You picked the wrong folks to mess with.

151
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,960
Th-The Honju is down!

152
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,510
We did it.

153
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,380
Yeah.

154
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,470
Yes!

155
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,260
That's Captain Ashiro for you, huh?

156
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,510
I was right...

157
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,390
This is the Defense Force 
I've wanted to be in since I was a kid.

158
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,140
They're all so cool...

159
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,230
I want to stand right there 
with them someday...

160
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,440
Your face is a mess.

161
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,280
What? How can you say that when
I'm having an emotional moment?!

162
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,660
You've got a heart of stone!

163
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
We're just getting started.

164
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,910
Let's do our best, too.

165
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,460
Yeah.

166
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,380
The captain and I will deal with the Yoju.

167
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,420
No, you get some rest.

168
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,180
You too, Captain.

169
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,350
<i>That's right. You only have 1% left 
until your suit overheats.</i>

170
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,730
You fired a whole bunch 
of high-powered shots.

171
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,230
Leave the Yoju to us.

172
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,940
No, I'm fine.

173
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,910
What is that?

174
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,460
The Yoju...

175
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,050
So that last scream wasn't its death rattle?

176
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,840
Energy levels rising...

177
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,010
It's an ultra-massive Yoju bomb!

178
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,510
The blast's estimated impact
 is equal to 20 kilotons of TNT!

179
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,470
That's the same as a nuclear bomb!

180
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,230
No! Don't shoot!

181
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,230
Evacuate!

182
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,280
<i>No... there's no time...</i>

183
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,650
<i>If that thing hits the ground...</i>

184
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,240
Human...

185
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,620
Looks like this fight is a draw.

186
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,210
No, Senpai!

187
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,590
Kafka?!

188
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,590
Get back here! There's nothing you can do!

189
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,140
<i>Wait...</i>

190
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,600
<i>How's he so fast?</i>

191
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,430
<i>That's not what 1% unleashed 
combat power looks like!</i>

192
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,700
We're detecting a gigantic 
Kaiju signal above the base!

193
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,660
Fortitude 9.8!

194
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,160
<i>This signal, it's...</i>

195
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,710
<i>Kaiju No. 8!</i>

196
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,220
<i>I knew something was wrong...</i>

197
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,390
<i>But I found myself liking him so much...</i>

198
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,140
<i>that I just turned a blind eye 
to the possibility.</i>

199
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,110
You can have 1% of my expectations.

200
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,740
<i>I'm sorry, Vice-Captain Hoshina.</i>

201
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,450
Fine.

202
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,870
You did save my life, 
so I'll keep quiet about it for now.

203
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,030
<i>I'm sorry, Kikoru.</i>

204
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,580
<i>You kept your promise 
and never told anyone...</i>

205
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,370
<i>And everyone else... 
I'm sorry for lying to you.</i>

206
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,750
Just don't take any risks, please.

207
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,800
<i>Sorry, Ichikawa. I think I'm gonna have to.</i>

208
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,970
You're a long way from being 
able to fight by my side.

209
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,310
<i>Mina... I...</i>

210
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,850
Senpai!

211
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,150
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

212
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,200
<i>Everyone else risked their 
lives during this fight!</i>

213
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,080
<i>I can't be the only one 
who puts his own safety first!</i>

214
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,420
<i>I'm part of the Defense Force, too!</i>

215
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,210
<i>I'm an officer of the Third Division, too!</i>

216
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,050
So now it's my turn!

217
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,510
Everyone, on the ground!
Shields at max!

218
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,750
<i>Well, now I've done it...</i>

219
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,670
<i>My arms and legs 
are barely holding together...</i>

220
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,260
<i>I'm too old to be pulling stunts like that.</i>

221
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,390
Kafka Hibino...

222
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,560
No...

223
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,400
Kaiju No. 8.

224
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,870
I'm taking you into custody.
