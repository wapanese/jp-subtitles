1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,230
Time for your big debut.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,570
Vice-Captain Hoshina, 
I've located the Yoju core.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,200
<i>What?</i>

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,840
It's at the base of the neck.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,990
<i>And there's one more thing. 
This one's important.</i>

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,030
The Yoju have reproductive organs too.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,200
If we don't destroy those organs, 
their corpses might spawn new Yoju.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,170
Target sighted.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,040
No additional targets in area.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,980
<i>Roger.</i>

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,290
<i>You are cleared to fire.</i>

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,080
Fire.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,810
Watch this one closely, Kafka.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,390
That's the power of the person 
you're trying to stand beside.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,600
Honju has taken critical damage 
and has stopped moving entirely.

16
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,490
Just like I thought.

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,950
We killed the Honju, but the Yoju 
are still alive inside its corpse...

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,620
and are going to come swarming out.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,400
Hey, you didn't hear the alarm?

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,640
The cleanup crew 
won't be needed until later.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,850
Aww, this one's no good either.

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,170
The reproductive organs I loaded
 them with have been destroyed.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,630
Maybe there's somebody on the force
 who knows all about Kaiju?

24
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,740
Wow, the Honju's huge!

25
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,810
Episode 7       Kaiju No. 9

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,430
Monster Sweeper

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,430
Find Kafka and Ichikawa?

28
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,600
You know we can't see them from up here.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,880
I can see why they called every 
cleanup company in Tokyo and Kanagawa.

30
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,850
Hey, did you see the new guy?

31
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,950
You don't think he's locked himself
 in the bathroom again?

32
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,310
Want me to go get him?

33
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,520
Thanks.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
Hey, look.

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,760
This place is still dangerous. 
Stay out of here until we give the all clear.

36
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,930
Move, Iharu-kun!

37
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,090
Oh, I missed your heart, huh?

38
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,610
I guess I'm not as accurate in this form.

39
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,000
Iharu-kun!

40
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,200
The bleeding won't stop!

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,460
Calm down and use your suit 
to stop the bleeding!

42
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,550
Who the hell are you?

43
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,040
<i>A Kaiju?</i>

44
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,640
<i>The only humanoid Kaiju 
I know that's not Senpai is...</i>

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,190
<i>the one from the exam!</i>

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,520
This is the one that took down Shinomiya?

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,610
I think so.

48
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,140
Well, I don't want to 
just return empty-handed.

49
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,270
Maybe I can at least take home 
a live sample of a Defense Force officer.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,190
Platoon Leader Ikaruga, 
we've encountered a humanoid Kaiju.

51
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,480
Send backup immediately!

52
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,150
Platoon Leader!

53
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,130
No...

54
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,760
Oh, right. Your communicator thingies.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,120
I've figured those out.

56
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,770
This area is completely undetectable 
from the outside world.

57
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,170
I came up with this trick to 
help me stay hidden among humans,

58
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,300
but it works well for 
hunting humans too, you know.

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,340
Reno!

60
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,100
Huh? I'm not quite hitting my targets.

61
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,360
<i>He's breaking right 
through my suit's shields.</i>

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
<i>But...</i>

63
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,660
Oh, I get it. You see it, don't you?

64
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,260
Oh, right.

65
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,490
Let me tell you this just 
in case you ever run into him.

66
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,100
At first it looks like he's using 
some kind of magic or something...

67
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,000
But watch his fingers closely.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,280
You'll see him prepare for the attack.

69
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,410
<i>I can dodge them!</i>

70
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,110
He dodged it!

71
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,870
So I was right.

72
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,190
Get out of here and call for backup.

73
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,440
Why do I have to let you protect me?

74
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,110
Oww!

75
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,000
Iharu-kun!

76
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,930
Go, please.

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,710
<i>I'm scared.</i>

78
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,080
<i>Even Shinomiya didn't stand 
a chance against him,</i>

79
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,330
<i>so I sure as hell don't.</i>

80
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,460
<i>But...</i>

81
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,960
<i>The Defense Force officer I want to be...</i>

82
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,480
Ichikawa, run!

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,900
Once you're sure you're safe, call it in!

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,500
<i>...is a man who would put his life 
on the line for his buddies like this!</i>

85
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,780
<i>I can at least buy enough time 
for Iharu-kun to get out of here!</i>

86
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,920
<i>Reno's a totally different guy 
than he was yesterday!</i>

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,370
<i>What happened to him?</i>

88
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,800
<i>How can he fight that thing?</i>

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,760
Damn it! Damn it all!

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,860
I hate this! I hate it!

91
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,400
<i>You'll hit a wall unleashing your combat power.</i>

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,110
<i>Usually around 20% to 30%.</i>

93
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,620
<i>Only a very few people can scale that wall,</i>

94
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,820
<i>but everyone has the 
potential within them to do it.</i>

95
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,740
<i>If you just assume you'll pass 
and don't put in the effort, you never will.</i>

96
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,160
<i>I've been stuck at 20% for almost two weeks.</i>

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
<i>Ever since that day, I've thought 
of nothing but getting stronger.</i>

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,610
<i>But he...</i>

99
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,740
<i>But he...</i>

100
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,080
<i>He surpassed me like it was nothing!</i>

101
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,260
And I hate it!

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,640
You seem to know a few things about me.

103
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,450
But you don't know about this one, do you?

104
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,700
Huh?

105
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,960
Iharu-kun? Why?

106
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,320
<i>No... What I hate isn't Reno.</i>

107
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,550
<i>It's me... the guy who 
hasn't changed a bit since that day.</i>

108
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,170
<i>The guy who always needs 
somebody else to save him!</i>

109
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,780
Listen, Reno. You ain't saving me.

110
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,680
I'm saving you, dumbass.

111
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,920
Iharu-kun.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,250
Not sure what I'm seeing here.

113
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,230
Didn't you go to get help?

114
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,430
Shaddup!

115
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,220
If I hadn't come back, 
you'd be dead right now!

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,120
Oh, you were trying to get him out of here?

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,890
That won't work.

118
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,080
Nothing, living or otherwise, 
can leave this space without my permission.

119
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,450
You heard the guy.

120
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,820
Gotta fight, then.

121
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,690
Let's take him down together, Reno!

122
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,660
I ain't doing so good, though.

123
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,880
I'll back you up, get you an opening.

124
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,650
So hit him as hard as you can!

125
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,510
Right!

126
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,960
Let's go, Reno!

127
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,480
A conductor round?

128
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,760
You aren't the only one who's 
trying all the different bullets!

129
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,730
This stuff makes it hard to move.

130
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,640
Guess I'll stop him first.

131
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,300
<i>Focus.</i>

132
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,390
<i>You've already taken a hit from him once. 
You know how the timing works!</i>

133
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,840
Him too, huh?

134
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,030
Now, Reno!

135
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,070
Unleash maximum combat power!

136
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,550
<i>Please, God... just this once... 
just this one moment...</i>

137
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:16,060
<i>Give me more power 
than Shinomiya or Captain Ashiro!</i>

138
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,320
What the hell?

139
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,700
A wall of corpses?

140
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,570
Oh...

141
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,860
From the look of it...

142
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,830
I guess you're screwed, huh?

143
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,210
Reno!

144
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,910
<i>Vice-Captain Hoshina, 
this is Platoon Leader Ikaruga.</i>

145
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,120
What's up?

146
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,440
<i>We've lost contact 
with Ichikawa and Furuhashi.</i>

147
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
What?

148
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,980
<i>We've lost communication and vitals signals.</i>

149
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,480
<i>Ichikawa?</i>

150
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,230
Did I just see that thing move?

151
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,990
Kafka Hibino!

152
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,500
Kikoru! Does this mean...?

153
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,800
Yeah.

154
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
He's here.

155
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,230
Ichikawa... Iharu!

156
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,330
Reno!

157
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,680
<i>My whole body is burning...</i>

158
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,310
<i>I need to have the suit stop 
the bleeding and stand up.</i>

159
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,910
<i>I'm still alive!</i>

160
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,530
<i>The battle's not over!</i>

161
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,370
You can still move, huh?

162
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,670
It's surprisingly hard to halt a human's 
motor functions without killing them.

163
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,700
No you don't!

164
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,110
I've seen that trick already.

165
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,550
Now, time to wrap this up.

166
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,400
Would this be too weak?

167
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,340
Damn it...

168
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,880
You can still move, huh?

169
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,900
Damn it!

170
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,900
Well, how about this?

171
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,840
<i>My comrade's getting hurt 
right in front of me...</i>

172
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,040
<i>and I can't do a thing to stop it?</i>

173
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,740
<i>I hate it...</i>

174
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,380
<i>I hate to admit it...</i>

175
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,340
<i>But Reno is incredible!</i>

176
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,300
<i>He'll become a captain someday!</i>

177
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,850
I won't let it end for him here!

178
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,890
I'm about done with him, 
so I don't need you anymore.

179
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,230
<i>Please, God...</i>

180
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,560
<i>Or a demon or the devil 
himself... I don't care.</i>

181
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,470
<i>Save Reno...</i>

182
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,100
<i>Save my friend!</i>

183
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,920
Go ahead and die now.

184
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,100
The only one dying here is you, asshole.

185
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,960
<i>What just happened?</i>

186
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,280
<i>I can see my own torso...?</i>

187
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,690
<i>Oh, my head got knocked off!</i>

188
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,820
Sorry I'm late.

189
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,490
<i>I'm so weak...</i>

190
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,680
<i>I wanted so bad... 
to stop this from happening.</i>

191
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:36,070
<i>But in the end... I made him
 transform one more time.</i>

192
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,200
A-Another humanoid type?

193
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, so that's you, huh?

194
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,000
You're...

195
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,820
Kaiju No. 8.

196
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Sorry, Ichikawa. Looks like 
it's gonna take a little longer.

197
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,320
No...

198
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,320
It'll be fine.

199
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,390
Just calm down. Have the suit 
close the wounds one by one.

200
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,960
I guess you don't need a lecture 
from me on that, huh?

201
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,640
I can't even do it.

202
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,980
Senpai...

203
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,990
Be careful.

204
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,670
Yeah.

205
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,090
Just let me handle this.

206
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,320
<i>I know he's strong,</i>

207
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,330
<i>but I've got a bad feeling...</i>

208
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,050
Not that I'm mad or anything,

209
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,280
but why are you getting in my 
way when you're a Kaiju, too?

210
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,300
And also, you're a lot stronger 
than I thought you were.

211
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,300
I'd like to have your corpse
 so I can use it.

212
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,600
<i>He managed to hurt Senpai in his Kaiju form?</i>

213
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:05,240
I see. You're tough. 
If I'm gonna kill you...

214
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,260
I'm probably gonna need about this much.

215
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,160
<i>He wasn't taking the fight 
with us seriously at all?!</i>

216
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,050
Senpai, run!

217
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh...

218
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:26,370
So this is the stuff you've been shooting
 them with, over and over again?

219
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,270
<i>Huh?</i>

220
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,980
<i>What?</i>

221
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,710
The wall of corpses?

222
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
<i>I'll heal while I have the chance...</i>

223
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,680
<i>What?</i>

224
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,190
<i>What is this guy?</i>

225
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,460
<i>Protect...</i>

226
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,580
<i>Can't take... direct hit...</i>

227
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,190
<i>He's pushing me back?</i>

228
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,440
<i>Abnormal...</i>

229
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,090
<i>Something's wrong...</i>

230
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,640
<i>The damage I've taken 
is taking too long to repair...</i>

231
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,850
<i>Confusion...</i>

232
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,020
<i>Temporary retreat...</i>

233
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,830
<i>No opportunity to retreat.</i>

234
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,520
Your core's in your torso, right?

235
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,020
Brace yourself, 'cause 
I'm about to punch a hole in it!

236
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,090
<i>Oh, this is bad.</i>

237
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,680
<i>Oh no. My core is completely exposed.</i>

238
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,640
It's over.

239
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,670
Th-This is Ikaruga Platoon! 
We've discovered a humanoid Kaiju!

240
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,750
It's not strong enough!

241
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,350
How far did he go?

242
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,030
You're going to find Reno and Iharu?

243
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,500
Their communications are offline, 
and we can't even detect their vitals!

244
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,880
How?

245
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,370
If they're with that other humanoid...

246
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,350
I should be able to sense him.

247
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,170
Kikoru.

248
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,320
Take care of things while I'm gone!

249
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,360
Wait!

250
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,000
<i>He transformed right here?</i>

251
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,670
<i>This is Ikaruga Platoon!</i>

252
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,000
<i>We've discovered a humanoid Kaiju 
in the southeast of Sector Foxtrot,</i>

253
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,770
<i>It matches the description of Kaiju No. 8!</i>

254
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,600
Roger.

255
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,720
Sending a neutralization unit now.

256
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,720
That idiot...

257
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,080
The mimetic space was destroyed, huh?

258
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,650
But that gave me the opportunity I needed.

259
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,900
Crap!

260
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,860
I now understand how you work.

261
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,160
Next time, I can kill you.

262
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,070
I won't let you go!

263
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,480
You behave like a human, 
even though you're a Kaiju.

264
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,410
We'll meet again, Kaiju No. 8.

265
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,580
Damn it! I've got no choice 
but to get out of here myself!

266
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,200
He got away!

267
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,650
Help the wounded!

268
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,130
<i>Good.</i>

269
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,240
<i>I let the humanoid type get away, 
but I did what I set out to do.</i>

270
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,780
A coal-black body 
and a skull face, like a demon.

271
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,310
I've finally found you, Kaiju No. 8.

272
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,920
Ho...

273
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,140
<i>Vice-Captain Hoshina!</i>

274
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,680
This is Hoshina.

275
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,560
I've made contact with Kaiju No. 8
 in Sector Foxtrot.

276
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,720
Looks like you've been 
having some fun with my men.

277
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,920
<i>No, Vice-Captain Hoshina...</i>

278
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,320
<i>That person is...</i>

279
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,880
But when it comes to the smaller 
and mid-sized enemies...

280
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,760
I think I'm a bit better than she is.

281
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,510
<i>He wasn't bluffing!</i>

282
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,520
<i>He's got a lot of experience 
fighting smaller Kaiju!</i>

283
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,320
Well, you're a tough one.

284
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm pretty sure I landed 
at least a few hits.

285
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,130
<i>I've only ever seen him 
with that grin on his face.</i>

286
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,240
<i>But this is...</i>

287
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,760
Time to stop messing around, then.

288
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,960
<i>This is what Vice-Captain Hoshina 
looks like when he's killing Kaiju!</i>

289
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,400
Requesting permission to remove limiter.

290
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,710
<i>Roger!</i>

291
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,500
I'll be the one to...

292
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,090
<i>Unleashed combat power, 92%!</i>

293
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
...neutralize No. 8.
