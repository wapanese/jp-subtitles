00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,610
Episode 8   Welcome to the Defense Force

2
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,400
I'll be the one to...

3
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,960
<i>What do I do?</i>

4
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,580
<i>I can't use my fists against
 Vice-Captain Hoshina!</i>

5
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,310
That seemed to work.

6
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,810
<i>No, I won't survive this 
if I try to hold back!</i>

7
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,470
<i>He's so quick, I can't harden my body 
to protect myself fast enough!</i>

8
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>He may not be stronger, but he's a hell 
of a lot faster than the humanoid Kaiju!</i>

9
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,210
<i>The first time I saw Kikoru move, 
I thought she was incredible.</i>

10
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,670
<i>But...</i>

11
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,840
<i>He's on a whole other level!</i>

12
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,690
<i>He's not even moving like a human!</i>

13
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>I dodged that!</i>

14
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,390
<i>What is this? Some kind of 
slashing attack I can't see?</i>

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,890
Core located.

16
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,660
<i>Not that I'm human, either.</i>

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,580
<i>Now that I've done it, I can tell that 
regenerating uses a lot of my stamina!</i>

18
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,750
<i>I can't take too many hits like that!</i>

19
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,420
<i>Wait, seriously?</i>

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,290
<i>I'm not exactly joking around here.</i>

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,900
<i>He's probably at least Fortitude 8.0.</i>

22
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,510
<i>That'd make him a Daikaiju.</i>

23
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,820
<i>But what's this weird feeling 
I'm getting from this fight?</i>

24
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,200
Well, it doesn't matter.

25
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,580
<i>Those invisible slashes...</i>

26
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,210
<i>And a double attack!</i>

27
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,660
<i>No.</i>

28
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,660
<i>The double attack was a decoy!</i>

29
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,520
Mist Slasher.

30
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,510
<i>A triple attack?!</i>

31
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,730
<i>Gotcha.</i>

32
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,560
The blade...

33
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,450
The blade's stuck!

34
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,870
<i>That was close.</i>

35
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,940
<i>That was stronger than I expected, but...</i>

36
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,270
<i>After he saw my core, 
I knew he'd aim for me there!</i>

37
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,270
No!

38
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,790
Yikes. I let it get away.

39
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,100
<i>Reporting.</i>

40
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,600
Kaiju No. 8 has escaped.

41
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,920
<i>Kaiju No. 8.</i>

42
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,780
<i>Kafka Hibino.</i>

43
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Now leave the rest to me!

44
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,020
<i>Is it really okay for me to believe in him?</i>

45
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,410
I'm back...

46
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,030
Sorry, I must've worried you.

47
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,900
I wasn't worried!

48
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,010
And I have more than
 a thing or two to say to you...

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,990
Hey!

50
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,980
Sorry... I let it get away.

51
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,310
The one who hurt you...

52
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,750
I-I don't care.

53
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll kill it myself.

54
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,200
Hey, where are you going? 
You're in terrible shape.

55
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,390
Ichikawa and Iharu were 
horribly injured... I have to go.

56
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,640
And even if you went, what could you do?

57
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,740
They'll be fine.

58
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,560
The Defense Force is starting to 
use Kaiju regeneration in its tech, too.

59
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,360
You should worry about yourself instead!

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
Not only did the other officers see you,
you made contact with Vice-Captain Hoshina!

61
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,170
They could easily find some clue 
that leads straight to you!

62
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,270
It's rare to see you this down.

63
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,850
Cripes. You've caught me in 
a really embarrassing spot.

64
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,920
I'll take a photo to remember it by.

65
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
Please don't!

66
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,030
So, was Kaiju No. 8 strong?

67
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,510
I'm assuming it's a Daikaiju.

68
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,600
That would make it the first one
 since Fukuoka five years ago.

69
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,210
Fortunately, there've been no casualties 
due to No. 8 these past few months.

70
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,210
It doesn't seem to be the type 
to attack people indiscriminately.

71
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,920
<i>Yeah, that's the strange feeling I had...</i>

72
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,040
<i>Why did No. 8 attack
 my weapon instead of me?</i>

73
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,510
<i>Nothing about that battle made sense.</i>

74
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
<i>The way it moved and reacted...</i>

75
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,980
<i>It was more like fighting a human 
than fighting a Kaiju.</i>

76
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
For now, get some rest.

77
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,700
I'll take care of this.

78
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,550
No matter what type of Kaiju it is,

79
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,120
it's our job to neutralize it.

80
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,950
<i>Well, she's right there.</i>

81
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,840
Roger.

82
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,180
<i>Captain! Vice-Captain!</i>

83
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,540
You're too loud, Ikaruga.

84
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,640
What's wrong?

85
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,170
<i>Sorry. I learned something 
I thought you should hear.</i>

86
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,960
The Kaiju that attacked Furuhashi and Ichikawa

87
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,310
appears to have been the same humanoid
 type that appeared at the exam site.

88
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,580
When they found it,

89
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,190
<i>it had a human form...</i>

90
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,360
Hey!

91
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,620
Hey, are you deaf?

92
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,990
Out of the way!

93
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,240
What?

94
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,310
What?

95
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,880
Hey, say something!

96
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,380
<i>Breaking news.</i>

97
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,820
<i>After the latest incident, the Defense Force</i>

98
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,970
<i>has designated the humanoid type that
appeared at the exam site and Sagamihara</i>

99
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,240
<i>as a long-term neutralization target,</i>

100
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,280
<i>giving it the codename Kaiju No. 9.</i>

101
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,000
Now, how do I kill Kaiju No. 8?

102
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,630
Oh dear, oh dear.

103
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,640
I'll need to remain hidden 
until I get used to this body again.

104
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,280
He's awake.

105
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,720
Hey.

106
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,850
You awake, partner?

107
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,740
Senpai, I'm glad you're okay.

108
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,430
That's my line, dummy.

109
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,120
Also... thank you.

110
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,560
For saving me and Iharu-kun.

111
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,350
Why are you thanking the old dude?

112
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,810
Iharu-kun's in the same room?!

113
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,590
It was Kaiju No. 8 that saved us, right?

114
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,440
Well, he found the Yoju reproductive organs, 
and that was a huge help, right?

115
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,080
Oh, good point.

116
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,990
Thanks, old dude!

117
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,320
S-Sure thing!

118
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,050
Why'd the Kaiju save us, though?

119
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:50,000
He was so strong.
 He knocked No. 9's head clean off!

120
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,920
For a Kaiju, he was pretty damn cool!

121
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,620
I wish you could've seen him!

122
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,860
Hey, why are you blushing, old dude?

123
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,610
Blushing?

124
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,190
He's got the same dumb look 
on his face he always does!

125
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,440
Very true!

126
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,600
We're so lucky it was Iharu-kun...

127
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,280
You don't need to hit me so hard.

128
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,230
Furuhashi & Ichikawa

129
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,230
Congratulations on Leaving the Hospital

130
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,610
Congratulations on leaving the hospital!

131
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,570
Wh-What's this?

132
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,870
A celebration for our 
first successful mission!

133
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,890
We were waiting for you
 to get out of the hospital.

134
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
Okay, let's get started.

135
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,680
Your course of A6-grade marbled
 Japanese Black Wagyu beef!

136
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,440
A6?!

137
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Is there an A6?!

138
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,060
*There is not

139
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,150
We could never serve less than the finest 
at a party organized by Haruichi-sama.

140
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,730
I remember asking for the cheapest course.

141
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,320
You can pay the standard prices.

142
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,030
Really? Lucky us!

143
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,990
Just who is Haruichi?

144
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,830
What?

145
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,310
You didn't know when you asked him
to put this together?

146
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,950
That's right.

147
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,420
He's the heir to Izumo Technologies,

148
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,950
the largest anti-Kaiju arms 
manufacturer in the country.

149
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,210
The place that makes 
the Defense Force suits?

150
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,880
Yeah. He's got way more wealth 
than even my family.

151
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,090
So that's why you asked me to find a place?

152
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,000
That's right.

153
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,530
You said you wanted everybody 
to get a good meal, right?

154
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,600
And he's perfect for the job, huh?

155
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Yeah.

156
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,150
So yeah, excellent job 
on your first mission.

157
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,900
You don't get many days 
when all your batchmates

158
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,420
are off at the same time.

159
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,080
So have a lot of fun!

160
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,310
Cheers!

161
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,900
Cheers!

162
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,710
Yeah, this is so good!

163
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,440
...blew his head right off! It was amazing!

164
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,020
I've never seen everybody looking so happy.

165
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,030
Thank you for putting this together.

166
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,530
Don't speak too soon, Ichikawa.

167
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,220
The show's about to start.

168
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,370
What do you mean?

169
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,660
And you're too busy trying 
to show off to help your team!

170
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,560
And you make everything personal!

171
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,800
You're the one person on this team 
who has <i>zero</i> right to say that to me!

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,130
I don't count, 'cause I'm 
just that damn good!

173
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,450
Guys, don't fight...

174
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,200
You always do things your way
 and neglect the basics.

175
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,400
And you do things so by the book,
 you can't keep up when we work together!

176
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,040
I have to slow myself down, you know.

177
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,670
These guys too?

178
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,580
So anyway, Izumo...

179
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,100
You sure you guys' suits ain't defective?

180
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,500
I couldn't even defeat
 a single one of those jerks!

181
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,180
Draw out more of its power, then.

182
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,100
Not you too, Senpai!

183
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,790
Hey, you're with the comms team, right?

184
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,650
We kept losing communications 
during the mission!

185
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,040
You're the one who kept going inside 
radio interference areas without telling us!

186
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,840
We've told you that if you give us 
advance notice, we can work it out!

187
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,680
Oh no! It's everywhere I look...

188
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,550
But isn't this...

189
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,410
You've noticed, huh?

190
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,040
<i>They're all talking about the mission now.</i>

191
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>After their first mission, 
they've all seen what they're lacking.</i>

192
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,010
<i>That's right. It's not just me.</i>

193
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,990
<i>Everybody wants to be stronger.</i>

194
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,310
What did you say, asshole?

195
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,080
Show some respect for your elders!

196
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,750
I only respect people stronger than me.

197
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,520
All right, it's on!

198
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,860
I'll show you who's boss!

199
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,350
I'm tired of listening 
to your whining, you know.

200
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,280
That's my line, jerk!

201
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,710
You don't listen, do you, girl?

202
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,830
You've got no right to say that to me!

203
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,370
It's a yearly tradition.

204
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,450
We were so happy you reached out 
to us, young master.

205
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,820
I thought I'd never see you again.

206
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,710
Don't say that, Dojima-san.

207
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,720
I just wanted to make sure 
everybody had a nice meal.

208
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,850
So, about your father...

209
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,330
I haven't talked to him since then.

210
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,280
I see.

211
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,010
I'm sorry for worrying you.

212
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,870
Dojima-san, today's meal was incredible.

213
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,670
<i>Did he hear that?</i>

214
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Bathroom.

215
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,140
<i>I guess he's not the nosy type.</i>

216
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,350
Okay, calm down, everybody.

217
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,440
Time to make an announcement.

218
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,240
Announcement?

219
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,200
Kafka Hibino.

220
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,880
You saved a lot of lives during the mission,
 and that got you noticed.

221
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,550
So you're getting promoted to full officer.

222
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,240
Welcome to the Defense Force's Third Division.

223
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,220
Yes!

224
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,530
Senpai!

225
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,860
You did it, old dude!

226
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,400
Don't call me that!

227
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,270
Time to give him a victory toss!

228
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,520
Great idea!

229
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,940
Grab him, guys!

230
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,300
You help out, too!

231
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,390
Don't drop him!

232
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,690
It's a good night.

233
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,920
If I can stop us from losing 
a single person, I want to.

234
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:14,110
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

235
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,900
Yeah, I agree.

236
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,120
Kafka Hibino.

237
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,070
As of today, as of this moment,
 you are no longer a cadet,

238
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,440
but a full-fledged Defense Force officer.

239
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,060
I swear to give everything 
I have to the fight.

240
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,640
A-Anyway, I'll be going...

241
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,620
Don't get too excited.

242
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,250
You're a long way from being 
able to fight by my side.

243
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,310
<i>So Mina does remember!</i>

244
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,310
Yeah, just you wait, Mina!

245
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,040
Give me fifty push-ups for failing 
to address a superior by their title.

246
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,280
I did it again!

247
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,840
Kaiju No. 8...

248
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,730
and No. 9 need to be discussed at HQ,
which requires my presence.

249
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,180
<i>Whew...</i>

250
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,230
I've put Vice-Captain Hoshina in charge, 
so ask him about the paperwork.

251
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,040
Roger!

252
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,920
And... it was Hoshina who 
recommended you for full officer.

253
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,480
Of course, it only happened because 
of your success in the last battle.

254
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,680
<i>The vice-captain...</i>

255
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,700
Live up to his expectations.

256
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,590
Roger!

257
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,400
I guess that's enough for today.

258
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,070
I don't want another lecture
from the vice-captain.

259
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,150
The training room?

260
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,150
At this hour?

261
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,840
Who forgot to turn the lights off?

262
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,410
<i>The vice-captain? What's he doing?</i>

263
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,890
<i>Mental imagery training?</i>

264
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,580
<i>But the way he's moving...</i>

265
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,380
<i>He's not just doing ordinary training.</i>

266
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,100
<i>He's recreating his battle with me!</i>

267
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,480
Oh, Kafka?

268
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
You're here way too late again.

269
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,440
What about you? Why are you here so late?

270
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,530
Working out a strategy for No. 8.

271
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,120
So I can slice him in half with 
a single strike next time I see him.

272
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,840
I screwed up at the start, you know.

273
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,330
If I'd gone all in right off the bat, 
I could've chopped his head off.

274
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,380
And...

275
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,280
If I'd used skill six instead of skill five,

276
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,300
I could've sliced him 
and his core into ribbons.

277
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,180
You're getting way too scared.

278
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,270
No normal officer could handle that thing.

279
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,420
And No. 9's probably close to as strong.

280
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,060
So...

281
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,680
I've gotta handle 'em myself.

282
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,990
<i>He really is amazing.</i>

283
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,580
<i>He's not just trying to keep 
civilians safe, but us, too!</i>

284
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,640
Vice-Captain!

285
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,480
I'll do my best to be 
able to help in the fight.

286
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,310
Don't get so cocky, fool!

287
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,180
I don't expect a guy 
with 1% power to be helpful!

288
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,140
B-Bye...

289
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
But, well...

290
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,290
You can have 1% of my expectations.

291
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm heading back to the office.

292
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,130
You get to sleep.

293
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,160
Roger!

294
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,870
Initiate descent.
