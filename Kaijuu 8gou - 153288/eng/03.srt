1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,140
Whatever.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,730
I'll move it myself.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,310
<i>That suit...</i>

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,370
Wh-Who are you?

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,460
Examinee number 2016.

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,130
Kikoru Shinomiya.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,210
My hobby is murdering Kaiju.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,300
Remember that.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,460
<i>Shinomiya?</i>

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,970
Old man...

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,010
Did you know you smell like a Kaiju?

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,730
W-We work in Kaiju disposal!

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,770
What's a pair of disposal 
workers doing here?

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,400
Up you go...

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,400
Don't tell me he's got his own private suit!

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,910
Examinee number 2032. Kafka Hibino.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,790
Remember the name, kiddo.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,250
And he took my parking space 
while we were talking!

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,250
Stupid helpful butler!

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,970
I was expecting the exam to be a formality,

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,510
but this might actually be kind of fun.

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,220
I'm gonna show you up bad, Kafka Hibino.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,270
Let's go, Sebasu.

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,350
Of course.

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,780
Rumble

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,780
Rumble

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,780
Didn't take you long to use your powers.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,790
But wasn't it cool how I only transformed 
the part she couldn't see?

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,620
That's not the issue!

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,080
Hey, we heard a loud noise.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,170
Everything okay out here?

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,210
No, nothing! Everything's fine here!

33
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,550
Then get going.

34
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,840
Okay!

35
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,310
Next time you pull that stunt,
 I'm sending you home.

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,980
Okay...

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,060
<i>I gave up on this once...</i>

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>But this is my last chance 
to stand beside her!</i>

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,700
<i>This time, I ain't giving up!</i>

40
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,890
Episode 3    Revenge Match

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,970
<i>Huh? What the hell is this?</i>

42
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>I can't keep up at all!</i>

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,480
<i>I'd been keeping up my training out of habit!</i>

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,650
<i>And I do really hard 
physical work every day!</i>

45
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,980
The second stage of the exams has two parts,
a fitness test and an aptitude test.

46
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,860
Yeah.

47
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,530
The aptitude test is something 
you've either got or you don't.

48
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,910
Which means...

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,950
Yeah.

50
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,080
We want to get the best grades 
we can in the fitness test.

51
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,000
<i>Before, I used to be just below average!</i>

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,010
<i>But now...</i>

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,140
<i>Do you really get this weak 
when you turn thirty?</i>

54
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,730
<i>If I used my power,</i>

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,230
<i>I wonder if I could get to 
the front of the pack.</i>

56
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,780
<i>Damn it...</i>

57
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,150
<i>My body doesn't want to move at all!</i>

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,150
Kafka Hibino  
Fitness Exam Rank

59
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,410
219 out of 225

60
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,160
Kafka Hibino Fitness Exam Rank: 219 out of 225

61
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,410
Kikoru Shinomiya Fitness Exam Rank: 5 out of 225

62
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,540
Well, it didn't take long to show you up.

63
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,630
Kafka Hibino.

64
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,380
Remember the name, kiddo.

65
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,300
Kiddo!

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,340
Kiddo!

67
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,060
Forget it! Forget my name right now!

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,020
I feel so much better.

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,320
You really didn't use 
your Kaiju power, did you?

70
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,950
Everybody's put 
in a lot of effort to get here.

71
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,330
It wouldn't be fair to use my power.

72
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,460
I thought it would be so cool 
to say that, but I should've used it!

73
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,210
It's been ages since I last tried this test!

74
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,960
I don't think that's the only 
reason you got the ranking you did.

75
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,090
Here are the applicants this year.

76
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,390
A lot look pretty interesting.

77
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,260
Not that you care about anything 
but killing Kaiju, I'm sure.

78
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,020
Continue.

79
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,810
I'll listen while I work.

80
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,810
Oh, that's rare.

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,900
The first person I've got my eye on is...

82
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,610
Haruichi Izumo.

83
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,160
Yeah. That's a good idea.

84
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,160
Graduated top of his class 
from Tokyo Neutralization University.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Haruichi Izumo

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Fitness Exam Rank      2nd

87
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,160
The most promising of this 
year's group of new graduates.

88
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,210
Then there's Iharu Furuhashi,

89
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,750
a powerhouse who was valedictorian 
at Hachioji Neutralization Technical College.

90
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,920
Iharu Furuhashi

91
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,920
Fitness Exam Rank     3rd

92
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,550
Yes!

93
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,260
Aoi Kaguragi, the rising star of
the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.

94
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,590
Aoi Kaguragi

95
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,590
Fitness Exam Rank      1st

96
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,100
He turned down a sure spot in the 
JGSDF elite to come to the Defense Force.

97
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,020
And that's not all.

98
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,560
There're more applicants from neutralization
 universities and colleges than most years.

99
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,570
Normally, these people would be trying 
to become elite officers, not field agents.

100
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,990
No wonder they all seemed so damn good...

101
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,360
And the big one everybody's watching is...

102
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,700
Her.

103
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,830
Graduated from California
Neutralization at age 16.

104
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,250
She skipped grades and became
the youngest ever to do so.

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,580
They call her the greatest talent ever.

106
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,590
Kikoru Shinomiya

107
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,880
Kikoru Shinomiya.

108
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,340
<i>I'm gonna kick her ass.</i>

109
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,340
<i>Now, let's see if 
I've got any hope against her.</i>

110
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,430
<i>Let's see what you've got.</i>

111
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,020
It's a group of extremely skilled applicants, 
none more so than Kikoru Shinomiya.

112
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,350
So you...

113
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,020
So she's...

114
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,110
Oh?

115
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,070
Did you finally figure out 
how awesome I am, Kafka Hibino?

116
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,740
I had no idea you were so amazing!

117
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,530
Don't touch the mistress!

118
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,910
Who the hell is that guy?

119
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,290
Some groupie of Shinomiya's?

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,210
Second time you got
 shown up today, Kafka Hibino.

121
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,460
Let's see how many more times
 that'll happen today.

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,300
Well, I'm gonna show you up too!

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,060
I'm just about screwed, though.

124
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
There's still hope.

125
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,360
For the last two years, the second part of 
today's test has been Kaiju corpse disposal.

126
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,950
What?

127
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,620
They want to test knowledge of Kaiju, 
as well as your ability to work in a group.

128
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,200
And also make sure applicants realize that

129
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,910
there's more to the job 
than just killing Kaiju.

130
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,380
That's why I chose to work in disposal 
for my part-time job.

131
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,420
Okay!

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,300
Let's bet it all on the next part!

133
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,420
Right!

134
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,930
Area 2

135
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,930
Defense Force
Training Area Two

136
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,930
Wow.

137
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,930
It's huge.

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,060
I'm Third Division Vice-Captain Hoshina.

139
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,060
I'm the head of the second 
stage exam committee this year.

140
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,690
Third Division
Vice-Captain
Soshiro Hoshina

141
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,060
You'll be doing your aptitude test
here in this area.

142
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,450
Your task in this area will be 
to find Kaiju and...

143
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,950
<i>Dispose of their bodies!</i>

144
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,910
Neutralize them!

145
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,670
<i>Neutralize...</i>

146
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,630
<i>...them?</i>

147
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,290
What happened to disposing 
of their bodies, Ichikawa-san?

148
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,880
I just said that's what it was 
for the past two years!

149
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,130
I'm disappointed too!

150
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,010
But we can't send you in empty-handed,

151
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,760
so you'll be wearing these.

152
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,890
So this is Izumo Tech gear, huh?

153
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,600
The G-X4552, huh?

154
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,860
<i>What is this?</i>

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,730
<i>Wow...</i>

156
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,860
<i>It's pressing itself up against my body...</i>

157
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,620
<i>Body measurements 
and shape adjustment complete.</i>

158
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,660
<i>Kaiju muscle fibers operating normally.</i>

159
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,620
<i>It's becoming one with my body...</i>

160
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,420
<i>I can feel my muscles getting stronger!</i>

161
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,000
<i>It's hot...</i>

162
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,050
<i>So this is...</i>

163
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,260
<i>This is a Defense Force Kaiju combat suit.</i>

164
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,010
<i>It's made from organic 
material taken from Kaiju,</i>

165
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,890
<i>and massively multiplies 
the combat power of its wearer.</i>

166
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,270
<i>For now, there's no better weapon
 you have against the Kaiju.</i>

167
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,110
I'll start measuring the unleashed combat power
of the ones who have their suits on.

168
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,110
Third Division Operator

169
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,110
Konomi Okonogi

170
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,730
Understood.

171
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,900
<i>Reno Ichikawa. Unleashed combat power, 8%.</i>

172
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,370
<i>Haruichi Izumo, 18%.</i>

173
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,790
Sounds about right, I guess.

174
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,200
<i>Aoi Kaguragi, 15%.</i>

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,160
Understood.

176
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
<i>Iharu Furuhashi, 14%.</i>

177
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,960
What?

178
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,760
<i>Unleashed combat power indicates
how much of the suit's power you've drawn out.</i>

179
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,930
<i>Even after training, 
it's usually around 20%.</i>

180
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,390
We're lucky to get one 
applicant a year above 10%.

181
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,020
This year might be a bumper crop 
like we've never seen before.

182
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,770
Seriously?

183
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,690
Kikoru Shinomiya...

184
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,280
Unleashed combat power, 46%!

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
<i>She's already at the level 
of a platoon leader.</i>

186
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,790
The greatest talent in history...

187
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,870
This has to be a record for anybody 
who hasn't officially joined yet...

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,290
Just 8%...

189
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,510
<i>Oh, there's no reason 
to get down, Ichikawa-kun.</i>

190
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,550
If you get an 8% on your 
first time, you did well.

191
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,220
Honestly, if you don't have a zero 
at this point, you pass.

192
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,770
And I've never even seen a zero!

193
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,770
<i>Grr!</i>

194
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,230
Kafka Hibino...

195
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,770
Unleashed combat power, 0%!

196
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,020
What's wrong with him?

197
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,530
Wow, he's my first zero!

198
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,070
Huh? Are the measurements wrong?

199
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,410
Just give me a little more time!

200
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,450
I'm trying to squeeze it out!

201
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,950
You're not trying to take a dump!

202
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,210
You can't squeeze it out!

203
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,540
Wow, the old guy is hilarious!

204
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,000
I like him!

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
He probably won't pass, though.

206
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Take your proctoring job seriously!

207
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,840
<i>Why?</i>

208
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,430
<i>Damn it! There's got to be some trick!</i>

209
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,140
<i>I need to figure it out 
before the exam ends!</i>

210
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,020
<i>You're pissing me off, Hibino Kafka.</i>

211
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,560
<i>Show the power I saw 
in the parking lot already!</i>

212
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,520
<i>The exam's almost over!</i>

213
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,360
Okay, now that you're all in your suits...

214
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,490
Let's start the final test.

215
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,310
Defense Force Screening Exam Final Test

216
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,310
<i>I'll explain the test.</i>

217
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,770
<i>Your targets are a Honju and 36 Yoju</i>

218
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,860
<i>that have been placed throughout 
the urban training area.</i>

219
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,990
<i>These Kaiju caused sixteen 
fatalities in Hachioji last year.</i>

220
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,580
<i>We captured them alive 
to serve as training aids.</i>

221
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,500
<i>You're going to fight them 
with anti-Kaiju weapons.</i>

222
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,800
<i>You'll all be tracked with a drone 
that will monitor your actions.</i>

223
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,670
If we decide your life is in danger,

224
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,890
we'll remotely activate 
the shield on your suit,

225
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,720
<i>but be aware this will mean you fail.</i>

226
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,060
<i>To be honest, I can't guarantee 
you'll survive this next part.</i>

227
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,610
Only if you're willing 
to accept that, then...

228
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,190
<i>Go.</i>

229
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,200
What the hell?

230
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,050
Yoju 12 down.

231
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,800
Yoju 03 down.

232
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,760
Wow...

233
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,680
Damn it! Let's get going too!

234
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,980
Don't fall behind, Ichikawa!

235
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,730
That's my line!

236
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,900
This equipment is incredibly heavy 
without the suit helping you!

237
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,440
Only I, the zero, can understand this!

238
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,240
Don't make it sound cool!

239
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,200
But what do we do?

240
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,950
We don't have that kind of offensive power.

241
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,200
<i>Oh, I forgot.</i>

242
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,170
Captain Mina Ashiro is here 
for the test as well.

243
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,750
Do your best to look good for her.

244
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,630
Let's see who can be 
a cooler Defense Force officer!

245
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,550
<i>That's right...</i>

246
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,890
<i>Who cares if I'm a zero?</i>

247
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,060
<i>Calm down. This is your last chance.</i>

248
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,230
Ichikawa.

249
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,070
Why are the examining officers 
following us all with drones?

250
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,110
True... If all they cared about 
was how many Kaiju you killed,

251
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,450
they could just track 
that number with sensors.

252
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,570
Yup.

253
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,580
They're testing our abilities, 
but also how we can adapt to the situation.

254
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,540
Which means since we lack that kind of 
offensive capability, we should...

255
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,750
Yup!

256
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,220
Support all the attackers as best we can!

257
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,050
Right!

258
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,510
Damn it!

259
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,930
Senpai! Engagement to our right!

260
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,390
Okay! Go around from the side
and provide support!

261
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,910
<i>Those hooves...</i>

262
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,080
<i>I know this guy!</i>

263
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,700
<i>The one we did a joint 
disposal of with Iida Cleaners!</i>

264
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,080
<i>So that's why they included 
these in our equipment...</i>

265
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,840
Eat this!

266
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,140
A stun grenade?

267
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,440
It's got weak eyesight 
but incredibly good hearing!

268
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,940
Once you've deafened them, 
they're easy targets!

269
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,230
The stomach!

270
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,910
The skin on its stomach 
is weaker than most Kaiju!

271
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,700
Aim for the stomach!

272
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,950
What?

273
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,380
Thanks for the support, Shinomiya groupie!

274
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,590
I am not a groupie!

275
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,270
We did it, Senpai!

276
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,780
Yeah, we've taken apart more 
Kaiju bodies than we can count!

277
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,530
We know you guys inside and out!

278
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,030
<i>I can do this!</i>

279
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,620
<i>I don't have to use my Kaiju power!</i>

280
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,540
<i>I'll make up for all my screw-ups!</i>

281
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,460
I'll throw the next one!

282
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,040
Let's keep it up!

283
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,390
Another one?

284
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,020
Senpai!

285
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,400
Area Delta, Number 2032 injured.

286
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,320
Irregularities detected in vitals. 
He's unable to continue combat.

287
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,650
Yoju 23 is continuing to approach.

288
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,650
Prepare the remote shield.

289
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
Oww...

290
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,410
<i>Crap.</i>

291
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,660
<i>They're gonna put the shield up...</i>

292
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,960
...but be aware this will mean you fail.

293
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,340
<i>Stand up...</i>

294
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,170
<i>She's...</i>

295
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,050
<i>She's watching!</i>

296
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,510
<i>I can't embarrass myself 
in front of her anymore!</i>

297
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,930
Activating remote shield!

298
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,770
<i>Figured he'd be the first to drop out.</i>

299
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,730
<i>He was a funny guy... Too bad.</i>

300
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,500
That's the third time, Kafka Hibino.

301
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,300
When I'm on the battlefield, 
nobody gets to quit.

302
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,590
Kikoru! You saved me!

303
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,800
I'll go defeat the rest of them,

304
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,260
so you just lie on the ground like a loser.

305
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,270
She's going after the main target?

306
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,730
I'll take it out first!

307
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Better pay attention!

308
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,320
She's so much more powerful!

309
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,410
Is that really the same equipment we've got?

310
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,200
So your unleashed combat power makes 
that much of a difference, huh?

311
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,790
Damn it... I'll go too!

312
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,450
Senpai!

313
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,620
<i>It's broken?</i>

314
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,960
<i>I can't stand up!</i>

315
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,500
<i>2032, can you hear me?</i>

316
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,760
<i>This is Hoshina in the operation room.</i>

317
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,380
We're seeing irregularities in your vitals.

318
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,640
Multiple fractures, probably.

319
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,390
Possibly organ damage.

320
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,190
No...

321
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,730
<i>Do I have to give up?</i>

322
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,900
<i>No... while there's still a chance, I'll...</i>

323
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,080
<i>I'll never be able to stand by her side...</i>

324
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,260
<i>It's always the ones with talent who pass...</i>

325
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,850
As the exam proctor, 
I recommend you drop out.

326
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,980
Even those shields aren't perfect.

327
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,570
I'm the one who decides if I give up or not.

328
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,660
Senpai.

329
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,580
I'm too old for dreams...

330
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,590
I know I look like an idiot, but...

331
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,260
I've decided to bet my 
whole life up to this point

332
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,180
and chase my dreams again!

333
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,060
This time...

334
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,110
This time, I'm not giving up, no matter what!
