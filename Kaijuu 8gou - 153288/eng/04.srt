1
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,650
This time, I'm not giving up, no matter what!

2
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,200
Episode 4      Fortitude 9.8

3
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,120
Oww...

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,030
Senpai, are you okay?

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,120
See? I can still stand!

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,290
He just stood up on his broken leg, right?

7
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,840
Well, if that's your choice.

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,760
<i>If I think it looks bad, I'm turning 
the remote shield on, okay?</i>

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Fine by me!

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,140
Ichikawa, don't worry about me. Go on.

11
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,440
We had a deal, right?

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,510
If something happens to me, you can...

13
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,030
I'll back you up.

14
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,830
Let's do the best we can.

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,430
Ichikawa...

16
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,080
<i>That's just who you are, isn't it?</i>

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,910
All right, if you insist!

18
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,120
Are these guys for real?

19
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,430
Let's go, Ichikawa!

20
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,720
By our powers combined!

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,260
Everyone's staring at me, 
and I'm really embarrassed!

22
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,500
You can be our legs!

23
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,510
Use the suit's power to help you!

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,400
The broken bone hurts like hell, but...

25
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,270
Use all your knowledge to handle attacking!

26
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,520
Right!

27
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,300
C-Can we just pass these guys?

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,580
They'll be comic relief!

29
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,700
Take your job seriously!

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,460
Follow Kikoru and don't worry about me!

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,650
Hurry!

32
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,320
Got it!

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,170
Hang on tight!

34
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,170
<i>He's so damn fast!</i>

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,230
I'm gonna get there first!

36
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,000
Eat my dust.

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,350
Get ready so you can support
 her once we catch up!

38
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,180
Right! Leave it to me!

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,080
She's not even letting us help her, huh?

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Number 2016 has taken down 
the last Yoju in Area Delta,

41
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,880
and is now engaging the Honju!

42
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,150
Last one.

43
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,890
Th-The Honju has been destroyed.

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
<i>The final stage of the exam is complete!</i>

45
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,530
<i>Recovering drones.</i>

46
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,110
<i>Good work, everyone.</i>

47
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,170
That girl is just too goddamn fast!

48
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,170
Combination

49
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,170
Undone

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,980
While we bring back the drones, 
we also need to send medics for the injured.

51
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,720
Right, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
Huh? Oh.

53
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,840
<i>That was even faster than I thought.</i>

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
<i>It was so much work to set this all up, too.</i>

55
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,720
Kikoru Shinomiya's even more 
powerful than the rumors say.

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,360
<i>So she's enough to catch even your eye, huh?</i>

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,480
I'd imagined we'd see 
about thirty people drop out.

58
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,610
But nobody did.

59
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,400
And with only minimal injuries.

60
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,280
And it's clearly all thanks to her.

61
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,810
That's what you'd expect to see 
from Director Shinomiya's daughter.

62
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,720
She'll be a big shot in the Defense Force
 someday, that's for sure.

63
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,350
And a ray of hope for this country.

64
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,190
I was perfect, wasn't I, Daddy?

65
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,200
Now, time to go back and laugh 
at Kafka Hibino a fourth time...

66
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,210
Kikoru Shinomiya was every bit 
the monster everybody said she was, right?

67
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,330
Yeah.

68
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,080
She sure showed me up, 
just like she said she would.

69
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,360
But thanks to her, we made it to the end.

70
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
Now we just wait for the results.

71
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,370
Yes...

72
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,840
What?

73
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,400
What's going on?

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,360
Senpai, let's get out of here!

75
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,990
<i>I was barely able to protect my heart by
 focusing my entire shield on a single point...</i>

76
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
<i>I can still fight!</i>

77
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,840
What the hell are you?

78
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,840
You're still moving?

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,600
<i>It can </i>talk<i>?!</i>

80
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,000
What's going on with that skin of yours?

81
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,520
There, there. I'll let you handle this.

82
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,520
<i>It's a Kaiju, but it's intelligent!</i>

83
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,940
<i>What's going on?</i>

84
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,020
Die!

85
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,280
Make sure you chew before you swallow.

86
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,530
Something's wrong!

87
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,830
Abnormalities detected in 2016's vitals!

88
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,200
What's going on? What's happening out there?

89
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,670
I don't know!

90
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,000
But we're picking up live signals 
from the Kaiju they already killed!

91
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,280
What?

92
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,200
Those Kaiju shouldn't be able to 
come back to life like that...

93
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,720
We have an estimated fortitude 
for the revived Honju!

94
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,900
It's 6.4!

95
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,330
<i>It's more powerful now?</i>

96
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,980
<i>You'd need a whole company to handle that.</i>

97
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,190
<i>The only ones here capable of taking 
that thing down fast would be...</i>

98
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,860
Activate remote shields for all examinees.

99
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,520
Yes, ma'am!

100
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,950
Send back some of the drones 
and get me a camera feed.

101
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,950
Hoshina, we're heading out there.

102
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,450
<i>...me or her.</i>

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,750
Roger.

104
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,150
<i>Emergency. Emergency.</i>

105
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,300
<i>Examinees are to immediately 
evacuate to the nearest shelter.</i>

106
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,180
<i>I say again: examinees are to immediately 
evacuate to the nearest shelter.</i>

107
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,470
<i>Evacuate?</i>

108
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,090
<i>I can't evacuate...</i>

109
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,100
<i>If somebody doesn't stop this thing,</i>

110
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,100
<i>lots of people will die!</i>

111
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,080
<i>Stop the bleeding with Kaiju muscle fibers.</i>

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,300
<i>I can still move. I can still fight!</i>

113
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,870
<i>When I'm on the battlefield...</i>

114
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,110
<i>Nobody dies!</i>

115
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,030
Be perfect, for the sake 
of this nation's future!

116
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,200
I need to be perfect!

117
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,230
I won't lose...

118
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,720
Kikoru-chan, you're amazing!

119
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,090
Your name's at the very top!

120
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,980
Kikoru Shinomiya 
 Kagari Tojo 
 Ryota Tokiwa 
 Kazuma Miyakawa 
 Haruka Kobayashi 
 Jin Saito

121
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,980
Tokyo Neutralization Middle School Acceptance List

122
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,980
That means you're number one, right?

123
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,560
Yes! I was the top scorer!

124
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,430
Wow!

125
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,330
Risa.

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,990
Daddy!

127
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,080
Congratulations on passing, Risa.

128
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,440
Don't pat me on the head like that, 
Daddy! It's embarrassing!

129
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,350
I'll buy you that present, 
just like I promised.

130
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,170
Really? Hooray!

131
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,700
Bye, Kikoru-chan!

132
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,710
Let's go get yakiniku 
to celebrate your hard work!

133
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,820
I told you there was nothing to worry about.

134
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,980
I always had faith in you, son!

135
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,560
Kikoru-sama.

136
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,640
The master will be home today.

137
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm sure he'll be quite pleased.

138
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,480
Yeah!

139
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
You got the top score?

140
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,360
Of course you did. Who cares?

141
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,000
Rejoicing over a single success will 
only lead to failure next time.

142
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,410
Get ready for your next goal immediately.

143
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Kikoru.

144
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,040
Always be perfect, 
for the sake of this nation's future!

145
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,440
And for your late mother's sake, as well.

146
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,190
Yes, sir...

147
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,390
<i>I won't lose!</i>

148
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,140
Never stop moving forward!

149
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,760
<i>I can still fight!</i>

150
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,720
Never let anyone be better than you!

151
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,550
<i>Even with one arm, 
as long as it can move, I can...</i>

152
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,120
Be more powerful than anyone 
else on the battlefield!

153
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,770
<i>I can still fight!</i>

154
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,870
<i>No...</i>

155
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,760
Honju sighted!

156
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,070
Kikoru Shinomiya is nearby, and injured!

157
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,840
The Honju's severed offensive 
uniorgan has regenerated!

158
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,350
It's condensing energy for an attack!

159
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,650
<i>Crap...</i>

160
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,980
<i>Will we make it in time?</i>

161
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,530
<i>I'm done for...</i>

162
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,670
I'm sorry, Daddy.

163
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,760
I couldn't be perfect.

164
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,690
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,050
You did a great job, Kikoru!

166
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,980
What are you doing here?

167
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,490
Because you worked so hard, 
everybody was able to evacuate!

168
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,920
Now leave the rest to me!

169
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,360
What the hell was that explosion?

170
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,430
Damn it!

171
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,340
Get a move on!

172
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,520
Get your asses into the shelter!

173
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,290
A signal flare?

174
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,880
You can run there, right?

175
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,940
Y-Yeah.

176
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
He's guiding our evacuation, huh?

177
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,900
That's why he's the JSDF's rising star!

178
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,150
<i>Kafka-senpai...</i>

179
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,900
<i>Emergency.</i>

180
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,330
<i>Examinees are to immediately
 evacuate to the nearest shelter.</i>

181
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,910
Senpai, let's get out of here!

182
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,700
The Honju came back to life!

183
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,090
Don't head that way!

184
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,710
Shinomiya is fighting it right now!

185
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,230
I told HQ!

186
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,880
Everyone get out of here! That's an order!

187
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,380
Senpai, you heard that, right?

188
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,680
He's already gone!

189
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,520
<i>He's not going to transform, right?</i>

190
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
<i>He's not, right?</i>

191
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,200
<i>If he turns into a Kaiju right now, 
he'll be killed for sure.</i>

192
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,370
<i>No, he'll do it!</i>

193
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,690
<i>At times like this, 
he doesn't hesitate at all...</i>

194
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,680
What?

195
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,210
What's going on?

196
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,320
You're a Kaiju?

197
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,060
Kikoru.

198
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,470
Please! Please!

199
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,780
Please don't tell 
the Defense Force about this!

200
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,710
Please!

201
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,640
I'll tell you more in a bit.

202
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,180
I only need a sec to kick this thing's ass.

203
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,810
So just relax and get some rest.

204
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,470
I'm detecting a mysterious ultra-powerful 
energy source near the Honju!

205
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,400
It might be a new Kaiju!

206
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,500
<i>Another one?</i>

207
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,480
<i>Do we have visual?</i>

208
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,030
The explosion knocked out our comms network.

209
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,480
We do not have visual.

210
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,000
Wait, is this number right?

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,680
Fortitude 9.8?

212
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,000
<i>Impossible.</i>

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,400
<i>The blast must've scrambled
the measurement system.</i>

214
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,410
R-Right?

215
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,430
Otherwise it'd be one of 
the most powerful Kaiju in history!

216
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,770
Sorry. I'm running out of time here.

217
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,320
So I'm cleaning you up...

218
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,790
with one punch!

219
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,080
Let's see you come back to life after <i>that</i>!

220
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,070
N-No! Just kidding!

221
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,100
Please don't come back to life!

222
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,080
Don't scare me like that!

223
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,680
Who is this guy?

224
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,510
<i>A Yoju?</i>

225
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,500
Looks like you'll be okay.

226
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,640
I'm glad you're safe!

227
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,000
But let me say one thing.

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,400
You can't put yourself in danger like that!

229
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,820
You too!

230
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,390
Ichikawa! What are you doing here?

231
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,090
You ran off while my back was turned,

232
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,440
and sure enough, 
I find you here, transformed!

233
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,390
I was thinking maybe I could 
just transform a part of my body.

234
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,680
But when I saw the Honju 
I was like, "No way!"

235
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,080
You need to be more careful!

236
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,350
Shinomiya!

237
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,320
Ashiro and Hoshina have 
arrived at the scene.

238
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,600
What is this?

239
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,100
What would you have to do to cause this?

240
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,800
I've seen this before somewhere...

241
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,900
Captain Ashiro, I can't 
find any of the examinees.

242
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,990
This is the operation room.

243
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,950
An additional three examinees 
have arrived at Shelter 6.

244
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,790
It's Kikoru Shinomiya, 
Reno Ichikawa, and Kafka Hibino.

245
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,870
They're safe, huh?

246
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,640
All examinees are now accounted for.

247
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,670
<i>Roger.</i>

248
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,420
I'll admit that Kikoru Shinomiya is strong,

249
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,500
but she can't have done this...

250
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,400
The Kaiju coming back to life, 
and then this blast zone...

251
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,040
There's a lot we don't understand.

252
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,930
Bring in an investigation unit 
and a disposal unit.

253
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,730
Hoshina and I will wipe out 
the remaining Yoju.

254
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,620
Roger.

255
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,900
<i>It's like what we saw three months ago...</i>

256
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,710
<i>Are they linked in some way?</i>

257
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,860
I'm glad to see you're not 
as badly hurt as I thought.

258
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,670
I'm back in the hospital...

259
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,870
Shinomiya's condition is looking good, too.

260
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,170
They're using the Defense Force's
 best tech to treat her, supposedly.

261
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,460
Why does she get better treatment?
Let me in on that!

262
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,410
Oww!

263
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,180
'Cause you only have a few fractures.

264
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,200
It was all over so fast.

265
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
It's been ages since I went up
against people so incredible,

266
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,350
and it reminded me...

267
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,480
Chasing your dreams means 
there's always someone out there

268
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,740
who's beating you 
at the thing you care about most.

269
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,350
Senpai...

270
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,240
But it's also so exciting 
that you don't really care!

271
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,160
It helped me remember that!

272
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,040
And I have you to thank for encouraging me.

273
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,730
Thanks, Ichikawa.

274
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,550
Captain Ashiro?

275
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,710
What are you doing here?

276
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,470
I'm told you carried 
Shinomiya to the shelter.

277
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,160
Thank you for your help in rescuing her.

278
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,730
Goodbye.

279
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,840
Mi...

280
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,430
<i>No, not yet.</i>

281
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,570
<i>I'll talk to her after I become an officer!</i>

282
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
<i>Just watch me, Mina!</i>

283
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,840
Daddy, I couldn't be perfect...

284
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,090
I...

285
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,990
Daddy?

286
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,430
Oh, just stay there.

287
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Vice-Captain Hoshina.

288
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,240
We dealt with all the Kaiju that revived.

289
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,120
Fortunately, nobody was killed

290
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,640
thanks to you taking down the Honju.

291
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,080
Is that not what happened?

292
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,860
I'm glad you're safe!

293
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,750
No, I defeated that Kaiju.

294
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,270
Kokubunji    Tokyo

295
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,270
<i>During a Defense Force
selection exam,</i>

296
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,360
<i>an unusual incident took place,
with Kaiju suddenly coming back to life...</i>

297
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,210
<i>There were several injuries during 
the incident, but zero fatalities.</i>

298

299
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,070
<i>The Kaiju that came back to life

300
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,880
Zero? Zero?

301
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,820
<i>of the Third Division 
who were present during the exam...</i>

302
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,810
No, no, no. No way there were zero.

303
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,340
Or is one of these 
"Captain" people that strong?

304
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,750
<i>Kaiju No. 8 remains at large,</i>

305
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,330

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,330
No. 8? What?

307
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,630
Um... this is how you answer a phone, right?

308
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,840
<i>Hey, where've you been?</i>

309
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,880
<i>Breaktime's over, you know.</i>

310
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,730
Uh...

311
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,100
<i>Don't you "uh" me. Get back here.</i>

312
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,170
Right.

313
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,960
I'll be right back.

314
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,860
Sheesh. Humans are so particular about time.

315
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,870
Sorry, sorry.

316
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,080
I had a bad case of diarrhea.

317
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,530
You had us all worried, you know?

318
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,580
Tell someone where you're going 
before you hole up in the toilets, new kid.

319
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,650
Sorry, Toku-san.

320
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,020
Hey, I heard there was 
an accident at the exam site.

321
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,890
Seriously?

322
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,540
Oops.

323
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,680
Are Kafka and Ichikawa okay?

324
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,480
How careless of me.
