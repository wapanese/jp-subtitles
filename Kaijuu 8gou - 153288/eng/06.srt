Okonogi, status report.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,400
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,030
Evacuation of the surrounding 
area began at 0245.

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,480
<i>The epicenter is located in Sagamihara.</i>

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>Citizens in the surrounding area are asked 
to follow JSDF orders and evacuate.</i>

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,700
<i>I repeat...</i>

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,740
Why Sagamihara?

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,600
Is the Defense Force here yet?

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,630
Mommy, I gotta go to the bathroom!

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,200
Stay calm, everyone!

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,530
The next buses will arrive soon!

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,530
Stay calm and evacuate!

16

Kaiju Evacuation

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,340
There's room on the buses for everyone!

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,340
Are we working with the JSDF?

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,210
A JSDF artillery regiment command post

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,230
0305 Hours   JSDF Artillery Regiment Command Post

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,230
is being constructed 
at the Leon Mall parking lot.

22
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,550
Deploying FO.

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,030
Observation post constructed.

24
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,810
Sitrep on the evacuation progress.

25
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,690
And the Honju?

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,710
It first appeared at Kannawa Fault

27
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,030
and moved underground 
while growing larger.

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,280
It's believed to have surfaced 
because it's entered its breeding phase.

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,450
The appearance of the Honju has been followed
by the appearance of a large number of Yoju.

30
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,550
Come on, how many of these things are there?

31
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,420
Fortunately, the neutralization area
 isn't that far away.

32
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,770
If we want to minimize damage 
to the surrounding area,

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,130
our best option is to defeat the Honju 
in the central Sector Bravo.

34
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,750
I'll handle the Honju.

35
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,640
Sector Echo will serve as the sniper point.

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
We'll be able to target the enemies 
from alongside Highway 16.

37
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,300
This operation will be designated 
as the Sagamihara Neutralization Operation.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,570
Best of luck to all of you.

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,700
It's time to go Kaiju hunting.

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,420
<i>Our first mission.</i>

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,520
<i>Kaiju No. 8. I still can't believe it...</i>

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>But don't disappoint me, Kafka Hibino.</i>

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,240
Vice-Captain, Senpai's about to throw up!

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,250
Sorry! I was so nervous, I ate too much food!

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,060
Normally, you get too nervous to eat!

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,600
Open a window! Now!

49
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
If you throw up, I'll kill you!

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,520
What's wrong with you, old dude?

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,000
Please don't kill me!

<i>And that's the Honju for this mission!</i>

Episode 6

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,670
Sagamihara Neutralization 
Operation at Daybreak

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,090
I'll brief you on the operation.

62
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,690
Captain Ashiro's unit will handle the Honju.

63
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,480
The problem is that
 it's creating a ton of Yoju.

64
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,170
This neutralization area is kept

65
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,680
deliberately clear of important infrastructure
and critical transportation routes.

66
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,530
Sector F    Ikaruga Platoon

67
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,080
Your job will be to make sure 
no Yoju escape from this area.

68
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,070
Sector J    Nakanoshima Platoon

69
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,210
It's an important job that determines 
how much damage is dealt,

70
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,490
how much it costs to rebuild from 
that damage, and how long it'll take.

71
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,750
Of course, any platoon with new 
recruits will be placed at the very rear.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,220
But that also means...

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,510
You're our last line of defense.

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Anybody got questions?

75
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,870
Good.

76
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,700
No matter how good your scores 
are during training,

77
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,940
that won't save a single life.

78
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,920
It's time, recruits. Show me 
what you can do on the battlefield.

79
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,410
All right, let's go!

80
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,100
Have fun out there, guys.

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,080
This is the JSDF Artillery

Thank you for your cooperation.

84
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,270
All platoons and all JSDF 
forces are ready to go.

85
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,200
Eight minutes until
 Captain Ashiro reaches her position.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,110
<i>It's time, right, Senpai?</i>

87
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,600
Yeah.

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,330
During this mission, 
I have to prove I can do the job.

89
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,430
You're never gonna be 
a full officer at this rate.

90
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,860
You'll be fired in three months.

91
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,850
I won't get another shot.

92
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,050
<i>Nervousness. Panic.</i>

93
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm feeling all kinds of pressure.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,530
But for some reason...

95
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,340
I'm also incredibly excited!

96
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,670
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

97
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>This is the job you've always wanted.</i>

98
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,720
<i>Senpai.</i>

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,610
Let's make sure our first mission
 is a big success!

100
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,660
Right!

101
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,570
<i>Yoju sighted in Sector Echo!</i>

102
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,870
They're here.

103
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,280
Time to go, Kikoru.

104
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,720
Why are you telling me what to do?

105
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,410
Don't die out there, Ichikawa!

106
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,840
<i>You too, Senpai!</i>

107
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,160
Okay!

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,080
Time to make my first mission a big success!

109
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,030
Captain Ashiro has reached the sniper point.

110
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,730
Please lure the Honju to Sector Bravo 
and provide fire support.

111
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,650
<i>Roger that.</i>

112
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,380
<i>JSDF Artillery Regiment Command Post,</i>

113
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,040
<i>now initiating fire support 
for the Defense Force.</i>

114
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,240
Time for your big debut.

115
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,870
Start by showing your superiors
 just how damn good you really are.

116
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,500
<i>It's begun.</i>

117
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,760
<i>But it's not like the exam.</i>

118
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,040
<i>I feel strangely calm...</i>

119
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,120
<i>I can tell the suit is helping me.</i>

120
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,800
<i>Unleashing combat power!</i>

121
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,790
You're too far out in front!

122
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,520
Your combat power is 1%, 
so stay in the rear!

123
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,750
Sheesh.

124
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,240
Why do we have to babysit the new kids?

125
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,090
Can't you guys just go someplace
 you won't get in our way and watch?

126
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,330
Listen up!

127
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,360
We don't know the enemy's vulnerable points.

128
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,210
Play it safe until we get info 
from the guys on the front line.

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,220
Roger that.

130
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll play it safe and blast anything 
that could be a weak point.

131
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
<i>What the hell?</i>

132
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,060
<i>That's not the kind of firepower
you see from a rookie!</i>

133
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,340
<i>So that's the power of Kikoru Shinomiya.</i>

134
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,120
Kikoru...

135
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,740
Nice!

136
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,720
What else would you expect from me?

137
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,920
<i>Abnormal vital signs detected.</i>

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
<i>Rapid increase in heart rate.</i>

139
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,750
You don't need to tell me that!

140
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,630
Sector F

141
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,700
There we go!

142
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,230
Two legs down. Finish it!

143
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Well done, Furuhashi!

144
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,750
There we go!

145
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,080
You see that, Reno?

146
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,120
Did you do that by yourself?

147
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,830
Yes.

148
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,050
I swapped out the burst rounds 
in my gun for freeze rounds.

149
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,840
I think it's a better fit for my style.

150
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,760
I can slow down the enemy while I fight.

151
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,850
I think, once I get the hang of this, 
I'll be even better at hunting Kaiju.

152
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,510
<i>I'm not there yet.</i>

153
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,510
<i>I need to get stronger.</i>

154
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,120
<i>So Senpai won't have to transform!</i>

155
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,270
Sector J

156
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,800
They're so damn speedy!

157
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,050
Wh-What's the deal with this year's recruits?

158
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,870
Platoon Leader Nakanoshima!

159
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,460
What's going on with those guys? 
I'm losing my self-confidence here!

160
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,290
Hmm, I knew it was 
a good batch this year,

161
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,800
but not <i>this</i> good.

162
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,050
I've taken down six already.

163
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,610
You're going a little slow, 
aren't you, Haruichi?

164
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,910
Right, right.

165
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,110
Don't forget that you only got four 
of those six 'cause I backed you up.

166
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,200
One's a wild child. 
One's the clean-cut type.

167
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,370
<i>Cougar Mode</i>

168
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,370
Yeah, it's a good year.

169
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,000
You're talking about their looks?

170
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,670
Vice-Captain Hoshina told me 
there are a few really good ones.

171
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,620
But that's not all.

172
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,160
The average unleashed combat power of
the new recruits is higher than in most years.

173
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,120
The guys at the top are motivating 
the others to do better.

174
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,680
<i>Number eight!</i>

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,090
<i>That was totally my kill!</i>

176
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,730
Our observation teams have verified 
that Sector Juliet is clear of Yoju.

177
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,010
All Yoju have been defeated.

178
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,170
<i>The kill reports keep coming.</i>

179
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,520
<i>They're all amazing!</i>

180
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,030
<i>Ikaruga Platoon will advance, 
with Ichikawa and Furuhashi at the forefront.</i>

181
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,130
Ichikawa and Iharu, too?

182
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,310
<i>This is no good.</i>

183
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,530
<i>Everyone's working so hard, 
and I'm just slowing them down.</i>

184
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,000
<i>Isn't there anything I can do?</i>

185
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,960
<i>Wait, didn't he just say...</i>

186
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,280
Listen up!

187
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,630
We don't know the enemy's vulnerable points.

188
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,340
Play it safe until we get info 
from the guys on the front line.

189
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,260
<i>I'll fight with my own weapons!</i>

190
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,690
Senpai, look!

191
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,600
What the hell's he doing?

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,850
<i>Wow, even with just 1%,</i>

193
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,510
<i>the suit makes it easy 
to dismantle their bodies.</i>

194
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,990
<i>If they could mass-produce these things,</i>

195
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,400
<i>it'd be nice if they gave some 
to the cleanup industry.</i>

196
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,300
<i>This is a pretty standard structure 
for fungal-type Kaiju,</i>

197
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,510
<i>but the core's not where it usually is.</i>

198
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,420
<i>Where is it?</i>

199
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
<i>If it's not here, then maybe over there?</i>

200
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,540
<i>Wait a second...</i>

201
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,210
<i>Vice-Captain Hoshina, 
I've located the Yoju core.</i>

202
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:52,930
What?

203
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,930
It's at the base of the neck,

204
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,260
but there are hard, fibrous muscles on top 
of it that serve as its backbone.

205
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,770
Officers with weaker attack power
might need to hit them from the sides.

206
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,960
<i>And there's one more thing. 
This one's important.</i>

207
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,280
The Yoju have reproductive organs too.

208
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,930
The white, bumpy organs near their rears.

209
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,220
If we don't destroy those organs, 
their corpses might spawn new Yoju.

210
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,800
<i>Kafka.</i>

211
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,630
That's some damn fine work.

212
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,910
<i>Okonogi-chan, share that news 
with the rest of the team.</i>

213
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,770
Roger that.

214
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,200
Sharing information on Yoju core 
and reproductive organs with all officers.

215
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,610
<i>I'm sure you picked up some 
of that at your last job,</i>

216
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,170
<i>but I guess your studying really paid off.</i>

217
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,010
<i>Well done.</i>

218
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,590
<i>I helped the Defense Force!</i>

219
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,480
I'll go neutralize all the corpses
 of the defeated Yoju!

220
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,960
<i>I'll do everything I can, no matter 
what it is, until I reach Mina's side!</i>

221
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,890
What?

222
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,880
<i>Looks like they've started for the day too.</i>

223
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,010
Honju has reached the designated 
combat initiation point.

224
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,260
JSDF ground and air forces 
are requested to withdraw.

225
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,320
The Defense Force will initiate 
an attack on the Honju's legs.

226
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Please keep it pinned 
down as long as you can.

227
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,540
Target sighted.

228
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,600
Compensation for Coriolis force, 
gravitational force complete.

229
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,360
No additional targets in area.

230
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,490
One round loaded and ready to fire.

231
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,550
<i>Roger.</i>

232
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,800
<i>All conditions met for firing to commence.</i>

233
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,230
<i>You are cleared to fire.</i>

234
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,210
Let's see who can be 
a cooler Defense Force officer!

235
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,200
Kafka-kun...

236
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,130
This is who I am right now.

237
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,950
<i>Unleashed combat power, 96%.</i>

238
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,450
Watch this one closely, Kafka.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,990
Fire.

240
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,540
<i>That's the power of the person 
you're trying to stand beside.</i>

241
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,260
Second round loaded and ready to fire.

242
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,040
<i>Roger.</i>

243
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,310
<i>You are cleared to fire.</i>

244
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>Honju vital signs have disappeared.</i>

245
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,480
<i>It's collapsing!</i>

246
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,980
Third round loaded and ready to fire.

247
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,250
<i>R-Roger.</i>

248
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,630
<i>You are cleared to fire.</i>

249
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,790
Honju has taken critical damage 
and has stopped moving entirely.

250
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,390
That's the captain for you.

251
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,630
<i>Fourth round loaded and ready to fire.</i>

252
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,150
<i>B-But the Honju is already down...</i>

253
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,140
Give the order.

254
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,070
<i>R-Roger.</i>

255
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,950
<i>Damn it!</i>

256
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,540
<i>It's totally different from when you look 
at it on TV or through binoculars!</i>

257
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,300
<i>She's incredible!</i>

258
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,330
Feel like giving up?

259
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,840
Standing by her side means matching 
that kind of strength.

260
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,870
And can you do that, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

261
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,850
Not a chance!

262
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,400
Not a chance?!

263
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,030
My unleashed combat power isn't as good 
when it comes to the long-range guns,

264
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,780
so I'm not as capable of
 taking down the big boys as she is.

265
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,600
But when it comes to the smaller 
and mid-sized enemies...

266
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,450
Vice-Captain! Behind you!

267
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,250
I think I'm a bit better than she is.

268
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,920
<i>A katana?</i>

269
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,680
<i>It was so fast I couldn't see it at all!</i>

270
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,820
My family's been a clan of Kaiju-hunters 
since the days of the Muromachi period.

271
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,780
I'm much better at this stuff.

272
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,110
A captain and vice-captain are 
the force's most powerful members.

273
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,110
We each get special equipment 
tailored to our fighting styles.

274
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,190
<i>Hoshina, the Honju's down.</i>

275
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,000
Roger.

276
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,700
That's enough chatting. 
The real show's about to start.

277
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,940
But she just said she took down the Honju...

278
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,450
I told you during the briefing.

279
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,230
The problem is the countless Yoju it creates.

280
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,620
We killed the Honju, but the Yoju 
are still alive inside its corpse...

281
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Just like I thought.

282
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,470
Here they come.

283
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,320
...and are going to come swarming out.

284
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,280
All right, guys! We're wrapping up here.

285
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,670
Once we're done cleaning up the riff-raff,

286
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,860
we can all go home 
and have a yummy breakfast.

287
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,780
Cleaning up the riff-raff? 
He makes it sound so easy.

288
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,280
Wimpin' out already, recruits?

289
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,540
Looks like you need to work on your stamina!

290
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,360
All right, guys!

291
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,540
Let's show them that there's more to 
fighting than your unleashed combat power!

292
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,630
Right!

293
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,630
Hey, you two.

294
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,510
Platoon Leader Nakanoshima.

295
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,780
You're free to rest and let 
the veterans do the work, you know.

296
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,990
What'll it be?

297
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,710
We'll fight, obviously!

298
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,570
Deployed Officers Status

299
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,210
The new recruits are tired.

300
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,570
Their unleashed combat power 
and endurance are both falling.

301
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,450
It's a big neutralization to have 
for their first mission.

302
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,960
But if they can make it through this, 
it'll take them to the next level.

303
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,070
Most officers end their careers with

304
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,760
unleashed combat power
topping out at around 20% to 30%,

305
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,760
but a very small number of them will 
overcome that wall and become captains.

306
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,260
Right now, the only one of the new recruits 
to reach that level is Kikoru Shinomiya.

307
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,270
But there might be one more...

308
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,460
I think Reno Ichikawa
 might be up for it as well.

309
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,240
<i>Damn it.</i>

310
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,290
<i>I spent five years in technical 
college training every day!</i>

311
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,800
<i>Why can't I keep up with him?</i>

312
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,100
Iharu-kun.

313
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,720
I don't think there are any more Yoju here.

314
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,030
Yeah, looks like you're right.

315
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,550
<i>New Yoju entering Sector Foxtrot.</i>

316
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,920
They're here. Let's return 
to the front lines.

317
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,170
Right.

318
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,290
<i>Monster Sweeper</i>

319
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,320
<i>Monster Sweeper, Inc.?</i>

320
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>What's one of the cleaners doing out here?</i>

321
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,030
Hey, you didn't hear the alarm?

322
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,320
The cleanup crew 
won't be needed until later.

323
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,150
Aww, this one's no good either.

324
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,830
The reproductive organs I loaded 
them with have been destroyed.

325
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,690
How did they find out?

326
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Maybe there's somebody on the force
 who knows all about Kaiju?

327
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,710
You guys know anything?
