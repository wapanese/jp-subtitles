00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,120
...a report of our hypotheses.
This analysis is the result of work by the science team of the Defense Force Third Division, 
which specializes in neutralization missions. The information that forms the basis
 for these hypotheses and analyses was gathered by the 
Defense Force's intelligence teams, as well as cooperative civilian organizations.
STATUS OF PURSUIT
The Defense Force made attempts to gather more information to
 prevent further damage, but failed to discover the target. 
Yojo neutralization teams gathered at the hospital to form a pursuit force,
 expanding their search radius, but failed to discover the target.
The Defense Force designated this Kaiju a long-term neutralization target
 and gave it the designation "Kaiju No. 8." It was designated a nationwide pursuit target,
 and became the first Kaiju that the Defense Force ever failed to neutralize.
SECOND ENCOUNTER
The second encounter occurred during the Sagamihara Neutralization Operation
performed by the Third Division. After the defeat of the fungal-type Kaiju,
 the mission had shifted to neutralizing the remaining Yoju. At this point,
 communication was lost with several rookie officers. As biological monitoring systems
 went offline as well, their unit began to search for them. Members of the search party
 discovered two of the officers who were experiencing communication failures,
 as well as a humanoid Kaiju. Immediately afterwards, a mysterious shadow
 launched an attack at the officers, which struck the humanoid Kaiju instead.
 The mysterious shadow escaped. The humanoid-type, which remained, was identified as
 Kaiju No. 8 due to its physical description. An attempt was made to neutralize it,
 which failed. The unit recovered the two wounded officers, and another unit initiated
 a pursuit of Kaiju No. 8. It may possess the ability to enlarge the size of its entire body.
* Descriptions of a mouth large enough to swallow a person whole 
and octopus-like legs indicate that it may possess transformational abilities.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,450
Kaiju No. 8...

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,540
He felt... strangely human.

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,470
And then there's No. 9, which could
speak and disguise itself as a human.

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,010
What's happening to the Kaiju?

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,730
Vice-Captain!

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,360
I'll do my best to be 
able to help in the fight.

9
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,490
You can have 1% of my expectations.

10
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,200
I can't let him down!

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,330
Okay, I've finally taken the first step!

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,960
Time to get some sleep
 so I can be ready for tomorrow.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,210
Getting rest is part of the job, too...

14
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,930
Episode 9    Raid on Tachikawa Base

15
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,020
Operation room, what's going on?

16
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,070
We're seeing dozens of Kaiju inside the base!

17
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,530
It appears the Kaiju have
 attacked us from the air!

18
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,790
Estimated fortitudes 6.1, 6.3, 6.2, 6.5...

19
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,450
Each and every one of them is...

20
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,410
K-Kaiju!

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,330
...Honju class?!

22
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,060
This is Hoshina.

23
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,060
Captain Ashiro is away,
 so I'll be giving the orders here.

24
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,440
Anybody who's on night watch,
 take battle stations.

25
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,860
Get the off-duty officers here, too.

26
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,820
All hands, prepare for combat.

27
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,610
Roger!

28
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,570
<i>Lure as many as you can into the training area!</i>

29
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,950
<i>Make damn sure none of them get off the base!</i>

30
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,950
<i>But we're not hearing any reports
 of damage from outside the base...</i>

31
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,960
<i>That can't mean...</i>

32
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,750
<i>Are they after the base itself?</i>

33
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,880
What's going on?

34
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,760
The base...

35
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,470
is on fire!

36
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,680
Wyvern-type Kaiju?

37
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,850
Those things are bad news...

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,860
<i>Wyvern types?</i>

39
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,610
<i>But then... that means something's not right.</i>

40
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,490
Get anybody who uses a rifle
 together at the base's center.

41
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,450
We'll lure them in and shoot them down.

42
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,080
Roger!

43
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,710
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,750
Kafka! You're still alive, huh?

45
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,630
<i>Yes.</i>

46
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,590
But there's something wrong here.

47
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
Tell me.

48
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,090
You only see about a dozen or so
 wyvern-type Kaiju each year,

49
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,090
but there's always something
 they have in common.

50
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,060
They're always alone.

51
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,730
<i>But these guys showed up in a group!</i>

52
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,310
Yeah. Which can only mean one thing...

53
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,530
There's something out there that's got
 the power to make them swallow their pride,

54
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,780
and the intelligence to act
 with a goal in mind.

55
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,950
An incredibly powerful leader.

56
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,040
Target sighted.

57
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,670
I'm hangin' up, Kafka.

58
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,010
Are you the strongest human at this base?

59
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,560
<i>It can speak, too?</i>

60
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,430
The captain ain't here,

61
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
so yeah, I guess.

62
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,150
I see.

63
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,150
That settles it, then. You are my prey.

64
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,860
Honju's estimated fortitude
 calculations complete!

65
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,200
It's 8.3... That's Daikaiju class!

66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,410
Ikaruga, do you copy?

67
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,330
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

68
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,370
You command the fight against the Yoju.

69
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,540
Prioritize keeping them in the base
 and away from civilians,

70
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,250
and keeping the main building online.

71
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,210
<i>Roger!</i>

72
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,460
As for the Honju, I'm...

73
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,340
You dodged it?

74
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,800
You pass.

75
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,070
I'm gonna have to be the one to handle it.

76
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,650
Excellent.

77
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,860
Now... it's time.

78
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Let's begin your annihilation.

79
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,100
The Yoju are reacting to its cry...

80
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,560
So they <i>are</i> after this place.

81
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,270
<i>This thing's punches hit like a meteor strike!</i>

82
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,360
<i>One solid hit, and I'm a dead man.</i>

83
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,620
<i>And its skin is tougher than No. 8's!</i>

84
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,920
Fire!

85
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,130
It's unharmed?

86
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,380
Retreat!

87
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,350
Gunners, swap to oscillator rounds.

88
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,890
<i>Don't attack from the front!</i>

89
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,890
That voice... Hibino?

90
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,850
You need to attack their backs...

91
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,900
They're the same type that was reported in '03!

92
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,190
Senpai?

93
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,440
The old dude?

94
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,690
I was worried when
 I couldn't get a hold of you!

95
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,860
<i>Sorry, I was talking to the vice-captain.</i>

96
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,490
<i>Just hit the back, got it? The back!</i>

97
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,370
The front is easier to hit
 when they're in flight,

98
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,410
<i>but the skin's thick!</i>

99
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,700
The core should be near the back!

100
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,130
<i>The skin on the back is as thin as possible
 to help keep their weight down!</i>

101
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,380
Nice, Hibino!

102
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,260
Split up to run decoy in front
 while hitting the back!

103
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,880
Roger!

104
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,050
Get back.

105
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,760
I'll take the front.

106
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,690
I'll be the decoy.

107
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,650
Get behind it, Haruichi.

108
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,860
You owe me one for this!

109
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,620
<i>He's good.</i>

110
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,920
Combat power fully unleashed!

111
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,380
What?

112
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,340
<i>The Kaiju are working together?</i>

113
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,970
<i>It's no good! We can't get behind them!</i>

114
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,140
<i>We've failed as well!</i>

115
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,720
<i>Another Kaiju blocked us!</i>

116
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
That's impossible!

117
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,100
<i>What do we do?</i>

118
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,150
<i>If we can't get behind them, then how...</i>

119
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,570
<i>There's another way.</i>

120
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,520
Shinomiya?

121
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,230
What do you mean, another way?

122
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,040
I just...

123
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,170
use my unstoppable power...

124
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,020
to smash right through their front armor!

125
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,730
Tachikawa Base Underground Weapons Storage Room

126
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,190
A custom weapon? For me?

127
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,240
I thought you had to be a captain to get one.

128
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,950
Normally, yeah.

129
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,410
But we've decided
 it's worth making an exception.

130
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,370
The fortitude levels and numbers of Kaiju
 we're seeing this year are abnormal.

131
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,710
And, since you're the third
 most powerful officer on base,

132
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,790
we've decided to treat you
 as part of our main force.

133
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,220
Shinomiya, from now on,

134
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,390
you're our third strongest weapon
 after the captain and vice-captain...

135
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,600
It will be your job to annihilate the Kaiju.

136
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,860
Hits pretty hard, for a prototype.

137
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,860
One thing I don't like, though,

138
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,830
is that such an ugly weapon doesn't suit me.

139
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,950
Sh-She smashed through its front armor?

140
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,620
All right, you Kaiju...

141
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,290
Now that I'm on the battlefield...

142
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,050
it's over for you.

143
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,180
<i>The weapon is primarily made from</i>

144
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,270
<i>the uniorgan of the Honju that was
 neutralized in Shinagawa two years ago.</i>

145
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,110
Pull the trigger to turn on the power,
 and it'll release shock waves.

146
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,360
<i>Usage one...</i>

147
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,860
<i>Generating a shock wave behind you
 when taking an action.</i>

148
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Accelerate!

149
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,620
Squadron-Style Axe Technique
Number One: Falling Thunder!

150
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,720
<i>Usage two...</i>

151
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,800
<i>Unleashing a frontal shock wave on impact...</i>

152
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
for more power!

153
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,220
Number Two: Water Skimmer!

154
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,190
Wow...

155
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,560
What do you mean, it doesn't suit you?

156
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,990
It's perfect for your aggressive,
 overbearing personality.

157
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,240
Now, who's next?

158
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,950
Above me?

159
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,700
<i>Freeze rounds?!</i>

160
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,250
Reno...

161
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,960
Be careful, Shinomiya.
 They attack from the sky, too.

162
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,180
You aren't going anywhere!

163
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,810
<i>I'm impressed he can fight like that
 against Kaiju this strong.</i>

164
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,980
Number Three: Half Moon!

165
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,780
Did she get them?

166
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,240
<i>Reno.</i>

167
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,700
You can have the honor of helping me.

168
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,000
If you can keep up, that is.

169
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Sounds great to me.

170
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,840
All right, search the battlefield for openings
 and catch the enemy off guard!

171
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,300
You heard that, right?

172
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,510
Yeah.

173
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,720
A guerrilla squad of just two...

174
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,140
That sounds like Shinomiya.

175
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,720
We can't let the two of them leave us behind.

176
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,100
Which means we need to...

177
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,140
Hit the enemy from behind
 when Shinomiya's got 'em distracted!

178
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,110
Shinomiya's team will stop the Kaiju
 from working together!

179
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,570
Continue the mission!

180
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,690
Split into two and hit the enemy from behind!

181
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,780
<i>Shinomiya seems like
 she's doing her job just fine.</i>

182
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,950
The problem is...

183
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,210
This thing.

184
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,060
I-It's strong...

185
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,480
<i>But that's not all.</i>

186
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,190
<i>It's...</i>

187
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
<i>enjoying the fight.</i>

188
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,280
<i>Okonogi-chan, open Gate 3!</i>

189
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,160
Roger!

190
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>It's an emotion Kaiju aren't supposed to have.</i>

191
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,260
Why'd I even bother opening it?

192
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Those doors are expensive, okay?

193
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,970
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

194
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,230
Even most Kaiju can't fight me like you do.

195
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,320
I can't wait to eat you and get even stronger.

196
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,160
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

197
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,120
You really are strong.

198
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,670
<i>Sorry, Okonogi-chan.</i>

199
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,380
<i>This is an emergency,
 so I'm skipping the procedures.</i>

200
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,090
Here in the training grounds,

201
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,640
I don't have to worry about
 hurting the officers if I go all out.

202
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,400
<i>Unleashed combat power, 92%!</i>

203
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,900
All right, time to neutralize this Kaiju.

204
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,530
They're so powerful!

205
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,000
<i>I won't make it in time...</i>

206
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,170
<i>If I just transform part of my body...</i>

207
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,600
H-Hibino-san?

208
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,140
You okay, Minase?

209
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,560
Thanks!

210
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,520
I guess you learned to use your suit, huh?

211
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,650
W-Well, I am a full officer,
 you know! So of course...

212
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,360
Hibino-san, behind you!

213
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Kikoru!

214
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,790
Kikoru!

215
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,830
You okay, Senpai?

216
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,670
Reno and I will distract the Kaiju.

217
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,460
Get the wounded out of here while we do.

218
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,550
Roger!

219
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,210
Senpai...

220
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,050
Just don't take any risks, please.

221
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,390
You're a full officer now.

222
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,180
Believe in your fellow officers.

223
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,730
Right.

224
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm off!

225
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,200
Wow...

226
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,450
When did they learn to work together like that?

227
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,620
<i>Report! Nakanoshima's unit has arrived!</i>

228
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,040
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ikaruga!

229
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,010
Ebina's unit has arrived as well and is
heading to assist in the southern quadrant!

230
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,840
Thought you could get away with this,
 huh, you damn Kaiju?

231
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,340
The senior officers who were off duty?

232
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,550
They came to help!

233
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,470
<i>Shinomiya's team and Agatsuma's platoon
 have taken down two Yoju.</i>

234
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,480
This is Takao Platoon.

235
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,100
Our gunners are ready to go.

236
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,400
We'll attack the Yoju in the air
 with freeze rounds.

237
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,360
This is Itakura Platoon.

238
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,320
We've secured the warehouse area.

239
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,820
We're starting to push them back,

240
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,410
even without the captain here!

241
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,120
Okay, Minase, let's hurry and help the wounded.

242
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,830
Right!

243
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,910
<i>Incredible...</i>

244
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,540
<i>It's not just Kikoru and Ichikawa.</i>

245
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,090
<i>Everyone is incredible!</i>

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
<i>This is my division...</i>

247
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,550
<i>This is...</i>

248
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,010
<i>the Third Division!</i>

249
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,100
You picked a fight with the wrong people.

250
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,430
We're gonna win this fight.

251
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,320
Again...

252
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,990
It was the same with the attack
 you used to cut off my arm.

253
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,790
You're slicing right through
 the tiny gaps in my exoskeleton.

254
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,630
This is no fun at all.

255
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,130
Now that I know exactly what
 you're aiming for, it's easy for me to...

256
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,840
handle it...

257
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,100
Hoshina-Style Sword-Slay Technique
Number Two: Cross Slasher.

258
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,730
Number Four: Wild Slasher.

259
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,820
So aiming for the gaps was just a diversion?

260
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,080
Yeah, this is how a fight should be!

261
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,060
A head-on battle against an opponent
 whose strength rivals your own!

262
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,440
Rivals! Rivals! Rivals! Rivals!

263
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,490
Huh?

264
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,870
Your core's a lot smaller than I thought.

265
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,710
Number Six:

266
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,040
Eightfold Slasher.

267
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,840
Got him!

268
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,460
That's the vice-captain for you!

269
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,170
You see that, Kaiju?!

270
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,890
This is...

271
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,760
<i>Not yet!</i>

272
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,610
Hibino-san? What's wrong?

273
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,190
Sorry, I'm fine.

274
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,030
<i>What's going on? My detection ability's
 going off when I haven't transformed!</i>

275
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,910
<i>Vice-Captain...</i>

276
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,340
It got bigger?!

277
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,840
The position of its core shifted,
 so I wasn't able to fully destroy it?

278
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,560
<i>Ultra-high temperature steam...</i>

279
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,860
<i>Glad I brought it inside the training grounds.</i>

280
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,730
Its fortitude is rising alongside the heat...

281
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,650
No way!

282
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,120
Fortitude...

283
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,170
9.0!
