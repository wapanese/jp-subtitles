1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,890
<i>Last time on </i>Kaiju No. 8<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,570
What's going on? What's happening out there?

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,490
We're picking up live signals 
from the Kaiju they already killed!

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,190
You did a great job, Kikoru!

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,040
Sorry. I'm running out of time here.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,620
So I'm cleaning you up...

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,540
with one punch!

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,590
<i>An unexpected incident occurred,</i>

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,420
<i>but Senpai's last exam came to an end.</i>

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,170
And I have you to thank for encouraging me.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,470
Thanks, Ichikawa.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,930
<i>After all he went through, Senpai looked 
even more like a man you could count on.</i>

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,060
I can't take this!

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,600
<i>Never mind.</i>

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,430
I'm scared! I'm scared! 
I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared!

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,120
And it's all your fault!

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,100
I'm only suffering like this 
because you encouraged me!

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,520
You were thanking me for it at the hospital!

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,250
You were so cool then! What happened?

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,370
Kafka! Ichikawa!

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
You've both got mail.

22
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,390
Okay, we open it on three.

23
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,640
<i>No matter how it turns out, 
this is my last shot.</i>

24
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,530
<i>Will the path I'm on 
take me all the way to her?</i>

25
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,150
<i>Time to find out!</i>

26
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,470
One, two...

27
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,900
Examinee Number 2032

28
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,900
Kafka Hibino

29
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,900
Examination Results

30
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,750
Episode 5    Joining Up!

31
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,760
Hey.

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,370
Well, I figured you'd pass.

33
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,040
Same to you.

34
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,010
I'm not seeing any big surprises here.

35
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,660
I don't see Shinomiya's groupie, though.

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,640
You wanted him to pass?

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,870
No, I...

38
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,220
Hey, it's Shinomiya!

39
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,600
Shinomiya-san!

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,940
I heard you were the top scorer!

41
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,960
Yeah, they asked me handle the oath.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,150
I can't wait to work with you!

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,320
Thanks.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,620
Before the test, 
I was sure I'd be number one.

45
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,600
But after what we saw...

46
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,690
I suppose we'll be competing 
for the number two slot.

47
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,630
I scored the highest on the fitness exam.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,470
You can aim for number two.

49
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,370
I'll aim for number one.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,540
Oh, sorry!

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,620
Hey, you were with the old dude!

52
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,090
Reno Ichikawa.

53
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,620
Sorry, I'm bad with names.

54
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,050
I'm Iharu Furuhashi.

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,060
A pleasure to meet you, Furuhashi-san.

56
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,160
Just call me Iharu, Reno.

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,380
Where's the old dude? Didn't work out?

59
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,530
Senpai is...

60
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,120
Captain Mina Ashiro is entering the room.

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,170
<i>Captain Ashiro...</i>

62
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>It's finally time!</i>

63
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,440
The induction ceremony will now begin.

64
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,640
Kikoru Shinomiya will speak 
on behalf of the incoming class!

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,660
Yes, ma'am!

66
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,090
The twenty-seven of you are, 
as of this moment,

67
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,390
officers in the Defense Force!

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,680
On behalf of all 27 of us, I swear that 
we will lay down our lives for the cause!

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,230
You helped a lot during 
the incident after the exam.

70
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,100
Thanks to you, there were no casualties.

71
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,100
Again, you have my thanks.

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
<i>It wasn't me who defeated them.</i>

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
<i>Kafka Hibino, you should be
 the one hearing these words...</i>

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,700
<i>So why aren't you here?</i>

75
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,080
<i>You had the audacity 
to not only save my life,</i>

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,520
<i>but to worry about me like 
I was a little girl...</i>

77
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm glad you're safe!

78
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,940
<i>This is humiliating!</i>

79
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,860
<i>I still want some answers 
from you about that Kaiju form, too!</i>

80
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,090
<i>I'm not gonna let you just up 
and disappear on me!</i>

81
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,390
Excuse me!

82
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,930
Sorry to interrupt the ceremony!

83
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,680
The old dude!

84
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,400
Number 2032. Kafka Hibino. Failed.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,460
He scored the lowest on the fitness exam

86
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,820
and a zero on his aptitude test, 
so there's not much to talk about.

87
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,060
Yeah, sounds about right to me.

88
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,570
I don't—

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,040
<i></i>All righty, I'll take him, then.

90
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,670
Sure, his numbers are below average.

91
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,830
He doesn't have what it takes 
to be an officer.

92
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
But in actual combat during the last exam,

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,590
he was able to locate 
the enemy's weak points,

94
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,980
and he also aided the overall effort

95
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,470
by prioritizing helping others 
over his own kill count.

96
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,600
Not many people are capable of that.

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,020
And more than anything...

98
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,330
The dude was funny as hell.

99
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,760
Is that really all you care about?

100
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not sure if we'll ever 
promote him to a full officer,

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,570
but I'll bring him into my platoon as a 
cadet and give him some more training.

102
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,050
He's being enrolled as a cadet,

103
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,570
so I had him sit out the induction ceremony.

104
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,160
<i>Glad to hear it, Kafka Hibino.</i>

105
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,480
<i>So I was right. He did pass.</i>

106
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,190
<i>As a cadet, though.</i>

107
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,790
<i>That's a surprise.</i>

108
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,160
All right, now that we're all here, 
let's have a word from Captain Ashiro.

109
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:41,440
Everyone, I'm glad that you all decided 
to volunteer for the Defense Force,

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,190
enduring and passing that difficult exam.

111
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,480
I thank you.

112
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,160
These last few years,

113
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,550
we've seen far more Kaiju with far 
higher fortitudes than was typical before.

114
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,960
We've also now seen this strange incident 
where dead Kaiju came back to life.

115
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,080
These neutralization missions 
will be extremely dangerous.

116
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
Some of you may die on your very first one.

117
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,350
There's absolutely no guarantee
 that you'll survive.

118
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,050
But even so...
 No, that's exactly <i>why</i>...

119
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,390
I want you to entrust your lives to me.

120
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,470
I swear to be standing at the very front, 
acting as both your shield and spear!

121
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
I'll...

122
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,580
I'll be standing next to you soon, Mina!

123
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,900
Huh?

124
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,860
Huh?

125
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,360
Awkward

126
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,440
What the hell?!

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,680
He's gone crazy!

128
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,880
He's calling Captain 
Ashiro by her first name!

129
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,790
Oops

130
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,950
Kaf...

131
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,700
Kafka Hibino.

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,000
You spoke out of turn and
 disrespected a superior officer.

133
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,180
You owe me one hundred push-ups.

134
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,210
<i>I didn't mean to say that out loud!</i>

135
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,470
He's already at it!

136
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,730
Captain Ashiro, I think you're going 
a little easy on the guy...

137
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,400
Huh?

138
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,480
<i>Did I just see her smile?</i>

139
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
He just got here. and he's 
already bringing the comedy?

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,530
I know, right? I told you.

141
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,510
This place can get pretty gloomy sometimes.

142
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,820
We need a guy like him.

143
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,870
<i>Well, that's only half the story.</i>

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,790
<i>When those Kaiju started 
coming back from the dead,</i>

145
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,540
<i>we suddenly saw 
a 9.8 fortitude Kaiju signal.</i>

146
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,560
<i>I still think it was just a busted sensor,</i>

147
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,080
<i>but at the same time, 
somebody's vitals stopped coming in.</i>

148
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,000
<i>Kafka Hibino...</i>

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,500
<i>There's something strange about him,</i>

150
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,920
<i>and not just the fact 
that his suit aptitude was zero.</i>

151
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,040
<i>I'm going to keep him close 
and find out what that "something" is.</i>

152
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,520
Ninety-nine...

153
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,980
One hundred!

154
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,450
You really hung in there, old dude!

155
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,230
Kafka Hibino.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,260
Come with me. We need to talk.

157
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,820
What, we can't do it here?

158
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,550
But if we did it here...

159
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,080
Are you confessing your love?

160
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,440
It is not!

161
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,840
Senpai!

162
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,000
So it's one of those "meet me 
after school behind the gym" things?

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
Just come with me!

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
You ate a Kaiju and turned into one?

165
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,090
I can't believe it!

166
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,390
God, you're such a glutton.

167
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,920
I didn't mean to eat it!

168
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,640
You're both way too loud!

169
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,090
I think we could just tell 
the Defense Force, you know.

170
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,040
They might be able to cure me!

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,680
Not a chance.

172
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,530
Even if they don't kill you outright,

173
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,080
you'll spend every day being tested 
and doing experiments.

174
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,960
You'll never be a defense officer.

175
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,320
Really?!

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,640
And when a Kaiju's powerful 
enough to get a number,

177
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,580
I've heard they use its body as parts 
for a special weapon after they defeat it.

178
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,290
It's possible that'll happen to you.

179
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,490
Kikoru, please! Please 
keep this our little secret!

180
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,050
Save an old man's life!

181
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,580
You're too close! Way too close!

182
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,960
Please, please, please!

183
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,800
Fine.

184
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,410
You did save my life, 
so I'll keep quiet about it for now.

185
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,820
In exchange,

186
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,370
if I find out that you're 
a Kaiju that's going to harm mankind,

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,110
I'll kill you.

188
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,830
Yeah.

189
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,610
If that happens, I'm counting on you!

190
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,850
<i>Arms tight against your sides, wrists slack.</i>

191
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,940
<i>Let your instincts take over 
when you aim the reticle,</i>

192
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,840
<i>and don't pull the trigger...</i>

193
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,430
<i>Squeeze it!</i>

194
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,400
<i>Squeeze!</i>

195
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,810
<i>Squeeze!</i>

196
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,730
<i>Reno Ichikawa,
 fire training exercise complete.</i>

197
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,780
<i>Time, 2:35.</i>

198
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,750
<i>Estimated unleashed combat power, 18%.</i>

199
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,490
Haruichi-kun, I've got a question!

200
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,460
<i>I'm impressed. He's grown 
a lot in a very short time.</i>

201
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,280
<i>Reno set another personal best!</i>

202
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,280
Come on!

203
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,840
<i>I won't let him beat me!</i>

204
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,600
<i>Iharu Furuhashi, 2:15.</i>

205
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,080
<i>Estimated unleashed combat power, 20%.</i>

206
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,230
Hell yeah!

207
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,570
I win!

208
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,620
Don't get cocky, Reno.

209
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,280
I won't.

210
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,960
Kikoru Shinomiya, 1:16.

211
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,520
Estimated unleashed combat power, 55%.

212
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,590
Play nice, kids.

213
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,920
Both of your scores combined 
are still worse than mine.

214
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,630
Sheesh.

215
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,530
The more I train, the more she makes me 
realize just how average I am.

216
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,890
You've got time to worry 
about people better than you?

217
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,680
My combat power's as good as yours now.

218
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,070
<i>I've got to worry about those above me 
</i>and<i> those below me, huh?</i>

219
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,320
I'll set a new best when it's my turn, Aoi.

220
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,970
<i>Kafka Hibino, 6:39.</i>

221
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,880
<i>Estimated combat power, 1%.</i>

222
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes!

223
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,640
Did you see that, Kikoru?

224
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,630
I finally turned that zero into a one!

225
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,330
Stay away from me!

226
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,850
Well? Tell me how awesome I am.

227
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,720
Why are you acting so happy 
when you're 1% and I'm 55%?

228
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,680
Kafka!

229
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,130
Yes, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

230
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,030
You're never gonna be 
a full officer at this rate.

231
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,750
You'll be fired in three months.

232
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,850
What?

233
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,280
Old dude...

234
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,810
Okay, ten laps around the perimeter 
and we call it a day.

235
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,190
What?

236
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,290
You complained, so now it's fifteen.

237
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,250
Get going!

238
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,730
Yes, sir!

239
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,130
The new recruits have quite 
a few rivalries between them already, huh?

240
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,080
Yeah.

241
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,960
Looks like, even when I'm not around,

242
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,790
they're competing with each other 
and making each other better.

243
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm so tired!

244
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,640
We had to do laps at the end, too... 
The vice-captain is a monster.

245
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,550
Looks like you need to build 
up some more muscle, Reno.

246
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,860
No, yours aren't that 
much different than mine.

247
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,980
Our fitness eval scores are always the same.

248
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,200
Are you serious? Look at these biceps!

249
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,240
They look like they're just for show to me.

250
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,880
Reno's more stubborn than I thought.

251
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,160
Quit bickering over stupid stuff, kids.

252
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Behold the muscles 
of a hard-working grown-up!

253
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,320
Wow, you're getting some bulk...

254
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,540
<i></i><i>Exhale</i><i></i>

255
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,870
<i></i><i>Bounce</i><i></i>

256
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,240
Aww, so close!

257
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,530
You can't be in the Defense 
Force with a spare tire!

258
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,130
That's very rude, Iharu-kun.

259
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,000
It'll happen to you too 
when you hit 28 or so!

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,890
I've actually lost a ton of weight!

261
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,000
Forget the stomach.

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,110
I challenge you all to arm wrestling!

263
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,400
Yer on!

264
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,320
All right.

265
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,010
Okay, let me just set a towel down here...

266
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,860
Huh. It's awful noisy tonight.

267
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,110
What's wrong?

268
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,230
We were just talking about 
how scrawny we all were.

269
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,620
Just what you'd expect 
from a former military officer.

270
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,510
What matters isn't your muscles! 
Right, Reno?

271
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,310
<i>You know, it's been a while 
since I've done anything like this.</i>

272
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,360
Yes, what matters is your results!

273
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,880
I'll outdo you in training tomorrow!

274
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,130
You won't beat me!

275
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,070
But did you expect any less?

276
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,930
That's right.

277
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,650
Excuse us!

278
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,520
It's fine.

279
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,020
It's about time for me to head out.

280
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,180
Thank you!

281
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,320
Are you feeling all better?

282
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes. I'm fine now, thank you.

283
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,600
<i>Wow...</i>

284
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,020
<i>She's got good muscles, 
and just the right amount too.</i>

285
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,340
<i>But that's not enough 
to explain her combat power.</i>

286
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,540
What?

287
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,160
I was wondering how you got those muscles...

288
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,070
I mean, what kind of training you did.

289
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,600
Stand next to me.

290
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,760
I'll show you the basics.

291
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,000
Here?

292
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,980
Th-Thank you!

293
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,400
So why'd you guys all decide to join up?

294
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,160
If you want to ask other people, 
you should start by giving your own reasons.

295
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,000
For me, it's definitely Captain Ashiro.

296
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,040
She saved me when I was in middle school, 
and I've always wanted to be like her!

297
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,430
What about you guys?

298
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,680
Part of it's my family,

299
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,240
but something similar, I think.

300
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,500
My goal is Captain Ashiro.

301
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,640
Same here.

302
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,950
That poster of Captain Ashiro was so cool.

303
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,650
And she was so awesome in that documentary!

304
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,880
Mina's really inspired a lot of people, huh?

305
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,610
She's our generation's superhero.

306
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,360
So what's your story, old dude?

307
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,360
Well, I...

308
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,660
What?!

309
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,650
Captain A-Ashiro is...

310
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,040
...your childhood friend?

311
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,630
Y-Yeah.

312
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,920
And you both promised 
to join the Defense Force?

313
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,070
Like a "childhood promise" kinda thing?

314
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,350
Well, I think I've had enough...

315
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,430
Wait.

316
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,770
Let's hear the rest of that story.

317
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,770
Oh, well, she was born on a very sunny day...

318
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,290
She's always liked squid.

319
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,240
That's surprising!

320
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,780
She took care of the class 
pets in elementary school...

321
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,030
Give us more.

322
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,880
And then... and then...

323
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,720
Hours

324
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,870
Women's Bath

325
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,450
That was a great bath.

326
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,960
Hmm?

327
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,280
Did a serial killer come through here?

328
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,100
Oh, Kikorun.

329
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,710
They ended up talking so much 
they stayed in the bath too long.

330
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,880
They were talking 
about Captain Ashiro, they said.

331
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,360
Stupid boys.

332
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,700
<i>I don't have a lot of time.</i>

333
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,570
<i>I'll have to work twice 
as hard as everybody.</i>

334
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,700
Working hard, huh?

335
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,280
Vice-Captain Hoshina!

336
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,920
Getting your Zs is part of the job too.

337
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,120
I can't let myself get fired.

338
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,990
For Captain Ashiro?

339
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,760
How did you know?!

340
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,940
You were telling everyone 
in the bath, right?

341
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,710
Assume every word you say 
in this dorm will be recorded.

342
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,970
Scary!

343
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,600
I promised I'd fight by her side!

344
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,380
Oh, you know I could interpret that as saying 
you're going to steal my vice-captain spot.

345
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,360
I didn't mean it like that...

346
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,040
No.

347
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,540
I do mean it. I'll do my best 
to make it happen.

348
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,870
Hmph.

349
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,920
Fine.

350
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,630
You've got two more hours.

351
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Turn off the lights when 
you leave and lock the door.

352
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,810
I'm not letting you have my 
spot next to Captain Ashiro.

353
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,760
Thank you—

354
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,800
And...

355
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,350
You shouldn't get too close 
to the rest of the officers.

356
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,980
In this line of work, something could 
happen to any one of them at any time.

357
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
A Kaiju?

358
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,000
This isn't a training exercise, is it?

359
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,640
See what I just said?

360
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,380
Let's go. It's time for your first mission.
