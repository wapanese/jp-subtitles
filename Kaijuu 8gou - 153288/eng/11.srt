1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,060
Kaiju No. 8...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,770
I can't believe there was 
a Kaiju inside the Defense Force.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,150
And a Daikaiju class, too.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,490
Deputy Director of the Defense Force
Keiji Itami

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,480
We need to deal with this immediately.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,450
Do we tell the media?

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,740
We ought to keep this under wraps,
as we did with Kaiju No. 9.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,000
I hear rumors that one country is experimenting
with Kaiju-to-human tissue transplants.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,250
Chief of Staff
 Defense Force Eastern Command
Juzo Nogizaka

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,830
They'd try something if they knew.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,540
The obvious move is to dispose of it in secret
and convert it into weaponry.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,760
Shouldn't we consider using it 
as a <i>living</i> weapon first?

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,180
This discussion is getting us nowhere.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,640
We bring it in first, then decide.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,390
Director General of the Defense Force
Isao Shinomiya

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm ordering the Third Division 
to hand over Kaiju No. 8.

17
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,410
Episode 11              Kaiju No. 8 Captured

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,200
Kaiju No. 8's vitals are stable.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,700
It shows no signs of transforming.

20
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,250
Is that really...?

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,090
<i>It's been a full day, huh?</i>

22
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,100
<i>What happens to me now?</i>

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,930
When a Kaiju's powerful 
enough to get a number,

24
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,980
I've heard they use its body as 
parts for a special weapon.

25
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,650
It's possible that'll happen to you.

26
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,910
<i>Just when I'd taken a step closer
to being by her side...</i>

27
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,950
I'm sure Mina's mad.

28
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,580
It's time.

29
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,330
We're transporting you to HQ's facilities.

30
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,090
Mina...

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,590
Vice-Captain! I'm sorry! I...

32
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,550
Don't say a word.

33
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,220
Stand up.

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>Figures.</i>

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,400
<i>I </i>have<i> been keeping one hell 
of a secret from them.</i>

36
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,930
The security detail 
is ready to accompany him.

37
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,940
<i>Oh no... I can't even look him in the eyes.</i>

38
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,900
<i>He's done so much to look out for me.</i>

39
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,070
<i>He's probably so mad.</i>

40
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,450
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

41
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,040
<i>This time, it's really over...</i>

42
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,090
Senpai!

43
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,050
I have faith that you'll come back, okay?

44
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,010
Ichikawa.

45
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,060
Ichikawa's going to be doing 50 
push-ups for talking out of turn.

46
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,020
Mina?

47
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,270
There are no cameras in here.

48
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,990
When you dashed in to save us all 
without a moment's hesitation,

49
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,340
I was shocked to see you as a Kaiju.
 But I also told myself...

50
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,740
that's just like you.

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,750
I'm putting together testimony 
and footage that will help you.

52
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,340
If we can prove you're human, 
we might be able to save you.

53
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,840
We're also going to report on 
everything you've done as an officer.

54
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,390
Nobody in the Third Division 
thinks of you as an enemy.

55
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,220
It's time.

56
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,060
Sit down.

57
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
Kafka Hibino.

58
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,570
In accordance with Article 13 
of the Defense Force Code,

59
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,610
you are to be transferred 
to the Ariake Maritime Base.

60
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,410
To ensure the safety of the citizenry—

61
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,410
Mina.

62
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,620
Can I still... try to stand by your side?

63
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,130
Yeah.

64
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,970
I'll always be waiting.

65
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,370
<i>Idiot.</i>

66
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,870
Third Defense Force, salute!

67
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,510
Vice-Captain Hoshina, 
what do you think you're doing?

68
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,060
I'm saluting my superior officer, 
Captain Ashiro.

69
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,060
Of course you are.

70
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,390
We can't have anyone saluting to a Kaiju.

71
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,650
Of course.

72
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,910
Defense Force Ariake Maritime Base

73
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,080
<i>Bulkheads 23 to 31 are completely sealed.</i>

74
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,500
<i>Kaiju No. 8 is now contained.</i>

75
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,710
Several Days Later

76
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,650
I still can't believe it, you know.

77
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,110
Who woulda thought that
 the old man was Kaiju No. 8?

78
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,160
I mean, the guy's got 
one heck of a spare tire.

79
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,700
Right, Reno?

80
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,420
Hibino-san saved me from the Kaiju.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,260
He found the Kaiju's weak points.

82
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,930
And he was always so much fun
 to be around in training.

83
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,510
I mean, he saved my life too.

84
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,510
We don't get to decide.

85
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,520
The Neutralization Bureau does.

86
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,600
That's a former SDF officer.

87
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
Always following orders.

88
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,780
You're right, though.

89
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,980
The fact that a human turned 
into a Kaiju is a big deal.

90
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,490
If it gets out, we're looking 
at a worldwide panic.

91
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,950
The whole world's gonna have to
live every day wondering

92
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,290
if the person standing next 
to them is actually a Kaiju.

93
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,290
No...

94
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,550
This is too much for us to get involved in.

95
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,760
<i>Senpai...</i>

96
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,050
Enter.

97
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,100
Excuse me.

98
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,890
You called?

99
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,770
Put all this together for me.

100
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,690
On the double, please.

101
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,730
Okay.

102
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,270
This is all...

103
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,940
Can you do it?

104
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,530
Yes, of course.

105
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Vice-Captain.

106
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,930
We've cleared out all 
the destroyed vehicles.

107
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,370
Oh, thanks.

108
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,250
What will happen to Hibino, you think?

109
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,560
I'm going to need him back here.

110
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,450
When he was fighting with me, 
he wasn't using his full strength.

111
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,780
Who's he think he is?

112
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,440
You can say that again.

113
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,690
Next time, we're going to fight for real.

114
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,450
Director General's Office

115
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,620
Enter.

116
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,460
What do you want?

117
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,090
Dadd—

118
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,260
Director General Shinomiya.

119
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,600
I've come to request that 
Kafka Hibino not be eliminated.

120
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,440
He's saved my life.

121
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,900
Please consider a light—

122
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,940
Fool.

123
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,980
Did you come to talk about 
your failures?

124
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,400
But...

125
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,490
Look at this.

126
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,490
All right.

127
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,080
His chest X-rays.

128
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,210
Look at what's on the left side.

129
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,590
He's made it look like a heart,

130
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,670
but it's a core.

131
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,170
No...

132
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,630
He's no human.

133
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,260
He's a Kaiju.

134
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,350
A Kaiju, like the one 
that killed your mother.

135
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,980
If you understand now, then leave.

136
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,000
Daddy...

137
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,210
I still want to believe in him.

138
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,470
Another physical exam?

139
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,760
How many of these do I have to do?

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,220
I'd like to sleep in a comfy futon soon...

141
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,190
I have faith that you'll come back, okay?

142
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,030
<i>There's so much I need to tell everyone.</i>

143
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,160
<i>I can't give up.</i>

144
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,830
<i>I need to get back there.</i>

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,460
Captain's Office

146
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,460
We're being transferred to other divisions?

147
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,580
Temporarily, but yes.

148
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,300
After the last Kaiju attack,

149
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,130
Tachikawa is down 75% of
 its functionality as a base.

150
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,760
It's no longer deemed suitable 
as a place to train new recruits.

151
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,230
We've seen multiple Daikaiju, 
first No. 9, then No. 10,

152
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,860
and the brass is concerned.

153
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,520
They feel that this may be 
a chain of connected incidents.

154
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,320
So there's more coming?

155
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,560
Not just more, but possibly
 more at the same time.

156
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,830
We must be ready,

157
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,210
and you're the key.

158
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,130
We'll be taking the most talented 
rookies from all the divisions

159
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,420
and training them across 
division boundaries.

160
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,470
And that's us?

161
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,840
She said we're talented.

162
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,470
Is this because of No. 8?

163
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,050
What do you mean?

164
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:15,560
Their real goal is to split up everyone who 
was close to Kafka Hibino and monitor them.

165
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,320
Captain Ashiro, if that's the case, 
I won't obey that order—

166
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,150
Wait.

167
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,990
It's noble that you care 
for your fellow officer,

168
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,410
but this plan's been under 
consideration for some time.

169
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,690
Kafka Hibino has nothing to do with it.

170
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,950
I understand.

171
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,540
But I don't know about just 
going to another division...

172
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,040
That's right.

173
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,500
I admired the Third Division, 
and you, and that's why...

174
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,250
I'll do it.

175
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,760
Do you understand? We're getting split up!

176
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,050
Put some more thought into your answer!

177
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,850
I'll do it.

178
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,350
Captain Ashiro

179
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,350
Platoon Leader Ikaruga

180
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,350
Hakua Igarashi

181
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,350
Platoon Leader Itakura

182
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,060
Dad

183
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,360
Yes, that's right.

184
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,360
It's an internal Defense Force matter,
so I can't go into details...

185
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,410
But there's someone I want
 to save, no matter what.

186
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,830
Yes, I know it's unlikely.

187
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,330
Thank you.

188
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,670
Sorry, I didn't feel like I could interrupt.

189
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,800
I was the one who walked up here.

190
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,170
Don't worry about it.

191
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,090
Aoi...

192
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,520
I was talking with my 
old commander in the JSDF.

193
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,820
I wanted him to introduce me to 
anyone important who could help Kafka.

194
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,820
That surprises me.

195
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,030
I didn't think you were the type 
to ask for personal favors.

196
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,910
I said before that 
I don't want to lose anyone.

197
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,710
Kafka Hibino is a member of 
the Third Division, like the rest of us.

198
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,340
Am I wrong?

199
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,260
I...

200
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,890
If we can prove you're human, 
we might be able to save you.

201
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,520
<i>Mina's right.</i>

202
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,020
<i>I'll prove I'm human 
and go back to everyone.</i>

203
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,730
<i>First, I have to get them to hear me out.</i>

204
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,540
D-Director General Shinomiya?!

205
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,670
I didn't expect the director general
 to go in himself.

206
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,220
That man always settles
 important matters personally.

207
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,430
Director!

208
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,810
I'm not a Kaiju!

209
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,690
<i>Release the bindings.</i>

210
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,280
But that's Kaiju No. 8!

211
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,610
It's too dangerous!

212
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,610
<i>Who do you think you're talking to?</i>

213
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,500
If he's really Daikaiju class, he could
 break them with a wave of his hand.

214
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,830
He's sitting there because he wants to.

215
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,880
<i>Maybe he'll listen to me!</i>

216
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,340
Director General Shinomiya!

217
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,510
I'm human...

218
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,060
Kafka Hibino!

219
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,440
What was that for?

220
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,030
Let me tell you something.

221
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,240
In this world, a creature that can
 stop bullets with its bare skin...

222
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,240
could never be considered human,

223
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,120
Kaiju No. 8.

224
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,620
Daddy...

225
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,460
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

226
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,050
I'm Kafka Hibino.

227
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,470
You are, huh?

228
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,390
That's the signal. Unlocking FS-1002.

229
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,270
Request for authorization cleared.

230
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,450
What's that?

231
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,530
Nerve link cleared.

232
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,450
Driver and Kaiju No. 2's 
cell synchronization, all clear.

233
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,460
FS-1002 activation complete.

234
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,760
Then you can die in that form.

235
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,010
Commencing disposal of Kaiju No. 8!

236
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,720
<i>I won't fully transform!</i>

237
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,890
<i>I'll prove I'm human!</i>

238
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,490
Oh, crap!

239
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,700
Kafka!

240
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,490
He's still got it.

241
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,330
The man they once called the strongest
soldier the Defense Force had ever seen.

242
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,130
You look a lot more like a Kaiju now.

243
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,520
<i>It'll be bad news 
if I take a hit from that.</i>

244
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,690
<i>I'll just have to keep dodging 
until his suit overheats!</i>

245
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,810
<i>Why is my body reacting like this?</i>

246
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,940
<i>It's the same as when I fought the Daikaiju!</i>

247
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,690
<i>But there aren't any...</i>

248
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,150
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

249
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,280
<i>It's reacting to him like he's a Daikaiju?</i>

250
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,780
Kaiju No. 2.

251
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,200
In 1972, it nearly destroyed Sapporo.

252
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,460
The second Kaiju to ever be given a number.

253
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,000
A Daikaiju with incredible destructive power

254
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,420
and the pride to never give up 
until the moment it died.

255
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,390
That suit and those arms 
were made from No. 2.

256
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,690
And your father, Isao Shinomiya, 
is the only one to ever be able to use them.

257
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,070
<i>So this is what Kikoru was talking about...</i>

258
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,190
<i>Identified Kaiju Weapons:</i>

259
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,490
<i>the Numbers!</i>

260
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,030
<i>No... don't let that thing hit you again!</i>

261
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,450
<i>Dodge!</i>

262
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,710
<i>I can't move! Why?</i>

263
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,540
<i>When...?!</i>

264
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,210
<i>Damn it.</i>

265
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,890
Kafka Hibino!

266
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,390
Whew...

267
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,150
You've finally shown 
who you really are, Kaiju.

268
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,190
<i>What? Something's wrong...</i>

269
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,580
<i>Yeah... Something's not right...</i>

270
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,260
What is this?

271
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,420
I can't control my body!

272
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,980
<i>Damn it...</i>

273
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,020
<i>Forget proving I'm human, 
I'm totally acting like a Kaiju now!</i>

274
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,240
<i>Kill. Kill.</i>

275
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,450
<i>Kaiju... Kill...</i>

276
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,820
<i>Kill...</i>

277
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,210
No! You're human, right?

278
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,430
Kafka Hibino!
