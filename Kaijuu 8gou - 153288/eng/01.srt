α2, this is CP.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,830
Continue your surveillance mission.

(Emergency Underground Shelter, Yokohama Entrance)
At South District and Central District

an Emergency Kaiju Alert has been issued.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,790
Residents in the mentioned areas.
Please move to the shelters immediately.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,110
Regarding the future movement
of the earthquake focus…

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,530
Ah.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,600
The target is moving from Yatobashi
towards Yamashita Town.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,820
Estimated length is 60 meters.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,250
Fortitude is 3.5, over.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,800
No thermal response within 3 kilometers.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,600
Understood.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,430
All units, fire.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,070
Repeat, fire.

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,850
Understood. Lead the target to TO.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,340
Fire.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,520
(Special Kaiju Alert)
Will the intimidation attack work?

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,650
(Evacuation Alarms Sounded in Yokohama City)
Will the intimidation attack work?

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,930
I wonder which division will come.

28
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,240
In Yokohama,
it will be the Third Division.

29
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,020
(Kaiju No. 8)

30
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,740
Wow, it's everywhere.

31
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,760
Looks like we'll be
working overtime for a while.

32
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,170
Okay, let's get to work.

33
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,030
Okay.

34
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,760
The citizens are all cheering
the Third Division…

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:17,950
(Thank You, Defense Force)
The citizens are all cheering the Third Division

36
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,760
(Thank You, Defense Force)
for the successful defeat of the Kaiju.

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,460
for the successful defeat of the Kaiju.

38
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,020
The Third Division once again
completed the mission with no casualty.

39
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,600
- I heard Captain Ashiro has come.
- Because of the Third Division,

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,700
- That's great.
- we get to live in peace.

41
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,190
I would like to thank them
along with this cheer.

42
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,600
- Hey, capture the footage of the victims too.
- Citizens in the affected area in Yokohama,

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,270
- Ah, sorry.
- Citizens in the affected area in Yokohama,

44
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,830
- It's okay.
- Citizens in the affected area in Yokohama,

45
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,030
- Ah.
- please be careful of possible Yoju.

46
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,280
Report back to me after it's done.

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,620
Yes.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,610
Our battle

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,640
only begins after everything is over.

50
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,440
The work that no one cares about

51
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
and is grateful for.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,630
However, this is

53
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,940
our unknown battle against Kaiju.

54
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
(Kafka Hibino)
our unknown battle against Kaiju.

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,260
Kafka.

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,630
Izumo Tech. said they want a sample.

57
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,730
Thanks.

58
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,330
No.

59
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,040
There's too much grease here
to cut through.

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,550
Bring me a heated chainsaw.

61
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,200
Got it.

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,170
Hey!

63
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,250
Don't hoist it up.

64
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,210
That hurts.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,030
Bring the stretcher over here!

66
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,310
Don't worry.

67
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,430
It's a superficial wound.

68
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,750
I've had a few injuries like this.

69
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,650
Remember to file for
workers' compensation.

70
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,060
Okay.

71
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,040
The Third Division does indeed leave a mess.

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,060
It's hard to distinguish the viscera.

73
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,780
But…

74
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,300
Do we really need to
get this done this week?

75
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,880
Kafka, you'll take charge of another area.

76
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,610
We're short-staffed there.

77
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,620
Where am I going?

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,520
The intestines.

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,450
- No!
- The higher-ups have approved. Just go.

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,160
My condolences.

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,480
I've heard the rumors.

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,520
Is working in the intestines
really that tough?

83
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,400
(Roar)
Just think about what's in there.

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,020
(Anatomical Diagram)
Just think about what's in there.

85
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,200
When working there,

86
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,960
you'll temporarily lose your appetite.

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm exhausted.

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,440
The baby panda is really cute.

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,220
Let's witness it growing up.

90
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,700
I can still smell it.

91
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,720
Next up is today's special feature.

92
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,240
The protagonist is the one who subdued
the Kaiju that appeared in Yokohama City,

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,470
the Third Division of the Defense Force.

94
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,970
(Special Feature: Third Division is Deployed)
the Third Division of the Defense Force.

95
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,570
(Japan Defense Force up Close)
the Third Division of the Defense Force.

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,950
(Third Division Returning in Triumph)
the Third Division of the Defense Force.

97
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,470
(Third Division Returning in Triumph)
And the leader of this division…

98
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,760
(Captain Mina Ashiro)
And the leader of this division

99
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,480
(Captain Mina Ashiro)
is Captain Mina Ashiro.

100
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,970
is Captain Mina Ashiro.

101
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,870
At the age of 27,

102
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,800
she not only became the Captain,

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,980
but also slayed

104
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,990
(Captain Mina Ashiro)
hundreds of Kaiju.

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
Let's eliminate all the Kaiju together.

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,370
Hmm.

107
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,840
(Captain Mina Ashiro)
Her calmness and dignified appearance

108
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,270
have made her become
the most popular captain.

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,000
It is believed that she'd be a candidate
for Commander.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
(Future Commander Candidate)
It is believed
that she'd be a candidate for Commander.

111
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,010
(Future Commander Candidate)
We're looking forward to her future performance.

112
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,300
Why I wind up on this side of things?

113
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,120
No, don't think about it.

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,060
Cleaning is also an important job
in helping people.

115
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,420
I live in a nice room

116
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,450
and eat the food I like.

117
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,640
Isn't that enough?

118
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,560
My head hurts so much.

119
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,000
Damn, all because of that special feature.

120
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,760
Good morning.

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,680
Here you are.

122
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,130
Kafka, come here.

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,370
I'll go get ready.

124
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,200
Okay.

125
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Kafka, good morning.

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,280
Morning.

127
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,510
This is Ichikawa, the part-time student
who will start working with us from today.

128
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,070
He is determined to join the Defense Force.

129
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,990
(Reno Ichikawa)
He is determined to join the Defense Force.

130
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,280
Well.

131
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,450
Let me tell you
this guy dreamed of that too.

132
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,720
But he gave it up long ago

133
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,990
and has become a veteran of our company.

134
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,240
That sucks.

135
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
Tokuda.

136
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,160
You are embarrassing him.

137
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,210
Why?

138
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,200
Why did you give up?

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,840
I have tried hard in my own way.

140
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,680
But there's always someone better.

141
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,690
(Thoroughly Cleaned 10 Kaiju)
(Health Check All Pass) (The Best Record)
I kind of realized that my abilities are limited.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
When you get older, you'll understand…

143
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,260
I don't understand.

144
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,880
I will never give up.

145
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,840
I will never understand that logic.

146
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,190
And I don't want to.

147
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,040
Hey…

148
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm going to get changed.

149
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,220
Well?

150
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,120
I thought he would get along with you.

151
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,050
So cunning.

152
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,360
No matter how I answered,
it'd just make me look miserable.

153
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,100
But,

154
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,680
is giving up really that bad?

155
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,200
Hey.

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
- Okay, let's get to work.
- Hey.

157
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,580
Uh… The Mitsuike crew,
keep on cleaning the bones.

158
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,090
Hand those parts in original shape
directly over to Izumo Tech.

159
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,990
Okay.

160
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,960
The Yoshimura crew is
in charge of dissecting the legs.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,350
This part will be completely destroyed.

162
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,340
Okay.

163
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,390
Newcomer, to the intestines, follow me.

164
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,170
Yes.

165
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,890
Great.

166
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,270
You had it coming.

167
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,920
Kafka, you're also on intestines,
come along.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,630
Me too?

169
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,480
Dealing with the intestines
for two days in a row?

170
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,640
You're good at dealing
with the intestines, right?

171
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,500
Damn it.

172
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,480
I'll show you.

173
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,110
Although he complaints,
he still works diligently.

174
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,380
If he had passed the exam,
he would've been a good officer.

175
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,120
Really?

176
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,240
He must have been grossed out too.

177
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,610
Though I am no better.

178
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,160
Hey,

179
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,530
you only brought that bento for lunch?

180
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,110
I don't have much appetite.

181
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,380
That makes sense.

182
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,820
Take this.

183
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,080
What…

184
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,710
Ah.

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
(Multivitamin V)
That's for you.

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,210
(Multivitamin V)
Eat as much as you can.

187
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,240
Otherwise, you won't make it
through the afternoon.

188
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,280
I'll be fine…

189
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,170
Here, take these too.

190
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,160
You'll feel much better with them.

191
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
No, that… I don't quite understand
what you're saying,

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,480
but I really don't need that.

193
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,180
Come on.

194
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,810
Just try it on, kid.

195
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,830
Senior, please don't do this.

196
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,610
- That's an abuse of power.
- Everyone has to do this in our line of work.

197
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,310
- Don't be shy.
- Everyone has to do this in our line of work.

198
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,540
Take your own luggage, okay?

199
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:53,880
(Monster Sweeper Inc.)

200
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,260
Good work.

201
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,890
Everyone, well done.

202
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,960
We're leaving first.

203
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,370
Okay.

204
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,590
Good work.

205
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,050
The worst part should
have been cleaned up now.

206
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,400
Senior.

207
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,600
Ichikawa.

208
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,690
What? Are you here to take revenge
for what happened this noon?

209
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Thanks to…

210
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,330
Thanks to your help, I was able
to get through the first day.

211
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,110
Thank you very much.

212
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,720
Oh!

213
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Oh.

214
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,020
I just came to say this.

215
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,290
Goodbye.

216
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,060
Ah.

217
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,870
Also…

218
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,180
The age limit for
Defense Force recruitment

219
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,450
has been relaxed to 33 years old.

220
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,480
It is due to the effect
of a declining birthrate.

221
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,420
Actually, other people's life choices
have nothing to do with me.

222
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,990
But when you talked about giving up,

223
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,980
you looked sad.

224
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,490
Well,

225
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,320
I really don't care what you do.

226
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
If I misunderstood,

227
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,900
you can just give it up.

228
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,340
Goodbye.

229
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,880
Ichikawa.

230
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,740
Thank you.

231
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,290
You are a better person than I thought.

232
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,620
I… I said I didn't mean that…

233
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,600
Senior?

234
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,660
A Yoju?

235
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,560
Ah.

236
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Ichikawa, run!

237
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,700
Leave as fast as you can!

238
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,160
Call the Defense Force once you are safe!

239
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,530
But senior, you are alone…

240
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,230
Even the two of us can't handle it.

241
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,560
Don't you want
to be a Defense Force Officer?

242
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,380
How can you die here?

243
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,880
Look, I am here!

244
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,390
Over there.

245
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,080
It worked.

246
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,350
This will do.

247
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,590
Damn it!

248
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,620
All of these were destroyed.

249
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,230
Your home, my home, and the school.

250
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,760
Hmm…

251
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,320
I won't forgive the Kaiju!

252
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,330
I was so close to finishing my Pokemon game!

253
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,570
Is this what makes you sad?

254
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,760
I…

255
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,610
I'm sad because Miiko died.

256
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,870
That tri-colored cat?

257
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,580
I want to become a Defense Force Officer.

258
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,030
What nonsense are you
spouting, you little kid?

259
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,270
(To Miiko)
You're a primary school student.

260
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,360
So…

261
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,600
Let's compete to see who can
become the coolest officer.

262
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,480
Let's eliminate all the Kaiju together.

263
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,840
Damn it.

264
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,320
It shouldn't be like this.

265
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,750
Damn it.

266
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,730
So what about the Kaiju?

267
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
I must attack its legs.

268
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,070
Hit its legs.

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,860
Why has it come to this?

270
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,490
Let's compete to see who can
become the coolest officer.

271
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,360
Ichikawa?

272
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,790
Idiot, why did you…

273
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,200
I've already notified the Defense Force.

274
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,390
That's not what I mean.

275
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,700
If I were to abandon you,

276
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,370
I would never become an officer.

277
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,620
(We regret to inform you of the selection result.
Not Qualified)

278
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,440
Damn.

279
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,540
(Japan Defense Force is Recruiting)

280
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,470
Damn.

281
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,260
Damn it.

282
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,270
How can I be so useless?

283
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,810
Nothing has changed at all.

284
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Whether it's my game console
or a friend's cat.

285
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,200
I even failed to protect a junior.

286
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,960
Damn it!

287
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,590
Target has been eliminated.

288
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,850
There are casualties at the scene.

289
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,180
Our team will switch
to a rescue operation.

290
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,400
(Japan Defense Force, Third Division)
Igarashi, Takaraki,

291
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,090
(Japan Defense Force, Third Division)
take care of the injured.

292
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,360
Everyone else, follow me.

293
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,630
Search the area for any remaining Yoju.

294
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,340
(Captain Mina Ashiro)
Search the area for any remaining Yoju.

295
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,860
Are you okay?

296
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,890
Stay still.

297
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,240
Mina is really amazing.

298
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,770
She killed something so scary in an instant.

299
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,280
She has gone to a place I can't reach.

300
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,760
Senior.

301
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,060
Oh.

302
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,420
When the Kaiju appeared,

303
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,280
if you hadn't told me to run

304
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,680
and you hadn't saved me,

305
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,340
I would have been dead by now.

306
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,050
You're so cool.

307
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's compete to see who can
become the coolest officer.

308
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,880
You really should be
a Defense Force Officer.

309
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,220
But, that's your own choice.

310
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,000
It has nothing to do with me.

311
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,160
Yeah.

312
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,130
How long do I intend to turn a blind eye?

313
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,790
Thank you, Ichikawa.

314
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,790
You really are a good person.

315
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,120
Although I don't think
giving up is a bad thing,

316
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,170
it's not good to deceive myself.

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,760
I will once again aim to be
a Defense Force Officer.

318
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,960
Eh?

319
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,800
Found him.

320
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,120
Kaiju…

321
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,730
Senior?

322
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,640
Are you hurting?

323
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,620
Senior!

324
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,860
Ugh.

325
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,530
Eh?

326
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,430
Eh?

327
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,040
Ichikawa, it's me!

328
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,900
Calm down.

329
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,200
(Bang Bang Bang)
Ah.

330
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,650
(Bang Bang Bang)
Notify the Defense Force.

331
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,520
Run, senior!

332
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,250
Eh?

333
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,740
(Episode 1: The Man Who Became a Kaiju)

334
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,750
If you encounter a Kaiju,

335
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,640
first, you should attack its legs,

336
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,030
then tie it up

337
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,240
to immobilize it.

338
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,200
It's a bit scary.

339
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,730
What?

340
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,400
To think about fighting a Kaiju
several times bigger than myself.

341
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,480
Don't worry.

342
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,040
When the time comes,

343
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,340
I will be by your side.

344
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,940
Liar.

345
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,690
Yes.

346
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,450
Kaiju was spotted
at Yokohama Minami General Hospital.

347
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Yes.

348
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,960
No, no problem.

349
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,620
I'll dispatch the officers immediately

350
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,000
and exterminate it.
