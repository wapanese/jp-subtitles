1
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,700
Sure you're not pushing yourself too hard?

2
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,790
Episode 12        Kafka Hibino

3
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,250
What are you thinking, anyway?

4
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,540
You're not worried about the old dude?

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,500
You went and agreed to go to another unit.

6
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,550
I want to get stronger.

7
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,260
You can do that here, right?

8
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,640
That's how we've done it so far!

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,060
Yeah.

10
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,930
I'm sure I could get stronger if I stayed, too.

11
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,850
But...

12
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,690
I want to get stronger as quickly as possible.

13
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,240
So that next time I can protect him, 
instead of him having to protect me.

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,870
Next time? You really think 
the old dude's coming back?

15
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,950
I've decided to believe.

16
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,910
And when he comes back, 
I don't want to rue my own weakness.

17
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, me too...!

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,960
Fine, damn it! I'll train too!

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,880
You're the one guy I refuse to lose to!

20
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,340
What are you two arguing about?

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,340
Platoon leaders...

22
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,100
Today's the day they decide 
what they're doing with Hibino.

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,780
It's hard to stay focused, 
thinking about that.

24
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,020
Same for you guys, right?

25
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,020
It'll be fine!

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,730
We all wrote that letter asking 
for clemency together!

27
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,820
And Captain Ashiro was summoned to HQ, too.

28
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,230
The captain was?

29
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes.

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,660
I'm sure they called her 
because they have good news.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,620
Mina Ashiro, reporting as ordered.

32
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,500
<i>Director General Shinomiya 
is currently examining Kaiju No. 8.</i>

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,760
<i>Please remain there until he's finished.</i>

34
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,380
Roger.

35
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,180
<i>You are only here as an observer.</i>

36
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,970
<i>A seat has not been prepared for you.</i>

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,110
No! You're human, right?

38
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,910
Kafka Hibino!

39
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,370
<i>He's fast.</i>

40
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,120
<i>But he's just an animal. He's not thinking 
about the opening he leaves after his attack.</i>

41
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,350
<i>An attack that destroys his own body, 
knowing he can regenerate?</i>

42
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>If I try to use human common sense 
in this fight, I'm going to regret it.</i>

43
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940
Stop it!

44
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,190
Daddy!

45
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,910
<i>Without No. 2's shield, 
that would've killed me instantly.</i>

46
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,210
<i>Squadron-Style Combat Technique Number Two:</i>

47
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,950
<i>Force Blast!</i>

48
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,290
That attack expands its striking range
by using a sonic boom.

49
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,590
A method No. 2 put to good use.

50
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,260
<i>The core's gone?</i>

51
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,350
<i>He used his body as a decoy 
and regenerated from his core?</i>

52
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,270
<i>Fighting like this is too much!</i>

53
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,100
<i>I'm not gonna survive this!</i>

54
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,440
Impossible! That shelter's as strong 
as we could make it!

55
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,650
We just lost the second layer!

56
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,320
In theory, it should survive an 
attack from a Fortitude 10.0!

57
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,830
We can expect to take some damage.

58
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,420
After all,

59
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,340
we have two numbered Kaiju, No. 2 and
No. 8, battling each other across time.

60
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,300
<i>Incredible...</i>

61
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,220
<i>He's facing a numbered Kaiju all on his own!</i>

62
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,010
It's strange, though.

63
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,280
If he was going to kill him,
 he should've done so

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,440
with his first attack
while he was still in human form.

65
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,980
Instead, it looks like Isao

66
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,180
is deliberately pushing No. 8 to test him.

67
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,240
I can't imagine why.

68
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,050
<i>Is Daddy giving Kafka Hibino 
a chance to survive?!</i>

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,300
I came to the Defense Force to save lives.

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,550
Instead, Kafka Hibino saved mine.

71
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,640
But he...

72
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,850
Your standard for judging someone shouldn't
be their background, or what they say.

73
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,690
The way I see it, people ought
 to be judged by their actions.

74
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,190
Yeah, you're right.

75
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,200
Dad

76
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,620
The only fact that matters 
is what you do, huh?

77
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,890
No!

78
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,520
No. 8's fortitude is starting 
to surpass Isao's estimations.

79
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,230
<i>Crap! I have to stop this thing!</i>

80
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,690
Damn it all!

81
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,070
Stop!

82
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,380
<i>I'm going to end up killing him!</i>

83
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,140
Hell no!

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,640
<i>I'm not killing Kikoru's dad
 right in front of her!</i>

85
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,070
...if I find out that you're a Kaiju 
that's going to harm mankind, I'll kill you.

86
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,700
<i>I'll...</i>

87
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
<i>I'll... have to...</i>

88
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,880
<i>But I still want to believe in him!</i>

89
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,020
Don't give in to some Kaiju,
 Kafka, you idiot!

90
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,140
I... I...!

91
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,690
<i>I...</i>

92
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>Application Result</i>

93
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>Mr. Kafka Hibino</i>

94
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>We regret to inform you that you have not passed
 the first round of the recently concluded
 Anti-Kaiju Defense Force selection tests.</i>

95
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,320
<i>This is how it always goes for me.</i>

96
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,660
<i>I always screw up at 
the most important moment.</i>

97
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,340
<i>Damn it...</i>

98
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,060
<i>I had hope, but I suppose all is lost.</i>

99
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
I'll always...

100
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,050
I'll always be waiting.

101
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,000
I...

102
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,880
I... I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

103
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,390
I'm Kafka Hibino.

104
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,380
Put your weapon away,

105
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
Narumi.

106
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,180
You kept refusing to signal for backup.

107
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,890
Defense Force First Division Captain 
Gen Narumi

108
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,890
I thought you were trying to kill yourself.

109
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,850
Don't be stupid.

110
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,890
I'll admit he was more than 
I expected, though.

111
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,020
Medics, take No. 8 in immediately.

112
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,570
Its core may be damaged.

113
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,280
So, what will you do with him?

114
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,420
Director General Shinomiya 
has finished his examination.

115
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Lastly, we want to hear what you think
as his commanding officer,

116
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,420
Captain Mina Ashiro.

117
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,550
Of course.

118
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,430
You've seen Kafka Hibino up close 
since the day he joined.

119
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,190
Our reports say you know him 
from before that, as well.

120
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,060
Yes.

121
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,520
But from the trials to now, 
I haven't given him any special treatment.

122
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,150
Our records show that she failed 
Kafka Hibino during the exam.

123
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,910
It was Vice-Captain Hoshina's suggestion 
that he be selected as a backup.

124
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,250
To be clear, we've almost 
entirely reached our conclusion.

125
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,290
We simply need your report for the papework.

126
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,300
Which means your testimony will have 
no influence on Kaiju No. 8's fate.

127
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,390
We don't want you to feel responsible 
for what happens here.

128
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,470
Understood.

129
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,560
Speak.

130
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,860
I'll leave it to the specialists to decide
whether Kafka Hibino is a human or a Kaiju.

131
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,320
Instead, I'll tell you what I know of him
 as a Defense Force officer.

132
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,580
During the Sagamihara Neutralization Operation,

133
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,960
Officer Kafka Hibino contributed to his unit 
by discovering the Yoju's reproductive organs.

134
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,130
He's continued to be a hard worker who's 
saved the lives of his comrades many times.

135
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,670
Especially notable was the battle with No. 10,

136
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,740
where he saved the Third Division from 
being wiped out by destroying the Yoju bomb.

137
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,220
And so what?

138
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,600
That was only possible 
because he used his Kaiju power.

139
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,150
The fact that a rookie officer was 
capable of all that is proof he's a Kaiju!

140
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,400
Yes, that's correct.

141
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,320
His unleashed combat power 
at the time he joined was 0%.

142
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,410
He only passed the exam as a backup.

143
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,910
He'd failed the Defense Force exam
twelve times straight prior to that.

144
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,960
Age-wise, he's also 
the oldest of any of our recruits.

145
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,710
So he must've used his Kaiju power to cheat!

146
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,280
But he didn't give up.

147
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,930
No matter how many times he failed,

148
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,100
even though his combat power was zero...

149
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,100
Even though his body had 
turned into a Kaiju...

150
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,440
He never stopped trying to save people.

151
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,610
Out of all the people I know, Kafka Hibino

152
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,570
hates giving up,
 cares for others more than anyone,

153
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,160
and...

154
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,790
Miiko!

155
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,580
And he has more humanity than anyone.

156
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,330
What is the deciding factor as to whether 
Kafka Hibino should be trusted as an officer?

157
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,040
I believe it's his heart.

158
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,550
We're not asking your personal opinion!

159
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,470
Stop trying to cover for your subordinate.

160
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,600
We can't trust something as vague 
and ill-defined as his "heart"!

161
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,680
Thank you, Captain Ashiro.

162
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,100
Return to your post.

163
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,540
We've heard what his commanding officer felt.

164
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,120
Nobody will accuse us 
of a hasty decision now.

165
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,370
We're ready to dispose of him now.

166
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,540
Your decision, Director General.

167
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,340
No. 8 will...

168
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,390
<i>I hated myself for not 
being able to do anything.</i>

169
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,480
<i>I told myself I'd make the Kaiju pay
 for making her cry like that.</i>

170
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,990
<i>So I'd decided that if I was gonna
become a Kaiju in both body and mind,</i>

171
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,370
<i>I'd rather die as a human.</i>

172
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,090
I'm... alive?

173
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,210
You're awake?

174
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,510
D-Director General Shinomiya!

175
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,510
Calm down.

176
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm not here to hurt you.

177
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm so glad...

178
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,230
If anything happened to you,

179
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,230
I could never face Kikoru.

180
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,160
If I'm still alive, does that 
mean you accept that I'm human?

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
That I'm a member of the Defense Force?

182
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:51,040
If what was inside your chest 
was the frail heart of a human,

183
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,050
you would've died back there.

184
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,050
I'll tell you what the council decided.

185
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,930
You're a Kaiju.

186
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,650
But we'll decide later if you're a threat.

187
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,900
At the moment, most people 
are opposed to letting you live.

188
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,910
Kaiju No. 8 will fight for us.
He will not be converted into weaponry.

189
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,950
I object!

190
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,080
We can't use a living Kaiju in combat!

191
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,040
It's dangerous!

192
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,500
There's no precedent!

193
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

194
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm Kafka Hibino.

195
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,590
I've decided that he can be controlled.

196
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,220
It's a fact that he's been doing missions 
with the Third Division for months.

197
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,060
It's not clear if a weapon made from him 
would be able to produce that much power.

198
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,060
With as many Daikaiju as we're seeing,

199
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,070
we need to use our forces
in the most optimal way possible.

200
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,570
But there's no precedent for this.

201
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,570
Precedent?

202
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,230
Precedents are meaningless
in the face of this country's defense.

203
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,540
Surely none of you have forgotten the series
of disasters involving No. 6 ten years ago.

204
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,880
Over two hundred officers
 and three captains lost their lives.

205
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,880
Including your wife.

206
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,590
If a swarm of Kaiju emerges with numbers
that far exceed our estimates,

207
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,890
this nation could easily be destroyed.

208
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:30,890
But if we can utilize his incredible power,
we might stand a sliver of a chance.

209
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,690
Even so,

210
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,190
we stand opposed.

211
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,450
Kafka Hibino.

212
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,320
<i>He said my name?</i>

213
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Prove your worth if you want to survive.

214
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,880
<i>So they're just leaving me alive 
so I can be used as a weapon?</i>

215
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,170
I still think of myself 
as a Defense Force officer.

216
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,970
I'll make you accept me as one too!

217
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Mina Ashiro

218
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Kafka Hibino:
Disposal Deferred

219
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,300
<i>But... I can't be entirely happy.</i>

220
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,720
<i>Now I need to get stronger...</i>

221
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,730
<i>Or I won't be able to stop him if I need to.</i>

222
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,730
Is this...

223
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,230
Did the SDF do this?

224
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,070
No, they didn't.

225
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,110
Then this is...

226
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,450
A victory Kafka Hibino won for himself!

227
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,170
Hâ€”

228
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,210
Hooray!

229
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,920
You did it, Old Dude!

230
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,010
God was watching out for you, I guess!

231
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I'm so glad, Hibino-san!

232
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,470
It's gonna get noisy around here again.

233
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,470
Hey, Reno, it says the old dude's saved!

234
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,940
I knew.

235
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,020
I told you, right?
I was sure he was coming back.

236
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,740
<i>When you get back, I'll be way 
stronger than I am now, Senpai!</i>

237
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,990
I'm glad it worked out for Hibino-san.

238
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,080
The hard part's just beginning, though.

239
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,250
If people outside the Force
 knew we had a Kaiju...

240
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,380
Well, it's a secret, right?

241
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,380
They'll find out someday.

242
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm sure the brass knows that too.

243
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,170
Then...

244
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,640
Kafka Hibino needs to prove he's useful 
enough that nobody can refuse his help.

245
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,970
Things are gonna get 
even harder from now on.

246
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,070
Hey, we're not done talking.

247
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,860
Wake up.

248
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,950
Wait for me, Mina...

249
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,710
Huh? You lost?

250
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,340
Game duration of seven minutes? That's fast!

251
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,260
Nothing I could do!

252
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,390
This "Number 9" guy 
started playing last week,

253
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,350
and all of a sudden he's top of the pile!

254
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,140
That should do it.

255
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,560
I've figured out mankind's 
intellectual level.

256
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,980
On an individual basis, it's nothing special.

257
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,450
So their weapon is the ability to accumulate 
knowledge across generations, then.

258
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,410
What about on your end?

259
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,870
I've more or less figured out 
the layout of the base.

260
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,170
Now we can move our plan to the next phase.

261
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,090
Yes, goodbye.

262
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:38,470
Time to bring the Kaiju power that fell
into human hands back to our side.
