1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,480
When that Kaiju showed up 
and you told me to run away...

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,190
If you hadn't saved my life then,

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,780
I would've died today.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,030
You really should think 
about joining the Defense Force.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,870
Thanks, Ichikawa.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,000
You really are a nice guy.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,460
I'm going to give 
the Defense Force another go—

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,090
Found you.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,890
A Kai... A Kai—

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,270
Senpai?

11
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't worry!

12
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,200
"Whenever you get scared...

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,950
I'll always be right by your side!"

14
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,740
Hah! You read too much manga, Kafka-kun.

15
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,830
That's so corny!

16
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't you dare tell my mom, 
or your mom, that I said that!

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,130
They'll tell the whole neighborhood...

18
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,430
Thanks...

19
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah. If we're together, 
there's nothing to be afraid of.

20
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
The Kaiju was sighted inside a hospital.

21
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,700
Before it can harm anyone...

22
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,410
we need to defeat it.

23
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,760
Episode 2  The Kaiju Who Defeats Kaiju

24
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,540
<i>A small Kaiju has appeared within Yokohama.</i>

25
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,590
<i>I repeat. A small Kaiju 
has appeared within Yokohama.</i>

26
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,590
This alert sound is so annoying...

27
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,170
Fix it, government.

28
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,670
Sho-chan, hurry!

29
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,550
<i>Citizens are asked to evacuate 
to shelters, or lock their doors...</i>

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,390
Turn off the lights.

31
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,310
<i>Take necessary precaution
 to keep yourself safe.</i>

32
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,440
Oh! We can show him
it's a misunderstanding!

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,820
Senpai, give him a smile!

34
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,280
A-A smile?

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,740
Got it! A smile!

36
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,120
Yeah, that's definitely not gonna work.

37
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,490
I knew it!

38
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,500
Hey, gramps, you okay?

39
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,410
Huh?

40
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,340
D-Did I do that?

41
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm, like, totally a Kaiju!

42
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,970
Wh-What was that? An explosion?

43
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,890
Is everything okay?

44
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,890
Huh? A Kaiju?

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,770
The Defense Force is probably on their way!

46
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,560
Let's scram!

47
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Yeah!

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,520
I'll cause trouble 
for the hospital if I stay here!

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,570
Let's escape out the window!

50
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,620
Should've seen that coming!

51
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,040
What's going on with my body?

52
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,830
Call the doctors!

53
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,580
Let's get going, Senpai!

54
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,210
H-Hey! Wait!

55
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,770
The Kaiju is fleeing from 
Yokohama South General Hospital.

56
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,930
It's heading for an evacuated area.

57
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,900
<i>What's going on?</i>

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,190
<i>Senpai's a Kaiju?</i>

59
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,530
<i>Since when? How?</i>

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,400
<i>And wait... is he even really a Kaiju?</i>

61
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,570
Um, let me just confirm real quick...

62
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,740
It's really you, right, Senpai?

63
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm not even sure anymore!

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,830
What is that? Some kind of special mode?

65
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,170
That's what I want to know!

66
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,430
Look, Ichikawa! I'm eating a bird alive!

67
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,600
Eww! That's really disgusting, Senpai!

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,190
Oh! I'm back!

69
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,600
You even revert creepily!

70
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,480
Ichikawa, trouble!

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,230
Now what?!

72
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,320
I gotta pee!

73
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Now?

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,530
Hold it in!

75
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,950
No, I think my body's gonna piss on its own!

76
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,490
I can't hold it in!

77
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,330
This isn't good!

78
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,540
I'm a grown man! I don't want to 
piss on a public street!

79
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,250
Where would you piss from, anyway?

80
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,960
I don't see the right parts...

81
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,100
Senpai!

82
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,600
Now nobody will ever take me as a bride!

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,930
I'll just die here!

84
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,440
No, you've got other stuff 
to worry about, right?

85
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,690
Now let's get going!

86
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,030
But you know, Ichikawa...

87
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,610
What happens to me now?

88
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,950
Think I can join the Defense Force?

89
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,910
No way! No way! No way!

90
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,780
You're what they're defending people from!

91
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,290
They'll kill you on sight!

92
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,290
Yeah, I figured!

93
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,540
<i>Huh?</i>

94
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,290
<i>Which means...</i>

95
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,220
<i>I'll never be able to 
join the Defense Force?</i>

96
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,470
<i>Damn it...</i>

97
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,310
<i>Just when I'd decided to try 
and catch up to her...</i>

98
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,810
<i>How can I do that with this body?</i>

99
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,350
Senpai!

100
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,230
No Entry

101
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,480
That's a cordon.

102
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,030
Once we're inside, there'll be nobody around.

103
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,490
Senpai?

104
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,280
Shh! Something's coming.

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,330
The Defense Force?

106
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,200
No, it's coming from underground...

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,750
What's this?

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,380
Another Kaiju?

109
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,260
Car 2, maintain course.

110
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,930
We'll head to the new location.

111
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,390
It's the same type 
as the one that attacked us.

112
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,480
You can tell?

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,110
That means they'll have fewer men 
to send after you, though.

114
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,480
This is our chance to hide.

115
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,280
Luckily, they already started evacuating 
when the alert was sent out about you.

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,700
Let's just pray there'll be no casualties.

117
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,260
Mommy! Mommy!

118
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,510
Run... quickly!

119
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,640
Just wait! I'll get you out!

120
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,940
Run!

121
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,490
No! You're coming with me!

122
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,580
Run... please...

123
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,420
Please!

124
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,960
Please!

125
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,630
Please!

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,420
Please!

127
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,710
No!

128
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,430
Mommy!

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,430
Please! Please! Please!

130
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
W...

131
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,620
Wow. I'm really strong.

132
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,950
You okay?

133
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,660
Yeah, of course. Sorry. Sorry.

134
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,670
Um...

135
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,580
Smile!

136
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,040
No!

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
G-Got it! I'll be gone 
in a moment! So don't cry!

138
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,130
Senpai!

139
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,590
H-Hey...

140
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,810
Mommy! Mommy!

141
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,440
She's just unconscious. She'll be fine.

142
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Really?

143
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,520
Yeah.

144
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,360
Ichikawa, get them out of here.

145
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,780
What are you going to do?

146
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,950
I'm gonna try...

147
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,370
Punching it as hard as I can.

148
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,370
Let's get out of here!

149
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,130
One, two...

150
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,050
Three!

151
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,790
You, uh...

152
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,090
definitely can't do that to a person.

153
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,760
Senpai...

154
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,060
It's safe now.

155
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,560
Get your mom to a hospital...

156
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,280
Listen. The Defense Force will be here soon.

157
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,120
I'll be gone in a second, so don't worry.

158
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,550
M-Mr. Kaiju...

159
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,180
Thank you.

160
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,850
Thank you.

161
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,310
Yeah. If we're together, 
there's nothing to be afraid of!

162
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,230
Yeah, as long as we're together!

163
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Let's go!

164
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,510
That's right...

165
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
I have to go.

166
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,390
Senpai, I've called for an ambulance.

167
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,390
Let's get out of here 
before someone arrives.

168
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,730
Senpai?

169
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,570
Ichikawa, I'm not giving up after all.

170
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,570
I have to go and stand by her side!

171
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,340
What happened here?

172
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,510
What the hell?

173
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,610
Tell me about the Kaiju you saw.

174
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,410
The Kaiju?

175
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,960
Don't worry.

176
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,130
I'll wipe out all the Kaiju.

177
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,840
Really?

178
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,220
Um, do you promise not to 
hurt the good Kaiju?

179
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,770
The one who saved my mom.

180
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,540
Drawing Based on Witness Testimony

181
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,660
<i>Kaiju No. 8.</i>

182
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,370
<i>This is the eighth Kaiju that 
the Defense Force has given a codename.</i>

183
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:20,550
Kaiju No. 8
(Witness Composite)

184
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,630
<i>No. 8 remains at large, with

185
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,590
They still haven't found this guy?

186
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,090
Right?

187

<i>Citizens have been reporting concern 
at this latest announcement.</i>

188
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,970
He's probably dead already.

189
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,840
<i>This has gotten way out of hand...</i>

The Secret World of Cryptids

195
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,350
<i>and every Defense Force officer 
in the country is looking for him now.</i>

196
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,860
Oh, right. Ichikawa.

197
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,070
You and Kafka got something in the mail.

198
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,610
He went to the job site early, 
so take this to him.

199
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,820
Okay...

200
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,330
It's that time already, huh?

201
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,040
Kafka-san used to take the exam every year.

202
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,540
Every single year.

203
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,960
And every year, we'd have to cheer him up.

Application Result

205
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,420
We are pleased to inform you that you have passed the first round
of the recently concluded Anti-Kaiju Defense Force selection tests.

206
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,880
Oh, you did it!

207
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,760
Nice!

208
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,630
Thanks.

209
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,550
Want me to take Kafka his?

210
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,010
No, it's fine.

211
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,640
I'll take it.

212
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,110
Looks like he passed, huh?

213
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,450
But this'll be the last chance ever, right?

214
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,330
I want him to have his 
one last shot, you know?

215
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,750
He's worked so hard for so long...

216
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Senpai!

217
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,890
You passed the first round of exams!

218
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,890
Seriously?

219
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,690
Why are you exposing yourself?!

220
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,650
Wow, it's a little early 
to play rough, right?

221
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,860
Your face! Your face!

222
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,530
Do you know what you look like?

223
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,940
Crap!

224
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,820
I still slip up once in a while...

225
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,910
All back to normal!

226
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,120
You're not back to normal!

227
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,410
You were on the news 
when I was at the office!

228
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,160
You have to be more careful!

229
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,540
Fine! Fine!

230
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,870
I'm sorry!

231
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,460
<i>Senpai and I...</i>

232
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,170
You're the patients from the room!

233
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,460
You okay?

234
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,510
Yeah, we just barely survived...

235
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,100
<i>We told everyone we ran away 
when the Kaiju showed up.</i>

236
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,100
<i>I think we fooled everybody, but...</i>

237
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,730
Here. This is yours.

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,230
Application Result

239
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,230
We are pleased to inform you that you have passed the first round
of the recently concluded Anti-Kaiju Defense Force selection tests.

240
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,070
Good. Good stuff.

241
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,860
I thought you'd be happier.

242
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,580
It's always the second round where I fail!

243
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,240
Why do you seem proud of that?

244
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,040
So, what will you do?

245
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,500
Are you really going to take 
the second round of exams, with that body?

246
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
It'll be fine!

247
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,460
Nobody'll know!

248
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,210
You're not gonna fool anyone!

249
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,630
For Disposal

250
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,090
The first round is just 
a written test and some paperwork,

251
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,220
For Delivery

252
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,510
but there'll be officers 
everywhere at the second.

253
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,220
They'll kill you on sight.

254
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,100
Even so, I'm taking it.

255
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,350
Totsuka Construction

256
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,770
I've spent the past three 
months trying as hard as I can,

257
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,560
and I can't find a way to turn back.

258
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,150
I'm 32 years old. This is my last chance.

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,320
Japan Defense Force

260
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,320
Now Recruiting

261
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,080
All right.

262
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,160
But even if something happens to you, 
I'm not going to drop out.

263
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,370
If we're gonna do this, 
we're doing it as rivals.

264
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,470
I can't get the cap off...

265
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,050
I take it back!

266
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,050
Skip the exam!

267
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,810
I'll be fine! I'll be fine!

268
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,310
I'll be good when it's time for the exam!

269
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,980
Transform back!

270
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,980
Don't abandon me.

271
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,730
Seriously, no matter what 
happens, I'm not helping you!

272
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,730
Everybody will be here soon, 
so get it together!

273
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,990
Whew...

274
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,950
If he'd passed and I hadn't,

275
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,580
I wouldn't be able to call 
myself his senpai anymore...

276
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,630
Okay. Time for my revenge match.

277
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,340
10 Days Later

280
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,040
Wow...

281
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,500
So this is the Defense Force's
 Tachikawa Base...

282
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,880
I went to Kumagaya Base on 
a field trip once, but this one's way bigger.

283
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,260
They share this area 
with a Self-Defense Forces garrison.

284
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,350
When something happens, 
both sides work together

285
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,470
to dispatch troops all over western Tokyo.

286
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,730
If you transformed here, 
you'd be dead within seconds.

287
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,460
No point in getting scared.

288
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,750
Let's go!

289
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,920
Hey, old man.

290
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,250
We're a little early, 
but let's get checked in.

291
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,920
I said, old man.

292
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,960
Senpai?

293
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,890
Yes. You.

294
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,510
Pay attention, old man.

295
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,680
Old Man?

296
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,680
Me?

297
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,020
<i>Is she taking the exam too?</i>

298
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,400
I'm not an old man! I'm still just 32!

299
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,450
That makes you old.

300
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,780
It does?

301
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,620
Well, it does.

303
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,750
That rust bucket is yours, right?

304
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,910
It's in the way.

305
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,040
I can't park my car, so move it.

306
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,050
There's tons of open spots!

307
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,760
I want to park it there.

308
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,470
My lucky number today is five.

309
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,260
Your lucky number?

310
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,100
What's the deal with this little brat?

311
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,560
Come with me.

312
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,150
This young man is going to 
teach you a lesson in manners.

313
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,900
Whatever.

314
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,440
I'll move it myself.

315
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,570
What are you going to do?

316
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,750

No! The company car!

Kikoru Shinomiya.

322
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,040
My hobby is murdering Kaiju.

323
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,200
Remember that.

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,580
<i>Shinomiya? That last name...</i>

325
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,590
Anyway, old man...

326
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,800
Did you know you smell like a Kaiju?
