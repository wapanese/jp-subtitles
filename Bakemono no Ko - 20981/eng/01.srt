1
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:42,140
Bakemono no Ko

2
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:09,440
Bakemono no Ko

3
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:42,760
hidai shita monsuta no atama wo kakushimotta sandanjuu de shitomeru

4
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:42,760
I shoot the head of the fat monster with my concealed shotgun

5
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:49,660
kondo koso chuucho nado sezu ni

6
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:49,660
this time, without hesitation,

7
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:55,790
sono hikigane wo hikitai

8
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:55,790
I want to pull the trigger

9
01:54:56,830 --> 01:55:01,520
aitsu no shoutai ha kyoeishin

10
01:54:56,830 --> 01:55:01,520
Is he actually vain?

11
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:08,030
shippai wo osoreru kyoufushin

12
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:08,030
Does he fear mistakes?

13
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:20,640
mochiagerare ukiashidatte fukureagatta jisonshin

14
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:20,640
Or does his conceits swell up with flattery?

15
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:26,800
saa midareta kokyuu wo totonoe

16
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:26,800
Calming down my shaken breathing

17
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:34,810
yubisaki ni ishiki wo atsumeteiku

18
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:34,810
I gather my consciousness in my fingertip

19
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:40,880
boku dake ga ikeru sekai de juusei ga todoroku

20
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:40,880
A gunshot roars in the world only I can go to

21
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:47,450
mabayui hakanai senkou ga kaketeitta

22
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:47,450
A dazzling, fleeting flash of light sprung forth

23
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:53,100
nanika ga owari mata nanika ga hajimarunda

24
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:53,100
"Something ends and something begins"

25
01:55:53,100 --> 01:56:01,150
sou kitto sono hikari ha boku ni sousakenderu

26
01:55:53,100 --> 01:56:01,150
I'm sure that's what the light cries at me

27
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:17,390
oitsumeta monsuta no me no okuni

28
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:17,390
Deep within the cornered monster's eyes

29
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:23,200
kodoku to junsuisa wo mitsukeru

30
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:23,200
I find loneliness and innocence

31
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:30,320
suterareta koneko mitai ni

32
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:30,320
like an abandoned kitten

33
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:36,210
karada wo marume obieteru

34
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:36,210
he curls up, frightened

35
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:49,920
aa kono mama ropude tsunaide kainarashiteku koto ga dekitanara

36
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:49,920
If I can put a rope on him and domesticate him like this

37
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,900
ikutsu mono sentakushi to kanousei ni kakomare

38
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,900
I'm surrounded by countless choices and possibilities

39
01:56:55,900 --> 01:57:02,210
sagashite nozondeta mono ga boyaketeiku

40
01:56:55,900 --> 01:57:02,210
What I was looking for and wishing for becomes blurred

41
01:57:02,210 --> 01:57:07,900
nanika ga umare mata nanika ga shindeikunda

42
01:57:02,210 --> 01:57:07,900
"Something is born and something dies"

43
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:16,240
sou kitto soko kara ha nigerare ha shinai darou

44
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:16,240
I'm sure he won't run away from there

45
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:21,220
odayaka sugiru yuugure

46
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:21,220
The gently passing evening

47
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:23,810
mayonaka no shijima

48
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:23,810
The silence of the dead of night

49
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:27,220
mata monsuta ga abaredasu

50
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:27,220
The monsters get enraged once again

51
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:33,200
boku ha sotto iki wo koroshi

52
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:33,200
I hold my breath quietly

53
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:36,310
dansou ni tama wo komeru

54
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:36,310
And load bullets into the magazine

55
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:44,380
kono shizuka na sakki wo kanzukarechi mawanu youni

56
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:44,380
getting a smell of this quiet bloodlust

57
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:52,160
kyou mo boku dake ga ikeru sekai de juusei ga todoruku

58
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:52,160
Today again a gunshot roars in the world only I can go to

59
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:58,310
mabayui hakanai senkou ga kaketeitta

60
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:58,310
A dazzling, fleeting flash of light sprung forth

61
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:04,020
nanika ga owari mata nanika ga hajimarunda

62
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:04,020
"Something ends and something begins"

63
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:10,880
koushite zutto kono sekai ha mawatteru

64
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:10,880
This is how this world will always go round

65
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:17,190
nanika ga owari mata nanika ga hajimarunda

66
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:17,190
"Something ends and something begins"

67
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:25,510
kitto kitto

68
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:25,510
Definitely, definitely
