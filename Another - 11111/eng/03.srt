1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,600
Shall I show you?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,200
Shall I show you...

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,900
...what's under this eyepatch?

4
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,740
An artificial eye?

5
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,510
My left eye is a doll's.

6
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,080
It can see things that 
should remain unseen,

7
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,500
so I usually keep it covered.

8
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,860
Do you feel ill?

9
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,200
This might not be a good place for you, 
since you're not used to it.

10
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,670
Not a good place?

11
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,800
The dolls...

12
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,100
Dolls are hollow, you see.

13
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,850
Completely hollow, in body and soul.

14
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,860
That void connects them with death.

15
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,740
But hollow things seek to fill their emptiness.

16
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,250
Don't you feel as though this 
place is drawing something out of you?

17
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,750
Yeah.

18
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,240
We should go.

19
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,500
It's more comfortable upstairs.

20
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,460
Do you live around here?

21
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,850
Yes.

22
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,760
That thing about "Yomi at Twilight"...

23
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,960
Is that the name of this shop?

24
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,440
Feel free to drop in. -Studio M

25
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,320
What is Studio M?

26
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
Kirika's studio.

27
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,210
It's on the second floor.

28
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,510
Kirika?

29
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,820
The person who makes these dolls.

30
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,240
The ones in the basement, too?

31
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes, I think they're all Kirika's.

32
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,960
Why does that doll...

33
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,280
...look so much like you?

34
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,340
Who knows?

35
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,240
When I first met you, 
weren't you holding a doll?

36
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,350
Yes.

37
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,010
I heard a girl died 
at the hospital that day.

38
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,070
Was it for her?

39
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,740
I mean, um...

40
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,770
<i>I think her name was Misaki, or Masaki.</i>

41
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,490
<i>Something like that.</i>

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,610
Do you have any sisters?

43
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,810
<i>Apparently, she was an only daughter,</i>

44
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,880
<i>so her parents were devastated.</i>

45
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,760
Why are you...

46
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,270
Why indeed.

47
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,560
<i>I have no other customers.</i>

48
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,280
Do you have something else to ask me?

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,410
Well, yes.

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,100
A few things seem strange to me.

51
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,570
Like...

52
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,040
I warned you not to get close to me.

53
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,910
But it may be too late.

54
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,940
Too late?

55
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,260
You don't know a thing about it, do you?

56
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,720
There's an old story in this town...

57
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,300
...about the class 3 of 26 years ago.

58
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,990
I'm guessing nobody has told you.

59
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,160
There was a student in that class...

60
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,280
...who excelled in sports and her studies.

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,540
She was kind to everyone.

62
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,520
She was loved by teachers 
and students alike.

63
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,090
But shortly after starting 9th grade, she died.

64
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,670
How?

65
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,570
The story I heard said she was in 
a plane crash with her family.

66
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,560
But there are several other theories.

67
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,480
Some say it was a car accident.

68
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,310
Others claim she died in a house fire.

69
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,900
Regardless, everyone in the 
class was terribly shocked.

70
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,590
They were overcome with grief.

71
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,320
But then, suddenly, someone said,

72
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,080
"She isn't dead."

73
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,410
He pointed at her desk and said,

74
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,540
"Look, she's right there.

75
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,830
See? She's alive and well."

76
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,840
Then, other students started 
saying the same thing.

77
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,570
"It's true, she's not dead."

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,750
That behavior spread through

79
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,010
the rest of the class, like a chain reaction.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,790
They didn't want to believe the truth.

81
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,250
They didn't want to accept the cruel reality.

82
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm sure you can relate.

83
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,410
Everyone in the class 
continued with that act,

84
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,240
insisting that the girl was still alive.

85
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,040
Even the homeroom teacher 
took their side, declaring,

86
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,630
"It's true, she's alive.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,730
So all of you should continue 
to work hard as a team,

88
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,970
until the day you all graduate together."

89
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,850
The principal even arranged to have her seat

90
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,610
included in the graduation ceremony.

91
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,890
Is this... a true story?

92
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,260
Then, after graduation,

93
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,550
everyone gathered in the 
classroom for the class photo.

94
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,030
The whole class, including the teacher.

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,080
But when they looked at the 
photo, they noticed something.

96
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,140
There in the photo, off to the side,

97
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,790
they could see the girl 
who should have been gone.

98
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,090
Her face was deathly pale,

99
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,290
but she smiled like all the others.

100
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,910
That girl...

101
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,550
The student who died...

102
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,010
...was named Misaki.

103
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,230
There's more to this story.

104
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,110
Oh, sorry.

105
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm sorry, Grandma.

106
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,620
Yeah, I'm okay.

107
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,740
I just got a little sidetracked.

108
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,820
I'm heading home now.

109
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,230
I hate those devices.

110
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,800
You can be found, and caught, anywhere.

111
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,970
It's closing time.

112
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,480
Please go on home now.

113
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,740
1998 Midterm Exam Schedule
Grade 9 Exam Dates
Math | Science
Social Studies | Japanese

114
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,950
Once exams are over, 
we start career counseling...

115
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,130
Having to discuss that 
formally with a teacher

116
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,280
is so depressing.

117
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,770
These days, high school 
acceptance rates are over 95%.

118
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,880
So don't worry.

119
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,260
There's a high school out 
there even you could get into.

120
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,230
Is that supposed to encourage me?

121
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,330
That was my intent.

122
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,720
Where are you gonna go?

123
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,020
West High.

124
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,690
Are your grades that high?

125
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,730
I'm working on them.

126
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,520
Oh yeah?

127
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,610
Ah...

128
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,360
Well, good luck with that.

129
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,580
At any rate, you're stuck 
with me until graduation.

130
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,660
Keep your strength up!

131
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,200
You're stuck?

132
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,550
We've been together since 2nd grade.

133
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,950
We're even neighbors.

134
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,520
When we were kids,

135
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,300
we did all kinds of stupid stuff together.

136
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,370
But now he's turned into 
this pseudo-honors student

137
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,420
who can't keep up with my improv.

138
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,670
To me, it just looks like 
you haven't changed.

139
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,940
I've changed a lot!

140
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,930
What do you know about me?

141
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,770
I know things about you 
that even you don't know.

142
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,750
Like what?

143
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,070
That's how we're stuck with each other.

144
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,750
Makes sense.

145
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,500
So, what are you gonna do about high school?

146
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,340
Go back to Tokyo?

147
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,120
Yeah.

148
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,260
My dad will be back in Japan by next spring.

149
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,820
You'll go to a private school there?

150
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,710
Probably.

151
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,710
That's one way, I guess.

152
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,210
What do you mean?

153
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,430
Maybe I'll go to a private 
school in Tokyo, too.

154
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,300
What school are you going to, Kouichi?

155
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,100
K High.

156
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,740
K High, huh?

157
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,190
Akazawa, you're going to Tokyo?

158
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,060
If I do, I suppose I'll live on my own.

159
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,390
Weren't you going to that

160
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,670
Sacred Heart something-or-other 
girls' school?

161
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,740
I never said I wanted to go there!

162
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,280
Another one who's trying too hard for nothing.

163
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,110
Sakakibara?

164
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,280
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

165
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,810
No.

166
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,770
I didn't think I'd need one.

167
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,040
Um...

168
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,790
Would you like to walk home with me, then?

169
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,850
My house is just past yours.

170
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,570
But... I couldn't ask you to do that.

171
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,480
It's no big deal.

172
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,430
Come on, let's go.

173
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,650
By the way, what do you do 
for class trips here?

174
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,780
We went to Tokyo, last year.

175
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,350
We went to a big amusement park,

176
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,520
and to the top of Tokyo Tower.

177
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,950
It was so much fun.

178
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,750
You went to Tokyo, huh?

179
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,710
I love Tokyo. There are so 
many fun things to do.

180
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,970
I wish I could go to school there...

181
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,680
Why don't you?

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,390
My family can't afford it.

183
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,600
Wait, aren't class trips 
usually a 9th grade thing?

184
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,080
Not here. We go during 
the 8th grade fall term.

185
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,540
Although, it used to be in 
the 9th grade spring term.

186
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,010
Used to?

187
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,200
Um, yeah...

188
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,090
I don't know when it changed.

189
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,210
<i>I don't dislike rain.</i>

190
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,150
Hey, Sakuragi?

191
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,710
What is Misaki like?

192
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't...

193
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,030
Don't what?

194
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,580
Don't ever speak that name in class 3!

195
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,120
What?

196
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,650
But why—

197
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,770
Man, the rain's gotten worse.

198
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,590
Hey, do you know the story

199
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,900
about the class 3 of 26 years ago?

200
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,140
You actually believe stories like that?

201
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,220
How...

202
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,080
How do you know...

203
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,390
I just heard a rumor.

204
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,310
How much did you hear?

205
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,330
A popular student suddenly died,

206
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:53,490
and then she showed up in 
the class' graduation photo.

207
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,840
That's about it.

208
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,130
Only the first year...

209
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,310
Why do you all look so serious?

210
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,180
Sakakibara knows about the first year...

211
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,100
Good morning, Rei!

212
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,410
Rei!

213
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,600
Yeah, yeah, morning.

214
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,270
Ah. That's a delicate issue.

215
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,280
Let's try to keep it as quiet 
as possible, for now.

216
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,410
Just keep an eye on things.

217
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,960
I'm home!

218
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,740
Welcome back.

219
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,220
Hey, don't you have exams next week?

220
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,090
Figure they'll be a breeze?

221
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,190
Not at all.

222
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,450
I'm doing all the studying I need to.

223
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay then, sorry I asked.

224
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,610
Man, I'm beat!

225
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,610
Um, Reiko?

226
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Do you remember which 9th 
grade class my mom was in?

227
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,420
Nope.

228
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,320
Then, do you know the story about 
the class 3 of 26 years ago?

229
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,180
Reiko?

230
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,610
Huh?

231
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,220
Um... I was asking about the 
class 3 of 26 years ago.

232
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,060
That story's been swirling around for years.

233
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,820
I heard there's a continuation to it.

234
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,530
You don't know all of it?

235
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,770
You know it, don't you?

236
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,190
That type of story tends to get embellished.

237
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,390
I don't think you should 
take it too seriously.

238
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,560
There's a right time to 
find out about everything.

239
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,520
Ritsuko was in class 3.

240
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,840
Why, Rei?

241
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,770
Why?

242
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,820
Hang on.

243
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,130
Entry Prohibited

244
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,470
Yeah?

245
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,930
Are you all right?

246
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,560
Why do you ask?

247
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
I called because I thought 
you were in trouble!

248
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,030
Akazawa looks like she's 
about to blow her top!

249
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,310
Why would she...

250
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,190
Listen, Sakaki.

251
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,390
Don't mess with things that don't exist!

252
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,750
What are you talking about?

253
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,220
It's dangerous!

254
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,960
As for that story you asked about yesterday,

255
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,210
I'll tell you everything next month.

256
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,250
So, for the rest of this month, just—

257
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,230
It's about that girl who died at the hospital.

258
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,950
Did you find something?

259
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,230
Her name was Misaki.

260
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,870
Misaki, not Masaki.

261
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,720
The "mi" used in "future,"

262
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,510
and the "saki" meaning "blooming flowers."

263
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,740
And it turns out her surname was Fujioka.

264
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,780
Misaki Fujioka?

265
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,250
Why do you want to know about her?

266
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,830
Um, well...

267
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,750
You don't have to tell me now.

268
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,640
But someday, okay?

269
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,790
Okay.

270
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,220
By the way, you have exams coming up, right?

271
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,510
Yes.

272
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,430
My little brother's studying like crazy, too.

273
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,730
You have a brother?

274
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,010
Two, actually.

275
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,020
They're both total muscleheads, though.

276
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
They don't care one bit about books!

277
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,680
I don't think they've ever read 
anything except manga.

278
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,520
Isn't that just awful?

279
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,530
May 26 (Tue.)

280
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,920
You're always done early.

281
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,270
Am I?

282
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,070
You left before the exam period 
ended yesterday, too.

283
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,690
Is everything okay?

284
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,020
Yes, I'm fine.

285
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,330
So, her name was Misaki Fujioka.

286
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,690
The girl who died.

287
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,270
Misaki...

288
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,910
Misaki was my cousin.

289
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,880
We used to be together all the time.

290
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,030
We were much more closely connected.

291
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,170
Connected?

292
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,530
Hey...

293
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,730
About class 3 from 26 years ago...

294
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,780
What's the rest of the story?

295
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,820
Nobody will tell you?

296
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,370
No.

297
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,010
I suppose that's understandable.

298
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,660
There's something I've wanted to ask.

299
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,840
Something I've been wondering 
 since I transferred here.

300
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,500
Why does everyone in our class,

301
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,960
even our teachers, act like you—

302
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,090
Because I don't exist.

303
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,980
<i>Listen, Sakaki.</i>

304
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,840
<i>Don't mess with things that don't exist!</i>

305
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,840
That's...

306
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,100
<i>It's dangerous!</i>

307
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,910
But...

308
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,530
None of them can see me.

309
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:43,610
What if you're the only 
one who can see me?

310
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,660
No...

311
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,840
It can't be...

312
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,300
That's...

313
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,520
What's wrong with her?

314
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,050
Put flesh.
