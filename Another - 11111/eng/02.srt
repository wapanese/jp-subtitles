1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,610
Hey there.

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,130
Why...

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,470
Are you okay with this?

4
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,740
Well...

5
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,200
You should be careful.

6
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,750
It may have already begun.

7
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,890
And just what is this?

8
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Um, it's a lemon.

9
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,450
That's a lemon?

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,770
It's "The Lemon's Scream."

11
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,840
Are you sure that's how you want to draw it?

12
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,050
This is how the lemon looks to me.

13
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,890
It's not in line with the 
objective of the class...

14
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,100
But I suppose it's all right.

15
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,550
That said, you should save things 
like this for the art club.

16
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,270
Okay. I'm sorry.

17
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,020
No need to apologize.

18
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,370
Go ahead and finish it up.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,390
Are you a fan of Munch?

20
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,330
Yeah, kind of.

21
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,770
Mochizuki definitely has a 
drawing style all his own.

22
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,010
The lemon is screaming?

23
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,310
No, actually, it's the world that's screaming.

24
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,840
The lemon is covering its ears

25
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,030
because it's terrified of the sound.

26
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,030
So, you're in the art club, huh?

27
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,130
Yeah.

28
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,220
It just started up again this year.

29
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,660
Are you planning to join 
any clubs, Sakakibara?

30
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,310
I haven't decided.

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,320
Would you be interested in the art club?

32
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
Me?

33
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,010
Yeah, I mean...

34
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,880
What are you drawing, Teshigawara?

35
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,250
An apple.

36
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,510
Apples don't have arms and legs.

37
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,310
This is how the apple looks to me!

38
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,950
Be serious!

39
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,430
I <i>am</i> sort of interested...

40
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,320
Hey, what do you think of Ms. Mikami?

41
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,810
I'm not sure how to answer that.

42
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,420
Well, I guess that's understandable.

43
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,240
Yeah.

44
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,960
She's not here?

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,170
Doesn't looking at Munch's "The Scream"

46
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,790
make you feel scared, or uneasy?

47
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,620
Uneasy?

48
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,520
Yes.

49
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,990
I feel uneasy about everything.

50
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,520
The painting draws out that emotion.

51
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,780
That's why I like it.

52
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,550
You like it because it makes you uneasy?

53
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,700
It doesn't do any good to pretend 
you can't see what's going on.

54
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,540
I think...

55
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,160
...it's the same for everyone.

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,890
Yo, Sakaki!

57
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,240
Talking about Ms. Mikami over here?

58
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,370
Let me in on that!

59
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,500
Unfortunately, we were talking 
about something a little darker.

60
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
What do you mean by...

61
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,390
...something darker?

62
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,100
The feeling of uneasiness 
enveloping the world.

63
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,330
What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,250
Haven't you ever felt that way?

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,800
Of course I have!

66
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,070
Like when I finally made it to the 9th grade,

67
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,990
only to end up in the cursed class 3...

68
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,930
Listen, Sakaki...

69
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,620
I've been wanting to tell you 
something since yesterday.

70
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,580
Don't you think that's a bad idea now?

71
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,830
Well, maybe, but...

72
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,620
What...

73
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,770
What's wrong?

74
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,580
Nothing. I've gotta go.

75
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,390
Hey, Sakaki!

76
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,840
That's not a...

77
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,560
Hey.

78
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,200
Was it okay to do that?

79
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,180
Do what?

80
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,460
They didn't try to stop you?

81
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,290
I guess not.

82
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,710
What are you drawing?

83
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,350
Is it based on some kind of model?

84
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,090
Or did you make it up?

85
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,270
Both, I guess.

86
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,350
At the end,

87
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,140
I'm going to give her enormous wings.

88
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,780
Is she an angel?

89
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,950
Who knows?

90
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,700
What were you doing out 
in the rain yesterday?

91
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,810
I don't dislike rain.

92
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,470
My favorite is the cold rain 
that falls in midwinter,

93
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,460
just before it turns into snow.

94
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,500
What's wrong with your left eye?

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,610
You've been wearing that eyepatch

96
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,280
since I met you in the hospital.

97
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,420
You want to know?

98
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,050
If you don't want to tell me, it's okay.

99
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,630
Then I won't.

100
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
You should head back to class.

101
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,270
I haven't seen you here before.

102
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm Sakakibara, from the 9th grade's class 3.

103
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,070
I just transferred here.

104
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,230
I'm Chibiki, the librarian.

105
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,850
You're welcome to come 
here anytime you like,

106
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,740
but you should get going now.

107
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,550
Yes, Sir.

108
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,350
Why, Rei?

109
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,680
Rei!

110
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,220
Chibiki, eh?

111
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,130
I'm pretty sure that was his name.

112
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,120
He acted like he was the master of that place.

113
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,460
He does give that impression, doesn't he?

114
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,290
The master of the library.

115
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,260
Antisocial, always dressed in black,

116
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,980
he gave almost all of us girls the creeps.

117
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,580
Did he say anything to you?

118
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,590
No, not really.

119
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,300
Okay.

120
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,080
Has the auxiliary library 
always been in that room?

121
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,540
Yes.

122
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,870
But it only became the auxiliary library

123
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,270
after the new building was finished.

124
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,100
By the way, Kouichi,

125
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,950
are you going to join a club?

126
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,800
Well...

127
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,700
Actually,

128
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,160
I was invited to join the art club today.

129
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,610
Do you like art?

130
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,640
It interests me.

131
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,250
I'm not very good at drawing, though.

132
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,900
But still...

133
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,170
Um, I've never told anyone 
this before, but...

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,870
If possible, I'd like to go 
to a fine arts school.

135
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,500
Oh? That's news to me!

136
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,170
I'd like to study carving and sculpting.

137
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,360
Does that sound crazy?

138
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,720
First of all, your father 
will undoubtedly oppose.

139
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,010
Second, even if you graduate,

140
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,280
you won't have any marketable skills.

141
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,130
Talent is a key factor, of course,

142
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,490
but without some luck on your 
side, you're likely to fail.

143
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,750
But if that's what you want 
to do, you might as well try.

144
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,320
It's just pathetic to give up on something

145
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,210
before you even give it a shot.

146
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,990
Pathetic?

147
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,690
Yes. That's important, isn't it?

148
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,960
Whether you look good or 
pathetic in your own eyes.

149
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,010
You think so?

150
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,410
Sakakibara!

151
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,780
Sorry. We're swamped during the day.

152
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,250
Is it okay for me to be here?

153
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,370
It's totally fine.

154
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,390
Thank you.

155
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,100
So, what are you reading these days?

156
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,420
The author you recommended to me, John Saul.

157
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,650
If only I could get my coworkers 
to read his stuff, too.

158
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,310
But that's not what you 
came to talk about, is it?

159
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,240
No.

160
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,370
There's something I wanted to ask you.

161
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,250
Did a girl die at this hospital last Monday?

162
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,300
Last Monday?

163
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,700
You were still here then, weren't you?

164
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,670
Why do you ask?

165
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,910
Something happened that made me wonder.

166
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,220
I get the feeling you're asking for a reason.

167
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,690
There were no deaths among the 
patients I was in charge of.

168
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,680
Changing the subject, then...

169
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,410
Did you see a girl

170
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,150
wearing a school uniform in any 
of the wards that day?

171
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,570
A girl, again?

172
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,070
She had a dark blue blazer, short hair...

173
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,700
and an eyepatch over her left eye.

174
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,850
An eyepatch?

175
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,540
So, an ophthalmology patient?

176
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,540
Hang on!

177
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,770
You saw her?

178
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,330
No.

179
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,020
But a girl who died...

180
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,390
There might have been one.

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,930
Really?

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,580
It's possible.

183
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,010
I think it was a girl, anyway.

184
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,490
I heard someone say a young patient died.

185
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,070
What was the patient's name?

186
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,050
Want me to find out for you?

187
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,180
Can you?

188
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,530
Sure, I could ask around.

189
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,000
If I dig anything up, I'll call your cell.

190
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,740
I know I've already asked, 
but are you sure it's okay for you to do this?

191
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,920
We'll just say you were 
concerned for a classmate.

192
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,440
You seem to have a good 
reason to want to know.

193
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,810
But in return, you'll have to 
tell me that reason sometime.

194
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,580
Got it, mister horror lover?

195
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,270
As you all know,

196
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,890
haiku is a type of fixed form poetry 
consisting of seventeen syllables,

197
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,720
divided into lines of five, seven, and five.

198
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,780
However, the term "haiku" 
itself is relatively new.

199
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,370
The name was coined approximately

200
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,020
one hundred years ago by 
a man named Shiki Masaoka.

201
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,790
Prior to then, the poems 
were called "haikai."

202
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,630
There are three important 
rules for composing haiku.

203
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,350
Sakakibara.

204
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,700
Are you heading home now?

205
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,230
Got a minute?

206
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,350
I see.

207
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,840
So you were born at Yomiyama Hospital.

208
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,810
My family moved to Tokyo 
shortly after, though.

209
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,820
And you lived in Tokyo from then on?

210
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,790
Yes.

211
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,650
Did you ever come back to visit?

212
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,610
My mom died right after she had me,

213
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,420
so not often.

214
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,560
I see.

215
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,710
Why do you ask?

216
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,190
I get this nagging feeling 
I've met you before.

217
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,320
Somewhere.

218
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,270
Maybe you're mistaking me for someone else?

219
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,100
That's part of why I wanted to ask.

220
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,580
So annoying.

221
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,340
Huh?

222
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,230
Oh, sorry.

223
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,910
I didn't mean you.

224
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm annoyed that I can't remember it clearly.

225
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,310
You shouldn't let it bother you.

226
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,680
This is part of being 
the head of countermeasures.

227
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,250
I have to do a good job.

228
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,380
What exactly does the 
head of countermeasures do?

229
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,660
In simple terms, I'm in 
charge of devising and

230
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,010
executing countermeasures 
to protect the class.

231
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,060
Protect the class?

232
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,250
Devising? Executing?

233
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,120
I want to make sure you understand 
the situation class 3 is in,

234
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,700
and the rules we must follow.

235
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,070
Akazawa!

236
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,690
What?

237
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,980
Hold on...

238
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,630
Actually...

239
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,530
What?!

240
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,820
Honestly,

241
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,060
I miss one day of school, 
and this is what happens?!

242
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,310
See you later.

243
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,460
Misakichou 3-3

244
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,380
The Hollow Blue Eyes of Yomi at Twilight

245
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,500
"The Hollow Blue Eyes of Yomi at Twilight."

246
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,500
What is this?

247
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,350
Feel free to drop in. 
-Studio M

248
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,620
Hello?

249
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,990
Sakakibara?

250
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,840
Ms. Mizuno?

251
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,390
About what we discussed the other day.

252
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,380
I found it.

253
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,050
They said it was a junior high school girl.

254
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,220
Apparently, she was an only daughter,

255
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,300
so her parents were devastated.

256
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,030
And her name?

257
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,400
What was the girl's name?

258
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm not sure, but...

259
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,810
Yes?

260
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,320
I think her name was Misaki, or Masaki.

261
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,850
Something like that.

262
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,410
I only heard it secondhand, 
so I don't know if it'sâ€”

263
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,720
Welcome.

264
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,240
My, it's unusual to see a 
boy your age here.

265
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,230
Are you a customer? Or perhaps...

266
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,860
Hello.

267
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,490
Um, this is a shop, right?

268
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,080
Are you a junior high student?

269
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
Yes, at Yomi North.

270
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,870
Admission: 500 yen

271
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,280
In that case, I'll give you half price.

272
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,870
Is this a doll shop?

273
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,240
About half and half.

274
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,350
I also sell,

275
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,470
but not at prices a junior 
high student could afford.

276
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,760
But, please, take your time looking around.

277
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,260
I have no other customers.

278
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,850
I could put on some tea as well, if you'd like.

279
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,040
Thanks, but I'll pass on the tea.

280
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,170
Very well.

281
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,580
Then, please take your time.

282
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,260
More This Way

283
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,500
Is that...

284
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,780
Mei? Why are you here?

285
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,240
Oh? So you don't dislike this sort of thing?

286
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Why are you here?

287
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,420
Why?

288
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,800
I wasn't hiding because 
I wanted to surprise you.

289
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,420
You just happened to come while I was here.

290
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,400
Did you think it looks like me?

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,220
Yeah...

292
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,220
It does, doesn't it?

293
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,150
But only half.

294
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,020
Maybe less than that.

295
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,930
Why are you here?

296
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,980
I don't dislike these things.

297
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:51,290
And why are you here, Sakakibara?

298
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,970
Well, um...

299
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,170
I was just walking around, and...

300
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,600
I mean, I don't know this 
town all that well yet,

301
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,450
and when I stumbled across 
this place, I got curious.

302
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,770
I see.

303
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,630
Some people say dolls like 
these are creepy.

304
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,270
But you don't think that?

305
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,540
No.

306
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,690
These two are my favorites.

307
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,620
Their faces look so peaceful.

308
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,950
It's strange to me that they can look so calm,

309
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,490
even though they're attached.

310
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,410
But maybe that's the reason they're calm?

311
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,240
Impossible.

312
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,130
It would make more sense for them

313
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,720
to be calm if they were separated.

314
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,430
Shall I show you?

315
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,720
Shall I show you...

316
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,560
...what's under this eyepatch?

317
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,050
Bone work.
