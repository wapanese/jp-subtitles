1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,890
Have you heard of Misaki?

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,610
From the 9th grade, class 3.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,610
Was there anyone named that in class 3?

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,040
It happened 26 years ago.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,290
She'd been popular ever since the 7th grade.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,710
She was smart, pretty, 
and had a great personality,

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,660
so she was loved by 
students and teachers alike.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,080
Yeah, there's at least one person 
like that in every grade.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,590
But shortly after she started the 9th grade,

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,630
Misaki died.

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,380
What?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,720
How?

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,260
I heard it was an accident.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,900
So, everyone was really shocked.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,560
Until, suddenly, someone said it.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,320
Said what?

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,820
He pointed to Misaki's desk and said,

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,570
"Misaki's right there. She's not dead."

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,850
Was that...

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,770
Well, it was just an act.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,120
But from that day on, 
class 3 continued to behave

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,020
as though Misaki was still alive.

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,010
That's kinda creepy.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,010
They kept up the act right up to graduation.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,010
Do Not Enter

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,500
The principal even arranged to have

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,460
Misaki's seat included in 
their graduation ceremony.

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,170
Isn't that a good thing?

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,530
Sure, if it ended there.

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,900
There's more?

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,050
The rest of the story is...

32
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,070
How do you feel? Are you in pain?

33
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,990
No.

34
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,290
My goodness, what a way to start your life here.

35
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,700
You poor dear.

36
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,780
Um...

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,170
I'm sorry, Grandma.

38
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,350
Oh, no. Don't you worry about that.

39
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,740
You couldn't help it.

40
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,020
Um, does my dad know?

41
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,740
I haven't told him.

42
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,870
Yousuke is in India at the moment, isn't he?

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,470
Want me to tell him? I have his number.

44
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,510
No, thank you. I'll contact him myself.

45
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,240
Yeah. That's probably best.

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,300
That Yousuke, he's such a dutiful man.

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,970
In all this time since Ritsuko died...

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,790
That's the Yomiyama River flowing 
through the center of the town.

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,550
And can you see the grounds beyond it?

50
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,400
Um...

51
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,380
You mean that building?

52
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,250
Yes.

53
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,900
That's the school you'll be attending.

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,100
Is that the same school you went to, Reiko?

55
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,900
Yes, although that was 14 years ago.

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,870
So my mother went there, too?

57
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,660
That's right.

58
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,470
My sister Ritsuko also went to Yomi North.

59
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,580
Yomi North?

60
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,020
Yomiyama North Junior High.

61
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,840
Oh.

62
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,170
Public schools are a little 
different from private schools,

63
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,040
but it just takes some getting used to.

64
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,590
I'm sure you'll get used to it in no time.

65
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,040
I hope so.

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,600
You'll be fine.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,290
Once you're out of the hospital,

68
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,310
I'll help you prepare for life at Yomi North.

69
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,320
Oh, you're reading King this 
time, mister horror lover?

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,570
Well, I'll leave you guys alone.

71
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,720
We're students of Yomiyama North 
Junior High's 9th grade, class 3.

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,600
Okay...

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,980
I'm Kazami. Tomohiko Kazami.

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,910
This is Sakuragi.

75
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,510
Ah, nice to meet you. I'm Yukari Sakuragi.

76
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,610
And this is—

77
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,980
Izumi Akazawa.

78
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,750
Um, did you want something?

79
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, yes.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,660
Sakuragi and I are class officers.

81
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,870
Akazawa is in charge of countermeasures.

82
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,020
We came here today as 
representatives of class 3.

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,450
Countermeasures?

84
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,210
You just transferred here, right?

85
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,350
We heard that you were supposed to start

86
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,550
coming to school on Monday, 
but then suddenly got sick.

87
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,380
So we decided to visit you 
on behalf of the entire class.

88
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,190
Um, here. These are from all of us.

89
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,300
You moved here from Tokyo, right?

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,340
Yeah.

91
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,300
And you went to a private school there?

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,790
Why did you transfer?

93
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,350
For family reasons.

94
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,230
Is this your first time living in Yomiyama?

95
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,970
Yes.

96
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,310
Oh... I thought maybe you used to live here.

97
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,510
I've been here before,

98
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,860
but I've never lived here.

99
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,490
Did you stay for a long time?

100
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,270
I can't say.

101
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,620
I don't remember.

102
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,450
I was really young, so... maybe?

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,960
Here.

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,670
I made you a copy of all notes from 
the start of the first term.

105
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,360
Thank you!

106
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,930
I think I'll start going to school in early May,

107
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,930
so I'll see you then.

108
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,190
Um, Sakakibara?

109
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,210
Yes?

110
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,580
Well...

111
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,900
Sakakibara...

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,730
Your first name's Kouichi, right?

113
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,820
May we call you Kouichi?

114
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,650
Oh, sure.

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,490
We look forward to getting 
to know you, Kouichi.

116
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,830
Same here. Thanks.

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,180
Kouichi, are you sure you've 
never lived in Yomiyama before?

118
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,010
I don't think so.

119
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,940
Dad

120
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,230
Oh, pardon me.

121
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,070
Are you a Yomi North student?

122
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,450
Do you have something to do 
on the second basement level?

123
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,660
Yes.

124
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,630
But the second basement level is...

125
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,380
I have something to deliver.

126
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,220
My poor other half...

127
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,470
...is waiting for me there.

128
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,210
Hey, wait.

129
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,540
What's your name?

130
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,890
Mei.

131
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,860
Mei Misaki.

132
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,940
Mechanical Room - Boiler Room 
 Morgue

133
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,340
Good morning, Rei!

134
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,340
Good morning, Rei!

135
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
How are you?

136
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,070
Good morning!

137
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,680
Good morning!

138
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,690
Hey there, good morning! 
How're you doing?

139
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,460
Morning...

140
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,280
It's 2 A.M. over here.

141
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,270
India sure is hot!

142
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,290
What's up?

143
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,200
You're about to leave for school, aren't you?

144
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,320
This is your go-get-'em call. 
Be grateful!

145
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
Uh, sure.

146
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
Feeling okay?

147
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,780
How've things been since 
you got out of the hospital?

148
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,820
Can you hear me, Kouichi? I wanted to say—

149
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,310
Hold on, the signal here is bad.

150
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm feeling fine.

151
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,860
You don't have to worry.

152
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,570
Yeah, a collapsed lung's not 
the end of the world.

153
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,950
I had one, when I was a boy.

154
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,930
Really? I didn't know that.

155
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,630
I never told you.

156
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,400
I didn't want anyone telling 
you it's hereditary.

157
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,440
Is it?

158
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,440
I actually had it twice, 
but never again after that.

159
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,640
So if it's hereditary, you're all done.

160
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,180
I hope so.

161
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,630
Think of it as something that's in the past,

162
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,380
and go enjoy your life.

163
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,360
I won't stress over it.

164
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,210
That's my boy! Say hello to 
your grandparents for me!

165
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,370
Man, India is seriously hot!

166
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,300
Good morning, Rei! Good morning!

167
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,860
Rei is <i>your</i> name, you know.

168
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,490
Cheer! Cheer up!

169
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,510
Sure. Thanks.

170
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,650
Moving along.

171
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,360
The third thing you need to know to 
prepare yourself for Yomi North is:

172
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,660
Always uphold the class rules.

173
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,590
Okay.

174
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,020
Things might be different in Tokyo,

175
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,040
but here the group matters 
more than the individual.

176
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,710
I think I can handle that.

177
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,590
Good.

178
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,960
Now, the fourth thing you need to know is—

179
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,050
Kouichi!

180
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,420
Breakfast is ready!

181
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,720
Breakfast, she says, Kouichi.

182
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Good morning, Grandpa.

183
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,280
Good morning.

184
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,200
Are you going back to the hospital today?

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,690
No, I've been discharged.

186
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,810
I start school today.

187
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,400
Ah, school.

188
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,730
You're already in junior high, eh?

189
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,660
Yes, yes.

190
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,970
I'm glad you're feeling up to it.

191
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,710
I'm in the 9th grade now.

192
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,080
I'll be in high school next year.

193
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,190
If only that hadn't happened to Ritsuko...

194
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,150
Kouichi, breakfast!

195
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,380
Coming!

196
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,840
Why, Rei? <i>Why?</i>

197
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,270
I hope you'll be able to get along with everyone.

198
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,640
If you have any troubles at all,

199
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,740
please don't hesitate to talk to me.

200
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,990
You can also talk to Ms. Mikami, 
the assistant homeroom teacher, of course.

201
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,230
Yes, sir. Thank you.

202
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,650
We look forward to having you with us.

203
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,400
May 6 (Wed.)

204
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:36,170
Kouichi Sakakibara

205
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,170
I moved here because of my father's job.

206
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,090
I'm living with my grandparents.

207
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,540
And, um, it's nice to meet you.

208
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,970
Please give our new friend 
a warm welcome, class.

209
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,680
Help each other, and work 
your hardest together,

210
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,690
so that you can all graduate 
in prime health next March.

211
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,040
Sakakibara, you can take that seat there.

212
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,150
Yes, sir.

213
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,750
Are you all healed up?

214
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes, I feel much better.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,130
How does this town compare to Tokyo?

216
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,510
It's not that different.

217
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,190
But Tokyo sounds so great!

218
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,950
Small country towns like Yomiyama

219
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,940
have nothing going for them these days.

220
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,210
That's for sure.

221
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,940
Nothing interesting happens here.

222
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,320
Tokyo has its downsides, too.

223
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,690
It's so noisy, you can't relax.

224
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,570
I guess it might seem that 
way, if you've lived there.

225
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,950
You think so?

226
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,950
I'd love to try living in Tokyo!

227
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,240
I like it better here. It's much quieter.

228
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,580
And you're surrounded by nature.

229
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,710
That's an opinion you'd only hear 
from someone who lived in Tokyo.

230
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,530
I heard your dad is a college professor.

231
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,960
And he's researching 
in a foreign country now?

232
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,720
How did you know that?

233
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,390
Everyone knows.

234
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,340
Mr. Kubodera told us.

235
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,600
Oh, he did? And about my old school, too?

236
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,020
Pretty much everyone knows.

237
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,230
Ms. Mikami talked to us, too.

238
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,430
I see.

239
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,130
It's too bad Ms. Mikami 
isn't our homeroom teacher.

240
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,480
She's hot, and she's got killer style, yeah?

241
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
Well, um...

242
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,860
Oh? Pretty women not your type, Kouichi?

243
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,100
It's not that.

244
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,430
Then what kind of girl 
do you like, Sakakibara?

245
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,460
Why are you asking me this...

246
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,320
By the way, what country is your dad in now?

247
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,080
India.

248
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,210
He's been there about a year this spring.

249
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,780
Wow, India, huh?

250
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,770
I bet it's hot there.

251
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,160
I wouldn't be able to take it. I can't stand heat.

252
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,580
Consider yourself lucky, Teshy.

253
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,020
No matter how hard you try,

254
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,900
you're never gonna do research 
in a place like India.

255
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,070
Yeah, yeah, I'm well aware!

256
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,810
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

257
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,560
No, nothing.

258
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,410
But I was wondering about the 
other girl who visited me.

259
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,280
Akazawa, was it?

260
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,490
Is she absent today?

261
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,910
Yeah, looks like it.

262
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,300
Hey! Why don't we give you a 
tour of the school during lunch?

263
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,700
It's tough not knowing where stuff is, right?

264
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,330
Yeah, that's a good idea.

265
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,670
Thanks.

266
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,560
I appreciate it.

267
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,580
Ready!

268
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,120
You look like you want to run.

269
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,360
Yeah. I love running.

270
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,520
Yeah?

271
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,360
So, you've run before.

272
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,030
Um, yeah.

273
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,910
I hear you have a heart condition.

274
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,510
Yeah, I was born with it,

275
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,970
so I don't know what it feels like to run.

276
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,130
I wish I could run with all my strength.

277
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,880
You might be able to someday.

278
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,260
Yeah, maybe you're right. Someday.

279
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm gonna...

280
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,500
...go to the nurse's office to lie down.

281
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,240
Are you okay?

282
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,640
It happens all the time.

283
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,380
I can get there by myself.

284
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,080
Sakakibara?

285
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,370
Where did Takabayashi go?

286
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,880
To rest in the nurse's office.

287
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,460
Oh...

288
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,650
I fell yesterday and sprained my ankle.

289
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,360
So, we don't share P.E. 
with another class here?

290
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,240
Only class 3 is different.

291
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,360
Classes 1 and 2, and classes 
4 and 5, have P.E. together.

292
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,490
You walked around with Kazami, Teshigawara,

293
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,050
and the others during lunch, right?

294
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,690
Yeah.

295
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,340
Did they say anything to you?

296
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,250
They just gave me a tour of the school.

297
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,260
That's all?

298
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,870
Yeah.

299
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,830
I see...

300
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,590
If we're not careful, 
Akazawa will yell at us.

301
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,010
Hey, Sakuragi?

302
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,840
Yes?

303
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,650
I've been wondering...

304
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,220
Where's Misaki?

305
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,420
Who?

306
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,510
The girl named Mei Misaki.

307
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,870
The one wearing an eyepatch on her left eye.

308
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,650
What?

309
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,750
I didn't see her in the classroom at lunch.

310
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,000
Sakakibara?

311
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,330
Hey, Misaki.

312
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,360
You watching the P.E. class, too?

313
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,010
Should you be up here?

314
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,460
I don't know.

315
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,890
But there's no point in 
watching from up close.

316
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,620
And you? Should you be up here?

317
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,130
I don't know.

318
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,010
Were you drawing something?

319
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,470
How do you write "Mei"?

320
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,010
With the character that means "sing."

321
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,810
The same character used 
in "sympathy" and "scream."

322
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,940
I see.

323
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,800
So, do you remember meeting me 
at Yomiyama Hospital the other day?

324
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,270
In the elevator.

325
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,310
You got off at the second basement level.

326
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,580
Did something like that happen?

327
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,940
What did you go to the 
second basement level for?

328
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,650
You said you had something to deliver.

329
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,120
You were holding some kind of white doll.

330
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,970
Is that what you had to deliver—

331
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,380
I hate being questioned.

332
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,820
Oh, sorry.

333
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,090
I wasn't trying to force you to tell me.

334
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,130
I just, well...

335
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,020
Something very sad happened that day.

336
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,920
You are Kouichi Sakakibara, correct?

337
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,810
Yes.

338
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,860
Your classmates haven't told you?

339
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,280
Told me what?

340
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,150
They associate your name with death.

341
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,980
But not just any death.

342
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,540
A cruel, irrational death that 
took place at this school.

343
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,810
This school is in a place close to death,

344
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,050
especially the 9th grade's class 3.

345
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,680
It's much, much closer to it 
than any of the other classes.

346
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,560
To... death?

347
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,190
You really don't know anything, Sakakibara?

348
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,900
Nothing at all?

349
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,530
Nobody has told you?

350
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,020
About what?

351
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
You'll find out soon enough.

352
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,350
You shouldn't try to get close to me.

353
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,790
You shouldn't talk to me anymore, either.

354
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,560
Why?

355
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,930
You'll find out soon enough.

356
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,960
But...

357
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,700
Goodbye,

358
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,310
Sa-ka-ki-ba-ra.

359
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,500
Are you getting along with your classmates?

360
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,230
Yeah, I guess.

361
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,280
Is something wrong?

362
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,310
No, nothing.

363
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,010
Blueprint.
