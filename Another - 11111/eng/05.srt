1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,020
What?!

2
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,210
Sanae Mizuno, was it?

3
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,970
She and Kouchi often talked 
about books together.

4
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,890
She was so young...

5
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,590
I worry about her brothers.

6
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,610
Oh, she had brothers?

7
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,140
One is named Takeru.

8
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,980
He's in my class.

9
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,300
Dear me, this is so awful.

10
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,230
Didn't a girl in your class 
recently die in an accident, too?

11
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,110
After a death, there always follows a funeral.

12
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,160
How very tired I am of funerals...

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,870
So very tired of funerals...

14
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,650
June 4 (Thurs.)

15
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,440
The news about Mizuno's 
sister comes as a terrible shock,

16
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,250
but it will be all right.

17
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,040
If we all try hard together, 
we can overcome this.

18
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,280
So...

19
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,880
She died.

20
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,420
Mizuno's sister died in 
an accident yesterday.

21
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,250
Oh...

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Self-Study - Sketching

23
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,390
I wonder what's wrong 
with Ms. Mikami.

24
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,880
Maybe she's really sick.

25
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,220
She didn't look too well.

26
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,410
I hope she doesn't...

27
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,770
Hey, Sakakibara?

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,070
Yeah?

29
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,800
You don't think Ms. Mikami 
has some serious,

30
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,950
life-threatening illness, do you?

31
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,230
I'm sure she's fine.

32
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,560
You're probably right.

33
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,250
Are you that worried?

34
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,020
Well, after what happened 
to Sakuragi...

35
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,890
And now Mizuno's sister...

36
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,020
So I just...

37
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,220
Are they related?

38
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,160
Is there a connection 
between these accidents?

39
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,820
Um, I don't...

40
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,100
Where are you going?

41
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,310
To do some research.

42
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,110
Yomiyama Prefectural Junior High School 
Class of 1972

43
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,080
Who am I kidding?

44
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,290
Of course I wouldn't find Misaki's name here.

45
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,850
Mom...

46
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,600
You found your mother?

47
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,840
Yes.

48
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,880
Interesting... So she graduated in '72.

49
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,010
Which class was she in?

50
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,150
Class 3, like me.

51
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,700
Oh? Which one is she?

52
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,120
This one.

53
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Ritsuko?

54
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,450
You knew her?

55
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,500
Yes.

56
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,230
Ritsuko was...

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,730
But...

58
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,020
I heard that she died. When was that?

59
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,720
15 years ago, right after she had me.

60
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,340
15 years ago?

61
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,000
I see...

62
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,440
So that's what happened.

63
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,900
Kouichi.

64
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,980
Mr. Kubodera asked me to send 
you to the faculty room.

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,490
Okay, thanks.

66
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,750
Let me apologize in advance.

67
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,550
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
But this is for all of us.

69
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,130
Forgive us.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,850
You are aware that Sanae Mizuno

71
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,430
passed away in an accident at 
the hospital yesterday, yes?

72
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,400
Yes.

73
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,310
Um, am I suspected of something?

74
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,010
Oh, no. We know it was an accident.

75
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,230
A very unfortunate accident.

76
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,320
It's just, Ms. Mizuno's cell phone was

77
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,990
found in the elevator in question.

78
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,940
Did you speak with her on the phone 
around 1 p.m. yesterday?

79
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,640
Yes, I did.

80
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,690
She was on the roof at the time, correct?

81
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,830
And she entered the 
elevator from there...

82
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,610
What caused the accident?

83
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,850
That's under investigation.

84
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,280
All we know for certain is that the 
sheaves holding the cables

85
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,470
in place came loose, causing it to fall.

86
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,290
That building is several decades old,

87
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,510
and it's been through numerous 
structural modifications.

88
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,270
<i>Let's both be careful.</i>

89
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,110
<i>Especially where unusual 
accidents are concerned.</i>

90
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Aya Ayano | Izumi Akazawa

91
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,260
Sakakibara.

92
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,630
Are the police finished questioning you?

93
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,440
Yes.

94
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,950
All right.

95
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,870
Then you're dismissed for the day.

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,610
Um, where is everyone?

97
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,190
The new female class officer

98
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,330
was selected during homeroom.

99
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,040
It's Akazawa.

100
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,280
But, where'd everybody go?

101
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,470
Please be sure to uphold

102
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,670
the class rules at all times.

103
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,520
Are we clear?

104
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,100
Who is dead?

105
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,020
Okay, sure.

106
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,870
Hey.

107
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,480
Walk home with me?

108
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,760
Where did everyone go 
during sixth period?

109
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,920
To the meeting room, 
to take care of some stuff.

110
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,970
What stuff?

111
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,630
You've had a lot of strange experiences 
since you came here, haven't you?

112
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,170
If you know, can you tell me 
what's going on?

113
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,090
Sorry, I can't.

114
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,800
Only, that something very unpleasant

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,100
might happen to you soon.

116
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,470
What do you mean?

117
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,980
At the meeting,

118
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,630
Akazawa said we needed 
to discuss something,

119
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,230
without you there.

120
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,410
But even if you don't 
like what happens,

121
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,430
try to deal with it.

122
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,990
Remember that you're doing it for all of us.

123
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,200
Please.

124
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,990
"All of us"?

125
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,350
<i>This is for all of us.</i>

126
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,660
<i>Forgive us.</i>

127
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,290
Is this one of those class rules?

128
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,640
Yeah.

129
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,220
I just don't get it...

130
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,140
Can I ask one favor?

131
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
What?

132
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,640
I want a copy of the class roster.

133
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,530
You didn't get one?

134
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,970
It's just not fair.

135
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,120
I can't agree with Akazawa's 
way of handling things.

136
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,260
It's not fair of her to force her own ideas

137
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,620
on the rest of us.

138
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,990
There must be so many 
things you want to know.

139
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
There are.

140
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,310
Then you can ask me.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
I'll tell you everything I know.

142
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,390
Takabayashi, wait! Are you serious?

143
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,830
Okay.

144
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,930
Does Mei Misaki exist?

145
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,670
Mei Misaki is...

146
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,010
Takabayashi! Takabayashi!

147
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,360
Good morning. You're early today.

148
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,270
June 5 (Fri.)

149
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,690
That's it. Any other...

150
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,200
No, forget it.

151
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,260
Did something happen this morning?

152
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,190
Let us pray that the soul of 
our classmate, Takabayashi,

153
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,580
may rest in peace.

154
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,530
Many sad events have transpired,

155
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,210
but do not lose heart, 
and do not give up.

156
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,930
We'll get through this together.

157
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,980
Remember to uphold the 
class rules at all times.

158
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,720
Ms. Mikami is in a difficult position,

159
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,640
but she has agreed to cooperate 
to the best of her ability.

160
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,450
Does everyone understand?

161
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,680
Hey.

162
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,500
What's with him?

163
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,050
Hey, Wakui?

164
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,130
What's going on?

165
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,550
<i>The customer you are trying 
to reach currently</i>

166
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,570
<i>has their phone off or is 
out of the service area.</i>

167
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,420
Hey.

168
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,910
Listen...

169
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,090
Sorry.

170
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:06,730
Figures of Speech
Simile, Metaphor, Personification

171
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,830
"A rumor walks alone."

172
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,870
Here, we see something 
that is not human

173
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,290
being expressed as 
displaying human behavior.

174
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,260
This is known as personification.

175
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,410
The important thing to 
understand is that

176
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:20,600
human attributes are given 
to something non-human.

177
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,440
Pascal once said, "Man is but a 
reed, but he is a thinking reed."

178
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,800
This is not personification.

179
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,450
So that's what they meant.

180
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,990
It is a metaphor.

181
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,910
Does that make sense?

182
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,480
Hi.

183
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,540
What's wrong?

184
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,630
Your call was unexpected.

185
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,870
Sorry. Ask Misaki to explain. -Mochizuki

186
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,370
24 Mei Misaki

187
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,230
So, you got a copy of the class roster.

188
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,110
And?

189
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,100
Let me start from the beginning.

190
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,150
Did you hear that Takabayashi died?

191
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,970
He had a heart attack.

192
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,340
I know he had heart problems, but...

193
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,800
I see.

194
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,120
The second June death 
was caused by illness.

195
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,980
Then, when I got to school today,

196
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,580
the whole class was acting weird.

197
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,170
Like they'd all conspired to 
treat me like I wasn't there.

198
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,230
So that's what they decided to do...

199
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,300
Does this mean I'm just like you now?

200
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,750
How does it feel to not exist?

201
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,410
Not so great.

202
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,840
But, in a way, it's a load off my mind.

203
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,820
It is?

204
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,070
Because now I know that you exist.

205
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,280
This is where you live, isn't it?

206
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

207
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,540
I thought you figured 
that out long ago.

208
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,290
You did say you lived around here.

209
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,990
And you're not a customer.

210
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,690
Was that your mother who 
answered the phone?

211
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,280
She was surprised.

212
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,390
I very rarely get calls 
from schoolmates.

213
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,820
Is Kirika your mom?

214
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,160
Yes. I guess you'd call it a pseudonym.

215
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
She goes by Kirika.

216
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,170
A strange woman, 
who keeps herself cloistered

217
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,370
in the studio upstairs.

218
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,990
Does the "M" in "Studio M" 
stand for Misaki?

219
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,230
It all makes sense now, doesn't it?

220
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,870
Let's go upstairs.

221
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,360
Did you know this was here?

222
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,560
Here you go.

223
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,830
Why don't you ask the questions?

224
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,570
It might be easier to explain 
everything that way.

225
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,330
I thought you hated being questioned.

226
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,900
I do.

227
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,020
But today,

228
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,420
I'll make a special exception.

229
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,300
First of all, Mei Misaki,

230
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
you exist, right?

231
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,130
Did you think I was a ghost?

232
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,220
Sort of.

233
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,980
I guess you couldn't help it.

234
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,560
But your doubts are gone now, right?

235
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,230
Now that you know I exist,

236
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,190
as a living human.

237
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm only nonexistent to 
the others in class 3.

238
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,170
Since when?

239
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,990
It started on May 1.

240
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,890
That's pretty recent.

241
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,690
Lots of things seemed strange 
to you from the start, right?

242
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,520
And nobody would tell me why.

243
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,870
Not explaining the situation 
to you beforehand

244
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,400
was a costly mistake.

245
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,610
Mistake?

246
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,590
You were supposed to treat me 
as someone who didn't exist,

247
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,740
just like everyone else in class.

248
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,910
But now you've ended up the same as me.

249
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,560
How awful for you.

250
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,570
It's not exactly bullying...

251
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,410
I don't think anybody thinks of it that way.

252
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,600
I understand that I 
no longer exist to them.

253
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,700
But why are they doing this?

254
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,180
It's a natural question.

255
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,110
Remember the story about the 
Misaki who died 26 years ago?

256
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah.

257
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,140
That was the trigger.

258
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,670
After that, class 3 drew closer to death.

259
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,340
Death?

260
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,520
It first happened to class 3

261
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,100
the year after Misaki's 
classmates graduated.

262
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,710
And once it happens, once it begins,

263
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,800
somebody dies each month.

264
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,070
Either a student, or 
someone from their family.

265
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,590
What is "it"?

266
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,280
It's when...

267
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,990
...the number of students in 
the class increases by one.

268
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,580
Increases? Who?

269
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,580
Nobody knows.

270
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,180
They can never figure out 
who the extra one is.

271
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,590
Extra one?

272
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,300
25 years ago, shortly 
after the new term began,

273
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,860
they realized that the classroom

274
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,730
was short one desk and chair,

275
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,220
even though they had prepared enough

276
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,000
for all of the students.

277
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Couldn't they just check 
the school records?

278
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,370
They did, but there was no point.

279
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,330
The roster and records had been 
altered to be inconsistent.

280
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,450
They were just one 
desk and chair short.

281
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,000
So, someone rewrote the numbers?

282
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,800
I used the word "altered" figuratively.

283
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,260
They say that everyone's 
memories had changed as well.

284
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,180
Huh?

285
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?

286
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,510
But it's supposedly true.

287
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,820
I was told this type of 
phenomenon could happen.

288
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,540
Phenomenon?

289
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,110
At first, everyone thought 
it was just an error

290
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,450
and thought nothing of it.

291
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,080
But starting in April, 
people connected to the class

292
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,870
started to die each month.

293
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,910
Each month?

294
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,000
For the whole year?

295
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,020
That year, I think it was six students

296
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,010
and ten family members.

297
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,280
Clearly abnormal, right?

298
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,710
This phenomenon has continued 
in class 3 ever since.

299
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,950
So, a 9th grade class 3 student

300
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,140
named Misaki died 26 years ago.

301
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,990
And starting the next year,

302
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,800
there was somehow an extra 
student in the class.

303
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,270
Then, people connected to the 
class started to die each month.

304
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,640
But why do people die when 
there's an extra student?

305
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,320
Nobody knows the reason.

306
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,040
That's just what happens.

307
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,390
Plus, that extra student is...

308
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,220
...someone dead.

309
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,310
You mean the Misaki who 
died 26 years ago?

310
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,870
Who is dead?

311
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,200
Is it a ghost or something?

312
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,470
I think it's different from 
what we'd call a ghost.

313
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,160
It seems to have a physical body.

314
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,750
There's no way to tell it apart 
from the rest of us.

315
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,380
No way to tell?

316
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,140
The dead person has 
a soul and memories,

317
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,590
and they don't realize they're dead.

318
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,200
Who are they?

319
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,170
The people connected to the class 
who have died over the years.

320
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,780
This is how I see it.

321
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,220
Class 3's actions 26 years ago

322
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,480
made the class a place 
that invites the dead in.

323
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,090
After that, the dead 
began to join the class,

324
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,180
and class 3 drew closer to death.

325
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,310
In response,

326
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,740
the class 3 students 
came up with several

327
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,300
countermeasures to try 
to escape this calamity.

328
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,580
Like exorcisms?

329
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,290
Possibly.

330
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,200
They tried moving to a 
different classroom,

331
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,220
and changing the name of 
class 3 to class C.

332
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,880
But that didn't stop it.

333
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,900
So the problem is with the students

334
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,340
in the 9th grade's third class?

335
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,940
Seems to be.

336
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,750
Then, about ten years ago,

337
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,630
they found a way to 
deal with the problem.

338
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,460
A method that prevented 
people from dying each month.

339
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,420
Don't tell me...

340
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,900
Treat one student like they don't exist,

341
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,420
to make up for the extra person.

342
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,430
That way, they return the 
class to its correct number,

343
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,430
and they can avoid the 
calamity for that year.

344
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,040
It's a sort of charm.

345
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,260
Face to face.
