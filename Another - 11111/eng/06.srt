1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,980
I don't want to.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,490
If I said that, would you not do it?

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,900
Of course, you have 
every right to refuse.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,210
However, if the calamity begins...

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,140
All right.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,630
Excuse me...

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,920
What will the teachers 
outside of class 3 do?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,420
They will cooperate to the 
best of their ability.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,150
However, you should not 
discuss this matter

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,830
with anyone outside the class.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,600
Not even our families?

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,260
The rules dictate that 
we must not speak of it.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,260
May 1 (Fri.)

14
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,850
I thought it wasn't going 
to happen this year.

15
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,030
At the opening ceremony,

16
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,740
we had the perfect number of desks.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,490
But we were short a desk 
once the new student came.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,580
It can start a month late?

19
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,270
Looks that way.

20
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,130
So...

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
By the way, you checked him out, right?

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,730
How'd it go?

23
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,510
I don't think it's him.

24
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,540
How do you know?

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,850
He never lived in Yomiyama.

26
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,970
He has no siblings.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,290
And his hands weren't cold.

28
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,600
Still...

29
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,700
Still...

30
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,240
If it's such an important rule,

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,800
why wasn't I told about it right away?

32
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,790
You had already spoken to me.

33
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,170
That made it difficult 
for them to broach the subject.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,080
Hey, there's something 
else I want to ask you.

35
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,370
Is there some reason your 
desk is the only one

36
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,260
in the class that's so old?

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,610
That's part of the rule.

38
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,770
I guess it serves some purpose 
in completing the charm.

39
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,770
Who is dead?

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,770
I saw the words "Who is dead?" 
scribbled on your desk.

41
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,280
Did you write that?

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,010
Yes.

43
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,280
I know that I'm not dead,

44
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,750
so I wanted to ask, who is?

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,370
You can tell?

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,210
Well...

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,790
This is my friend, Sakakibara.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,840
Welcome. Forgive my appearance.

49
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,110
Is he a friend from class?

50
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,010
Or the art club?

51
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,120
He's also a customer at 
the gallery downstairs.

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,440
He seems to enjoy it immensely.

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,900
Oh, really?

54
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,980
That's an unusual interest, for a boy.

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,010
You like dolls?

56
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,890
Well, I...

57
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,810
You should probably be 
leaving now, Sakakibara.

58
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,780
Oh, okay.

59
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,110
I will see him out.

60
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,650
I see.

61
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,270
Feel free to come again anytime.

62
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,710
Are you always like that?

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,090
Like what?

64
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,950
The way you talk to your mom.

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,330
I'd almost think you two were strangers.

66
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,640
We've pretty much always 
treated each other that way.

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,390
What's your family like?

68
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,470
I don't have a mom.

69
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,150
She died right after I was born.

70
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,510
I see.

71
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,540
Well, that was normal for us.

72
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,760
I'm just another one of her dolls.

73
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,890
That's awful.

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,120
You're her daughter, her flesh and blood.

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,080
I may be flesh and blood, but I'm not real.

76
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,750
Then, does your mom know about class 3?

77
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,520
No, and I can't tell her.

78
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,960
What does she think of you 
skipping school so often?

79
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,420
She doesn't really care, 
or she just doesn't interfere.

80
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,160
Except with certain things.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,300
What things?

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,630
So, now I know class 3's secret...

83
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,190
But how can you just accept what they're 
putting you through to complete the charm?

84
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,730
There's no other way.

85
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,270
I just happened to be the one.

86
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,320
If it hadn't been me,

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,490
I would've had to follow the others

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,210
in treating someone else like they don't exist.

89
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,000
It's better that I'm the one who's cut off.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,480
Children's Park

91
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,510
Why did they decide to make 
two people nonexistent?

92
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,740
They probably thought the 
charm wouldn't hold

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,750
if they told you to start 
ignoring me now.

94
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,520
So by making a 
second person cease to exist,

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,870
they could strengthen the charm?

96
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,780
Right.

97
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,140
It also saved them

98
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,920
the trouble of explaining me to you.

99
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,530
It's quite logical.

100
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,180
But it's just a charm, isn't it?

101
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,370
All of this for a charm?

102
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,950
Well, they're desperate.

103
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,000
When they consider that they might be next,

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,740
it makes them take it seriously.

105
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,640
Do you think they're being unreasonable?

106
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,650
Yes, I do!

107
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,860
There are no guarantees.

108
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,020
But if there's a chance it could 
help everyone avoid the calamity,

109
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,230
isn't it worth it?

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,740
It's sad when people die.

111
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,720
Thanks.

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,550
Be careful on your way home.

113
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,940
We're both close to death, after all.

114
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,540
I'll be fine.

115
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,820
I showed you this once before, didn't I?

116
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,140
I lost my left eye when I was four.

117
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,400
It developed a nasty tumor.

118
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,830
I woke up one day, 
and the eye was gone.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,600
My mom said a regular artificial 
eye wouldn't be attractive,

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
so she made a special one for me.

121
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,010
You don't have to hide it.

122
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,820
I think your eye is beautiful.

123
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,580
They said I almost died during surgery.

124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,810
I can sort of vaguely remember 
what happened then.

125
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,180
Do you believe that's possible?

126
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,520
You mean near-death experiences?

127
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,020
Death is not kind.

128
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,370
It's dark, black as far as you can see,

129
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,360
and you're all alone.

130
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,020
All alone...

131
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,290
Yes, but it's no different 
when you're alive, is it?

132
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,110
No matter how many 
relationships we seem to have,

133
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,550
we're all alone.

134
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,520
I am, my mother is,

135
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,110
and you are, too.

136
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,430
So was Misaki.

137
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,500
Starting tomorrow, 
we're two of a kind.

138
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,690
Oh, uh, yeah.

139
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,960
Welcome to the club, Sakakibara.

140
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,180
Helâ€”

141
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,710
Man, India's scorching!

142
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,340
Dad

143
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,340
What's with you?

144
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,630
Hey, what do you mean by that?

145
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,430
If you're worried about my health, I'm fine.

146
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,110
Hey...

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,910
Did Mom ever talk to you about 
her memories of junior high school?

148
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,820
Eh? Where's this coming from?

149
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,600
Mom was in class 3 in 
the 9th grade, too, right?

150
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,750
Anything come to mind?

151
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,820
Hmm...

152
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,510
Nope!

153
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,940
Not a thing?

154
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,210
Well, I'm sure she told 
me a few things...

155
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,490
So, Ritsuko was in class 3, you say?

156
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,990
Anyway, how does it feel to be back after

157
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,770
a year and a half away from Yomiyama?

158
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,460
A year and a half?

159
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,840
This was my first time coming here 
since I started junior high.

160
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,630
Huh? No, I'm sure thatâ€”

161
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,790
Oh, yeah.

162
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,560
Yeah, you're right.

163
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,760
My mistake.

164
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,040
Who is dead?

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,020
June 8 (Mon.)

166
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
Misaki!

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,790
Sakakibara!

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,570
I've gotta stop that...

169
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,320
Kirika doesn't make lunches for you?

170
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,370
Sometimes, when she feels like it.

171
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,110
But to be honest, they're not very good.

172
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,590
Do you ever cook?

173
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,880
No, never.

174
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,390
I can only heat up ready-made meals.

175
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,170
Isn't that normal for kids our age?

176
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,090
I'm a pretty decent cook, actually.

177
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,020
Really?

178
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,660
That's unusual.

179
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,880
I was in the cooking 
club at my old school.

180
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,140
Then, will you make me 
something, someday?

181
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,480
Sure, someday.

182
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,730
By the way,

183
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,660
weren't you drawing up here before?

184
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,400
Have you finished it?

185
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,900
Pretty much.

186
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,860
Did you give her wings?

187
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,890
Yeah.

188
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,860
I'll show you... someday.

189
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,240
Okay.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,010
Is drawing your hobby?

191
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,740
I think I like looking at art, 
more than making it.

192
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,010
I mostly just look at art books, though.

193
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,010
We have lots of them at home.

194
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,760
Do you ever go to museums?

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,060
No, there aren't many around here.

196
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,800
Then, you should visit me in Tokyo someday.

197
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,830
We can go to museums there.

198
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,820
I'll be your tour guide.

199
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,550
Sure... someday.

200
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,390
Art Club Room

201
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,660
Misaki, hey!

202
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,090
What are you doing here?

203
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,810
I just felt like dropping in.

204
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,620
So, you didn't quit the club?

205
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,840
I just needed a break.

206
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,540
Oh, yeah?

207
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,550
I see Mochizuki hasn't changed.

208
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,050
Speak of the devil!

209
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,580
Hi, Mochizuki!

210
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,460
Hey, um, guys?

211
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,170
Could you come with me for a second?

212
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,370
There's something we've 
gotta do right away.

213
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,860
We do?

214
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,840
But Misaki's here to visit us!

215
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,260
Never mind that. Just hurry, okay?

216
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,770
At least it wasn't thrown 
away, I guess...

217
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,680
Which one is your mom?

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,260
This one.

219
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,140
Ritsuko, huh? I see.

220
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,400
By the way, is their homeroom teacher...

221
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,810
He sure looked different back then.

222
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,900
The person you mentioned before...

223
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,750
Yes, I was talking about Chibiki.

224
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,970
Oh, two of you here today?

225
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,820
There are two nonexistent people now.

226
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,410
So I see.

227
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,630
Do you understand the 
situation now, Sakakibara?

228
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,750
Mostly,

229
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,330
though I still find it hard to believe.

230
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,670
That's understandable.

231
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,820
But it's true.

232
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,530
This phenomenon is truly 
happening in this town.

233
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,920
In this school.

234
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,520
You were class 3's homeroom teacher 
26 years ago, weren't you?

235
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,230
And that's how you knew my mother?

236
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,150
You got it.

237
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,940
Um, is it okay for 
you to not ignore us?

238
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,930
I have no connections to 
your class at this time.

239
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,370
I'm in a safe position, you might say.

240
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,540
Then, who's in danger?

241
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,390
Student

242
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,490
The students of class 3

243
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,520
Father | Mother
Student

244
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,620
and their families, within 
two degrees of separation.

245
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,690
Grandfather | Grandmother | Grandfather | Grandmother
Father | Mother
Student

246
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,810
Grandfather | Grandmother | Grandfather | Grandmother
Father | Mother
Student
Brothers | Sisters

247
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,040
And they must live in Yomiyama.

248
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,020
Grandfather | Grandmother | Grandfather | Grandmother
Father | Mother
Student
Brothers | Sisters 
Within Yomiyama

249
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,890
Two degrees would mean parents, 
grandparents, and siblings?

250
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,410
If they have to be living in Yomiyama,

251
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,760
does that mean anyone who 
leaves town would be safe?

252
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,710
Yes.

253
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,510
Think of it like a cell 
phone going out of range.

254
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,620
Um, why do you stay here?

255
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,620
I never meant to harm anyone.

256
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,820
Never...

257
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,430
It seems silly to think that way now,

258
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,190
but that ended up being the trigger,

259
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,370
which opened the door to death.

260
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,030
I was responsible for that.

261
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,490
That's why I remain at this school,

262
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,670
but as a librarian, not a teacher.

263
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,800
Half of that was just me running away.

264
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,220
Running away?

265
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,060
Half of me was crushed by guilt.

266
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,310
But the other half was ruled by fear.

267
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,870
Fear that I might die as well.

268
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,430
So I ran away.

269
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,540
Have teachers died, too?

270
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,130
Only homeroom and assistant 
homeroom teachers.

271
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,180
Um, was the Misaki of 26 
years ago a boy or a girl?

272
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,940
A boy.

273
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,560
His surname was Yomiyama, 
like this town.

274
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,760
His full name was Misaki Yomiyama.

275
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,270
One night in May, his house burned down.

276
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,830
The whole family died, parents 
and brother included.

277
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,460
Did you see the photo 
the dead Misaki appeared in?

278
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,480
Sure did.

279
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,140
Do you have it?

280
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,240
No.

281
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,410
To tell you the truth, it terrified me.

282
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,750
And when they say the school 
records somehow get altered...

283
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,080
It's true.

284
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,750
This holds copies of all class rosters.

285
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,480
26 years' worth, from 1972 
to the present.

286
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
The people with a red "X" by their name

287
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,630
Class Rosters

288
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,980
are the ones who died that year.

289
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,850
Look at the roster from two years ago.

290
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,490
See the name written at the bottom?

291
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:41,510
Deceased: Mami Asakura

292
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,070
Yes.

293
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,380
She was the dead person that year.

294
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,250
So, seven people died in 1996?

295
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,030
That's not many, is it?

296
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,210
It's because the plan to make 
one person nonexistent worked.

297
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,460
After they implemented it, 
nobody else died.

298
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,650
However, shortly after the 
second term began,

299
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,790
the student they chose to not exist 
ended up renouncing the role.

300
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,600
Breaking under the 
pressure and isolation,

301
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,970
he demanded that he existed, 
and that everyone treat him accordingly.

302
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,060
And so it began...

303
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:13,020
The deceased in 1996 was 
named Mami Asakura.

304
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,900
But she was originally a student 
in the 1993 class.

305
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,630
However, between April and June of 1996,

306
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,910
that was not the case.

307
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,120
It wasn't?

308
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,540
Correct.

309
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,420
As I recall, her name was 
on the 1996 roster.

310
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,810
But it was not on the roster for 1993.

311
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,110
It had disappeared.

312
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,670
Both the name and the "X"?

313
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,720
As you can see, when the 
phenomenon is active,

314
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,060
checking records is pointless.

315
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,660
And people's memories change too, right?

316
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,390
Exactly.

317
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,830
Then, at the end of the year,

318
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,230
when the deceased 
disappears after graduation,

319
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,400
Mami Asakura

320
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,040
the records revert 
to their original state,

321
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,510
ultimately revealing the extra student.

322
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,910
In addition, all memories of her 
as the deceased are lost.

323
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,670
All is forgotten.

324
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,280
The records and memories 
just go back to normal?

325
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,750
I cannot comprehend the logic behind it.

326
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,190
I've essentially given up.

327
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,490
There is only one countermeasure that

328
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,890
seems effective against this phenomenon:

329
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,540
denying the existence of 
someone in the class.

330
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
What's the success rate?

331
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,120
About 50%.

332
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,490
Some years it works, others it fails.

333
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,980
Some years it's clear 
why the measure failed,

334
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,690
others it's unknown.

335
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,350
That's terrible...

336
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,690
It's not a curse.

337
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,350
There is no malice to be found.

338
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,950
It occurs naturally, like 
a typhoon or earthquake.

339
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,760
Then, will having two nonexistent 
students be more effective?

340
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,910
I can't say.

341
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,050
There are almost no instances of 
the calamity stopping midyear.

342
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,420
Really?

343
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,690
Ms. Mikami was class 3's 
homeroom teacher in 1996?

344
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,180
Oh, you're right.

345
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,140
She has been through a great deal already.

346
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,040
To make her the assistant 
homeroom teacher again...

347
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,790
That'll be all for today.

348
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,240
Just one more thing.

349
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,780
Was 1983, 15 years ago, 
a year when it happened?

350
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,330
1983?

351
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,030
I believe it was.

352
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,810
I thought so...

353
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,110
Oh, right. That was Reiko's year.

354
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,920
You mean Ritsuko was in Yomiyama then?

355
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,280
Yes.

356
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,880
She came here to have me, 
and stay with her family.

357
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,230
So she died in this town...

358
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,010
I see.

359
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,350
I'm sorry, Kouichi.

360
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,850
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,430
There was nothing I could do...

362
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,560
When my mom died, 15 years ago,

363
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,190
was that part of the class 3 calamity?

364
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,760
I don't know.

365
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,710
My poor Ritsuko...

366
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,870
My poor Ritsuko... My poor Reiko, too...

367
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,470
Don't say that, dear.

368
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,040
Let's call it a night.

369
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,090
Cheer! Cheer up!

370
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,850
I honestly don't know what 
happened to Ritsuko,

371
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,100
but I think the calamity 
was stopped that year.

372
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,560
It stopped midyear?

373
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,080
Why? How was it stopped?

374
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,270
Please, Reiko.

375
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,970
I can't remember.

376
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,480
Reiko, please, try to 
remember something! Anything!

377
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,450
Well, I think something may

378
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,030
have happened during summer break...

379
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,980
Summer break?

380
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,670
I can't remember what, though.

381
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,030
I'm sorry, Kouichi.

382
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,030
July 13 (Mon.)

383
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,180
Good morning, class.

384
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,230
Today, I must apologize to you all.

385
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,650
I have to...

386
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,280
I have done my utmost so that

387
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,880
you could all graduate in 
good health next spring.

388
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,450
I did everything I could 
to make that happen.

389
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,990
But everything that occurs henceforth 
is for you all to deal with.

390
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,110
Once it has begun,

391
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,870
I do not know if any amount 
of struggling will do any good.

392
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,120
I don't know...

393
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,660
You can't expect me to.

394
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,470
But I believe it is futile to 
speak of such things now.

395
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,290
Sphere joint.
