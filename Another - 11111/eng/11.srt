1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,280
<i>I know without a doubt 
that I killed [*].</i>

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,860
<i>Nothing will change that fact.</i>

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,140
<i>That's why I decided 
to come clean here.</i>

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,510
<i>This is my confession.</i>

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,560
<i>It's been two weeks since the trip,</i>

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,760
<i>and nobody remembers [*] 
ever being in the class.</i>

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,620
<i>He's been completely forgotten.</i>

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,990
<i>Only I, the sole person deeply involved 
in his death, still remember [*].</i>

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>But I get the feeling it's 
only a matter of time.</i>

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,770
<i>That's why, while my 
memory is still clear,</i>

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,240
<i>I want to tell you the truth,</i>

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,480
<i>and how to stop the calamity.</i>

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,980
<i>Are you listening?</i>

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,610
<i>Send them back to death, 
where they belong.</i>

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>Send the dead back to death.</i>

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,580
<i>That's how to stop the 
calamity once it's begun.</i>

17
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,830
Back in elementary school,

18
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,010
there was a girl who 
looked just like her.

19
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,490
You mean Misaki?

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,990
Yes.

21
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,910
But I thought Misaki was an only child.

22
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,500
I wasn't in the same class as her,

23
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,930
but I know people called her Misaki.

24
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,960
That makes no sense.

25
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,050
From her address,

26
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,490
she shouldn't have even been 
in the same school as you.

27
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,780
That's exactly why it's so strange.

28
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,330
Did she wear an eyepatch 
over her left eye?

29
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,370
No.

30
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,010
Our Misaki lost her eye when she was four!

31
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,030
What? Then she...

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,150
Is the dead person here on this trip?

33
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,660
The extra person...

34
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,380
...is here.

35
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,290
Who is it?

36
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,510
It's...

37
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,630
Sakaki!

38
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,120
I think I might have 
done something bad!

39
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,140
Teshigawara? What happened?

40
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,310
Can I ask you two a question?

41
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,010
What is it?

42
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,580
Do you know a kid named Tomohiko Kazami?

43
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,900
What?

44
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,390
Just tell me!

45
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,670
Do you know Kazami? What's he like?

46
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,350
Of course I know him.

47
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,230
He's a class officer and the guy 
you've always been stuck with.

48
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,320
Misaki?

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,140
How could I not know him?

50
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,480
This is bad... Really bad...

51
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,590
What is?

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,670
I think I might have been wrong.

53
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,740
Wrong? About what?

54
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, I...

55
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,440
I was sure he was the extra...

56
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,150
So just now, I...

57
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,740
He was...? You mean...

58
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,090
Kazami...

59
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,820
You didn't!

60
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,700
I did!

61
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,450
You can't be serious.

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,210
Why would I lie about this?!

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,580
I tried to probe him a little,

64
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,540
since he's been acting weird lately.

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,330
And he said he didn't remember 
the stuff we did together as kids.

66
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,430
He didn't remember much 
from elementary school, either.

67
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,950
And then?

68
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,060
I braced myself, and asked him,

69
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,560
"You're not really Kazami, are you?"

70
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,310
"You're the extra person 
in the class, aren't you?!"

71
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,690
He looked panicked at first, 
then he flew into a rage.

72
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,030
He was acting so suspiciously, 
I was sure it was him.

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,920
So like the tape said, if he died, 
if he "returned to death,"

74
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
we'd all be saved.

75
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,370
Don't tell me...

76
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,010
...you killed him?

77
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,630
Did you?

78
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,410
I didn't mean to do it!

79
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,390
We started grappling and ended 
up outside, on the balcony.

80
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,300
And the next thing I knew...

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,270
He was lying still on the ground below.

82
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,660
Blood was coming from his head.

83
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,940
I got scared,

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,650
and ran back down the hall.

85
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,510
I'd seen Sakaki come in here earlier.

86
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,270
So you wanted to find out 
if Kazami was the extra?

87
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,920
Yeah.

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,250
I thought, if the extra died,

89
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,870
it'd be as if he'd never existed.

90
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,990
But you two said you know him,

91
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,530
so I must've been wrong!

92
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,840
Tell me, Sakaki, was I wrong?

93
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,290
Either that, or he's not dead.

94
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,150
Huh?

95
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,720
Falling from two stories up 
wouldn't necessarily kill him.

96
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,110
You can't see where he fell from here.

97
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,370
It's past that row of shrubs.

98
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,530
The first thing we should 
do is check if he's alive.

99
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,020
O-Okay...

100
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,290
Maejima?

101
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,170
What happened to you?

102
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,320
Blood?

103
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,180
I can't...

104
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,500
Oh, no.

105
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,430
Were you stabbed?

106
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,840
I looked... in the dining hall.

107
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,670
Th-The manager...

108
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,980
The manager?

109
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,090
Maejima, we've gotta get out of here!

110
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,720
Why are you screaming, Kouichi?

111
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,740
Sakaki! What's going on?

112
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,410
Who is that?

113
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,550
It's Maejima!

114
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,440
He's hurt!

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,180
How?

116
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,830
He's been stabbed!

117
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,560
And there's a fire in the dining hall!

118
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,140
A fire?

119
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,890
The manager's inside, dead.

120
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,130
He was murdered.

121
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,170
The killer must've started the fire.

122
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,230
Are you serious?!

123
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,030
It won't work.

124
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,230
Did you find Kazami?

125
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,740
He's gone.

126
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,620
What?

127
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,750
Was that Takako?

128
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,160
Sugiura!

129
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,660
You, get Maejima someplace safe,

130
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,180
and call 119!

131
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,170
Right.

132
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,070
That room...

133
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,570
It's mine, and Takako's.

134
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,910
Takako, are you in here?

135
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,230
Oh, no... Takako!

136
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,790
Takako, where are you? Takako!

137
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,740
Sakakibara?

138
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,140
What's going on?

139
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,160
Have you seen Sugiura or Kazami?

140
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,050
I saw Kazami.

141
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,420
He came to my room, covered with mud 
and his face clouded in anger,

142
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,680
saying Teshigawara was acting weird.

143
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,430
What?

144
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,300
I asked what happened,

145
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,150
but he just glared daggers at me.

146
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,750
So I mentioned the tape...

147
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,470
You told him?

148
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,590
Yeah.

149
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,870
He's not in here?

150
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,450
It's gone!

151
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,830
The tape recorder's gone!

152
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,600
What? Why?

153
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Sakaki!

154
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,250
Is Kazami here?

155
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,630
How's Maejima?

156
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,390
I left him with someone who heard 
the screams and ran in to help.

157
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,310
Guys...

158
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,390
What's going on?

159
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,980
Let's split up and look for Kazami.

160
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,280
And stop by all the rooms 
and tell everyone to get out.

161
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,190
There's a fire! Get out of here!

162
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,370
Huh?

163
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,070
A fire?

164
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,810
A killer?

165
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,740
Somewhere in this building.

166
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,600
Plus, there's a fire in the dining hall,

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,080
and we don't know where Kazami went.

168
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,820
Everything's so messed up!

169
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,630
We have to tell Ms. Mikami.

170
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,340
Ms. Mikami? Are you there?

171
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,860
We're coming in.

172
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,520
She's gone.

173
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,270
Is that blood?

174
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,440
Yeah.

175
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,360
You don't suppose something 
happened to Ms. Mikami, do you?

176
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,580
Don't you think we should go 
outside and call the police?

177
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,830
No.

178
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,400
Not before we make sure Ms. Mikami is okay.

179
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,810
Ms. Mikami?

180
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,230
Who was that?

181
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,410
Teshigawara.

182
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,490
And Mochizuki.

183
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,170
It came from downstairs, right?

184
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,180
Let's check it out.

185
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
Found you.

186
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Takako!

187
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,100
Are you okay?

188
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,380
Thank goodness.

189
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,030
If you had died, too,

190
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,570
I couldn't go on.

191
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,120
Just like you can't live without me.

192
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,640
Takako?

193
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,920
Send the dead back to death!

194
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,260
Ow!

195
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,890
Teshigawara! Let's get out of here!

196
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,310
M-My leg...

197
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,780
Send the dead back!

198
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,130
Stop!

199
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,380
Out of my way!

200
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,230
She said, "Send the dead back to death."

201
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,390
How did she know about that?

202
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,140
She listened to the tape.

203
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,190
You found it in the old 
class 3 homeroom, right?

204
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,240
Ogura told me.

205
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,200
<i>We're looking for a clue 
to stopping the calamity.</i>

206
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,700
<i>Seriously?</i>

207
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,270
I see.

208
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,470
The tape was brought here?

209
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,920
Yes, by Mochizuki.

210
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,690
As the head of countermeasures, 
I had to listen to it.

211
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,440
But why does she think 
Misaki is the dead person?

212
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,890
Ever since our trip to the beach,

213
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,620
Takako's been emotionally unstable.

214
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,510
I'm going to look for her.

215
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,070
No, Akazawa! 
It's too dangerous to go alone!

216
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,070
This is an important message 
from the head of countermeasures

217
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,600
to the students of class 3.

218
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,010
The tape you are about to hear

219
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,730
was left behind 15 years ago, 
when the calamity stopped midyear.

220
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,430
<i>...and how to stop the calamity.</i>

221
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,410
<i>Are you listening?</i>

222
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,330
<i>Send them back to death, 
where they belong.</i>

223
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,210
<i>Send the dead back to death.</i>

224
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,450
<i>That's how to stop the 
calamity once it's begun.</i>

225
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,340
These are the facts.

226
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,390
The calamity was stopped 
midyear 15 years ago.

227
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,770
And the dead person this year is...

228
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,020
Mei Misaki.

229
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,700
I know this because we went 
to the same elementary school,

230
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,530
and her left eye was intact.

231
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,790
Yet now, she is missing her left eye.

232
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,290
What does this mean?

233
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,400
That she was reborn incomplete.

234
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,740
The Mei Misaki we know is a fake.

235
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,370
And that's why we must...

236
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,010
...kill her!

237
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,310
No!

238
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,190
Return the dead...

239
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,360
...to death.

240
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,270
Return the dead...

241
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,890
Stop this!

242
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,130
Ms. Mikami!

243
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,330
You can't kill your own classmate!

244
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,210
But if we send the dead 
person back to death,

245
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,100
no one else will have to die!

246
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,610
If we kill Misaki, 
the calamity will end!

247
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,550
No!

248
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,860
Don't do this! You're making a mistake!

249
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,990
Then who the hell's dead?!

250
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,890
I don't know.

251
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,550
But...

252
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,040
I-I...

253
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,690
I don't want to die!

254
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,690
No!

255
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,530
You bastard!

256
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,290
Asshole!

257
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,550
There!

258
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,510
The dead girl!

259
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,220
I'll avenge my brother!

260
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,970
No!

261
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,030
You—

262
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,900
I'm sorry!

263
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,400
Open up!

264
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,440
Damn it.

265
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,080
Move!

266
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,220
Careful, it's slippery.

267
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,460
There you are!

268
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,180
Send the dead back to death!

269
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,200
Ogura!

270
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,700
They're in the hallway!

271
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,960
We're sav—

272
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,680
Go in from downstairs!

273
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,550
You really think it's Misaki?

274
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,810
There's something off about her.

275
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,270
I know, but...

276
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,860
Something smells burnt.

277
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,450
He did say there was a fire.

278
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,040
I don't see any flames, though.

279
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,410
The dining hall?

280
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,290
We should be safe here.

281
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,840
I think it's stopped.

282
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,770
What on earth happened?

283
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,430
An explosion in the 
dining hall, probably.

284
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,840
Oh...

285
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,170
Maejima passed out in front 
of the dining hall.

286
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,790
Could Sugiura have...

287
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,920
It wasn't me.

288
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,970
It was probably that old crone.

289
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,070
Crone?

290
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,230
You...

291
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,570
...are in my way!

292
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,020
But I won't kill you, 
since you're not the dead one.

293
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,980
Besides, Izumi seems fond of you.

294
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,790
Send the dead back to death!

295
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,770
Damn you!

296
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,930
Why...

297
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,000
Why is this happening?

298
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,430
Kouichi?

299
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,320
Akazawa!

300
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,630
Who is that?

301
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,640
Takako!

302
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,140
Mei... Misaki...

303
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,720
You really are...

304
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,220
No, Akazawa!

305
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,770
Sugiura was...

306
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,440
I'll kill you!

307
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,700
If the dead person was gone,

308
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,980
all of these tragic 
things would stop, right?

309
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,870
Misaki?

310
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,880
Misaki!

311
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,010
Misaki!

312
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,070
Stand by oneself.
