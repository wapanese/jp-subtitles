1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,600
Did you hear about Ayano?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,010
She was trying to escape, wasn't she?

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,860
I think so.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,470
You think she died because 
she tried to get away?

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,680
I don't know...

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,570
Ogura's brother died 
that same day, didn't he?

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,650
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,570
Hadn't he shut himself up at home?

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,200
Yes.

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,970
You know, I heard something 
about the class trip.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,110
Apparently, it does have significance.

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,250
Significance?

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,590
You mean, asking the gods for help?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,420
I heard the class was 
saved once by doing that.

15
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,600
Stupid...

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,520
Stupid brother!

17
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,630
You idiot!

18
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,260
Ouch!

19
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm sorry! Are you all right?

20
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,240
You okay?

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,500
Nice to meet you. 
I'm Kouichi Sakakibara.

22
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:56,920
Sakitani Memorial Hall

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,450
Got the tape?

24
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,840
Yep.

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Listen to it?

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,890
Not yet.

27
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,920
I'm afraid to listen to it alone.

28
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,120
Let's take a picture to 
commemorate this occasion.

29
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,750
It's our last summer break 
in junior high, after all.

30
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Okay?

31
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,900
Sakitani Memorial Hall

32
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,880
Everyone line up over there.

33
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,890
Perfect.

34
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,760
Let's get the teachers in the shot, too.

35
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,240
Okay, almost ready.

36
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,230
Sakakibara and Misaki, squeeze 
a little closer together.

37
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,570
You should get to be in one, too.

38
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,820
I'll take it for you.

39
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,450
Here goes!

40
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,640
Mochizuki, you and 
Ms. Mikami are too far apart!

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Same goes for Sakaki and Misaki!

42
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,660
Kazami, you're fine there.

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
All right, say "cheese!"

44
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,380
Tomorrow, we'll visit the shrine 
to pray for our safety.

45
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,310
Right.

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,930
This is a nice lodge.

47
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,610
A local business donated its recreation center.

48
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,160
It seems a bit extravagant for 
a school group, if you ask me.

49
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,640
Welcome!

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,200
We've kept all the rooms open for you.

51
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,410
Thank you for having us 
for the next three days.

52
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,080
We're happy to. Thanks for coming.

53
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,300
If there's anything you need, 
don't hesitate to ask.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
Okay...

55
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm playing it.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,240
<i>Now, this is the important part.</i>

57
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,250
<i>Right after we finally reached 
the bottom of the mountain,</i>

58
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,000
<i>that's when it happened.</i>

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,160
<i>And by </i>it<i>, I mean...</i>

60
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,950
<i>I...</i>

61
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,920
<i>It happened in the forest, 
outside the lodge.</i>

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,540
<i>I got into an argument 
with a guy named [*].</i>

63
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,100
<i>We ended up trading blows.</i>

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,540
<i>And then... And then...</i>

65
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,050
<i>The next thing I knew, he wasn't moving.</i>

66
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,470
<i>He was lying under a huge tree.</i>

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,950
<i>When I looked closer, 
I saw he'd been impaled on a branch.</i>

68
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,480
<i>He was dead.</i>

69
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,030
<i>Terrified, I ran back to 
my room at the lodge.</i>

70
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,610
<i>It had been decided that 
we'd be staying an extra night.</i>

71
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,620
<i>The police came to see us about 
the lightning and the fall.</i>

72
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,100
<i>They asked me a lot of questions,</i>

73
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,500
<i>but I couldn't tell 
them anything about [*].</i>

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,120
<i>I hardly slept at all that night.</i>

75
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,060
<i>I was sure someone would find 
[*]'s body and everyone would freak.</i>

76
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,380
<i>But in the morning, there were 
no signs of that happening,</i>

77
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,440
<i>so I went back into the 
forest to find it myself.</i>

78
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,690
<i>But... it wasn't there.</i>

79
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,220
<i>It had vanished without a trace.</i>

80
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,180
<i>I was so bewildered...</i>

81
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,790
<i>I asked the others what 
had happened to [*].</i>

82
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,950
<i>But they all just looked 
at me like I was crazy.</i>

83
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,780
<i>"Who's that? I don't know 
anyone with that name."</i>

84
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,780
<i>They even said there were 19 
students on the trip, not 20.</i>

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,840
<i>That's when it dawned on me...</i>

86
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:53,620
<i>The guy I'd killed must have been 
the extra student all along.</i>

87
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,270
<i>I know without a doubt that I killed [*].</i>

88
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,760
<i>Nothing will change that fact.</i>

89
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,520
<i>That's why I decided 
to come clean here.</i>

90
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,730
<i>This is my confession.</i>

91
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,700
<i>It's been two weeks since the trip,</i>

92
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,290
<i>and only I, the sole person deeply involved in his death, still remember [*].</i>

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,330
<i>But I get the feeling it's 
only a matter of time.</i>

94
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,150
<i>That's why, while my memory is still clear,</i>

95
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,710
<i>I want to tell you the truth,</i>

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,750
<i>and how to stop the calamity.</i>

97
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,760
<i>Are you listening?</i>

98
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,990
<i>Send them back to death, 
where they belong.</i>

99
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,650
<i>Send the dead back to death.</i>

100
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,800
<i>That's how to stop the 
calamity once it's begun.</i>

101
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,240
We couldn't hear his name.

102
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,620
Does that mean this has been altered?

103
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,980
Probably.

104
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,370
Then, it must be real.

105
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,000
There'd be no reason to alter a fake.

106
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,860
Well, we don't need the name.

107
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,970
What matters is how 
to stop the calamity.

108
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,870
They say there's no way to 
tell the dead from the living.

109
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,720
And they don't know they're dead.

110
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,040
Is there any way to tell at all?

111
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,750
There doesn't seem to be.

112
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,610
Mr. Matsunaga's case was pure coincidence.

113
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,490
You don't suppose the extra 
student is here, at this lodge, do you?

114
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,860
Say we do figure out who it is...

115
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,130
Then what?

116
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,960
Are we supposed to... kill them?

117
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,090
Well—

118
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,710
Could you kill a classmate?

119
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,330
You know, I've been thinking 
about who the extra could be.

120
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,490
Do you have someone in mind?

121
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,530
Well, I...

122
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,120
I just think there must be 
some way to tell who it is.

123
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,890
Keep inhaler in bag when not in use.

124
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,310
Maybe there is, and we 
just don't know it yet.

125
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,690
Exactly.

126
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,570
May I have a moment, Ms. Mikami?

127
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,430
Since we're all together, 
there's something I'd like to say.

128
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,960
Is that all right?

129
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,930
Um, sure.

130
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,730
Go ahead, Akazawa.

131
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,380
Since May, we have experienced 
nothing but misfortune.

132
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,270
Just last month, even 
Mr. Kubodera became a victim.

133
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,430
To begin, I'd like to apologize for my

134
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,160
great ineptitude as the 
head of countermeasures.

135
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,700
In addition, though it remains unclear

136
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,330
whether this trip will lead 
us toward a resolution,

137
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,980
I sincerely believe that you, 
Misaki, bear some degree

138
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,430
of responsibility for the 
disasters we've faced.

139
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,220
Why...

140
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,850
If Misaki had properly upheld her 
role as the nonexistent student,

141
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,480
I believe no one would've died.

142
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,010
Hold on!

143
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,450
What happened was unavoidable.

144
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,990
She couldn't help how it all went down.

145
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,130
Really, now?

146
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,050
If she had been completely thorough 
in avoiding contact with Sakakibara,

147
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,620
the countermeasure would have succeeded.

148
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,050
But—

149
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,160
I believe the primary person responsible 
for its failure is Misaki.

150
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,840
Wouldn't you agree?

151
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,590
What do you expect 
her to do about it now?

152
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,720
Apologize.

153
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,220
We have yet to hear one word 
of apology from her.

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Yet, Misaki, the moment you 
were allowed to exist again,

155
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,370
you carried on as if nothing happened.

156
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,230
There's no point.

157
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,730
Would apologizing serve any purpose?

158
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,950
If it will, I'll do it.

159
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,410
Misaki, you have nothing to apologize for.

160
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,000
It's my fault.

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
It's not!

163
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,500
Stop it!

164
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
This is pointless!

165
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,840
What's important is figuring 
out who the extra—

166
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,900
Hey, Wakui, are you okay?

167
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,480
Are you in pain?

168
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,590
Hey!

169
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,650
Is this boy asthmatic?

170
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,120
Yes. He always has this.

171
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,230
An inhaler? Shouldn't he use this?

172
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,040
It's empty?

173
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,990
Do you have a spare?

174
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,560
Call an ambulance! 
Ms. Mikami, call an ambulance now!

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Um...

176
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,420
Our phones haven't been working since 
yesterday. We can't make calls.

177
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,000
We've arranged for repairs...

178
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,000
It's out of range.

179
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,760
Does anyone have service?

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,030
Call 119! Get an ambulance here!

181
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,620
It says there's an antenna here, 
but I can't connect!

182
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,010
Mine won't work, either.

183
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,260
There's no service.

184
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,020
I'll drive him to the hospital.

185
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,740
Are you all right?

186
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,290
I'm not the one you should be worried about.

187
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,000
Maybe we shouldn't go up 
the mountain tomorrow.

188
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,320
Maybe not.

189
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,200
Sakakibara...

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,950
Yeah?

191
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,070
Thanks for earlier.

192
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,200
Huh?

193
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,150
You stood up for me in the dining room.

194
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,020
Oh, that. It was nothing.

195
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,140
And it wasn't just me.

196
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,820
There was Mochizuki and Teshigawara, too.

197
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,760
Thank you.

198
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,330
Will you come see me later?

199
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,830
I have my own room.

200
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
And...

201
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,240
I want to see the photo.

202
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,480
Where was it?

203
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,700
In a detached room at our house.

204
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,530
My grandma found it.

205
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,020
I don't know why it 
was in there, though.

206
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,640
Really?

207
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,060
My aunt Reiko uses that room.

208
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,080
With everyone in grade 9, class 3
March 16, 1973

209
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,210
Can you tell which one 
Misaki Yomiyama is?

210
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,870
Well, I can see that one 
person looks strange.

211
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,310
Strange? In what way?

212
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,870
Like...

213
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,720
He's kind of blurry, compared 
to the others in the photo.

214
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,350
Distorted, somehow.

215
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,430
That's right.

216
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,710
What about the color? 
Do you see any strange colors?

217
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,300
No, not really.

218
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,260
Thank you.

219
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,490
Are these other photos your mom's, too?

220
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,330
Yeah.

221
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,910
They really did look alike.

222
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,650
Who?

223
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,270
Your mother and your aunt.

224
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,150
You think so?

225
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,330
Their faces looked the same as kids.

226
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,790
Does Reiko do painting at home?

227
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,790
Yeah.

228
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,430
She considers that her real job.

229
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,970
I see.

230
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,760
You were drawing something, 
too, weren't you? An angel?

231
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,370
Who was the model for that?

232
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,580
It was...

233
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,020
Your cousin Misaki?

234
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,940
Maybe.

235
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,060
When we first met, at the hospital,

236
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:26,480
were you taking that doll 
to your cousin, after she passed away?

237
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,310
Did you find that strange?

238
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,000
Uh...

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,540
It's sort of complicated.

240
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,450
I don't usually like talking about it.

241
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,970
Could you tell me?

242
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,230
Okay.

243
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,380
My mother Kirika's real name is Yukiyo,

244
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,040
and Misaki's mother's name is Mitsuyo.

245
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,180
They're twins, almost identical.

246
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,210
When they grew up, 
they both got married,

247
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,350
and Mitsuyo became a mother.

248
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,950
To your cousin Misaki?

249
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,360
And one other.

250
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,220
She had twins.

251
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,710
Twins?

252
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,310
One year later, Yukiyo 
became pregnant, too.

253
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,490
But her baby never came into this world.

254
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,850
You mentioned that.

255
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,340
Yukiyo was so grief-stricken, 
she nearly had a breakdown.

256
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,180
To make matters worse, 
the Fujioka household,

257
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,000
into which the twins were born, 
was in financial trouble.

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,900
The Misaki household, on the other hand,

259
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,780
needed something to soothe Yukiyo's heart.

260
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,490
It was a matter of supply and demand.

261
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,390
You mean—

262
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,260
I was given to her.

263
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,970
I think they gave me to her, instead of Misaki,

264
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,830
because of my name.

265
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,000
Your name?

266
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,230
If the Misakis took 
in a daughter named Misaki,

267
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,940
her name would be Misaki Misaki.

268
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,560
I've been raised as Yukiyo's, as Kirika's only daughter, for as long as I can remember.

269
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,670
I think I was in 5th grade 
when I discovered the truth.

270
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,790
My grandmother accidentally let it slip.

271
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,740
I've never seen my mother so flustered.

272
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,430
She was probably planning to 
keep it a secret my whole life.

273
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,240
What happened once you knew the truth?

274
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,910
I wanted to meet Mitsuyo 
Fujioka, my other mother,

275
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,100
and I told Kirika that.

276
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,830
At first, she looked incredibly sad.

277
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,500
But then she was furious.

278
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,300
She didn't want you to 
meet your birth mother?

279
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,690
I guess not.

280
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,750
She doesn't interfere in my life much,

281
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,300
except, as I've mentioned, for certain things.

282
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,760
Right, I remember.

283
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,210
I think she feels anxious.

284
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,340
That's probably why she makes 
me carry a cell phone.

285
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,030
But while all that was going on,

286
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,100
I was secretly meeting with Misaki.

287
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,500
By then, she also knew 
that we were twins.

288
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,410
We felt that we were connected, 
whether we wanted to be or not.

289
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,250
She often sneaked over to my house.

290
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,680
She said she liked my house because 
it was full of pretty dolls.

291
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,040
When I asked her what she 
wanted for her birthday in April,

292
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,870
she said, "I want that doll."

293
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,010
But soon after starting 
9th grade, she suddenly...

294
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,250
That's what you were doing?

295
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,160
I had made a promise to her.

296
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,070
So you were sisters, not cousins...

297
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,260
Yes.

298
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,890
That's why you told me 
"it may have already begun."

299
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,250
So you remember that.

300
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,460
Yes.

301
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,130
Why didn't you tell me that day?

302
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,140
I...

303
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,360
I just...

304
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,000
I didn't want to believe it.

305
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,990
I didn't want to believe Misaki had died

306
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,120
because of some crazy curse.

307
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,370
That's why...

308
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,250
I could only call her my cousin.

309
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,100
I didn't want to say it.

310
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,960
The Misaki who died in April 
was the first victim.

311
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,390
If that's true, then...

312
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,590
Everyone else seems to think the 
calamity began in May, but...

313
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,640
The extra student was already

314
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,790
in the class before I came to Yomi North.

315
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,090
Is that why you're so 
certain that I'm not dead?

316
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,240
Yes.

317
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,970
Because I wasn't in the 
class back in April?

318
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,160
There's that, but it's not the main reason.

319
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,180
What's your main reason?

320
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,110
It's...

321
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,560
This eye.

322
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,410
This doll's eye tells me you're not.

323
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,930
Your left eye?

324
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,900
I think I told you

325
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,430
that it lets me see things 
that should remain unseen.

326
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,260
Yeah. What can it see?

327
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,940
The...

328
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,780
...color of death.

329
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,560
The color of things close to death.

330
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,400
Color?

331
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,270
What color is that?

332
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,150
A color I've never seen 
with my right eye.

333
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,770
It doesn't belong with 
colors like red and blue.

334
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,340
It's unique.

335
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,470
And you can only see that 
color in people who are dead?

336
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,390
It's clearest in dead people,

337
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,980
and faint in those with 
serious illnesses or injuries.

338
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,310
You mean, you can tell when 
people are about to die?

339
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,100
You can't understand how I 
can see these things, right?

340
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,080
Well...

341
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,830
I've had to accept it.

342
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,760
I've never even talked 
to Misaki about this.

343
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,370
At some point,

344
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,400
I decided to keep this eye 
covered for the rest of my life.

345
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,760
That's why I wanted to see 
that photo from 26 years ago.

346
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,910
You could see the color of 
death in Misaki Yomiyama?

347
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,900
Yes.

348
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,740
It's the first time I've ever seen 
that color so clearly in a photo.

349
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,950
I don't see the color of death in you.

350
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,150
That's how I know it's not you.

351
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,990
You're not the extra.

352
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,240
And you know it's not you 
for the same reason?

353
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,370
Does that mean you already 
know who the extra person is?

354
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,090
I try to keep my eyepatch on at school.

355
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,300
But you wrote "Who is dead?" on your desk.

356
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,970
It wasn't as if my finding 
out would change anything.

357
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,300
I did wonder, though... So...

358
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,190
What about now?

359
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,320
Is the dead person here on this trip?

360
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,580
The extra person...

361
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,280
...is here.

362
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,210
Who is it?

363
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,960
It's...

364
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,090
Sakaki!

365
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,970
I think I might have 
done something bad!

366
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,230
Makeup.
