1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,430
<i>I'll get it!</i>

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,250
I heard Nakao was hit by a boat.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,820
Then it's a lie that people won't 
die if they leave Yomiyama!

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,130
Yeah, I guess.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,070
So, we have nowhere to run?

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,510
What should we do?

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,290
Hey, should we still go on the class trip?

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,290
No way!

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,920
It makes no sense to go on 
a class trip in the summer

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,340
of a year when <i>it</i> happens.

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,340
It'd be safest to stay 
locked up at home.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,510
Maybe...

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,650
Why is this even happening to us?

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,190
It's so unfair.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,270
Yeah.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,790
If only that transfer student 
hadn't spoken to Misaki...

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,490
<i>But I...</i>

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,530
<i>I protected them.</i>

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>I left it for them...</i>

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,970
<i>...in the classroom.</i>

21
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,640
You girls be careful.

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,650
We will.

23
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,250
How did Nakao seem that day?

24
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,950
He had a bad case of car sickness,

25
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,170
and threw up a lot.

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,510
Anything else?

27
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,240
Well...

28
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,970
He couldn't swim straight.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
I see...

30
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,030
Maybe that's what happened!

31
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,510
What do you mean?

32
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,070
I spoke with Mr. Ohba, a city police 
detective, about what happened.

33
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,110
And he had a nagging suspicion...

34
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,880
that Nakao may have been dead 
before the boat hit him.

35
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,480
The condition of his head 
when he died was inconsistent

36
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,880
with the timing of his 
collision with the boat.

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,100
The herniation caused by 
a cerebral contusion

38
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,490
had already progressed significantly.

39
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,830
You mean, before he went to the beach?

40
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,420
According to his family,

41
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,560
they heard a loud noise from 
the stairway that morning.

42
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,000
When they went to check it out,

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,060
all they saw was Nakao 
hurrying out the door.

44
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,570
He must have hit his head then.

45
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,690
Most likely.

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,030
So the event that led to his 
death took place in Yomiyama?

47
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,480
A safe assumption.

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,800
When he left Yomiyama without

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,910
having his head checked at the hospital,

50
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,120
his death was assured.

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,680
Hey, Misaki?

52
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,530
Yes?

53
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,400
Never mind.

54
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,470
I'll say it after I find out for sure.

55
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,520
All right.

56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,850
Did you find that class 
photo from 26 years ago?

57
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,530
Not yet.

58
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,640
It's your fault.

59
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,850
It's your fault.

60
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,900
It's your fault.

61
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,740
It's your fault.

62
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,570
It's your fault!

63
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,910
Inoya

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
The classroom?!

65
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,470
Seriously?

66
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,480
That's what Mr. Matsunaga said.

67
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,590
He must mean the class 3 
homeroom in the old school building.

68
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,280
But what did he hide there?

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,390
All right, well, at least 
we've got the location.

70
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,500
I'll just...

71
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,250
Wait.

72
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,530
I don't want to tell anyone else.

73
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,600
Why not?

74
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,120
If Nakao hadn't gone to the beach,

75
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,780
he probably wouldn't have died.

76
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,740
Still...

77
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,240
I don't want to get 
anyone else involved.

78
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,140
I don't want anyone else to die.

79
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,210
We shouldn't tell Akazawa or 
the countermeasures committee just yet.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,300
If we find something,

81
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,110
and if we need their help 
at that point, then we can.

82
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,140
Makes sense.

83
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,440
I wouldn't want to see Akazawa die.

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,290
So, when should we go 
to the old building?

85
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,080
We can't go right now?

86
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,570
I have plans with my 
family this evening.

87
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,380
Tomorrow would work.

88
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,710
Then, how about first 
thing in the morning?

89
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,420
Come on, anything but morning!

90
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,170
All right, then... noon?

91
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,900
A lot of club members 
will be around then.

92
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,640
And since the second 
floor is barricaded...

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
Then... evening?

94
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,430
Hard to look for stuff at night.

95
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,060
Fine, 3 o'clock it is.

96
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,020
Okay.

97
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,840
Works for me.

98
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,220
Mochizuki, the art club meets 
in that building, right?

99
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,470
Yeah.

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,740
Do any club members come 
in over summer break?

101
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,030
No, never.

102
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,160
Then we can meet in the club room?

103
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,460
Sure!

104
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,140
I have a key,

105
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,830
and no one would question me being there.

106
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Teshigawara, please don't 
show up dressed like that.

107
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,460
Huh? Why not?

108
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,860
You'll stand out.

109
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,040
That's the price of being fashionable!

110
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,160
Inoya

111
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,070
Hey, do I spy Kouichi and Teshy?

112
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,950
What's the go-home club's 
ace doing at school?

113
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,080
Nothing special.

114
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,610
We're meeting up with Mochizuki.

115
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,660
You two here for club stuff?

116
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,530
We wanted to see Mr. 
Chibiki about something.

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,660
In the auxiliary library?

118
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,830
Not for that.

119
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,880
Mr. Chibiki is the drama club's advisor.

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,060
No way!

121
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,800
The guy who wears nothing but black?

122
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,850
That's surprising.

123
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,790
He actually gives pretty 
solid acting advice.

124
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,600
And he looks sort of cool when he's 
acting. It's fascinating.

125
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,690
So?

126
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,900
Why exactly are you here?

127
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,080
We're looking for a clue 
to stopping the calamity.

128
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,490
We don't know what it is,

129
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,690
but if we do find it, we intend to 
tell everyone else about it.

130
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,350
Seriously?

131
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,750
Something like that exists?

132
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,960
We want to stop the class 3 
calamity ourselves, if we can.

133
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,320
You guys wanna come along?

134
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,350
Hey!

135
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,820
I'll pass.

136
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,400
Me, too.

137
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,670
Goodbye, Kouichi.

138
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,900
Later.

139
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,900
Bye.

140
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,620
Misaki!

141
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,820
Where's Mochizuki?

142
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,480
I don't know.

143
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,460
I just got here.

144
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,860
Why are you here?

145
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,380
I had nothing to do,

146
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,910
and I didn't want to stay at home,

147
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,480
so I thought I'd come in and draw.

148
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,430
Oh.

149
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,300
What about you?

150
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,190
And Mochizuki's coming, too?

151
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,350
What brings you three here?

152
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,630
Well...

153
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,550
I guess you could call it... exploring?

154
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,480
Sorry I'm late!

155
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,780
And where do you plan to explore?

156
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,890
Uh...

157
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,170
Well, Teshigawara said 
we should meet up here...

158
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,030
No, I...

159
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,830
Um, that's it!

160
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,360
Sakaki said he had 
to look for something!

161
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,920
It's sort of important.

162
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,800
Do Not Enter

163
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,260
Look, we don't know what might happen,

164
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,430
so I'd rather you stayed in the club room.

165
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,660
I'll be fine.

166
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,050
Are you sure?

167
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,130
You really are weird, Misaki.

168
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,440
Aren't you scared?

169
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,400
No, I don't think so.

170
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,350
Which room was class 3's?

171
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,190
Probably the one in the middle.

172
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,970
There are five classrooms.

173
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,290
By the way, didn't this old building

174
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,670
have seven mysteries of some kind?

175
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,700
I wouldn't know.

176
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,990
I don't give a rat's ass 
about some urban legends.

177
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,550
So, you don't believe in 
ghosts and curses and stuff?

178
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,360
As if!

179
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,090
They're all just coincidences 
or tricks of the eye.

180
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,560
Except the calamity, of course.

181
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,830
Isn't "the secret of the auxiliary library" 
one of the seven mysteries?

182
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,930
The library?

183
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,320
They say you can occasionally 
hear moaning coming from it.

184
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,690
You ever heard it?

185
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,650
No.

186
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,000
I've heard there's an old 
archive in its basement

187
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,740
containing secret writings that can't 
be revealed to the public,

188
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,810
and that a librarian once locked 
himself inside to guard them.

189
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,970
So basically, that librarian is still alive,

190
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,600
and you can hear him moaning 
from the basement?

191
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Bet it would just turn 
out to be Chibiki.

192
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,270
I hear moaning in there, sometimes.

193
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,890
Are you serious?

194
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,980
Really?

195
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,990
Just kidding.

196
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,950
Let's let in some fresh air.

197
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,750
You are not fine at all.

198
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,920
Yes, I am. See?

199
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,390
You look fine to me.

200
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,810
I wouldn't want anyone to see us

201
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,140
and make us into another 
one of the seven mysteries.

202
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,480
Let's keep the windows closed.

203
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,450
Teshigawara!

204
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,410
Gimme a break...

205
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,410
You seem fine.

206
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,300
Take care.

207
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,640
Yeah.

208
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,550
I'll call you.

209
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,300
Later.

210
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,470
Later.

211
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,230
I'm not finding anything.

212
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,270
I don't think it'll be in a place

213
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,000
where it's easy to find, like in a desk.

214
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,540
But surely it wouldn't be 
where no one could find it.

215
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,240
Then there'd be no point in leaving it.

216
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,730
That's true.

217
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,310
It's probably not on the 
floor, or in any desks.

218
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,600
What about in there?

219
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,870
All I see are cleaning supplies.

220
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,050
What's that?

221
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,490
Find something?

222
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,930
What's that?

223
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,830
Something's written on it.

224
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,460
Let's see...

225
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,700
"To the future students who 
are undoubtedly suffering

226
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,110
from the senseless disaster of this class."

227
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,190
Bingo!

228
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,350
This is it!

229
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,820
Mr. Matsunaga must have written that!

230
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,990
A/V Room

231
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,430
I'm sure there's one in here, 
but is it okay to use it?

232
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,720
As long as no one finds out.

233
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,910
I found it!

234
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,540
Okay, let's play it.

235
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,220
<i>Um...</i>

236
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,860
<i>My... My name is Katsumi Matsunaga.</i>

237
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,980
<i>I'm a student of the 
9th grade, class 3 of 1983.</i>

238
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,790
<i>When I finish recording this,</i>

239
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,080
<i>I plan to hide it somewhere 
in the classroom.</i>

240
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,130
<i>If you're listening to this tape,</i>

241
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:06,100
<i>you're most likely in class 3, as well.</i>

242
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,420
<i>I wonder what the 
likelihood of that is...</i>

243
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,700
Ayano

244
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:16,070
<i>It's possible that you 
guys are also terrified</i>

245
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,410
<i>by the senseless disaster 
that I... that we...</i>

246
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,240
<i>Never mind.</i>

247
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,830
<i>I have two reasons 
for leaving this tape.</i>

248
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,960
<i>One is to confess a sin. My sin.</i>

249
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,510
<i>I want to tell someone what I did.</i>

250
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,150
<i>I need someone to listen.</i>

251
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,160
<i>The other is to give you some advice.</i>

252
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,000
<i>It's about the extra student who gets 
mixed up in the class,</i>

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,820
<i>and the calamity that 
happens as a result...</i>

254
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,420
<i>How it can be stopped.</i>

255
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,680
<i>In other words...</i>

256
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,040
<i>Actually, I should start at the beginning.</i>

257
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,860
<i>Our class went on a trip.</i>

258
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,980
<i>We all left on August 8, 
for three days and two nights.</i>

259
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,200
<i>Our homeroom teacher, Mr. Koga, had 
suggested that we visit a local shrine.</i>

260
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,230
<i>There's an old shrine in this town 
called Yomiyama Shrine.</i>

261
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,480
<i>He said that if we all prayed there,</i>

262
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,160
<i>he was sure the curse would be lifted.</i>

263
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,010
<i>There were 22 students in all, 
myself included.</i>

264
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,670
<i>We only half believed him.</i>

265
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,810
<i>On the second day,</i>

266
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,140
<i>we climbed the mountain 
to visit the shrine.</i>

267
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,790
<i>It was so old and run-down,</i>

268
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,310
<i>like it had been abandoned by the world.</i>

269
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,870
<i>Even though it bears 
the name of the city,</i>

270
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,400
<i>it looked like it hadn't 
been maintained at all.</i>

271
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,700
<i>So we decided to clean up the 
grounds while we were there.</i>

272
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,080
<i>At the time, we hoped that maybe 
this would lift the curse.</i>

273
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,720
<i>And after we prayed, 
our teacher confidently declared,</i>

274
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,210
<i>"Everything will be all right now."</i>

275
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,570
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

276
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,960
<i>It wasn't that easy.</i>

277
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,450
<i>As soon as we left the shrine,</i>

278
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,250
<i>the clear skies suddenly turned overcast,</i>

279
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,850
<i>and it began to rain,</i>

280
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,160
<i>complete with lightning strikes.</i>

281
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
<i>As we hurried down the mountain,</i>

282
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,150
<i>the first victim was 
a boy named Hamaguchi.</i>

283
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,950
<i>He was kind of dumb.</i>

284
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,510
<i>He was the only one 
who'd brought an umbrella.</i>

285
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,130
<i>And we were on a mountain, 
in a lightning storm...</i>

286
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,540
<i>He was walking 
in front of me, when...</i>

287
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,150
<i>For a second, my vision went white,</i>

288
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,790
<i>and I heard a huge crash.</i>

289
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,370
<i>Hamaguchi had been struck by lightning.</i>

290
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,300
<i>I still remember the smell 
of his flesh burning...</i>

291
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,720
<i>Anyway, the students panicked 
and bolted,</i>

292
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,650
<i>leaving Hamaguchi behind,</i>

293
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,100
<i>desperate to get off the 
mountain as quickly as possible.</i>

294
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,790
<i>But moments after we all took off, 
blindly running through the rain...</i>

295
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,770
<i>The second victim was taken.</i>

296
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,850
<i>A girl named Hoshikawa.</i>

297
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,450
<i>In her panic,</i>

298
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,660
<i>she slipped and fell off a tall, sheer cliff.</i>

299
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,120
<i>All we could do was call for help 
at the foot of the mountain.</i>

300
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,210
<i>But in the end, we couldn't 
save either of them.</i>

301
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,820
<i>Praying at the shrine 
had no effect whatsoever.</i>

302
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,690
<i>Now, this is the important part.</i>

303
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,110
<i>Right after we finally reached 
the bottom of the mountain,</i>

304
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,780
<i>that's when it happened.</i>

305
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,420
<i>And by </i>it<i>, I mean...</i>

306
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,320
<i>I...</i>

307
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,590
Crap!

308
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,640
That was close.

309
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,400
I was in a cold sweat.

310
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,910
Yeah, same.

311
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,400
The tape!

312
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,070
Oh, no.

313
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,120
Idiot.

314
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,650
You've gotta be kidding!

315
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,360
We didn't get to hear the important part!

316
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,850
What should we do?!

317
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,080
All we need to do is fix the tape.

318
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,780
It can be fixed?!

319
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,830
I think it's possible.

320
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,630
Great! Thanks, buddy!

321
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,120
We've gotta hear the rest!

322
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,010
Do you mind if we leave it with you?

323
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,140
I'll give it my best shot.

324
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,650
Brother!

325
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,120
Glass eye.
