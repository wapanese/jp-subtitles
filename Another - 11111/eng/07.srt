1
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,970
Everyone out!

2
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,530
Call the police and an ambulance, now!

3
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,290
Was anyone hurt?

4
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you all right?

5
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,740
I'm okay.

6
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,880
Let's go, Sakakibara.

7
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,530
It looks like making two students 
not exist didn't work.

8
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,140
<i>I'm at my wit's end.</i>

9
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,230
<i>I'm so tired.</i>

10
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,200
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

11
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,340
<i>Mr. Kubodera...</i>

12
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,490
<i>I'm sure you understand.</i>

13
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,740
<i>I leave the rest to you.</i>

14
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,470
That troubled me.

15
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,740
Sorry.

16
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,270
Anyway, the result of an investigation 
of Mr. Kubodera's home was disturbing.

17
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,920
Mr. Kubodera was a bachelor,

18
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,350
who still lived with his mother.

19
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,020
She was well on in years,

20
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,340
and had been bedridden for some 
time, due to a serious illness.

21
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,030
They found her dead in her bed.

22
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,790
She had clearly been murdered.

23
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,300
The stress of caring for her... 
The class 3 calamity...

24
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,070
Perhaps he felt so trapped by it all 
that it drove him to kill his own mother.

25
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,300
And then he killed himself 
in front of his students.

26
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,940
Why would he make such extreme decisions?

27
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,070
You think this was a 
result of the phenomenon?

28
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,230
Yes.

29
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,640
So he was drawn into death 
by otherwise unlikely means?

30
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,330
Could there be any other explanation?

31
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,290
The calamity hasn't been stopped.

32
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,940
People will keep dying.

33
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,420
There was nothing we could do.

34
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,050
Come on, Sakaki, don't get so down.

35
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,640
Blaming yourself won't change anything.

36
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,570
Do Not Enter

37
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,850
Until recently, you were...

38
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,910
Yeah, and it was breaking my heart!

39
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,080
You know the whole story now, right?

40
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,160
So you get where I'm coming from?

41
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,340
Yes, I understand perfectly well.

42
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,950
What about you, Misaki? 
Feel like a weight's been lifted?

43
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,140
Hard to say.

44
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,620
I didn't really feel a 
weight to begin with.

45
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,040
You are seriously weird.

46
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,490
Here you are.

47
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,630
Jeez, what's your problem?

48
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,530
You both might exist again,

49
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,430
but you'd best be prepared.

50
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,800
For what?

51
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,310
It's your fault.

52
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,430
H-Hey!

53
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,810
People will say that.

54
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,970
There's no way you'll be 
considered completely innocent,

55
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,100
and I'm sure I'll be accused 
of incompetence, as well.

56
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,320
True.

57
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,650
Where do you stand?

58
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,450
I can't blame Kouichi,

59
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,040
no matter what anyone says.

60
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,540
But it's not over.

61
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,120
The calamity, and my work as 
head of countermeasures,

62
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,540
are only just beginning.

63
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,690
I wonder if anyone will go

64
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,680
into hiding now, until summer break.

65
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Definitely.

66
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,020
Some people may have fled town already.

67
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
You think?

68
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,920
Yes. It happens every year.

69
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,620
There are always people who leave

70
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,180
Yomiyama for summer break.

71
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,520
It's all so strange.

72
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,440
But you really are weird, Misaki.

73
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,530
You talk like this doesn't involve you.

74
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,330
Do I?

75
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,710
Could it be that you're 
actually the extra this year?

76
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,960
It could very well be you, you know.

77
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,880
M-Me? No way!

78
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,340
Don't even joke about that.

79
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,260
There's really no way?

80
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,530
No, no, no!

81
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,740
I have no memories of dying!

82
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,700
And, not to brag,

83
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,310
but I clearly remember all 
the shit I got into as a kid!

84
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,580
You look well.

85
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,750
Thanks.

86
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,780
Was Akazawa here to talk 
to you about something?

87
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,530
As head of countermeasures,

88
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,870
she comes here often.

89
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,660
I see.

90
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,460
She's a strong girl, and she knows that,

91
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,140
but considering what she's up against...

92
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,510
I pity her.

93
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,180
By the way, Ms. Mikami 
dropped by today, too.

94
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,400
Ms. Mikami?

95
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,110
She knows my history here.

96
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,560
There was something she 
wanted to formally discuss.

97
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,150
And what brings you two here?

98
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,180
I wanted to ask about 15 years ago, 
when the calamity stopped midyear.

99
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,680
That was the one time 
in the past 25 years

100
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,530
when it stopped midyear.

101
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:04,890
April 12, sister, Kyouko, illness 
July 23, sister, Ikumi, illness 
June 6, accident 
June 13, accident 
August 9, accident 
August 9, accident

102
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,530
Excluding Ritsuko, whom I didn't know about,

103
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,680
there were seven deaths that year.

104
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,060
When did Ritsuko die?

105
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,890
In July.

106
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,550
Wait...

107
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
Does that mean the deaths 
stopped in August?

108
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,660
Yes, and look at the date 
of the August deaths.

109
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,360
August 9...

110
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,200
That class had just left 
for a class trip on August 8.

111
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,870
Class trip?

112
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,000
<i>I think something may have 
happened during summer break...</i>

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,850
So two students died in 
accidents on that trip?

114
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,290
And something happened on that trip 
that stopped the calamity?

115
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,510
So it would seem.

116
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,850
Notice that no one is listed 
as "deceased" on that page.

117
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,760
Deceased:

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,890
It never became clear who 
the dead person was that year.

119
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,460
Why did it stop?

120
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm not certain.

121
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,810
But I do know that they 
visited the Yomiyama Shrine.

122
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,780
A shrine?

123
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,560
A very old shrine, located 
halfway up Mt. Yomiyama.

124
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,050
Their lodge was at
the foot of that mountain.

125
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,520
So maybe if we visit the shrine...

126
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,590
Naturally, people went back to it in

127
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,460
years when the calamity occurred,

128
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,670
but it had no effect.

129
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,550
So the shrine had nothing to do with it?

130
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,870
No, that's not conclusive.

131
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,090
It could be that going 
there in a large group,

132
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,600
in early August, was effective.

133
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,800
Of course, we can't deny the 
possibility that the effect came

134
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,440
from something else, unrelated 
to visiting the shrine.

135
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,070
This is what Ms. Mikami came 
here to discuss with me today.

136
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,150
July 17 (Fri.)

137
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,150
This may seem abrupt,

138
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,700
but we will be conducting a class trip

139
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
from August 8-10, for three 
days and two nights.

140
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,070
Please prioritize this event,

141
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,230
and plan to participate, 
if at all possible.

142
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,590
You will receive additional 
details in the coming days.

143
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,730
I will mail the forms to all of you.

144
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,440
Question!

145
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,930
Ms. Mikami?

146
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,070
Who is dead?

147
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,020
Who is dead?

148
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,620
Who is dead?

149
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,540
The dead one...

150
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,430
...is you.

151
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,130
M-Me?

152
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,080
Dad

153
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,110
Hello?

154
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,440
I swear, India just gets hotter and hotter!

155
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,780
How've you been, kiddo?

156
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,460
Fine, I guess.

157
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,310
Yeah.

158
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,390
Yeah, everyone's doing well.

159
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,310
Hey, Dad?

160
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,150
Have you ever seen any of Mom's 
photos from junior high?

161
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,910
Photos?

162
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm pretty sure she showed me

163
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,660
her graduation album when we got engaged.

164
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,950
Any others?

165
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,130
Like, have you seen the group photo

166
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,660
her class took after their 
graduation ceremony?

167
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,620
Group photo? Why do you ask?

168
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,670
Well, I've heard that it 
was kind of weird.

169
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:04,170
Do Not Enter

170
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,210
Like, a ghost photo.

171
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,170
Where did you hear a 
silly story like that?

172
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,390
For one thing, ghost photos are just—

173
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,930
Well, it's just...

174
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,870
Oh, actually, now that you mention it,

175
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,240
I might've heard a story 
like that, a long time ago.

176
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,440
Something about a creepy photo.

177
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,710
Did you see it?

178
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,440
Nope.

179
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,590
She didn't like having it near her,

180
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,190
so she left it at her parents' place.

181
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,490
Her parents' place?

182
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,350
Hey, Kouichi, something goin' on there?

183
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,210
No, nothing.

184
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,020
I'm just kinda bored.

185
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,480
Ah.

186
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,530
You know, Ritsuko was 
a very special lady.

187
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,040
My feelings for her haven't changed a bit.

188
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,310
And that's why you're my—

189
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,380
Okay, I get it!

190
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,780
Later!

191
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,520
Inoya?

192
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,590
Yeah, I know where that is, but...

193
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,450
Today?

194
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,590
Come on, dude!

195
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,030
Don't tell me.

196
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,090
You got a date with Mei?

197
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,250
Well? What is it you want to talk about?

198
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,950
It's gotta be in person.

199
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,870
If you've got a date, 
just bring Mei along.

200
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,790
This problem involves 
the whole class, after all.

201
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,870
All right, I'll be there.

202
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,920
Kouichi!

203
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,170
Over here.

204
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Akazawa?

205
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,940
Teshigawara called you here, right?

206
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,120
Um...

207
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,830
Have a seat.

208
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,970
He called you, too?

209
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,120
Yes.

210
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
Only because he said it 
"involves the whole class."

211
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,520
I wouldn't go anywhere at 
his invitation otherwise.

212
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,030
Teshigawara filled me in on 
what happened 15 years ago.

213
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,190
And about your mom, too.

214
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh...

215
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,870
Welcome.

216
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,620
A friend of yours, Izumi?

217
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,700
Yes.

218
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,150
This is my classmate, 
Kouichi Sakakibara.

219
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,140
Oh, that must make you 
Yuuya's friend, too.

220
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,170
Thanks for being so kind to my brother.

221
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,450
I'm Yuuya Mochizuki's 
older sister, Tomoka.

222
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,610
Nice to meet you.

223
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,790
Oh, yes, likewise.

224
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,800
Yuuya has told me a lot about you.

225
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,960
What can I get for you?

226
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,940
Oh, let me see...

227
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,590
He'll have the same as me.

228
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,480
Oh...

229
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,980
Coming right up.

230
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,810
What did you get?

231
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,980
Coffee.

232
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,250
I don't like coffee. It's too bitter.

233
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,910
Well, the coffee here is the real deal.

234
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,180
They use Hawaiian Kona Extra Fancy beans.

235
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,510
Thank you for waiting.

236
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,670
Please enjoy.

237
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,270
Just take my word for it.

238
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,840
Give it a try.

239
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,850
It's bitter, but also sweet.

240
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,820
I like it.

241
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,260
So, you didn't go back to Tokyo?

242
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,520
No. It'd feel like I was 
running away, and...

243
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,790
I've started to wonder 
if it's me who's dead.

244
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,000
Maybe you were never born.

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,690
Maybe 15 years ago,

246
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,170
the calamity took your mother's life,

247
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,380
and she couldn't give birth to you.

248
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,850
And now, 15 years later,

249
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,460
you've come back to life as a 
transfer student in class 3.

250
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,260
That's...

251
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,400
That's ridiculous.

252
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,640
Don't take me so seriously.

253
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,190
True, I did consider the possibility,

254
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,890
but...

255
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,620
Shake my hand.

256
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,920
I still get the feeling 
that we've met...

257
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,770
No, that I've shaken your 
hand somewhere before.

258
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,710
You think so?

259
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,970
I can't call up a visual memory,

260
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,760
but my hand physically remembers yours.

261
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,340
Now that you mention it,

262
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,020
you shook my hand at the hospital, too.

263
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,910
Did you do that for a reason?

264
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,440
There's a rumor that dead people 
have shockingly cold hands.

265
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,890
I doubt it's true, though.

266
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,240
If it were that easy to tell...

267
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,220
Welcome.

268
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,130
Sorry I'm late.

269
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,660
Hey, guys!

270
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,480
What'd you do that for?

271
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
Do you hate me that much?

272
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,160
Want the truth?

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,300
I wouldn't mind...

274
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,450
Oh, whatever. I'll let it slide today.

275
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,450
What did you want to talk about?

276
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,090
You tell them, Mochizuki.

277
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,560
Okay.

278
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,000
Since there's a chance

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,230
that my sister could become 
involved in what's going on...

280
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,620
Oh, my sister is...

281
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,150
Tomoka, right?

282
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,180
Yeah.

283
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,200
Anyway, I just couldn't 
keep quiet about it...

284
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,780
You told her?

285
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,220
Down to the details.

286
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,260
She went to Yomi North, too,

287
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,510
so she knew the rumors about class 3.

288
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,370
And Tomoka actually gave us a 
surprising bit of info.

289
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,390
One of our regulars is a man 
named Katsumi Matsunaga.

290
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,500
I knew he went to Yomi North,

291
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,060
but I recently found out 
that he was in class 3.

292
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,470
I worked up the courage to ask him

293
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,400
if <i>it</i> had happened in his year.

294
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,350
And he said...

295
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,600
The curse that year wasn't...

296
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,290
It wasn't my fault.

297
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,010
I saved them all.

298
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,910
I saved them!

299
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,540
I knew I had to tell them! 
So that's why...

300
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,120
I left it there.

301
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,840
What does that mean? Left what, where?

302
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,520
He couldn't seem to recall.

303
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,070
I've asked him about it many times,

304
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,220
but he insists he has no idea.

305
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,970
Makes you curious, doesn't it?

306
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,300
This Matsunaga guy 
stopped the calamity?

307
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,940
And he left a hint on how 
he did it somewhere?

308
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,450
That's gotta be it.

309
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,190
So, I'm thinking we should talk 
to this Matsunaga guy ourselves.

310
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,130
Do you know where we can find him?

311
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,090
No, I don't know where he lives.

312
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,150
Then...

313
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,790
Don't you know someone who 
was in Matsunaga's class?

314
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,330
Oh, so he was your aunt's classmate.

315
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,940
If I find out where Matsunaga is,

316
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,100
will you come with me to see him?

317
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,790
You really were the model 
for that doll, weren't you?

318
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,650
You said only half, 
but it looks just like you.

319
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,070
This girl is the daughter she 
gave birth to 12 years ago.

320
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,220
Your sister?

321
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,110
But she was stillborn.

322
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,850
She made this doll based on

323
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,320
the daughter who never 
had a chance to live.

324
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,090
So it's only half me, if not less.

325
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,110
Actually, I have somewhere 
to be tomorrow.

326
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,460
Oh? Where?

327
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,290
My parents want me

328
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,280
to go with them to their summer house.

329
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,190
I couldn't tell them I don't want to.

330
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,360
Is it outside Yomiyama?

331
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,430
Yes.

332
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,260
So you're leaving town?

333
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,480
We'll only be gone a week.

334
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,320
I'll be back for the class trip.

335
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,410
Oh...

336
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,590
Hey, have you found that ghost picture

337
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,090
your mother left 
at her parents' house?

338
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,970
No, not yet.

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,840
If you find it, will you show me?

340
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,190
Sure.

341
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,190
If anything comes up, use this number.

342
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,630
Is this a phone number?

343
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,120
For a cell phone?

344
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,230
Yes.

345
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,080
Yours?

346
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,820
Yes.

347
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,890
You said you hated those devices.

348
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,680
I do.

349
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,500
Being connected to people all the time 
by electromagnetic waves disturbs me.

350
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,930
Then why do you have one?

351
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,790
She makes me carry it.

352
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,370
She claims to feel uneasy at times.

353
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,210
I see.

354
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,430
By the way...

355
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Yes?

356
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,410
You said you wondered if 
it's you who's dead.

357
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,430
Yeah.

358
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,960
Has your suspicion been laid to rest?

359
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,270
Yeah.

360
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,360
Huh?

361
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,910
New dolls are put in here.

362
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,090
