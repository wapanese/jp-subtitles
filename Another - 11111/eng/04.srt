1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,510
A girl from the 9th grade's class 3 died.

2
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,430
Everybody's talking about it.

3
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,440
Her umbrella flew out of her hand 
when she fell down the stairs,

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,200
impaling her through the throat.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,460
Seriously?

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,970
It was so horrific, the witnesses

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,630
were ordered never to speak of it again.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,800
Wasn't she a class officer?

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,560
I heard her mother died in 
an accident that same day.

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,360
Do you think it's the curse?

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,620
You've heard of that?

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,570
It's the school's most famous secret.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,900
The curse of class 3,

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,230
and the story that started 
it all 26 years ago.

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,330
Yeah...

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,250
Does that mean it's going to 
happen again this year?

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,710
Maybe. Nothing happened last year.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,470
Once it starts, somebody 
dies every month, right?

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, at least one person 
connected to the class

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,000
dies per month.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
Not just students?

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,060
They say family members 
are at risk, too.

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,970
Especially parents and siblings.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,260
You sure know a lot about it...

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,260
One of the guys in my kendo 
club is in class 3.

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,380
He told me in secret.

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,220
He didn't seem to believe it, though.

28
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,050
But someone's actually died...

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,170
Yeah.

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,690
It's probably best to stay 
away from that class.

31
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,940
Yeah.

32
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,740
June 2 (Tue.)

33
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,720
Redial: Teshigawara

34
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,260
Hey, how's that lung of yours doing?

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,860
It seems fine.

36
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,250
But you witnessed such an awful sight.

37
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,950
That sort of thing can affect the body.

38
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,040
You know about that?

39
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,450
My kid brother told me.

40
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,960
He's in your class.

41
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,460
Takeru Mizuno. He plays basketball.

42
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,460
Oh.

43
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,250
Here for a checkup?

44
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,270
Yes.

45
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,650
Well then, let's talk after it's done.

46
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,970
I should be home now.

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,620
My night shift ended hours ago,

48
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,630
but things keep coming up.

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Something weird is going on.

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,710
And there was that other incident, too.

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,110
The girl who died here in April?

52
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,710
Try not to think too much about it.

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,780
If you do have to be hospitalized again,

54
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,710
I'll be sure to take 
extra good care of you.

55
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,810
Great. Thanks in advance.

56
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,240
No problem. Later.

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,690
I see nothing that should 
affect regular school attendance.

58
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,920
However, no strenuous activities just yet.

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,200
Let's keep an eye on things 
for one more month.

60
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,610
Okay.

61
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,030
Hey.

62
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,650
How'd it go?

63
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,590
Looks like you won't have

64
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,100
to take care of me, after all.

65
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,210
Aw, that's too bad.

66
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,380
It's a little late, but do you 
want to grab lunch somewhere?

67
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,210
So, Misaki Fujioka was the cousin

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,010
of that girl with the eyepatch.

69
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,950
Anyway, I rarely talk with my kid brother,

70
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,480
but he did tell me a few things.

71
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,920
It seems your class has 
some special circumstances.

72
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,280
Special circumstances?

73
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,690
Yep.

74
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,700
He wouldn't give me details, though.

75
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,880
Don't you know?

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,390
The "circumstances"?

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm certain there's something going on,

78
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,850
but nobody will tell me.

79
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,100
Really...?

80
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,050
My brother seemed to 
be scared of something.

81
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,460
That's just a hunch, though.

82
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,170
What do you mean?

83
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,250
He thinks what happened last 
week wasn't an accident.

84
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,040
Not an accident?

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,590
And that's why he's scared?

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
Maybe...

87
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,210
Why...

88
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,980
Um, have you heard of 
someone named Mei Misaki?

89
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,060
Misaki?

90
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,460
Mei Misaki? Who's that?

91
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,720
A girl in class 3.

92
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,380
Has your brother ever mentioned her?

93
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,360
I told you, he and I don't talk much.

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,710
Actually, the girl with the 
eyepatch that I told you about

95
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,720
is named Mei Misaki.

96
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,950
Oh?

97
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,240
So, what, you like this Mei girl?

98
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,280
No, it's not that...

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,500
It's just, something's bothering me.

100
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,770
Something about her is different

101
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,220
from the rest of my class.

102
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,220
That's what you call "liking" someone.

103
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,460
I don't like her!

104
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,570
Okay, okay.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,310
So, what's so different about this Mei?

106
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,790
Well...

107
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,860
She's sort of strange.

108
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,760
At first, I thought maybe

109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,650
she was being bullied by the other kids,

110
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,540
but I don't think that's it.

111
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,750
It seems more like 
they're scared of her.

112
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,070
Scared?

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,250
Well, not exactly, but...

114
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,380
One of the guys told me not 
to mess with things that "don't exist."

115
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,960
Don't exist?

116
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,400
She claims nobody else 
in the class can see her.

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,970
The accident last week

118
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,100
happened right after she told me that.

119
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,300
If you think about it logically,

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,010
it seems like a simple coincidence.

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,000
There's nothing to connect 
those two things.

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,110
Right?

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,260
There's one other thing 
that bothers me.

124
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,820
They say it happened 26 years ago...

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,510
Had you heard that story?

126
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,500
Not until now.

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,640
I went to South Middle.

128
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,820
I still don't know what it

129
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,430
has to do with all this,

130
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,990
but I can't help thinking 
there's a connection.

131
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,930
I see.

132
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,020
It's turning into quite the horror story.

133
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,690
Want me to ask my brother about it?

134
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,350
You're going to school tomorrow, right?

135
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,630
Yes.

136
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,300
I'll call if I find anything out.

137
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,900
When's your next checkup?

138
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,920
This Saturday.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,030
June 6, huh?

140
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm pretty sure there's no 
Damien in this town...

141
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,630
But still, let's both be careful.

142
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,260
Especially where unusual 
accidents are concerned.

143
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,530
<i>I'm pretty sure there's no 
Damien in this town...</i>

144
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,390
No way.

145
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,070
Well, look who I found!

146
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,780
Oh...

147
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,750
Hiya, Kouichi! Skipping school?

148
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,590
No, I just left the hospital.

149
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,740
Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

150
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,380
What about you? Are you sick?

151
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,360
Yeah, that's right!

152
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,000
You're quite the actress.

153
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,240
I hate to say it, but 
I'm happy you think so.

154
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,710
Happy?

155
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,890
Yeah, it means my hard work in 
the club is paying off.

156
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,470
Which club?

157
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,730
To be, or not to be?

158
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,740
<i>That</i> is the question.

159
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,410
Ah, you're in the theater club?

160
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,270
Yep! With Izumi!

161
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,030
Who's Izumi, again?

162
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,900
Izumi Akazawa.

163
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,910
She tends to be a bit dramatic.

164
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,380
It shows in her acting.

165
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,320
But she's not a bad person.

166
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,630
So I hope you'll help her out, too.

167
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,880
Uh, sure.

168
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,230
No... No! No! No!

169
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,150
I don't want to die!

170
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,890
No!

171
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,460
The Hollow Eyes of Yomi at Twilight

172
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,770
Welcome.

173
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,780
My, it's unusual to see 
a boy your age here.

174
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,200
Are you a customer? Or perhaps...

175
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,430
Hello.

176
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,110
Are you a junior high student?

177
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,230
In that case, I'll give you half price.

178
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,870
Thanks.

179
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,290
Please take your time looking around.

180
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,650
I have no other customers.

181
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,090
Fancy meeting you here again.

182
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,290
What brings you here today?

183
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,270
I was on my way home 
from the hospital,

184
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,100
and I just happened to walk by.

185
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
What about you? 
Didn't you go to school?

186
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,800
I only go when I feel like it.

187
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,800
Are you all right?

188
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,930
I guess I won't have to be re-admitted.

189
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,280
How's the class doing since, you know,

190
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,840
the accident?

191
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,690
They're all terrified.

192
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,900
Of what?

193
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,520
They think it's begun.

194
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,610
What has?

195
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,200
Deep inside, they may have 
only half-believed it before.

196
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,240
But now...

197
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,700
Despite what they said to you,

198
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,050
I don't think they fully believed.

199
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,390
But it looks like it really is true.

200
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,610
I'd say it's 100% likely...

201
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,800
...that it's already begun.

202
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,530
That's why...

203
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,630
You still don't know?

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,150
All the better.

205
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,210
It might be best for 
you to never find out.

206
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,900
Once you do...

207
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,180
Tell me what happened to class 3!

208
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,210
Are you going back to school?

209
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah, tomorrow.

210
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,280
Then I probably shouldn't show up.

211
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,990
Why?

212
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,280
Be careful.

213
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,630
Hey, Misa—

214
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,290
Why? Why?

215
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,170
Yeah, that's what I want to know.

216
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,360
Why? Good morning, Rei!

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,620
Good morning!

218
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,300
Kouichi?

219
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,670
Are you okay?

220
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,920
It's just a headache.

221
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,940
I've been getting them a lot lately.

222
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,410
It's pretty annoying.

223
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,660
Maybe you're tired, on more than one level.

224
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,410
Maybe.

225
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,610
Hey, Reiko?

226
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,350
You said there's a right time

227
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,300
to find out about things, right?

228
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,190
How can you tell when that is?

229
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,510
Did I say that?

230
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,130
Um... So...

231
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,310
What 9th grade class were you in?

232
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,730
In 9th grade?

233
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,650
Class 3.

234
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,120
Class 3?

235
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,870
Then, did people talk about

236
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,830
class 3 being cursed in your year, too?

237
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,620
I can't remember.

238
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,290
It was 15 years ago.

239
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,650
You're going to 
school tomorrow, right?

240
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,080
Remember the tips I gave 
you for handling Yomi North?

241
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,750
Yeah.

242
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,880
Including number three?

243
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Of course. And number four, too.

244
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,750
Number three was to

245
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,610
always uphold the class rules, right?

246
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,800
Yes. That's...

247
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,620
Uh, what was...

248
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,310
The third thing I needed to know.

249
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,430
Oh, yeah. It's, uh...

250
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,190
Always uphold the class rules,

251
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,290
which means...

252
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,260
Are you okay?

253
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,570
I really am exhausted.

254
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,530
Sorry, Kouichi.

255
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,910
I can't help you.

256
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,410
Why—

257
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,080
Don't say that!

258
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,920
I can't stand that damn bird!

259
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,950
June 3 (Wed.)

260
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,270
Sakuragi used the west 
staircase, right?

261
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,270
Why would she use one so far away?

262
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,580
She must've had a reason.

263
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,240
Takako said she saw...

264
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,280
Takako Sugiura?

265
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,090
What did she see?

266
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
When Kouichi...

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,890
I honestly thought it wouldn't 
happen this year.

268
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,270
There are two possibilities.

269
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,570
It's not happening this year,

270
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,780
and Yukari's death was 
just a coincidence.

271
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,790
Either that, or it started in May.

272
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,030
As the head of countermeasures,

273
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,960
I can't rely on wishful thinking.

274
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,130
It'd be one thing if it was just Yukari,

275
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,330
but her mom died, too.

276
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,300
Because he broke the rules?

277
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,790
Why would they put a new 
student in class 3, anyway?

278
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,810
It was convenient for the school.

279
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,940
The new principal still

280
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,550
doesn't fully understand our situation.

281
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,430
Shouldn't the teachers explain it to him?

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,570
They may have thought it was 
best to keep it among the students.

283
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,810
So even the teachers want 
nothing to do with this...

284
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,230
It's all because I was absent 
his first day here.

285
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,220
If I had warned him in advance, 
this wouldn't have happened.

286
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,390
What's done is done.

287
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,890
The question is, what do we do now?

288
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,450
And how do we let him know?

289
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,210
It'll be difficult to 
explain it to him now.

290
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,250
And explaining it poorly 
could be dangerous.

291
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,060
Yeah, like getting caught in our own trap.

292
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,640
This is a lot like the situation 
this class was in two years ago.

293
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,150
Does that mean we need 
new countermeasures?

294
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,510
That's what I heard.

295
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,940
Seriously?

296
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,570
H-Hello?

297
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,860
Where are you?

298
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,740
Uh...

299
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,330
Don't "uh" me. Where are you?

300
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,810
I've been trying to call you all week,

301
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,910
but you never answer.

302
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,890
Sorry! Bad timing and stuff...

303
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,350
Besides, you were sick.

304
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,600
You promised you'd tell me in June.

305
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,310
You mentioned "the first year," too.

306
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,400
What happened?

307
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,260
Just hold on, okay, Sakaki?

308
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,520
Yeah, I did promise.

309
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,560
I did, but...

310
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,110
The situation has changed.

311
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,780
Yeah! The situation has changed!

312
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,900
Normally, it's up to the head

313
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,480
of countermeasures to handle this stuff.

314
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,110
But things got complicated because

315
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,100
this guy acted on his own.

316
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,970
That's why.

317
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
You want me to pretend he 
never made that promise?

318
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,380
Yes. As a favor to me.

319
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,690
No, to the whole class.

320
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,480
Okay, but...

321
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,020
You said it's dangerous to mess 
with things that don't exist.

322
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,720
What did you mean by that?

323
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,910
Incoming Call: Mizuno

324
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,120
What were you thinking?!

325
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,000
Hello?

326
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
Well... I...

327
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,390
Are you on lunch break right now?

328
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,290
Explain yourself!

329
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm sorry!

330
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,060
Do you have time to talk?

331
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,830
Do you realize what you said?

332
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,680
What's up?

333
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,500
I wanted to check with 
you on something.

334
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,960
We have enough to worry about as it is...

335
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,280
Check on what?

336
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,290
About the girl you told me 
about yesterday, Mei Misaki.

337
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,350
Does she really exist?

338
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,400
Yes, she does.

339
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,930
Is she nearby?

340
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,560
For sure?

341
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,010
Where is she now?

342
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,630
She didn't come to school today.

343
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,930
So she's not there...

344
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,240
Why do you want to know?

345
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,570
I spoke to my brother yesterday.

346
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,510
He refuses to talk about 
the incident 26 years ago,

347
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,870
or the accident last week.

348
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,400
But when I asked him about Mei,

349
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,240
his demeanor suddenly changed.

350
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,670
"What are you talking about?!

351
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,580
There's no girl like that in our class!"

352
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,540
He was adamant.

353
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,610
But that's a lie...

354
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,250
He was dead serious,

355
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,950
and he has no reason to lie.

356
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,090
Mei Misaki exists!

357
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,600
What?

358
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,170
Can you hear me?

359
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,570
I just got on the 
elevator, from the roof.

360
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,070
I have to get back to work.

361
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,040
Oh, that explains the static.

362
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,300
But this is...

363
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,660
Mizuno, can you hear me?

364
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,590
What's going on?

365
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,010
Build limbs.
