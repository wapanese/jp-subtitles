1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,610
We've gotta get out of here!

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,040
No!

3
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,760
I don't wanna die!

4
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,320
This is not normal.

5
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,150
Why?

6
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Has everyone lost their minds?

7
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,240
Mr. Chibiki!

8
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,980
Nobody else made it here?

9
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,780
Ow...

10
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,990
The bleeding has stopped. 
It's not serious.

11
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,740
You all stay here.

12
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,540
Got it?

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,330
Matsui!

14
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,770
Hel—

15
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
Sakakibara.

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,020
Do you remember this girl?

17
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,190
Of course I do!

18
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,940
Damn, I was wrong.

19
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,940
Wrong? What are you saying?!

20
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,310
Sugiura said it was Misaki,

21
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,240
but I think the dead one is you.

22
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,040
It started in May this year, right?

23
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,210
So the one who joined the class 
in May is obviously the dead one.

24
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,130
You're wrong! It started in April!

25
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,060
You expect me to believe that bullshit?

26
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,280
Why are you doing this?

27
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I figured it out when 
Teshigawara almost killed me.

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,930
I have to send the dead back 
to death, or else I'll die.

29
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,790
But that's...

30
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,950
Shut up!

31
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,350
If you hadn't come here,

32
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,010
Yukari wouldn't have died!

33
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,580
Sakuragi?

34
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,000
If you hadn't gotten close 
to the nonexistent girl...

35
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,890
Send the dead back to—

36
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,600
Idiot. Kouichi isn't dead.

37
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,110
But you've killed two people.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,470
You don't deserve to live.

39
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,450
I'll help you die.

40
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,920
Keep Yukari company.

41
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,700
Classmates shouldn't be doing stupid things

42
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,670
like killing each other.

43
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,140
Pretty words.

44
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,680
But someone who ran away

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,900
to watch from the sidelines, 
because he was afraid to die,

46
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,910
has no right to say anything!

47
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,870
You're right. I ran away.

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,810
But I can still save 
a student who's about

49
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,270
to die needlessly right in front of me.

50
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,710
A spectator like you can't do anything!

51
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,840
You can't change a thing!

52
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,610
The only ones who can fix this 
are those living in death's jaws!

53
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,490
Sakakibara, get outside!

54
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,660
Kazami?

55
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,620
Hey, Kazami!

56
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,500
Hey...

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,720
What?

58
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,270
Come on...

59
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,210
Stop messing around. Come on!

60
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
Damn it!

61
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,780
Damn it! Damn it!

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,830
Misaki's still inside.

63
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,470
Misaki! If you're here, answer me!

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,860
Stop!

65
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,750
Please, stop!

66
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,770
If I don't kill her, we'll all die!

67
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,440
You could die, too!

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,240
You've got it all wrong! 
Misaki's not dead!

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,990
If the calamity doesn't 
stop after I kill her,

70
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,890
then I'll agree with you!

71
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,380
Now, it ends.

72
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,600
You're wrong...

73
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,040
What's your problem? I'm...

74
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,430
I'm just trying to 
protect us all! So why?!

75
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,710
If you're so desperate to die,

76
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,600
I'll kill you along with her!

77
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,660
<i>Stupid brother...</i>

78
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,120
<i>You idiot!</i>

79
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,830
<i>Ouch!</i>

80
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,370
<i>I'm sorry! Are you all right?</i>

81
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,380
<i>You okay?</i>

82
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,560
<i>You're not from Yomi North.</i>

83
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,890
<i>No. I'm from Tokyo.</i>

84
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,490
<i>Oh.</i>

85
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,280
<i>Are you in pain?</i>

86
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,580
<i>No...</i>

87
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,160
<i>Someone I love died.</i>

88
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,370
<i>Oh...</i>

89
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,540
<i>Then...</i>

90
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,000
<i>We're the same.</i>

91
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,940
A year and a half ago,

92
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,470
I hit you with an empty can.

93
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,000
Remember?

94
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,960
Honestly, you're terrible.

95
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,070
You're supposed to say you remember,

96
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,390
even if it's not true.

97
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,540
Akazawa...

98
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,690
Misaki!

99
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
Misaki!

100
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,490
August 9 (Sun.)

101
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,190
Yes! I've got a signal!

102
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,490
Redial

103
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,490
Mei Misaki

104
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,060
Please connect.

105
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,640
Sakakibara?

106
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,490
Misaki! Are you okay?

107
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,200
Yes.

108
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,150
Where are you?

109
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,450
The backyard.

110
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,460
Are you hurt?

111
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm fine.

112
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,750
But, I can't really move.

113
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,210
I'm coming, okay? 
I'll be right there, so—

114
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,440
Don't come here.

115
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,140
Why?

116
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,000
You don't want to come here, Sakakibara.

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,210
But why?!

118
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,720
I...

119
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,160
I have to stop it.

120
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,730
Misaki, you can't mean... Who is it?

121
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,000
You'll regret it.

122
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,670
That's why.

123
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,450
Misaki!

124
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,560
Misaki!

125
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,910
Stay back.

126
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,920
We have to help!

127
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,840
We can't.

128
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,340
I see the color of death.

129
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,970
Did you just realize it now?

130
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,100
I've known for some time, 
but I couldn't tell you.

131
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,400
But now...

132
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,360
It's time for me to stop it.

133
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,900
Wait!

134
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,490
No...

135
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,000
It can't be. It can't be!

136
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,830
It's not true!

137
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,970
She's the extra?

138
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,550
You're sure?

139
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,440
You're sure?

140
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,430
Ms. Mikami...

141
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,870
Reiko is the extra?

142
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,500
Kouichi.

143
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,290
<i>Now, the fourth thing 
you need to know to</i>

144
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,780
<i>prepare yourself for Yomi North is:</i>

145
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,240
<i>Keep the line between my
work and personal roles clear.</i>

146
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,560
<i>Be careful not to call 
me Reiko by mistake.</i>

147
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,160
<i>At school, I'm the assistant homeroom teacher, Ms. Mikami, at all times.</i>

148
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,950
<i>Got that?</i>

149
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,910
Does any other class in our school have 
an assistant homeroom teacher?

150
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,430
Um...

151
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,060
They don't.

152
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,770
The 9th grade's class 3 is the only one.

153
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,720
Our classroom had the right 
number of desks this year.

154
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,550
And yet the calamity began in April.

155
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,430
Why do you think that is?

156
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,560
Because the place short one desk...

157
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,860
...was the faculty room.

158
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,160
No.

159
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,370
She's lying!

160
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,310
Move out of the way, Sakakibara.

161
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,760
I'll do it.

162
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,640
I'll send the dead back to death.

163
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,560
Kouichi...

164
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,430
I'm sorry, Reiko.

165
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,220
Don't!

166
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,670
Don't do this!

167
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,190
<i>Is this right?</i>

168
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,410
<i>Is this really right?</i>

169
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,410
<i>Is this really the right choice?</i>

170
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,410
<i>There's no mistake?</i>

171
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,170
<i>If we're wrong, I'll have murdered Reiko.</i>

172
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,900
<i>Is everything Misaki said true?</i>

173
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>Can I trust her?</i>

174
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,380
I remembered.

175
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,510
I saw it.

176
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,990
I was watching.

177
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,890
A year and a half ago,

178
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,950
I saw Ms. Mikami being killed!

179
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,230
<i>Cheer! Cheer up!</i>

180
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,600
<i>Why? Why? Rei!</i>

181
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,600
Certificate of Excellence Presented to Reiko Mikami

182
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,480
<i>I suppose it was about 
a year and a half ago?</i>

183
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,980
<i>At the pet shop.</i>

184
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,240
<i>How does it feel to be back after a 
year and a half away from Yomiyama?</i>

185
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,500
<i>A year and a half ago,</i>

186
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,960
<i>I hit you with an empty can.</i>

187
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,990
<i>Remember?</i>

188
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,160
<i>After a death, there always 
follows a funeral.</i>

189
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,920
<i>How very tired I am of funerals...</i>

190
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,010
<i>My poor Ritsuko... My poor Reiko, too...</i>

191
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,470
Believe me.

192
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,850
Reiko...

193
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,150
Goodbye, Reiko.

194
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,640
Goodbye, Mother.

195
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:44,830
Mikami Family Grave

196
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,280
You're here, too?

197
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,520
Everything okay with your lungs now?

198
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,760
I guess.

199
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,350
Probably won't be able to 
join in gym class, though.

200
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,100
Tombstone
October 29 Reiko
July 27 Ritsuko

201
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,510
None of the others remember Ms. Mikami.

202
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,560
Only us, huh?

203
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,790
I guess she was getting worried

204
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,840
that you might become the ninth victim.

205
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,340
So eight people died...

206
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,040
Strictly speaking, there were 
ten victims in August.

207
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,700
Who were the other two?

208
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,290
The manager and his wife.

209
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,340
They were Takabayashi's 
maternal grandparents.

210
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,310
I'm told they were in a poor 
emotional state since his death.

211
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,540
Ms. Mikami died in fall, 
a year and a half ago.

212
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,280
She was stabbed by an unknown 
assailant near the river.

213
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,640
I can't remember, but...

214
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,410
I hear Ms. Mikami was the 
dead person this year?

215
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,510
That means there were seven deaths

216
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,660
in the calamity two years ago.

217
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,790
Homeroom: Reiko Mikami  
October 29, murdered

218
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,790
Yes. There were seven "X" marks.

219
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,520
I saw the name "Akazawa" on 
the file from that year.

220
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,000
Was that...

221
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,760
Yes, he was Akazawa's cousin,

222
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,120
but they were raised more like siblings.

223
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,630
Shall I drive you home?

224
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,890
No, we'll be fine.

225
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,480
All right, then.

226
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,840
Take care going home.

227
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,910
Oh...

228
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,330
Actually, I guess the calamity is over, huh?

229
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,250
When did you figure out that Reiko,

230
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,630
that Ms. Mikami, was the extra?

231
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,470
When was it...

232
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,300
I forget.

233
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,130
Why didn't you say anything?

234
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,170
What good would it have done?

235
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,570
I obviously couldn't tell you.

236
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Ms. Mikami was special to you, right?

237
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,720
I mean, Reiko.

238
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,460
Want to go check out 
that amusement park?

239
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,320
Huh?

240
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,830
The Ferris wheel.

241
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,890
I don't ride those.

242
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,830
No?

243
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,700
I tried to call your cell phone

244
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,540
from the hospital the other day,

245
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,080
but I couldn't connect.

246
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,070
That's because...

247
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,300
I threw it in the river after that day.

248
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,820
Why?

249
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,490
I hate those devices.

250
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,530
Do we really need to be 
connected through them, all the time?

251
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,560
She'll probably give me 
a new one soon, though.

252
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,670
If she does,

253
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,030
can I call you sometimes?

254
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,560
Sure, sometimes.

255
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,340
Oh, yeah.

256
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,280
Mochizuki gave these to me.

257
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,310
You can see Reiko in them, right?

258
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,540
Yeah.

259
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,720
None of them could see her.

260
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,270
Even Mochizuki didn't 
realize she was there.

261
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,090
Really?

262
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,780
What about the color?

263
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,260
What color is Reiko?

264
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,060
I see the color of death on her.

265
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,470
I wonder if we'll slowly 
forget all this over time, too.

266
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,030
The trip, everything that's 
happened since April...

267
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,340
Everything that had 
to do with Reiko Mikami...

268
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,120
Everything...

269
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,670
You really don't want to forget?

270
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,000
You want to remember, forever?

271
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,660
It's over now, isn't it?

272
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,010
<i>That's how to stop the calamity.</i>

273
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,010
To: The Students of Grade 9, Class 3

274
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,650
<i>How you interpret this is up to you.</i>

275
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,340
<i>Just make sure to carefully 
consider your actions.</i>

276
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,550
<i>Think it through, and discuss 
it with your friends,</i>

277
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,790
<i>so you'll have no regrets.</i>
