1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,090
No! Not that!

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,350
Do it!

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,990
Wait! Let's not be hasty here!

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,540
All right!

5
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,590
He stopped it?

6
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,300
He said he stopped the 
calamity 15 years ago?

7
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,300
That's what he claims,

8
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,590
though he apparently doesn't 
remember any details.

9
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,900
Do you remember Mr. Matsunaga?

10
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,490
Of course. We were in the same club.

11
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,860
You were?

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,790
Did he ever talk about how he stopped it?

13
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,330
I can't recall ever hearing 
anything about that.

14
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,360
You went on a class trip

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,160
during summer break that year, right?

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,920
Yes.

17
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,320
It didn't seem like a good 
idea to stay confined at home.

18
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,900
What happened on that trip?

19
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm sure something happened,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,320
but I couldn't tell you what.

21
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,000
I see...

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,990
I'm no help, I know. Sorry.

23
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,240
It's okay.

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,530
I'm fine, so there's 
no need to push yourself.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,570
So, Mr. Matsunaga went on the trip, too?

26
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,040
I think so.

27
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,250
Yeah, he did.

28
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,870
Did anything seem strange about him?

29
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't think so.

30
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,220
I guess all we can do is ask him...

31
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,220
Okay. I'll run it by Matsu for you.

32
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,040
When you go to talk to 
him, I'll go with you.

33
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
Morning!

34
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,150
Good morning!

35
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,070
Morning.

36
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,520
What's all that stuff for?

37
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,240
I stocked up on supplies!

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,080
Sorry to keep you.

39
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you okay? You don't look so good.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,550
It's nothing. Just a little carsi—

41
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,260
He tries too hard...

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,940
You're coming, too, Akazawa?

43
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,300
Of course I am.

44
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,310
Why don't you ride in this car?

45
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,050
Yours doesn't look like it can handle four.

46
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,940
It's no problem.

47
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,470
This car runs better than you'd think.

48
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,320
That was unnecessary.

49
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,920
Okay...

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,910
Then, Teshigawara, you're in my car.

51
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,030
Um, okay.

52
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,130
Nakao, since you get carsick, you're up front.

53
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,040
Okay.

54
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,870
Well, let's go.

55
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,600
So Mr. Matsunaga won't be coming 
back to Yomiyama for a while?

56
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,220
I spoke to his mother,

57
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,780
and she said he's living at the 
resort hotel where he works.

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,750
City of Yomiyama 
Please Come Again!

59
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,000
Sanami Town

60
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,480
We made it out of Yomiyama 
without any trouble.

61
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,660
Yeah...

62
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,950
Let's get a move on!

63
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,380
Um, Reiko?

64
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,540
What?

65
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,550
Oh, nothing...

66
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,350
Damn it, if you're gonna drive that 
slow, get out of the fast lane.

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,940
I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.

68
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,440
I don't know, I think you're 
pretty easy to read.

69
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,290
Oh, yeah?

70
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,540
Please, describe me.

71
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,780
Uh, well...

72
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,900
Strong and dependable?

73
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,180
Wow, am I that macho?

74
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,160
Well, you are tough,

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,980
and you've got a strong 
sense of responsibility.

76
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,750
Stuff like that.

77
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,750
You're supposed to say, 
"That's not what I meant."

78
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,710
That's not what I meant.

79
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,630
What's with the tone? So annoying.

80
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,850
I've gotta pay you back now and then.

81
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,750
By the way, you're the head 
of countermeasures, right?

82
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,320
How is it decided who gets that role?

83
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Usually, they're appointed 
by the teacher.

84
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,160
It's not a popular job.

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,230
In a way, you could say

86
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,770
they're responsible for 
the lives of the entire class.

87
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,650
So, were you appointed?

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,700
I nominated myself.

89
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,680
Why?

90
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,090
Maybe no one else actually 
believed in the calamity,

91
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,620
but I was different.

92
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,540
I can't allow such a 
senseless phenomenon to exist.

93
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm going to put an end to it.

94
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,060
So hot...

95
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,640
They said Matsunaga was 
suddenly called to a reception.

96
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,640
I left my cell phone number,

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,460
so he should call me when he gets back.

98
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,240
What should we do until then?

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,750
No point in sitting around waiting, right?

100
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,990
Yeah, we came all this way.

101
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,420
Since we're outside Yomiyama, 
the calamity shouldn't affect us.

102
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,640
Let's go swimming!

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
We are near the ocean, after all.

104
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,310
All right!

105
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,200
But I didn't bring my trunks!

106
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,540
You can get some at the hotel.

107
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,760
They don't cost much. 
I'll buy you a pair.

108
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,190
I couldn't ask you to do that.

109
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,780
If you're not swimming, I won't, either.

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,110
Well, I thought this 
might happen, so...

111
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,820
Oh, don't tell me...

112
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,260
I thought that seemed 
like a lot of luggage.

113
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,710
It's a seaside resort, after all.

114
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,010
Not to mention we're outside Yomiyama.

115
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,750
And it's summer break.

116
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,220
It'd be too depressing to 
sit at home the entire time.

117
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,260
We have to spread our wings a little.

118
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,020
It's the sea!

119
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,730
The sea in summer!

120
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,300
It's mine!

121
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,520
All right!

122
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,370
Misaki?

123
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,340
Sakakibara?

124
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,230
Oh no, my glasses...

125
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,010
You'll pay for that!

126
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,890
Ready, set, dunk!

127
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,720
Is your family's summer house nearby?

128
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,570
Yes.

129
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,380
What does your dad do?

130
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
I'm not quite sure.

131
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,340
He's rarely in Japan.

132
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,980
That's why we put on 
these little family acts

133
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,360
on the rare occasions when he comes home.

134
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,020
We may be a family, 
but we aren't really connected.

135
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,720
Not that I care.

136
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,390
Hey, if we find out who 
the dead person is after this,

137
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,680
would making them nonexistent 
stop the calamity?

138
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,850
I don't think that would work.

139
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,980
It's already been triggered.

140
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,010
I think it's too late to try 
to balance everything out now.

141
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,830
Did they connect?

142
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,780
Seems so.

143
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,550
Connecting every now and 
then can't be so bad, can it?

144
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,790
I suppose.

145
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,430
Anyone up for lunch?

146
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes!

147
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,060
Hey, wait!

148
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,550
Should we go back to the hotel?

149
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm fine with something 
from a convenience store.

150
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,080
There are also seaside shops.

151
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,610
Hold it, you guys!

152
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,770
We're at the beach.

153
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,200
How could we not make the 
most of the outdoor life?

154
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,540
You want to cook here?

155
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,170
I knew you'd get it, Akazawa!

156
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,330
What?

157
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,380
How are we supposed to 
do that without any tools?

158
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,600
I've got the bases covered!

159
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,040
Take a look at this flawless setup!

160
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,510
You're such an idiot.

161
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,950
This is what was in that huge bag?

162
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,060
Are you going to cook?

163
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,930
Huh? Cook?

164
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,540
With what ingredients?

165
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,560
Local fare, of course!

166
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,660
Definitely an idiot.

167
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,690
With all the stuff you 
brought, I should've known...

168
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,290
I'm hungry.

169
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,610
Local fare?

170
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,610
Mochizuki! You brought 
the fishing gear, right?

171
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,370
Oh... Yeah!

172
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,150
All right, then let's see who can 
round up the most ingredients!

173
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,870
Do we get anything for 
winning or losing?

174
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,300
The loser has to make the food,

175
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,240
and the winner gets to eat it.

176
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,130
How's that?

177
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,500
Sounds interesting.

178
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,550
Then it's settled!

179
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,480
I'll pick the teams.

180
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,300
First off, on the Head of 
Countermeasures Team will be...

181
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,260
Akazawa!

182
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,390
Sugiura!

183
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,730
Naka— Actually, we'll pass on him.

184
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,260
And me!

185
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,020
Now, on the Nonexistent Team will be...

186
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,060
Sakakibara!

187
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,900
Misaki!

188
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,010
Mochizuki!

189
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,690
Hey, I exist!

190
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,540
But you don't exist <i>over here</i>.

191
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,700
Harsh...

192
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,100
So we're competing based 
on the fish we catch?

193
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,580
No, if you find anything 
besides fish, it counts, too.

194
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,490
Let me out!

195
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,600
That's sea lettuce. It tastes awful.

196
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,900
That's red algae. 
You can't eat it on its own.

197
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,020
I got one!

198
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,680
It's a big one!

199
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,560
Yes!

200
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
What is this?

201
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,750
Kelp.

202
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,250
You're supposed to catch <i>fish!</i>

203
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,250
Sorry.

204
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,000
What's wrong?

205
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,650
Get it off...

206
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,900
I thought it was going to eat me.

207
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,440
Octopuses don't eat people.

208
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,750
They'll bite if you 
poke at them, though.

209
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,870
How's it going?

210
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,380
I think I've got a big one...

211
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,600
It's pulling pretty hard.

212
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,820
All right!

213
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,360
That's your big one?

214
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,810
At least it's a fish.

215
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,430
Cute.

216
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,560
I've got one this time!

217
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,340
Hey.

218
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,210
You're doing that on 
purpose, aren't yo—

219
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,240
What is this?!

220
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,010
A sea cucumber?

221
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,670
I'm actually impressed 
you caught one of these.

222
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,150
Or maybe it just got caught on the line.

223
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,270
You creep! Useless jerk!

224
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,670
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

225
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,490
A pufferfish, an octopus, 
and a starfish.

226
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,350
This is kelp, right?

227
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,880
And a sea cucumber, and...

228
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,920
What's in this shell?

229
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,890
A hermit crab.

230
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,370
I guess that's how it goes.

231
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,270
This battle ends in a draw.

232
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,110
I picked up some meat and vegetables,

233
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,990
so let's all eat that.

234
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,360
Okay!

235
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,250
Freshly-caught really is the best!

236
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,770
Oh, how I love that crunch.

237
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,170
So delicious!

238
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,330
We definitely can't eat these guys.

239
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,610
Got it!

240
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,750
Reiko?

241
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,630
I tried calling your cell.

242
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,040
Is the battery dead?

243
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,940
Huh?

244
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,290
Oops...

245
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,590
Careless as ever, I see.

246
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,380
I'm surprised you found us here.

247
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,270
Wasn't hard to figure out.

248
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,530
This is the closest beach to the hotel.

249
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,510
Ah.

250
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,760
But, wow...

251
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,150
Girls sure do change.

252
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,590
You used to be a shrimp.

253
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,780
You've changed quite a bit, yourself.

254
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,530
Into an old geezer.

255
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,520
Shut up!

256
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,990
It's been 15 years, huh...

257
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,960
Technically, it's only been 14 years 
since our graduation.

258
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,040
Oh, yeah.

259
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,270
That makes us around 30, huh?

260
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't remind me.

261
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,410
Wait...

262
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,480
Have I seen you somewhere recently?

263
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,510
Where?

264
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,780
I don't remember seeing you.

265
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,880
It was probably a different girl.

266
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,980
Unfortunately, I don't think it was.

267
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,340
Then maybe it was at Kentarou 
or Natsuko's memorial services?

268
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,350
No, I only went to the funerals.

269
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,770
Oh...

270
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,360
Can't believe it's been 
15 years since they died.

271
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,420
Who're the kids?

272
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,540
This year's class 3 students.

273
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,230
Oh...

274
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,620
They're here about what 
happened 15 years ago?

275
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,800
I can only remember bits and 
pieces of that summer, myself.

276
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,290
Matsu, I heard that you 
stopped the calamity.

277
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,050
Tomoka at Inoya asked 
me about that, too,

278
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,560
but I don't remember.

279
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,940
Do you recall the class 
trip we took that summer?

280
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,430
Yeah.

281
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,770
An accident happened 
on that trip, right?

282
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,850
Do you remember anything about it?

283
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,800
And you are?

284
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,980
Akazawa, the head of countermeasures.

285
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,490
I see.

286
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,490
To tell you the truth, 
I don't remember much.

287
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,320
I know someone died 
on the mountain, but...

288
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,240
My memory's hazy, too.

289
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,580
I don't know what kind 
of accident it was.

290
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,540
Did the accident happen before you 
visited the shrine, or after?

291
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,240
Why does that matter?

292
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,820
Well, if it was before,

293
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,880
maybe a blessing from the 
shrine stopped the calamity.

294
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,190
I can't recall.

295
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,720
But, something tells 
me it was a run-down,

296
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,390
abandoned-looking shrine.

297
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,590
Right, the shrine.

298
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,930
I'm sure we went to the shrine.

299
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,870
We all joined hands and...

300
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,280
Nope, I just can't remember.

301
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,710
Um, Mr. Matsunaga,

302
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,110
didn't you leave something behind, 
as a clue for the others?

303
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,200
Apparently, I said that, but...

304
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,140
What did you want to tell them?

305
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,380
All I know is that I felt this 
urgent need to tell them, but...

306
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,500
You can't remember what about?

307
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,810
And you don't remember what you 
left behind, or where?

308
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,260
Like if it was a note, or something else?

309
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,110
No, it wasn't paper... It was...

310
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,190
What?

311
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,260
Yeah, I think I used something...

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,090
Oh, I know! It's at the school!

313
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,490
I took something to the school!

314
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,700
The school?

315
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,580
Where in the school?

316
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,150
I'll get it!

317
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,130
How far out are you gonna go?

318
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,850
What is he doing?

319
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,230
This doesn't look good.

320
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,320
The hell...

321
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,490
Dude, quit messing around!

322
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,460
Oh, shit.

323
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,440
Why...

324
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
But I...

325
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,680
I protected them.

326
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,670
I left it for them...

327
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,990
...in the classroom.

328
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,940
Body paint.
