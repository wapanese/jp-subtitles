1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,020
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,440
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,360
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,980
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,320
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>Across this land</i>

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,990
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,450
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>The story ends</i>

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,260
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,090
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,270
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>Makes people forget</i>

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,230
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,020
<i>Begin to rust</i>

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,860
<i>Just the same</i>

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,490
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>And they live on</i>

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,910
<i>We chose the same path</i>

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,040
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,580
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,830
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,210
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,290
<i>Even now</i>

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,670
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,220
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,890
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,980
Episode 12: A Real Hero

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,990
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Schwer Mountains, located in the northern lands

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,950
Ms. Frieren is falling asleep.

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,500
What?

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,820
She's asleep.

36
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,160
Oh, well. I'll carry her.

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,630
But Mr. Stark, your axe...

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh, right.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,770
My hands are free, though.

40
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,980
I'll carry her.

41
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,320
What? Why?

42
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,930
No reason.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,040
In the end, the king only 
gave us ten copper coins.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,510
What a cheapskate.

45
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm not surprised.

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,670
Many heroes have tried and failed 
to defeat the Demon King until now.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,300
There's nothing wrong with 
earning money to cover expenses

48
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,500
while working toward 
defeating the Demon King.

49
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,550
It'll feel like an adventure.

50
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,740
I suppose you're right.

51
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,250
That's the Hero's Sword.

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,740
It's a replica.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Back in the day, a merchant who 
visited my town gave it to me

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,660
for saving him from a monster.

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,670
"For the future hero," he said.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,030
Just something you'd say to a kid.

57
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,380
Is that why you became a hero?

58
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,290
No.

59
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,250
There was this annoying brat named 
Heiter at the village orphanage.

60
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,770
He said I'd only ever become a fake hero 
because all I had was a fake sword.

61
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,180
So I decided I'd prove him wrong 
by becoming a real hero.

62
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,900
Someday, I'll acquire the real Hero's Sword 
and defeat the Demon King.

63
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,190
But the passage of time is cruel.

64
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,050
The brat who said that to me is now 
a fake priest who just drinks all the time.

65
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,790
I'm a real priest.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
A dream...

67
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,120
Ms. Frieren, you're finally awake.

68
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,540
I feel like I've seen this sight before.

69
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,970
I must still be dreaming.

70
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,020
If only you were.

71
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,590
I underestimated the mountain weather.

72
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,720
Keep going north. The village 
we're heading to is up ahead.

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,870
Very well.

74
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,500
Ms. Frieren, can you walk?

75
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,930
No.

76
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,120
I see.

77
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,990
You smell nice.

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,500
Sheesh.

79
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,150
You must be tired from carrying 
her this whole time, Fern.

80
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,130
I'll take her now.

81
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,410
Perv.

82
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,140
How am I a perv?

83
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,440
The blizzard has mostly settled down.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,420
I thought we'd freeze to death.

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,970
There really is a village this 
deep in the mountains, huh?

86
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,660
We've been waiting for you, Ms. Frieren.

87
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,840
You're the current village chief? 
You're so young.

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,190
Yes. I'm the 49th in a long line of chiefs.

89
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,590
Welcome to the Village of the Sword.

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,060
There was a destroyed cabin 
outside the village.

91
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,150
It's an old hunting cabin.

92
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,550
The lord of the mountains destroyed it.

93
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,940
The lord of the mountains? 
Has there always been one of those?

94
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,880
So this is the Village of the Sword.

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,320
You know of this place, Mr. Stark?

96
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,300
This village used to protect the Hero's Sword.

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,720
The Hero's Sword was said to have been 
placed in a sanctuary near this village.

98
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,710
Throughout history, many heroes tried to 
pull it from the stone, but it wouldn't budge.

99
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,260
Not until eighty years ago, anyway.

100
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,730
According to the legend, uh...

101
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,740
"The Hero's Sword can only 
be pulled from the stone

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,960
by the hero who will drive off the great 
calamity bent on destroying this world."

103
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,990
Yeah, that's it.

104
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,910
And it was Mr. Himmel who 
drew the sword from the stone?

105
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,410
That's right. I thought it was 
a pretty famous story.

106
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,740
You hadn't heard it before?

107
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,940
No. Mr. Heiter never mentioned it.

108
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,810
This is it.

109
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,520
So warm.

110
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,150
Anyway, I'm disappointed, Ms. Frieren.

111
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,690
You were supposed to return 
half a century later.

112
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,070
I'm a mild-mannered person, 
but even I'm pissed off.

113
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,140
At least, that's what my grandmother said.

114
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,950
I told her eighty years would be fine.

115
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,380
The people of this village, who've protected 
the Hero's Sword for generations,

116
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,590
can easily defend themselves.

117
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,530
That's true, but we still 
need you to fulfill your duty.

118
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,020
What duty?

119
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,660
Monster extermination.

120
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,420
Monsters regularly appear around this village.

121
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,810
The lord of the mountain has been especially 
unruly lately. It's been a real problem.

122
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,660
Then I'll start tomorrow.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,380
Better to deal with this 
sooner rather than later.

124
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,040
This area is full of monsters, 
even though the village is nearby.

125
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,310
Why didn't you hire other 
adventurers to exterminate them?

126
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,170
I wish we could, but...

127
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,600
It's because Himmel is the hero.

128
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,670
You weren't kidding. 
There sure are a lot of monsters.

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,060
They're gathered in front of that cave.

130
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,400
Frieren, is this—

131
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,580
It's the lord.

132
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,470
I see.

133
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,100
No wonder I didn't know who she meant.
 It's a new face.

134
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,860
Only eighty years, and you 
consider yourself a lord?

135
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,940
Stark, I know you can keep moving.

136
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,560
Can't you treat people better?!

137
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,200
Nice work.

138
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,500
Now I've fulfilled my duty.

139
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,230
Frieren, what's the meaning of this?

140
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,590
That's the Hero's Sword.

141
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,550
It's what attracts all the monsters.

142
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,690
A powerful barrier prevents them 
from entering the sanctuary,

143
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,850
but even so, they can't suppress 
their impulse to destroy it.

144
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,010
The Hero's Sword must truly terrify them.

145
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,980
That's not what I meant.

146
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,850
Right.

147
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,130
Himmel failed to pull 
the sword from the stone.

148
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,260
So this hero wasn't the real one either.

149
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,260
Himmel...

150
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,880
There's nothing wrong 
with being a fake hero.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,030
I'll defeat the Demon King 
and bring peace to the world.

152
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,390
Then it won't matter if I'm fake or not.

153
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,310
Himmel lived up to those words.

154
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,480
Even without that sword, he saved the world.

155
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,460
He was a real hero.

156
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,840
Then why was the truth covered up?

157
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,420
It was probably done by people who 
wanted to make Himmel a hero.

158
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,830
No hero needs embarrassing 
stories told about them,

159
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,910
like the time they failed to pull 
the Hero's Sword from its stone.

160
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,680
Future generations always 
romanticize heroes,

161
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,890
to the point that their original 
nature eventually disappears.

162
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,110
I always believed you 
could do it, Ms. Frieren.

163
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,490
I'm hella grateful.

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
My grandmother said that as well.

165
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,350
What's up with the words 
your grandma left you?

166
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,210
Well, see you in another fifty years.

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,230
Don't be late next time.

168
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:59,030
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Appetit region, located in the northern lands

169
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,280
Once we leave our belongings at the inn,

170
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,170
everyone's free to do what 
they want for the evening.

171
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,850
We haven't been to a town in a while.

172
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,270
We can finally cut loose.

173
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,540
Ms. Frieren, what will you do?

174
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,270
Shall we look around the shops together?

175
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,670
I'll pass.

176
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,130
I'd like to relax here at the inn 
and read some grimoires.

177
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,180
I see. In that case, I'll go alone.

178
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,800
Oh, right.

179
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,270
Today is Stark's eighteenth birthday.

180
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,400
Why didn't you tell me that beforehand?

181
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,180
I didn't get him anything.

182
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,140
You can buy something for him in town.

183
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,660
I don't know what Mr. Stark wants.

184
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,460
You don't think things through, do you, Fern?

185
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,610
This is your fault, Ms. Frieren.

186
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,400
By the way, what are you giving him?

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,540
I've got something special planned.

188
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,560
A potion that only dissolves clothing.

189
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,590
My master told me men enjoy 
receiving this kind of gift.

190
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,230
What? Are you curious, Fern?

191
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,110
I told you to return this vulgar 
potion when you bought it.

192
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I can't believe you, Ms. Frieren.

193
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,130
That potion was pretty valuable, you know.

194
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,590
What am I going to give him now?

195
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,110
Oh, right.

196
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,910
I have this.

197
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,480
<i>I'll have to look into it myself.</i>

198
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,870
<i>He's bound to notice, though.</i>

199
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,550
Mr. Stark.

200
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,580
Is he out?

201
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,630
A warrior carrying an axe?

202
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,710
He helped me push my cart.

203
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,360
I think he was headed toward the plaza.

204
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,270
He was playing with us until a moment ago.

205
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,230
He helped us out of that tree.

206
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,300
He stopped my rampaging cow.

207
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,760
<i>He's been helping lots of people.</i>

208
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,930
<i>How could Ms. Frieren be so rude?</i>

209
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,240
<i>There's no way Mr. Stark would 
appreciate that dirty potion.</i>

210
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,260
Mr. Stark.

211
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,260
Whoa!

212
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,570
That cloud looks like boobs.

213
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,900
<i>He's a perv after all.</i>

214
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,790
For real? That one looks like a turd.

215
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,610
<i>No, he's just a child.</i>

216
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,920
I'll have to tell Fern about them later.

217
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,080
<i>How am I supposed to respond to that?</i>

218
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,030
Mr. Stark.

219
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,780
Fern, good timing. Those clouds...

220
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,650
Actually, sorry. It's nothing.

221
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,680
Uh, so...

222
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,530
Would you like to go for a walk?

223
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,290
Yes.

224
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,140
Hey, why are you mad? Did I do something?

225
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,360
<i>How do I broach the subject?</i>

226
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,900
Come on. I'll apologize, okay?

227
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,750
<i>No matter how I ask, 
he'll know something's up.</i>

228
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,650
<i>Then I'll just come out and say it.</i>

229
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,510
Mr. Stark, is there anything you want?

230
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,700
What for?

231
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,140
It's your birthday today.

232
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,890
Is that right?

233
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,260
What's that got to do with what I want?

234
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,270
I'd like to get you a birthday present.

235
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,390
What? You're gonna give me something?

236
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,430
Actually, never mind. 
You're kind of irritating.

237
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,900
Wait. I wasn't joking.

238
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,950
I've never received a birthday present before.

239
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,090
I never got one from my 
dead family or my master,

240
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,160
so I just thought that was how it was.

241
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,890
Not even from your family?

242
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,540
Was it not the custom there?

243
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,220
No, they probably just didn't 
care about me that much.

244
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,030
I'm originally from a village of warriors.

245
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,820
There was no place there for the weak.

246
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,250
That was a pathetic display 
in front of that monster.

247
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
Try to be more like Stoltz.

248
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,780
Not only is he uninjured, but he doesn't 
have a speck of blood or dirt on him.

249
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,280
His pure white cape proves he's 
the strongest warrior in the village.

250
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,890
Stoltz, you're the pride of the village.

251
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,520
Of course, Dad.

252
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,840
But by contrast, Stark is a failure.

253
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,810
Despite training so hard every day, 
he still hasn't faced down a monster.

254
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,980
It's starting to rain. Let's head home.

255
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm going to train my 
foolish younger brother.

256
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,840
Don't be too mean to him.

257
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm heading home. You're wasting your time.

258
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,200
Stark.

259
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,570
Brother.

260
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,340
Sorry.

261
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,450
Good focus.

262
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,840
I know you'll become stronger, but your 
stance could use some improvement.

263
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,620
Come to think of it, my brother 
might've been different.

264
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,450
But...

265
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,790
When my village was attacked by monsters, 
I abandoned even my brother and fled.

266
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,670
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised my family 
never celebrated my birthday.

267
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,410
I was a failure who ran from everything.

268
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,580
I bet Himmel wouldn't have run.

269
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,190
Mr. Stark, let's go pick out a present.

270
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,200
The past doesn't matter.

271
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,320
The warrior Stark I've known has never run.

272
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,810
But I might in the future.

273
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,950
We won't let you.

274
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,810
But I—

275
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,560
If you won't choose, then I'm 
choosing something for you.

276
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,700
Fine.

277
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,630
I'd like this, then.

278
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,720
No. That's expensive.

279
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,510
Okay.

280
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,730
Welcome back. You're late.

281
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,540
Ms. Frieren, what are those 
ridiculously large hamburg steaks?

282
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,230
What are you talking about?

283
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,350
This is how you celebrate a birthday.

284
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,840
My master never gave me any gifts,

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,610
but he did make me birthday hamburg steaks.

286
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,720
What do you mean?

287
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,030
Stark, Eisen didn't tell you?

288
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,880
Tell me what?

289
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,440
Warriors are so awkward.

290
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,870
You're one to talk, aren't you, Ms. Frieren?

291
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,660
You're right. I understand 
because I'm awkward, too.

292
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,080
It's foolish, isn't it?

293
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,480
People won't know how you feel 
unless you tell them.

294
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,540
This is...

295
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,540
Come to think of it,

296
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,810
you always make ridiculously large 
hamburg steaks on our birthdays.

297
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,820
What's that about?

298
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,050
It's a custom in my region.

299
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,680
They're a gift to honor warriors 
who have worked hard.

300
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,840
It's like a birthday present from me.

301
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,080
But Eisen, we're not warriors.

302
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,590
Everyone who works hard is a warrior.

303
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,910
Really?

304
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,270
Who can say?

305
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,980
Warriors who have worked hard...

306
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,110
Brother, what are you making?

307
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,550
Hamburg steak. It's your birthday, isn't it?

308
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,330
Don't tell the rest of the family.

309
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,100
Run, Stark.

310
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,390
You have to live.

311
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,400
Eisen gave me the recipe.

312
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,000
Is it good?

313
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,130
Yeah.

314
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,200
I have some of this left over, too.

315
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,150
I'll pour it over your 
head again, Ms. Frieren.

316
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,320
Huh? What's that?

317
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,670
None of your business.

318
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,450
A valuable potion.

319
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,070
What? What's it do?

320
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,240
Perv.

321
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,680
What? How am I a perv?

322
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,630
Perv.

323
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,880
Seriously, why?!

324
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,600
<i>And you alright</i>

325
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
<i>Can you hear me</i>

326
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,980
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

327
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,320
<i>Crying excessively</i>

328
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,490
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

329
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,530
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

330
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,250
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

331
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,000
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

332
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,670
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

333
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,220
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

334
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,260
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

335
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,020
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

336
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,110
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

337
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,940
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

338
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,950
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

339
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,710
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

340
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,670
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

341
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,590
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

342
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:12,760
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

343
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,430
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

344
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>for you to come back home</i>

345
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,680
Himmel!

346
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,690
My nose is starting to bleed.

347
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,440
You're a wicked woman.

348
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,670
Alcohol is the best medicine.

349
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,440
So what, Frieren?

350
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,640
Too much time has passed. 
Nothing that can be done now.

351
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,630
Grown-ups are dirty.

352
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,210
He also likes older women.

353
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,040
