1
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,620
Ms. Frieren.

2
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,750
You're late.

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,680
You defeated Aura, didn't you?

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,060
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

5
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,480
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,030
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

8
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,360
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,700
<i>Across this land</i>

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,030
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

11
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,500
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:16,260
Beyond Journey's End

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,800
<i>The story ends</i>

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,300
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,140
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

16
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,810
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

17
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,310
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

18
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,480
<i>Makes people forget</i>

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,270
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,070
<i>Begin to rust</i>

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,900
<i>Just the same</i>

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,530
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,410
<i>And they live on</i>

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,950
<i>We chose the same path</i>

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,080
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,620
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,880
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,250
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,340
<i>Even now</i>

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,720
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,260
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

33
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,930
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,110
I don't believe—
I <i>can't</i> believe this happened.

35
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,070
Let's go.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,190
Wait. You don't need to run.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,580
The graf said he'd pardon you.

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,340
It must have been a fierce battle,

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,850
but none of them are seriously damaged.

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,090
Thank you for treating the heroes 
of the northern lands with respect.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,320
I used to cast flashier spells, 
but Himmel got mad at me.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,350
I bet he did.

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,320
He was right to be angry. I'd be angry, too.

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,110
Mr. Himmel trained you well.

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,710
Don't say it like that.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,280
I guess you're right, though.

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,700
This is a normal reaction.

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,780
What do you mean?

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,420
Don't worry about it.

50
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,050
Fern, Stark.

51
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,790
Good job defeating Lügner and his henchwoman.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm proud of you.

53
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,900
I'd be even more impressed 
if you weren't so beat up, though.

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,060
This is normal for a warrior.

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,050
What does "normal" even mean?

56
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,700
You're covered in wounds.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,500
See that they receive proper burials. 
I'll escort our benefactors to the city.

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,340
Yes, milord.

59
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,620
Milord.

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,960
What is it?

61
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,930
Frieren.

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,720
I've never been as grateful to anyone 
as I am to you today.

63
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,100
Frieren, I promised to reward you 
in any way I could.

64
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,080
You requested the defensive 
barrier grimoire by Flamme

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,120
that has been passed down 
for generations in my family.

66
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,630
Are you sure this is what you want? 
This grimoire...

67
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,960
It's fake.

68
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,450
Yes. The defensive barrier it describes

69
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,660
is nothing like our city's barrier, 
whose spell is passed down by oral tradition.

70
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,570
I'm well aware of that, milord.

71
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,280
It's just my hobby.

72
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,150
I see.

73
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,980
Either way, you needn't use 
such formal language.

74
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,530
From your perspective, 
I must seem akin to an infant.

75
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,420
I suffered a bitter experience when 
I first left to defeat the Demon King.

76
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,080
Come to think of it, Mr. Heiter 
said that in the royal capital,

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,490
disrespecting nobility 
is punishable by death.

78
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,050
Himmel and Eisen were nearly executed 
for speaking casually to the king.

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,650
Remembering Himmel screaming 
and crying takes me back.

80
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,550
Execution? That's extreme.

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,640
And speaking so casually to me 
is a serious crime in this town, brat.

82
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,270
Sorry, old man.

83
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,470
I'm gonna break this 
expensive-looking chair.

84
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,580
Th-The central lands sure 
are barbaric, milord.

85
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,950
Seriously?!

86
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,730
I've finished cutting the 
trees in the backyard.

87
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,710
Thank you.

88
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,960
Well, you know, I only said that 
so you'd escape.

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,850
In this town, you won't be thrown 
in prison just for speaking casually.

90
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,160
Be at ease.

91
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,790
In that case...

92
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,100
Good news for you, Mr. Stark.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,850
He's passed out.

94
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,490
I've told the townsfolk of Aura's defeat.

95
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,970
They all want to honor the heroes.

96
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,550
I ask that you take your time here.

97
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,870
He's floating.

98
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,270
It's not that big a deal.

99
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:13,310
<i>The name that has protected me</i>

100
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,560
<i>Is being called by that soothing voice of yours</i>

101
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,750
<i>So that you won't close your eyes all alone</i>

102
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:35,000
<i>I'll embrace you</i>

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,990
<i>You joined your warm hands with mine</i>

104
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,050
<i>So I won't forget</i>

105
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,190
<i>Beyond the night, where it's full of flowers</i>

106
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:02,410
<i>It is where you are, a place I will return to</i>

107
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:10,020
<i>Split the swelling, unravel the darkness</i>

108
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:18,000
<i>So that the dream remains uncorrupted</i>

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,440
<i>To the blue path that never ends</i>

110
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,060
I finished the shopping.

111
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,130
Shall we go, then?

112
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,910
You're leaving already, Frieren?

113
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,390
Graf Granat.

114
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,970
I'll see you to the gates.

115
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,860
Frieren, I hear you're traveling to Ende,

116
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,070
the farthest point north, 
where the Demon King's castle is.

117
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,340
But currently, conditions on the 
Northern Plateau aren't looking good.

118
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,180
Travel is restricted.

119
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,860
Even adventurers must be accompanied 
by a first-class mage.

120
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
Then there should no problem 
with Ms. Frieren by our side.

121
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,720
What's a first-class mage?

122
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,250
Ms. Frieren, you don't know?

123
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,180
It's a certification awarded by the 
Continental Magic Association.

124
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,260
Certification?

125
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,530
I acquired mine in the 
holy capital when we left.

126
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,350
See?

127
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,210
This is my third-class mage certificate.

128
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,090
Come to think of it, you did have 
some business to take care of then.

129
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,540
Is this what certifications 
look like these days?

130
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,100
Ms. Frieren, don't tell me you're 
an uncertified underground mage.

131
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,400
Don't make it sound like 
I'm some back-alley doctor.

132
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,410
The organizations that regulate 
mages are constantly changing.

133
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,040
I can't be bothered obtaining 
a new certification every time.

134
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,280
I doubt this holy emblem works anymore.

135
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,460
What is that antique?

136
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,000
Even I know about the 
Continental Magic Association.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,920
They've been around for over 
half a century at the very least.

138
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,780
That's barely anything.

139
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,720
It's a hassle when they change their 
standards of conduct so frequently.

140
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,010
In any case, we'll need to overcome 
this problem before we continue.

141
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,800
I don't know the specifics,

142
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,930
but I believe there's a place 
in the northern lands

143
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,650
where you can take the first-class exam.

144
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,490
The largest magical city in the 
northern lands, Äußerst.

145
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,420
It's far beyond the Schwer Mountains.

146
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,220
You can follow the highway, 
but it'll be a long journey.

147
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,440
Frieren, the house of Granat will 
never forget what you've done for us.

148
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,490
Safe travels.

149
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,320
It's snowing.

150
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,430
It's almost winter.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,110
The winters around here are bitter, 
so be careful.

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,330
If you underestimate them, you'll die.

153
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,090
Is it really that dangerous?

154
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
Don't you know?

155
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,110
In the war against the Demon King's forces, 
what do you think claimed the most lives?

156
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,980
It was the winters of the northern lands.

157
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,610
See? We're lost.

158
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,760
What are we going to do?

159
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,970
Episode 11: Winter in the Northern Lands

160
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,220
We're lost.

161
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,980
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Decke region, located in the northern lands

162
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,990
I can't believe we got lost before 
even entering the Schwer Mountains.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,550
Mr. Stark, wake up!

164
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,730
If you fall asleep, you'll die!

165
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,010
Have jumbo-berry specials 
always been this small?

166
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,360
Who cares about that right now?

167
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,820
What should we do?

168
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,750
In these strong winds, 
we can't transport him with magic.

169
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,390
He'd probably be blown away.

170
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,140
Then we'll have to carry him.

171
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,990
He's heavy.

172
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,380
Why is he so heavy?

173
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,150
You smell nice.

174
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,900
Can I leave him behind?

175
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,010
Bear it for now.

176
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,630
There should be an emergency shelter 
at the foot of the mountains.

177
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,640
Isn't that information 
eighty years out of date?

178
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,860
Are we going to be all right?

179
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,280
Good.

180
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,060
It's still being maintained regularly.

181
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,350
It seems like someone's inside.

182
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,490
Perhaps someone arrived before us.

183
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,540
We're going inside.

184
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,630
We'll freeze out here.

185
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,630
Good! Very good!

186
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,020
I'm starting to feel warmer!

187
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,650
Excuse the intrusion.

188
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,790
Ms. Frieren, we can't stay here. 
Let's look for someplace else.

189
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,570
What? Why?

190
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,650
There's a pervert inside.

191
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,650
A pervert? That's awfully rude.

192
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,550
Let's go, Ms. Frieren.

193
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,240
Wait. Are you an elf?

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,320
It's been about 300 years since 
I've met another of my kind.

195
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,960
I thought the elves had already died out.

196
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,480
So did I.

197
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,680
And thanks for the fire, miss.

198
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,310
Not at all.

199
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm lucky I ran into a couple of mages.

200
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
The Goddess must have led you here.

201
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:21,110
I crossed the Schwer Mountains, 
but this blizzard extinguished my coals.

202
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,220
I was keeping myself alive by doing 
squats inside this freezing hut.

203
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,760
I see.

204
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,210
I'm not sure I understand.

205
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,970
I'm Kraft the Monk.

206
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,290
Frieren the Mage.

207
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,590
Fern, also a mage.

208
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,730
This is Mr. Stark the Warrior.

209
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,680
Anyway, Aureole, huh?

210
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,510
You're traveling to heaven, then?

211
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,940
Good on you for being so pious.

212
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,410
I'm not sure I totally believe it.

213
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,150
Ms. Frieren.

214
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,820
Mr. Stark is getting colder.

215
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,660
<i>So warm and comfortable...</i>

216
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,220
<i>And that's one huge jumbo-berry special.</i>

217
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,020
<i>What happened to me?</i>

218
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,600
<i>We got caught in a blizzard, and then...</i>

219
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,620
Who is this guy?!

220
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,860
You're so noisy.

221
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,600
That's no way to thank someone 
for warming you up with their body.

222
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,610
Their body?

223
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,490
You've got a nice body, old man.

224
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,620
Mr. Stark?

225
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,640
No, not like that.

226
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,360
I mean he's got a nice body 
from training hard.

227
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,980
You must be really strong.

228
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,020
What's your name?

229
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,570
Kraft the Monk.

230
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,350
I've never heard of you.

231
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,160
But you must be a pretty famous monk, right?

232
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,980
Stark, rest here.

233
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,270
You two, help me bring in food supplies.

234
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,660
My wagon and cargo are nearby.

235
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm really glad I met all of you.

236
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,340
We'll be able to use these frozen supplies.

237
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,400
Use as much as you'd like.

238
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,090
You've certainly stocked up.

239
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,140
Trying to cross the Schwer Mountains 
in these conditions would be suicide.

240
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,220
We're stuck here for a while.

241
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,620
By the way, Frieren, do you know who I am?

242
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,910
Not at all.

243
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,940
I didn't think so.

244
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,170
I don't know the first thing 
about you, either.

245
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,270
She's the mage from the party of heroes.

246
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,110
And before that?

247
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,010
What do you mean?

248
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,040
I mean that we're elves.

249
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,540
It's been nearly six months.

250
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,570
Thanks to all of you, we made it through 
the long winter in the northern lands.

251
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,220
Take this.

252
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,330
Give it to Fern. She's a pious girl.

253
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,390
Must be because she was raised by a priest.

254
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,620
She never forgets to thank the Goddess.

255
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,410
Kraft, why do you believe in the Goddess?

256
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,790
You don't, do you?

257
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,500
Excluding during the age of mythology,

258
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,110
the Goddess of Creation hasn't shown herself 
once in the long history of this world.

259
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,880
You're young. I used to think that way, too.

260
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,550
But now I believe in the Goddess 
from the bottom of my heart.

261
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,060
No, I need her to exist.

262
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,240
Everyone who knew of my 
righteous triumphs has died.

263
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,200
So when I die, I'll go to heaven 
and the Goddess will praise me.

264
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,830
She'll say, "Well done, Kraft."

265
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,910
"You lived a fantastic life."

266
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,470
You understand that, Frieren.

267
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,800
It's too cruel for the path your life took 
to not be remembered by anyone.

268
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,230
We've lived a long time to get to this point.

269
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,800
Kraft, that's just something we desire.

270
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,120
You're right.

271
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,110
Does that apply to heaven too, Frieren?

272
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,890
No matter.

273
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,750
Tell me about yourself, 
and I'll tell you about myself.

274
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,500
If you don't believe in the Goddess, 
then I'll praise you instead.

275
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,010
Are you surprised?

276
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,030
Yeah. I didn't think you'd fund the 
reconstruction of this village's orphanage.

277
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,850
You don't beat around the bush, do you?

278
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,010
I was an orphan, too.

279
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,540
I'm sure the Goddess will praise me 
for living a pure and proper life.

280
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,060
What are you talking about, you corrupt 
priest? You're drinking right now.

281
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,070
Frieren.

282
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,540
Do you have someone to praise you?

283
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,050
Where did that come from?

284
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,270
You don't seem to believe in the Goddess,

285
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,480
so if you tell me about yourself, 
I'll praise you instead.

286
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,640
I haven't done much with my life.

287
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,820
I haven't done anything praiseworthy.

288
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,820
Even though you're constantly 
suppressing your mana?

289
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,510
To me, that seems like the 
result of tremendous effort.

290
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,210
Something that would take 
a lifetime to accomplish.

291
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,280
You noticed?

292
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,580
How many years have we 
traveled together again?

293
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,850
It's not an interesting story.

294
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,560
I don't mind.

295
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,500
Besides, it sounds like something 
useful to know for the future.

296
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,230
Why?

297
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,610
Perhaps a child of mine will become a mage.

298
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,130
I thought priests couldn't marry.

299
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,920
Why do so many strange 
people serve the Goddess?

300
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,380
I'll pass. I've already had 
someone else praise me.

301
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,500
I see. You have good friends, Frieren.

302
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,950
You should cherish them.

303
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,030
Actually, he's already...

304
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,520
He's in heaven now.

305
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,580
Then you'll see him again someday.

306
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,820
You're right.

307
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,040
I'm going this way.

308
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,980
Frieren, I doubt this is 
the last time we'll meet.

309
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,910
I'll see you in a few centuries.

310
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,910
Take care, old man! I had fun!

311
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,230
Thank you for the pendant!

312
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,510
<i>And you alright</i>

313
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,020
<i>Can you hear me</i>

314
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,900
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

315
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,230
<i>Crying excessively</i>

316
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,400
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

317
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,450
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

318
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,160
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

319
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,920
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

320
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,590
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

321
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

322
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,180
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

323
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,930
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

324
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

325
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

326
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,870
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

327
00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,620
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

328
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,580
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

329
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

330
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,680
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

331
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,350
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

332
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,270
<i>for you to come back home</i>

333
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,450
His pure white cape proves that he's

334
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,520
I'm a mild-mannered person, 
but even I'm pissed off.

335
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,390
This village used to protect the Hero's Sword.

336
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,150
the strongest warrior in the village.

337
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,060
It's a replica.

338
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,790
They're a gift to honor warriors 
who have worked hard.

339
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,060
Perv.

340
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,840
We're not warriors.

341
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,400
Don't tell the rest of the family.

342
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,930
Episode 12
A Real Hero

343
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,970
He was a real hero.
