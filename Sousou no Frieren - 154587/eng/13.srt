1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,040
I see.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,020
So you're an adventurer.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,650
I wanted to be one a long time ago.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,980
It was the kind of dumb 
childhood dream everyone has.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,040
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,460
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,380
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,010
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,340
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,680
<i>Across this land</i>

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,010
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,470
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:51,230
Beyond Journey's End

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,780
<i>The story ends</i>

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,120
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,790
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,290
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,460
<i>Makes people forget</i>

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,040
<i>Begin to rust</i>

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,880
<i>Just the same</i>

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,170
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

24
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,510
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,390
<i>And they live on</i>

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,930
<i>We chose the same path</i>

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,060
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,600
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,860
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

30
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,230
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,320
<i>Even now</i>

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,690
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,240
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,910
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,010
Episode 13: Aversion to One's Own Kind

36
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,010
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Alt Woods, located in the northern lands

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,010
When I was a kid,

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,750
I had a friend who I joined 
on lots of little adventures.

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,010
Foolhardy and with energy to spare, 
he was like a gorilla.

40
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,620
That said, he was a good gorilla 
who cared for his friends.

41
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,040
When I grew up and started 
to forget that dream,

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,640
he invited me to become 
an adventurer with him.

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,250
I wonder what would've changed 
if I'd taken his hand then.

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,000
That was ten years ago.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,560
I still regret it.

46
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,970
Huh.

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,050
So why are you telling me this?

48
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,040
My village's harvest festival is coming up.

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,090
My brother asked me to go into the woods 
and pick wild herbs to use in cooking.

50
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,050
But then...

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,440
I got stuck in a bottomless swamp.

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,570
I'm done for.

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,790
But if you take my hand, 
then maybe my fate will change.

54
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,870
Hold on. I'm thinking about it.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,850
What is there to think about?

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,090
Your hand is dirty.

57
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,870
This is really not the time 
to be worrying about that!

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
Besides, miss...

59
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,460
Grown-ups are dirty by nature.

60
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,280
This might be my first time encountering 
a physically dirty adult.

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,560
Can I have some more time?

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,480
I'm trying to remember the spell to pull 
someone out of a bottomless swamp.

63
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,520
P-Please hurry.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
Let's see...

65
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,750
Ms. Frieren.

66
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,100
Did you find any herbs?

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,960
Oh, I remember now.

68
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,060
This is far enough.

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,290
I'm sorry for the trouble 
Ms. Frieren caused you.

70
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,160
It's fine. She saved me.

71
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,760
I'll give her an earful later.

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,390
Not my problem.

73
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,480
Anyway, are you sure you don't 
need to stop by the village?

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,150
We're busy preparing for the harvest festival, 
but I can at least thank you.

75
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,820
We're hoping to reach a large 
town today so we can resupply.

76
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,150
I see. In that case, be careful.

77
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,250
There are lots of dangerous 
venomous creatures around here.

78
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,350
Okay.

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,500
Got it.

80
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,760
Something bit me.

81
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,630
What? You were bitten?

82
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,430
He told us to be careful. 
What are you doing?

83
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,360
Let's stop the bleeding.

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,590
Huh?

85
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,230
My nose is starting to bleed.

86
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,690
Identifying poison is a priest spell, 
so I'm not too good at it.

87
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,790
I don't recognize this reaction, 
so the antidotes we have might not work.

88
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,590
We should get you checked out at a church.

89
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Fern, how much longer can 
you use your flying magic?

90
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,930
It consumes a lot of mana, 
so only about thirty minutes.

91
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,080
Thirty minutes won't get us to town.

92
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,150
We'll head back to that village.

93
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,370
I'll transport Stark.

94
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,960
It's not that big a deal.

95
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,150
I'm fine.

96
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,600
Besides, my master said 
you can tough out poisons.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,700
Come to think of it, Eisen was perfectly 
healthy even after taking several arrows

98
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,220
that were coated with a poison 
strong enough to knock out a dragon.

99
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,120
Heiter was appalled.

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,400
See?

101
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,420
That just goes to show that Mr. Eisen 
was far from normal.

102
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,130
Besides, according to Mr. Heiter, 
20% of adventurer deaths are due to poison.

103
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,240
We should hurry.

104
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm fine, really.

105
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,250
It's too late.

106
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,320
In a few hours, his brain 
will begin to melt.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,510
It will flow out his nose,

108
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,490
and then he'll die.

109
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,190
That's terrifying!

110
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Isn't there anything we can do, Father?

111
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,340
Normally, it can only be 
cured if it's treated early,

112
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,740
but perhaps my brother could help.

113
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother, do you have a minute?

114
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,790
Don't you think this new 
tub is kind of small?

115
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,330
There's honor in poverty.

116
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,970
Isn't this going too far, though?

117
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,250
We're the only ones who impoverish 
ourselves down to a hand-sized tub.

118
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,640
More importantly, Sein, 
take a look at this boy.

119
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,520
Huh? Brother, these are the
 ones I told you about.

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,010
They're the people who rescued me.

121
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,110
Did you get bitten by a snake?

122
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,020
I told you to be careful.

123
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,550
Now we're even.

124
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,670
Brother, I'm going to help out at the plaza.

125
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,460
Sure.

126
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,220
My nose stopped bleeding.

127
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,560
The effects of the poison are gone.

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,600
Father, is he...?

129
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,920
What do you think of my younger brother?

130
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,420
That holy symbol around your neck

131
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,690
is awarded to the most outstanding priest 
in a region by the holy capital.

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,940
He instantly cured a poison a 
healing expert called incurable.

133
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,020
He's a genius.

134
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,810
I'm not surprised you noticed, Ms. Frieren.

135
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,120
You know who I am?

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,080
Mr. Heiter told me about you.

137
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,030
He gave me this holy symbol when he came 
here from the holy capital to observe us.

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,170
That said, I'm a mere provincial priest.

139
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,180
This is the only thing I can be proud of.

140
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,850
But my ability doesn't compare to Sein's.

141
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,420
Our parents passed away when we were young.

142
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,440
Since then, I raised my much 
younger brother myself.

143
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,270
As a child, he often said he wanted 
to become an adventurer.

144
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,850
He didn't want to become

145
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,560
an ordinary village priest like me 
who spent every day the same way.

146
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,830
He said that with his eyes 
full of hopes and dreams.

147
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,150
But now he's like I was when I was young.

148
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,300
This life must bore him.

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,620
Would you please take him 
away from this village?

150
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,690
I'm certain he's been looking for someone 
to give him that last push.

151
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,340
I'm in, Frieren.

152
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,170
What's there to even think about?

153
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,460
I'm not risking my brains 
flowing out my nose again.

154
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,540
It's true that the journey ahead 
may be safer with a priest.

155
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,720
What do you not like about 
the idea, Ms. Frieren?

156
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,840
It's an aversion to my own kind, I guess.

157
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,190
What is she talking about?

158
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,560
I'm inviting him to join us, 
even if you two don't want to.

159
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,510
Where is he going?

160
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,230
Mr. Sein spends a lot of time 
at the bar downstairs.

161
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,770
What?

162
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,490
Alcohol.

163
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,870
Tobacco.

164
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,000
Gambling.

165
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,950
That's a bit <i>too</i> corrupt, don't you think?

166
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,110
I'm getting to know the people. 
Care to join us?

167
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,960
It's Stark. We're looking for a priest.

168
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,850
Will you join us?

169
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,580
You must be joking. 
I'm this village's priest.

170
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,120
I can't go on adventures.

171
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,450
No, I suppose that could be fun.

172
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,900
Have a seat, Stark.

173
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,800
If you can beat me, I'll join your party.

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,980
Really?

175
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,900
Yes, really.

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,720
Please, no!

177
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,670
Ms. Frieren, I think I heard 
Mr. Stark scream downstairs.

178
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,180
Someone's taken all his belongings.

179
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,530
How awful. Who would do this?

180
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,120
No hard feelings.

181
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,810
What?

182
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,420
Grown-ups are dirty, after all.

183
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,970
Someone's taken all <i>his</i> belongings!

184
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,240
The village chief won the lot.

185
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,410
He's got the devil's own luck.

186
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,670
Sein.

187
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,920
I heard you're looking for party members. 
Ask someone else.

188
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,800
You want to become an adventurer, don't you?

189
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,380
That was a long time ago. It's too late now.

190
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,450
I should've gone after him sooner.

191
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,190
The only person sitting here 
is a loser in his underwear.

192
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,650
Frieren, come defeat the Demon King with us.

193
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,200
It's too late now.

194
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,280
I haven't fought demons in over 500 years.

195
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,570
I've forgotten how to fight them.

196
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,710
I deferred the decision for too long.

197
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,590
I was probably afraid to fight the Demon King.

198
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,890
Too much time has passed. 
Time I can't get back now.

199
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,100
So what, Frieren?

200
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm talking about the present.

201
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm talking about the present.

202
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,260
Ask someone else.

203
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,280
You don't know how I feel.

204
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,050
I see. That told me everything I need to know.

205
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,690
I don't like you, Sein.

206
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,970
I see. In that case...

207
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,820
So I've decided you'll join us, 
no matter what.

208
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,980
What? Why?

209
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,910
That makes so little sense that it scares me.

210
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,680
Thanks. I feel warmer now.

211
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,290
I'm truly sorry for all the 
trouble we caused. Excuse us.

212
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,310
How much did it cost to get everything back?

213
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,900
He said we should take our time and 
enjoy the harvest festival coming up,

214
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,510
and then he returned it all for free.

215
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,130
Good thing they're nice people here.

216
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,490
He didn't know what to do with the axe.

217
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,650
That's kinda sad.

218
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,640
Mr. Stark, please put these on.

219
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,810
Do you have to hold them 
like they're filthy?

220
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,320
Mr. Sein, these are yours.

221
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,370
What did I do to upset her?

222
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,720
She's mad you took all 
of Stark's belongings.

223
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,990
It wasn't me. It was the chief.

224
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,010
People who gamble are the worst.

225
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,010
I'm sorry, okay?

226
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,750
And Mr. Sein is supposed to be a priest.

227
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,410
I'm not so sure about a priest who drinks.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Don't you know, Ms. Frieren?

229
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,240
Alcohol is the best medicine.

230
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,650
What did you teach her, Heiter?

231
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:13,760
Whether we recruit him or not, 
Sein should become an adventurer.

232
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,670
You've really come around to the idea.

233
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,500
I thought it might be nice to give 
someone the push they need,

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,370
like Himmel the Hero did for me.

235
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,130
<i>Looks like the adventurers 
have decided to stay in town.</i>

236
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,570
<i>They've been trying 
to recruit me every day since.</i>

237
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,590
<i>All my efforts to make them stop 
have been in vain.</i>

238
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:59,350
<i>They invite me on adventures with hopes and 
dreams in their eyes, like he did back then.</i>

239
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,650
<i>I'm just going to travel around 
the northern lands a bit.</i>

240
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,460
I'll be back in time for the harvest 
festival three years from now.

241
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,220
If you aren't ready now, you can come then.

242
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,570
<i>Let's go on our next adventure together.</i>

243
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,240
<i>Every time they try to recruit me, 
I wonder, "Why now?"</i>

244
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,860
<i>They shine too brightly for these tired eyes.</i>

245
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,490
You want to know what Sein likes?

246
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,450
We've been struggling to win him over, 
so we're looking for ideas.

247
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,010
Well, he likes alcohol, 
tobacco, and gambling...

248
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,890
We know those already.

249
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,890
Are you sure he's a priest?

250
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,840
It seems Mr. Heiter was a 
serious priest after all.

251
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,230
What's a serious priest, anyway?

252
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,020
He also likes older women.

253
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,240
He's a totally depraved priest.

254
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,610
Older women, huh?

255
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,050
Honestly, I don't know what 
to do with that information.

256
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,160
What?

257
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,210
Oh, right.

258
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,390
Brother, don't you think 
our new sickle is too small?

259
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,170
You can't even cut grass with...

260
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,730
Oh, it's you again.

261
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,610
Do you have a minute, Sein?

262
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,970
You're still here?

263
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,960
C'mon.

264
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,240
Don't make me say it again. 
Ask someone else.

265
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,930
Sein, wouldn't you like to 
travel with an older woman?

266
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,040
Are you stupid?

267
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,100
That's the whole reason I wanted 
to become an adventurer as a kid.

268
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,310
Talk about impure motives.

269
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,070
So, where is this older woman?

270
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,160
Right here, Sein.

271
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,620
I'm an elf. I'm far older than you are.

272
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,720
Come to think of it, I think 
my brother mentioned that.

273
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,030
But an older woman like that... 
is no older woman at all!

274
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,720
He seems really distressed.

275
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,390
Then you leave me with no choice.

276
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,330
I didn't want to do this...

277
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,560
but the time has come to use the seduction 
technique my master taught me.

278
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,350
Smooch.

279
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,970
What was that?

280
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,300
I threw you a kiss.

281
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,650
Maybe you're too young 
to appreciate it, sonny.

282
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,320
Won't somebody please take this child home?

283
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,070
That was way too sexy.

284
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,760
What's wrong with you two?

285
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,600
That's odd. When I tried it on Himmel, 
it knocked him out cold.

286
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,210
Himmel!

287
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,090
You're a wicked woman.

288
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,730
How strange.

289
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,050
I understand.

290
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,440
If I'd been the target, 
I would have been in danger.

291
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,870
As depraved as he is, he's still a holy man.

292
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,250
A formidable foe.

293
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,790
Enough already.

294
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,220
I'm not becoming an adventurer.

295
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,350
I thought you wanted to go after your friend.

296
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,600
Brother, you must understand.

297
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,780
Sein...

298
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,810
He said he'd be back in three years.

299
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Well, it's been ten.

300
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,290
He's obviously dead.

301
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,090
So you're giving up without going to see him?

302
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,150
It's only been ten years.

303
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,260
If you don't go see him now, 
you'll regret it in the near future.

304
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,350
You'll wonder if you could've made it 
in time if you'd gone now.

305
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,980
It's tooâ€”

306
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,760
You think it's too late, don't you?

307
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,020
I'm talking about the present, Sein.

308
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:11,270
I can't go for the same reason 
I didn't follow him ten years ago.

309
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,060
I can't leave my brother 
behind in this village.

310
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,190
What are you talking about, Sein?

311
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,520
I overheard the conversation 
you had with Mr. Heiter

312
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,010
when he came to observe us.

313
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,360
With your talent, you could serve 
as a priest in the holy capital.

314
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,400
Me, in the holy capital?

315
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,210
Yes, undoubtedly.

316
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,660
What would happen to my brother then?

317
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,970
He'd come with you, of course.

318
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,400
I see.

319
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Mr. Heiter, I appreciate the offer,

320
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,650
but my life in this village is comfortable.

321
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,410
My brother lost his parents 
when he was still young.

322
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,180
As his older brother,

323
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,490
I can't take his hometown from him, too.

324
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,430
Very well.

325
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,580
I understand.

326
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,490
I suppose I wasted my time coming here.

327
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,820
But since I'm already wasting time,

328
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,740
perhaps I'll tell your brother 
all about my adventures.

329
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,150
My brother stayed in this village for me.

330
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,720
Sein, is that what you thought?

331
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,340
We're not the same!

332
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,590
I've never regretted the choice I made!

333
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,550
But what about you?

334
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,040
How long do you intend 
to regret <i>your</i> choice?

335
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,540
I've had enough.

336
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,990
I apologized to my brother.

337
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,350
Okay.

338
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,780
Don't get the wrong idea. 
He's a kind brother.

339
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,680
He never once hit me before,

340
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,420
but I made him hit me this time.

341
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,640
I'd never seen him with 
that expression before.

342
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,410
Frieren, I've decided to 
become an adventurer.

343
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,420
I'm going after my friend.

344
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,050
It's only been ten years, after all.

345
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,680
I see.

346
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm doing this so I can look for him.

347
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,950
I'll find him and make my stupid 
childhood dream come true.

348
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,760
So I'm only traveling with you partway.

349
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,290
All right!

350
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,380
You did it.

351
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,510
Bye!

352
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,470
See you!

353
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,390
Bye-bye!

354
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,730
See you later!

355
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,400
Later!

356
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,890
By the way, where are you guys headed?

357
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,130
Heaven.

358
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,900
Is that someplace you need to seek out?

359
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,150
We all go there when we die.

360
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,540
Even you, Mr. Sein?

361
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,110
She really doesn't mince words, huh?

362
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,810
Good luck to us both.

363
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,160
Seriously, what's her deal?

364
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,600
<i>And you alright</i>

365
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
<i>Can you hear me</i>

366
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,980
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

367
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,320
<i>Crying excessively</i>

368
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,490
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

369
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,530
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

370
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,250
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

371
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,000
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

372
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,670
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

373
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,220
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

374
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,260
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

375
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,020
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

376
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,110
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

377
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,940
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

378
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,950
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

379
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,710
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

380
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,670
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

381
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,590
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

382
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:12,760
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

383
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,430
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

384
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>for you to come back home</i>

385
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,400
What do you mean by understanding relationships?

386
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,130
You just seem like someone accustomed 
to speaking with women. I don't like it.

387
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,030
I'm pretty sure that would kill me.

388
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,110
Let's go shopping together later.

389
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,580
We help each other when we're in need.

390
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,670
It happens naturally as people age.

391
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,200
We're alive.

392
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,770
Do you really hate me that much?

393
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,020
Episode 14
Privilege of the Young

394
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,090
Those arguments are the 
privilege of the young.
