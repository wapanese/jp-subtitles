00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

2
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:38,740
Long-range magic is a combination of 
three key factors essential to mages.

3
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,240
There's the amount of mana,

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,330
the strength with which it's fired, and the 
level of control the mage has over it.

5
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,330
You know that much, don't you?

6
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,120
Yes.

7
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,920
Earlier, your magic dissipated 
before it reached its target.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,760
That's a sign that your mana 
and firing strength are lacking.

9
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,390
It's not something you can fix overnight.

10
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,510
Regardless of your talent, 
it'll take years to master.

11
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,230
However, your level of control 
over the magic is very high.

12
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,610
That's what most people 
tend to have trouble with.

13
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,110
But you've got no problems there,

14
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,610
so just be patient with yourself.

15
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,950
Okay.

16
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,820
Is Fern's training coming along smoothly?

17
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,150
In just four years, she's learned more 
than most people do in ten.

18
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,780
She's studying too hard. 
It's not a good thing.

19
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,330
She's been spending all her 
time in the woods lately.

20
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,040
She must really love magic.

21
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,960
But she's still a long way 
from becoming a proper mage.

22
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,250
I'll finish deciphering the 
grimoire before she does.

23
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,590
I see.

24
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,970
Say, Heiter.

25
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,930
This grimoire probably...

26
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,230
Heiter?

27
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,440
Don't look at me like that.

28
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,910
If anything, it's a miracle 
I've been mobile until now.

29
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,330
I'll try to decipher the grimoire quickly.

30
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,330
I'd appreciate that.

31
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,090
Fern, put your training on hold.

32
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,220
Heiter collapsed. 
I need you to stay with him.

33
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,050
But I still haven't hit the rock.

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,180
You'll do it eventually. Right now—

35
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,810
Eventually isn't good enough.

36
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,570
Mr. Heiter will die before then.

37
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,070
He saved my life.

38
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,500
It'd be a waste for you to die now.

39
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,050
A waste?

40
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:31,470
A long time ago, I lost an old friend.

41
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,180
Unlike me, he was straight as an arrow,

42
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,310
and he never abandoned 
anyone who was in need.

43
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,490
If he'd survived instead of me, 
he would've saved a lot of people.

44
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,950
Since I'm not like him, I planned to 
live out the rest of my days quietly,

45
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,500
but one day, I suddenly realized something.

46
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,750
If I died without doing anything,

47
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,460
all the courage, strength of will, 
and friendship I learned from him—

48
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,130
even all my precious memories—
would vanish from this world.

49
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,890
If you have precious memories 
inside yourself as well,

50
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,480
then I think it'd be a waste for you to die.

51
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,110
Mr. Heiter has always feared 
dying and leaving me alone.

52
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,990
He did the right thing.

53
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,240
I don't want him to regret saving me.

54
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,250
I don't care if it's as a mage 
or whatever else—

55
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,000
learning some kind of skill to support 
myself is my way of repaying him.

56
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,380
I want him to be glad he saved me 
and to know I'll be fine.

57
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,260
You remember everything 
I've taught you, don't you?

58
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,100
Yes.

59
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Then do as you like.

60
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,120
It didn't contain any spells for bringing 
back the dead or granting immortality.

61
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,750
I see.

62
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,250
Did you know that already?

63
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,380
The fear of death is immeasurable.

64
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,130
If such spells existed, 
Ewig would've cast them on himself.

65
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,760
Then why?

66
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,310
How is Fern?

67
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,850
She has room for improvement in some areas,

68
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,520
but it wouldn't be wrong 
to call her a proper mage.

69
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,190
I see. Then she made it in time.

70
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,990
Now she won't get in your way, Frieren.

71
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,200
Will you bring her with you on your travels?

72
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm sorry, Heiter. 
That's the one thing I can't do.

73
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,250
She'd only get in my way.

74
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,960
You tricked me, Heiter.

75
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,300
Your payment for deciphering 
the grimoire is in the desk drawer.

76
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,800
Please leave this place tonight.

77
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,760
Why?

78
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,390
As you can see, I don't have much longer.

79
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,780
I don't want her to experience 
losing anyone else.

80
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,780
Frieren, please look after Fern.

81
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,790
Are you trying to put on 
a brave face again, Heiter?

82
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,710
Fern has been ready to say goodbye 
to you for some time now.

83
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,250
What you need to do before your death

84
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,050
is give her a proper farewell

85
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,680
and make as many memories as you can.

86
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,060
Frieren, you really are a kind girl.

87
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,700
Why did you save Fern?

88
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
It's what Himmel the Hero would've done.

89
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,600
You're right.

90
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,450
Then maybe I'll do the same.

91
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,290
Thank you.

92
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,800
Because of you, I was able to 
repay my debt to Mr. Heiter.

93
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,840
He just tricked me, is all.

94
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,220
This corrupt priest.

95
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,230
Shall we go, then?

96
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,030
Episode 2: It Didn't Have to Be Magic...

97
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,210
26 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Turk region located in the central lands

98
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,090
That's enough, Fern.

99
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,500
We're finished.

100
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,340
Thank you for your help.

101
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,930
Here's your reward.

102
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,310
We've been doing such simple work.

103
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,350
That's how adventuring goes.

104
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,900
What were we paid in?

105
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,860
Folk magic. It's a spell 
that produces warm tea.

106
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,320
We'll try it out later.

107
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,450
The other day we learned a spell 
for removing rust from bronze statues.

108
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,410
Before that, we learned a spell 
for turning sweet grapes into sour ones.

109
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
How is it?

110
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,330
Sour.

111
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,750
You keep collecting the strangest spells.

112
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,040
It's my hobby, after all.

113
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,550
Ms. Frieren, you really do love magic.

114
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,300
Only somewhat, like you.

115
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,550
I feel like we're a little different.

116
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,140
We're the same.

117
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,140
Will you really do something for me?

118
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Since I'm an herbalist, 
I don't have any spells to teach you.

119
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,820
That's fine. Just learning about 
the local flora is helpful enough.

120
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,450
This is it.

121
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,380
It's a statue of Himmel the Hero.

122
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,840
It's in terrible shape, isn't it?

123
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,590
It's too much for one old woman to handle.

124
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,260
And the villagers don't care anymore.

125
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,100
Run!

126
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,120
When the village was attacked by a monster,

127
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,580
Mr. Himmel fought valiantly to defend us.

128
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,920
It saddens me to see him treated like this.

129
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,880
No, it's what he deserves. 
It's Himmel's fault for wanting to show off.

130
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,810
When the villagers offered to make a statue 
of him, he should have just declined.

131
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,770
Is this okay?

132
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,770
This pose isn't too handsome, is it?

133
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,020
Just hurry up and pick something.

134
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,520
He drove the sculptor mad 
by spending 18 hours choosing a pose.

135
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm hungry.

136
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,490
In the end, they settled on 
a ridiculously plain one.

137
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,410
What a strange story.

138
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,910
Come to think of it, there was an 
elven mage in the hero's party.

139
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,540
Shall we get this cleaned up?

140
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,300
Thank you.

141
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,090
Magic sure is amazing, isn't it?

142
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,550
There isn't a speck of rust left.

143
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,560
I wish there was a bit more color, though.

144
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,930
Perhaps I'll plant some flowers later.

145
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,520
Ms. Frieren, you have a spell that 
produces a field of flowers, right?

146
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,900
You're right. I guess I could just 
conjure something up...

147
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,360
No, blue moon weed flowers would be best.

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,030
What kind of flowers are those?

149
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,410
I don't know. I've never seen them.

150
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,540
Then why?

151
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,170
They grow in Himmel's hometown.

152
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,380
But you can't conjure flowers 
you've never seen before.

153
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,800
Blue moon weed...

154
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,260
Now that's a name I haven't 
heard in a long time.

155
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,810
Long ago, there used to be a 
field of them in those woods.

156
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,690
They don't grow around here anymore?

157
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,570
They all died out.

158
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,200
It's been decades since they've 
been spotted in these lands.

159
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,250
I see.

160
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,830
Let's go, Fern.

161
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,840
Okay.

162
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,050
You're hiding something.

163
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,680
I won't be mad, so show me what it is.

164
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,600
They're seed rats. Pests that consume seeds.

165
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,310
I'll release them in the woods.

166
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,070
Fern, shall we go look for blue moon weed?

167
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,200
Are you serious?

168
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,740
There was a field of them 
in these woods until recently.

169
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,040
That was decades ago.

170
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,290
But they're worth looking for.

171
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,130
If we find and analyze them, we can acquire 
a spell for conjuring blue moon weed flowers.

172
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,630
For Mr. Himmel?

173
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,130
No...

174
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm probably doing this for myself.

175
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,360
Ms. Frieren, we've been searching for 
blue moon weed for six months now.

176
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,610
You're right. Perhaps we should 
broaden our search area.

177
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh, I don't often see you on your own.

178
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,720
It's been a while since you 
first came to the village.

179
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,640
Have you found any blue moon weed?

180
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,220
Do you think we'll find any?

181
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,770
Ms. Frieren's obsession with 
magic is extraordinary.

182
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,730
At this rate, she'll continue searching 
for years, if not decades.

183
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,200
She's a mage who possesses the 
power to save many people.

184
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,370
She shouldn't spend her time searching 
for something that doesn't exist.

185
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,540
You're so young.

186
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,210
Am I wrong?

187
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I don't think so,

188
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,850
but Ms. Frieren must see things differently.

189
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,560
But since she's so much more 
mature than we are,

190
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,020
I'm sure she'd understand if you honestly 
conveyed those feelings to her.

191
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,880
These are the seeds of a related species 
she kept for their medicinal properties.

192
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,470
Could we plant these around 
Himmel's statue instead?

193
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,890
I get it, Fern.

194
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,430
I made you worry.

195
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,230
I'm not just spending my own time on this.

196
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,020
It's time to go.

197
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,030
I'll end my search soon.

198
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,160
How many years is soon?

199
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,950
Soon.

200
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,490
You don't know when to stop—

201
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,720
Shall we follow it?

202
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,750
Ms. Frieren, why do you collect spells?

203
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,420
It's just a hobby of mine.

204
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,420
I find that hard to believe.

205
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,420
It really is just a hobby.

206
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,800
I used to live much more apathetically.

207
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,450
Gross.

208
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,840
But then I got to know an idiot who 
complimented the spells I gathered.

209
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,630
That's all.

210
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,430
That's a silly reason.

211
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,350
You're right.

212
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,580
Is that...

213
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,370
It's a petal.

214
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,340
They say seed rats bury their food 
in safe places away from enemies.

215
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,920
They're clever animals, aren't they?

216
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,760
I wouldn't say that.

217
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,180
Since they bury their food in so many places,
they often forget where.

218
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,940
Blue moon weed?

219
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,440
It's a flower that grows in 
my homeland. It's beautiful.

220
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,860
Not as beautiful as me, though.

221
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,450
Shall we get going?

222
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,450
Frieren.

223
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,660
Someday, I'd like to show them to you.

224
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,700
I see.

225
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,660
If we have the opportunity, perhaps.

226
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,760
I figured they'd be here, 
but I wasn't expecting so many.

227
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,850
<i>It took longer than I would've liked, Himmel.</i>

228
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,980
I can't believe we really found them.

229
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,190
Now we can create a spell for blue moon weed.

230
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,660
Why are you so passionate about magic?

231
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,740
I don't understand.

232
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,990
But you do.

233
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,000
You never gave up on becoming a mage.

234
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,130
That's different.

235
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,210
I would've been happy to learn any skill 
that allowed me to support myself.

236
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,380
It didn't have to be magic...

237
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,260
But you chose magic.

238
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,900
You're right.

239
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,740
I never thought I'd see blue moon weed again.

240
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,870
They're beautiful.

241
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,120
Thank you, Ms. Frieren.

242
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,380
Now this statue will never be forgotten.

243
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,920
Oh, I nearly forgot.

244
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,220
There.

245
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,140
How cute.

246
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,390
Shall we go?

247
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,610
That's too powerful.

248
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
The Elder Sage of Corruption, Qual.

249
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,780
He called you heartless for not checking on him.

250
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,780
Let's put that into practice.

251
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,780
How many years do you think 
we've traveled together?

252
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,950
Does this journey have a purpose?

253
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,950
Classroom study is important, too.

254
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,030
Episode 3
Killing Magic

255
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,030
Killing magic.
