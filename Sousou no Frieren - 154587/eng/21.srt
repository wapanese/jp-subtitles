1
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,580
It's been a while, Flamme.

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,040
<i>You're there like the wind</i>

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,660
<i>Closing your eyes at sunset</i>

4
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,310
<i>I wonder what's on your mind</i>

5
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,630
Beyond Journey's End

6
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,010
<i>With your eyelids open</i>

7
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,590
<i>Your eyes shone like glass</i>

8
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:27,360
<i>It faintly smelled like a sunny day</i>

9
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,490
<i>Clear up the sky, let flowers bloom</i>

10
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,690
<i>Bloom and blame it on the sunny sky</i>

11
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,080
<i>Even the rain, when it stops</i>

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>Will make you shine in the sunlight</i>

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,480
<i>Calm the stirring sounds in my heart</i>

14
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,520
<i>We go like the sunny wind</i>

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,930
<i>Go on and fly over that cloud</i>

16
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,760
<i>Further and further away</i>

17
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,990
Episode 21: The World of Magic

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,960
Bargland.

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,500
The young are too hot-blooded.

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,130
The so-called privilege is nonsense.

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,880
What makes you say that?

22
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,930
Do you even have to ask?

23
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,030
The greatest joy of magic 
lies in searching for it.

24
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,550
That's all.

25
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,040
I see.

26
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,710
Time passes quickly.

27
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,790
The student I chose to train on a whim 
has already returned with her own student.

28
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,670
This is Frieren.

29
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,910
An elf, huh?

30
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,430
She's strong. I like her.

31
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,830
Tell me what spell you desire.

32
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,630
I shall grant you just one.

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,570
A spell that I desire?

34
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,500
I have knowledge of nearly every grimoire 
that's ever been written.

35
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,710
Mages spend their entire lives 
searching for the spell they desire.

36
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,340
Tell me what yours is, 
and I shall grant it to you.

37
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,330
I don't want one.

38
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,700
The greatest joy of magic 
lies in searching for it.

39
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,050
Flamme, this girl is no good after all.

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,120
She lacks a burning ambition.

41
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,580
Master, someday this girl 
will defeat the Demon King.

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,540
It will be a mage like her 
who clears the way to a peaceful era.

43
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,540
Are you saying I cannot?

44
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,530
As one who seeks battle, 
you cannot kill the Demon King.

45
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,230
We can't do it.

46
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,890
After all, you can't imagine yourself 
living in a peaceful era, can you?

47
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,420
Frieren is a mage of a peaceful era.

48
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,220
Good answer.

49
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,470
This is how mages ought to be.

50
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,710
<i>Damn it. He won't freeze at all.</i>

51
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,190
<i>The difference between 
our mana is too great.</i>

52
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,960
Nephtear.

53
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,610
Weak.

54
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,270
Kanne, defense!

55
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,140
I know!

56
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,920
You two put on quite the show earlier,

57
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,240
so I believe I know most of your tricks.

58
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,160
Relatively non-lethal ice magic,

59
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,190
and a mage who can't fight without water.

60
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,910
What am I even doing here?

61
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,910
This really is just babysitting.

62
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,170
That's not a nice thing to say.

63
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,590
Won't you run out of mana 
casting such flashy spells?

64
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,220
You graduated from magic school, didn't you?

65
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,670
Are the old folks still teaching their students
to fight defensive battles of attrition?

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,320
What do you mean?

67
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,900
Let me lecture you on the history of magic.

68
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:36,910
The defensive spell developed to combat 
Zoltraak is highly resistant to magic itself,

69
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,920
but its effectiveness against physical 
objects has hardly changed since then.

70
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,320
Naturally, there's a clear reason for that.

71
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,170
It's enough to defend against the physical 
attacks of monsters and warriors.

72
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,140
Defensive magic mustn't be over-engineered.

73
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,810
If we aimed for perfection, 
the technique would become too complex,

74
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,190
which would have a fatal effect 
on activation time.

75
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,330
The history of magic is one 
of attacking and defending.

76
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,880
It's the reason there's a trend 
for modern attack spells

77
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,190
to involve controlling physical objects.

78
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
Do you understand what I'm getting at?

79
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,550
Kanne, no! Move!

80
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,380
My spells overwhelm my opponents 
with high-volume physical attacks.

81
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,590
Now stay down.

82
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,140
Give me a break.

83
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,940
I'm not interested in hurting you.

84
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,820
Or do you want me to kill you after all?

85
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,810
Should you be approaching us so carelessly?

86
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,570
Sixty percent of the human body 
is made of water.

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,570
So what?

88
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,070
Magic is a world of visual imagination.

89
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,600
Can you picture how that water is distributed
throughout a person's body,

90
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,620
and how you'd remove and manipulate it?

91
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,780
How would you do that to a mage 
protected by a large amount of mana?

92
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,340
Spells can't produce effects 
you can't picture.

93
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,350
And even if there were water here, 
a small girl like you is no threat to me.

94
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,060
Not even bluffing works? 
I hate adults like you.

95
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,730
But I have figured out one thing.

96
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,750
You're lying.

97
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,550
If you loved fighting enough 
to lecture us on it,

98
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,880
you would've beaten us 
somewhere there was water.

99
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,570
What are you so afraid of?

100
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,140
Behave yourselves.

101
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,630
My job is just to put you two to sleep.

102
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,500
As long as Denken doesn't lose, that is.

103
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,540
<i>At this rate, this battle will end 
when she exhausts my mana.</i>

104
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,870
This is all a bit tough for this old body.

105
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,350
My apologies, Frieren, but I'm 
going to settle this quickly.

106
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,380
Waldgose.

107
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,880
Daosdorg.

108
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,130
What is that decrepit old man doing?

109
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,140
That old man fights rather spectacularly.

110
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,350
Will the barrier hold?

111
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,890
Of course. The barrier was created 
by the great mage Serie.

112
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,350
It cannot be destroyed by brute force.

113
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,940
Oh? That's good, then.

114
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,030
By the way, since around yesterday evening,

115
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,890
someone's been analyzing the barrier.

116
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,130
Why?

117
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,050
I don't know.

118
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,490
In any case, they're wasting their time.

119
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,790
Do you really think there's a mage 
in this world greater than Serie?

120
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,650
Catastravia.

121
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,820
<i>Impossible. A counterattack?</i>

122
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,290
<i>That was a continuous volley 
of spears of light.</i>

123
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,900
<i>She shouldn't have had the opportunity.</i>

124
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,050
<i>I'm out of mana. So this is the end.</i>

125
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,050
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

126
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,800
<i>She only used basic combat 
spells until the end.</i>

127
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,890
<i>This was practically a combat 
lesson for a trainee mage.</i>

128
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm surprised.

129
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
Even at my level, there was 
still someone above me.

130
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,630
Tell me where Laufen is.

131
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,800
I know you know.

132
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,130
I'm taking back our Stille.

133
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,990
If you were in my position, 
do you think you'd tell me?

134
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,070
You're right.

135
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,840
Laufen, you're hiding nearby, aren't you?

136
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,360
Bring the Stille here.

137
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,450
If you don't, I'll kill Denken.

138
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,850
Don't do it, Laufen. 
She doesn't intend to kill me.

139
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,570
You can tell, can't you?

140
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,470
<i>The old man was beaten.</i>

141
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,860
<i>She's a far better mage than me—
no, better than even Richter.</i>

142
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,240
<i>But she underestimates us.</i>

143
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,410
<i>She's not touching the old man's body.</i>

144
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,180
Don't use Jilwer. Stay hidden.

145
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,820
If you release even the slightest bit 
of mana, she'll detect you.

146
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,390
<i>From this distance, I could 
retrieve the old man and flee!</i>

147
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,410
Don't. It's a trap.

148
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,170
You leave me no choice.

149
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,980
I don't really want to do this, but...

150
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,430
Found you.

151
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,310
You fool.

152
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,460
You inexperienced fool.

153
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,960
You knew she wouldn't kill me.

154
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,000
But she planned to hurt you 
without killing you.

155
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,590
We still would've won.

156
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,330
Why are you so desperate 
to become a first-class mage?

157
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,470
You've got wealth, influence, 
and everything else you could want.

158
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,680
My homeland is located deep 
in the Northern Plateau.

159
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,860
Because the demons are acting up, only 
first-class mages can enter the area now.

160
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,130
I wanted to visit a grave 
I haven't been to in a while.

161
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,650
That's all.

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,380
Shouldn't you go help the kids?

163
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,760
Perhaps it's too late, though.

164
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,460
Richter will kill them before he faces you.

165
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,760
He's capable of making pragmatic choices.

166
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,350
They'll be fine. Kanne and Lawine will win.

167
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,370
I just finished analyzing the barrier.

168
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,280
I wasn't expecting Denken to lose.

169
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
Now, then.

170
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,140
Babysitting time is over.

171
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,310
He's actually trying to kill us now.

172
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,830
We won't last a minute against him.

173
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,050
Analyzing the barrier?

174
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,900
What do you mean?

175
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,830
Frieren. Don't tell me, you...

176
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,130
Genau.

177
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,950
It's not a problem. It's impossible.

178
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,770
Even if the world were turned upside down—

179
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,230
It's going to break.

180
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,980
Sense, who is that elf mage?

181
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,490
According to the list of test-takers, 
her name is Frieren.

182
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,740
That's the name of the mage who 
traveled with the party of heroes.

183
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,800
She apparently had a holy emblem, too.

184
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,170
So she's the last great mage.

185
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,960
Now you've done it, Frieren.

186
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,400
It's been a thousand years, 
and this is how you say hello?

187
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,490
This is why I can't quit being a mage.

188
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,350
In the world of magic, sometimes 
the world is turned upside down.

189
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,890
I can't believe you actually 
destroyed the barrier.

190
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,280
Why would you do that?

191
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,660
Because I felt sorry for Kanne.

192
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,400
Magic should be free.

193
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,920
She controls water, does she?

194
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,610
Magic is a world of visual imagination.

195
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,610
Can you imagine defeating a mage 
who controls water in the rain?

196
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,610
At the very least, I can't.

197
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,000
I doubt Richter can either.

198
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,760
The barrier...

199
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,410
What happened?

200
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,250
It's raining.

201
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,570
No, I can figure out what happened later.

202
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,500
I have to finish them now—

203
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,400
You finally showed an opening.

204
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,010
Your panic is disrupting your mana.

205
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,100
This will only buy you time!

206
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,780
I see now why you feared a spell 
that could control water.

207
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,530
This is the perfect example of the 
high-volume physical attacks you mentioned.

208
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,280
Lawine, don't let him get away.

209
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,420
Reamstroha.

210
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,920
There's nowhere for me to run, anyway.

211
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,090
This is why I don't like water.

212
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,910
Looks like you won.

213
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Let's get away from here.

214
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,700
The sun sets in two hours.

215
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
You can conceal your mana 
until then, can't you?

216
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,450
I don't have any mana left to conceal.

217
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,030
I see. You did well.

218
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,170
Don't pat my head.

219
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Sorry.

220
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,130
It was inevitable.

221
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,030
Denken and I are out of mana.

222
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,340
We have two hours left.

223
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,090
We're finished.

224
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,050
Laufen, can you dispel the binding?

225
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,900
You must be joking. 
This binding spell is ridiculously powerful.

226
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,780
Then bring down the tree instead.

227
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,390
Denken, there's nothing we can do.

228
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,290
I don't have the mana left 
to use Jilwer anymore.

229
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,560
Richter and Laufen, what do you think 
an imperial mage does in this situation?

230
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,550
He keeps fighting until the end.

231
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,560
We'll search for signs of battles fought 
by other parties and track them down.

232
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,810
You know, Fern,

233
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,870
you're really rather boring.

234
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,090
You seriously do only cast basic spells.

235
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,760
You should direct your 
complaints to Ms. Frieren.

236
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,620
Come to think of it, 
that elf is your master, right?

237
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,530
It's her fault we're soaking wet right now.

238
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,620
Make sure you give her an earful, all right?

239
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,970
I intend to.

240
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,820
Also, she doesn't limit what spells 
I cast outside of combat.

241
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,120
Come to think of it, you did cast 
a spell to catch that bird.

242
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,820
What other spells can you use?

243
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,910
Let's see...

244
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,930
I have a spell that lets you 
see through clothes...

245
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,650
I'm not going to cast it.

246
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,320
I hate to interrupt your 
pleasant conversation,

247
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,470
but maybe you shouldn't reveal 
too many of your tricks.

248
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,750
From the second test onward, 
we'll be competing against one another.

249
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,090
You're right.

250
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,600
Sorry 'bout that.

251
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,590
But I think you should've opened up 
some more, four-eyes.

252
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,770
There they are.

253
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,680
It's a defeated party.

254
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,800
The corpse of one of their 
members was nearby.

255
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,530
Even though there's no way for them to pass, 
they're keeping a tight hold on their Stille.

256
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,240
Are we going to negotiate with them, Denken?

257
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,960
They wouldn't cooperate.

258
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,670
If I were in their position, 
I'd refuse even money.

259
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,080
Why?

260
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,040
It wouldn't sit right with me.

261
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,220
It's not about logic.

262
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,960
Laufen, wait here.

263
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,190
If you see an opportunity, 
take their Stille.

264
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,140
Richter, come with me.

265
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,660
What do you intend to do?

266
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,880
We're approaching them head-on?

267
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,240
We don't have any mana left.

268
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,450
Don't you get it?

269
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,950
They're in the same boat.

270
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,750
Prepare yourself.

271
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,890
You're a man, aren't you?

272
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,970
You're joking, right?

273
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,870
Let's settle this with our fists!

274
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,720
It's time.

275
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,400
The first test is now over.

276
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,270
Six parties—eighteen individuals—
have passed the first test.

277
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,770
The second test will take place 
three days from now.

278
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,850
You will be informed of the details later.

279
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,050
That's all. You are dismissed.

280
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,530
It's been two days since 
they left for the exam.

281
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,530
I can stay up as late as I want, 
and Fern isn't around to get mad at me.

282
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm so happy, it's scary.

283
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,810
Sounds like you've got it rough, buddy.

284
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,180
<i>And I'm alright (I'll be alright)</i>

285
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,100
<i>Yeah, I hear you (I care about you)</i>

286
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,680
<i>The wind teases this hair that's longer now</i>

287
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
<i>There's meaning in everything</i>

288
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,100
<i>Even the days that came to a halt</i>

289
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,740
<i>Now that I finally understand,
I've caught up to you</i>

290
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,530
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

291
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,430
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

292
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,100
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

293
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,330
<i>I won't ask to see you, so at least</i>

294
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:37,120
<i>Let me remember the past, just for today</i>

295
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

296
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,010
<i>No more hesitations, I'd choose the present</i>

297
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,030
<i>Anytime, anywhere, yah (wherever you are)</i>

298
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,680
<i>Anytime, anywhere (smile for me)</i>

299
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,660
<i>I'll be there (close your eyes,
and I'll always be there)</i>

300
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,410
<i>Even if there are no absolutes</i>

301
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,480
<i>I'm always aware of your thoughts</i>

302
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,510
<i>Those tears will be alright,
dawn will surely break</i>

303
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,420
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby
for you to come back home</i>

304
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,220
I'm not sharing.

305
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,980
Don't worry, Ms. Frieren.

306
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,980
Don't talk about that.

307
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,020
You're even more spoiled than me.

308
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,040
It's not my birthday. 
I can't indulge myself like this.

309
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,040
You must eat your vegetables, too.

310
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,940
This guy is a pain in the butt.

311
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,950
We're no longer party members.

312
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,020
Episode 22
Future Enemies

313
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,090
Next time, we'll be enemies.
