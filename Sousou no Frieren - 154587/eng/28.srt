1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,490
I am Ms. Frieren's student.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,410
You pass.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,340
Next.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>You're there like the wind</i>

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,630
<i>Closing your eyes at sunset</i>

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,260
<i>I wonder what's on your mind</i>

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,600
Beyond Journey's End

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,980
<i>With your eyelids open</i>

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,570
<i>Your eyes shone like glass</i>

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:57,320
<i>It faintly smelled like a sunny day</i>

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,460
<i>Clear up the sky, let flowers bloom</i>

12
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,670
<i>Bloom and blame it on the sunny sky</i>

13
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,050
<i>Even the rain, when it stops</i>

14
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,060
<i>Will make you shine in the sunlight</i>

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,440
<i>Calm the stirring sounds in my heart</i>

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,480
<i>We go like the sunny wind</i>

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,900
<i>Go on and fly over that cloud</i>

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,740
<i>Further and further away</i>

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,870
Denken the Imperial Mage. 
I know all about you.

20
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,910
I'm honored.

21
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:02,050
A self-made military mage who rose to be 
the most influential in the northern lands.

22
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,620
It's an oft-heard heroic tale.

23
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,270
Honestly, I wish I could've met you 
when you were still young,

24
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,850
full of drive and ambition.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,700
I have no interest in burnt-out ashes.

26
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,640
Or so I believed.

27
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you feel differently now?

28
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,760
When you saw me, you thought about 
how you'd fight me, didn't you?

29
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,140
Only for a moment. 
I immediately abandoned the idea.

30
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,850
You pass. There's still a fire in you.

31
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,770
Normally it wouldn't even occur 
to someone to fight me.

32
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,100
Next.

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,990
You pass.

34
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,590
What? But we haven't even spoken yet.

35
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,050
Do we need to?

36
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,770
I guess not.

37
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,690
Next.

38
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,050
Is this some kind of joke?

39
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,970
What do you mean?

40
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,860
This is the first-class mage exam.

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,360
What kind of idiot never even sets foot 
into the examination grounds?

42
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,260
As you can see, my flesh-and-blood 
body is here, too.

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,910
I wouldn't want to be disqualified.

44
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,040
Throughout the exam period, your actual 
body never left your hometown.

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,300
Are you enjoying some tea right now?

46
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm surprised.

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,250
Not even Übel noticed.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,220
You've got guts. You pass.

49
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,720
Next.

50
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,080
You're Wirbel, captain of 
the Northern Magic Corps.

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,710
Of the second-class mages I know, 
you're the most combat-oriented.

52
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,780
With a single look, you realized 
you couldn't beat me in battle.

53
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,990
But that wasn't a judgment made out of fear.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,350
An idiot prone to picking fights he can't win
wouldn't even make it to second-class mage.

55
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,450
That's true.

56
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,990
Tell me, what's your favorite spell?

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,490
Magic is a tool for killing.

58
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,490
I neither like nor dislike any spells.

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,860
You pass.

60
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,910
Next.

61
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,560
What did you think when you saw me?

62
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,510
Um, I thought you were small and cute.

63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,030
What's wrong with this year's test-takers?

64
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,110
You pass.

65
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,040
Sense.

66
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,540
My apologies. We do have 
a bumper crop this year.

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,710
I failed.

68
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,040
There's always next time.

69
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,550
Stop following me.

70
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,130
Three years, huh?

71
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,810
Ms. Frieren, I passed.

72
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,110
Well done.

73
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,810
Frieren.

74
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,740
I made it this far because of you two.

75
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,050
Finally, I can visit a certain grave 
in my hometown.

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,740
I see.

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,450
Hey, Fern.

78
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,000
Have you decided yet?

79
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,540
I'd like—

80
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,540
Old man, I want these.

81
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,130
Well, well.

82
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,450
Don't be shy. Eat up.

83
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,380
When I was young, I hardly 
ever got to eat sweet things.

84
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,730
Thank you.

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,080
<i>What's going on here?</i>

86
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,290
Have some, young man.

87
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,100
Thanks, old man.

88
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,230
Who is he?

89
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,560
Mr. Denken the Imperial Mage.

90
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,830
An imperial mage?

91
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
You mean he's a noble?!

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,620
I'm sorry for speaking so casually to you.

93
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,370
It's fine. I came to this city 
as a mage like any other.

94
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,950
But you shouldn't feel obliged 
to treat a stranger like me...

95
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,750
I have no other use for my money.

96
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,450
There must be something.

97
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,500
He's right. Don't you have grandchildren?

98
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,760
I have no children or grandchildren.

99
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,510
My wife passed away when 
I was in my mid-twenties.

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,150
She was always sickly.

101
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,980
She was the daughter of a frontier noble

102
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,360
of the Northern Plateau who was 
defeated in a political dispute.

103
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,200
Back then, I was in need of both 
wealth and influence.

104
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,810
Those were the only ways I knew to save her.

105
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,000
When Serie established the 
Continental Magic Association

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,550
and began offering the privilege,

107
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,830
it was just after my wife had already passed.

108
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,670
I'd never felt more powerless.

109
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:20,940
It's ironic. These days, I could 
order entire nations around.

110
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,150
Fern.

111
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,570
For me, magic was only ever a tool 
to resolve political disputes.

112
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:37,340
Tell Frieren she reminded me 
of how fun magic can be.

113
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,000
The whole reason I became a mage was because

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,210
I admired her deeds in the party of heroes.

115
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,250
You should tell her that yourself.

116
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm sure she'd be glad to hear it.

117
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,640
You're right. That's what I'll do.

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,600
The magical city of Äußerst didn't disappoint.

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,790
I bought a bunch of good grimoires.

120
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,530
Hey, old woman.

121
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,090
You want those in this basket, right?

122
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,080
How could you just ignore her?

123
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Honestly, I did think about it a little.

124
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,260
Just a little?

125
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm surprised. I thought one of Himmel's 
party members would be...

126
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,770
Would be what?

127
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,760
If anything, you surprised me.

128
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,020
You tried to kill Fern's party 
during the first test, didn't you?

129
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,080
Fern complained to me about it.

130
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,850
She said you seemed like someone 
who'd kick a dog out of the way.

131
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,240
I get that a lot.

132
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,990
All I did was threaten them.

133
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,920
Though there was one of them whose death 
would probably make the world a better place.

134
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,990
I'd do anything to protect my hometown.

135
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,050
I wanted to become a first-class mage for 
the privilege of learning any spell I desired.

136
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,010
With a more powerful spell, 
I can slaughter more demons.

137
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:33,290
But even in other parts of the world, 
I do everything I can to help people in need.

138
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,770
Why?

139
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,740
My hometown is on the northern frontier.

140
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,270
There are countless stories 
about Himmel the Hero there.

141
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,560
The conquest of the Thousand-Mirror Tower.

142
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,250
His battles against Böse the Immortal, 
the Seven Sages of Destruction,

143
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,010
and the Hell Emperor Dragon.

144
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,650
When I was a kid, I loved 
those adventure stories.

145
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,130
But the village elders hardly 
ever talked about them.

146
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,280
They'd talk about how he defeated the monsters

147
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,870
that attacked the village, 
or how he guarded some merchant,

148
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,330
or even how he just helped 
carry stuff like a porter.

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,700
They were hardly impressive. 
Just a bunch of boring stories.

150
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,940
That's what I thought, anyway.

151
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,390
But you could tell how happy the village 
elders were when they told those stories.

152
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,010
After Himmel the Hero died

153
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,510
and the remaining demons started 
acting up, I finally understood.

154
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:54,720
The Thousand-Mirror Tower, Böse, 
the Hell Emperor Dragon,

155
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,540
even the Demon King—none of that 
had anything to do with my village.

156
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,740
Everyone had their hands full 
just maintaining their everyday life.

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,420
If Himmel the Hero 
hadn't come to my village,

158
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,620
then I doubt it'd still be there, 
whether he saved the world or not.

159
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,260
I see. What are you trying to say?

160
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,550
Those stories of Himmel's less exciting 
adventures were what guided me here.

161
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,380
That's all I'm trying to say.

162
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,840
I've been talking for too long.

163
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,310
I'm heading back with those guys.

164
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,030
Frieren, you should treasure 
the encounters you have.

165
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,280
Death isn't the only goodbye in this life.

166
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,780
But I guess you already know that.

167
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,610
Frieren, can't you magic us 
across one by one?

168
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,380
Then I'd be left all alone on this side.

169
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,010
Himmel, we need to defeat the 
Demon King as soon as possible.

170
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,650
What point is there in helping people 
in these insignificant ways?

171
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,560
You're right that they're insignificant.

172
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,120
Such deeds won't change the world.

173
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,840
But I won't ignore those in need 
right in front of me.

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,170
Don't worry, Himmel.

175
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,920
The world has changed.

176
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,510
We'll be granted our privileges tonight, 
and we're each allowed to bring guests.

177
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,130
Since we have the opportunity, 
let's all go together.

178
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,370
<i>She looks really unhappy about the idea.</i>

179
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,330
I was told we're allowed to bring guests.

180
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm sorry, but Ms. Frieren 
is prohibited per Ms. Serie.

181
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,430
For the next thousand years,

182
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,920
she is barred from entering any 
Continental Magic Association facility.

183
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,580
What exactly did she do to deserve this?

184
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,870
It can't be helped. 
I rubbed Serie the wrong way.

185
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
She's like a child.

186
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,140
It's not as though 
I wanted to be here anyway.

187
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,890
I'll wait outside.

188
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,370
I'll wait outside, too.

189
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,780
Hey.

190
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,390
That's the early evening bell.

191
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,710
They should be done receiving 
their privileges soon.

192
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,630
Yeah.

193
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,360
A first-class mage.

194
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,250
The highest level of mage, 
of whom fewer than fifty exist.

195
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,010
Fern has grown so much.

196
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:31,230
In this era, Fern will probably 
become a more famous mage than me.

197
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,690
Frieren.

198
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,810
I'm glad.

199
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,250
Me too.

200
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,430
Ms. Frieren.

201
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,430
Who is he?

202
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,870
A member of the Continental Magic Association.

203
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,710
I'm the first-class mage Lernen, 
one of Ms. Serie's students.

204
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,860
I'm sorry for the trouble 
Ms. Serie has caused you.

205
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,150
It's fine. She's always been like that.

206
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,900
What is it, Frieren?

207
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,100
You can see the fluctuations 
in my mana, can't you?

208
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,740
You're incredibly skilled. 
This peaceful era doesn't suit you.

209
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:27,120
You're right. I am an old-fashioned mage 
who only knows battle.

210
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,010
Ms. Serie often says the same thing.

211
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,460
If I'd been born during the era in which 
we fought the Demon King's forces,

212
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,670
I would've gone down in history 
alongside the other famous heroes.

213
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,140
I see. So what do you want from me?

214
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,890
The only one of Ms. Serie's students 
whose name is remembered is her first,

215
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,170
the Great Mage Flamme 
spoken of in fairy tales.

216
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:59,140
Once I grow old and die, yet another 
proof of her existence will disappear.

217
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,100
I don't want her to be alone in the future,

218
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:12,910
even if it means going down in infamy 
as the killer of the legendary mage Frieren.

219
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,430
I request a duel, Ms. Frieren.

220
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,740
I won't fight you. It'd be a waste of time.

221
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,730
Honestly.

222
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,290
Mages who only know how to fight 
can be so awkward.

223
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,120
There's no need for you to go down in history.

224
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,760
Serie will remember you.

225
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,440
One last thing.

226
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,380
This field of flowers was conjured by magic.

227
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,130
So what?

228
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,190
It was my master's favorite spell.

229
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,900
Didn't you call it useless?

230
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,780
Honestly, Flamme was a failure.

231
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,990
Despite all her talent, 
she failed to reach my heights.

232
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,720
I taught many students after her.

233
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,770
Most died without ever reaching my level.

234
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,790
But it's strange.

235
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,410
They were students I chose on a whim,

236
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,290
but I can clearly recall each one's 
personality and favorite spell.

237
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,650
Frieren, for some reason, I've never 
regretted taking on any of my students.

238
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,590
Even if they never made their mark on history.

239
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,540
She can't even tell her own students 
how she truly feels.

240
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,650
She truly is a child.

241
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,080
Ms. Frieren.

242
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,760
I received my privilege.

243
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,090
Shall we go, then?

244
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,090
Ms. Frieren, how did you get 
that injury on your shoulder?

245
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,200
I'd better get it healed at the church.

246
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Do you think they're still open?

247
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,610
Truly, we are awkward.

248
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,200
Both you and I.

249
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,520
Stark, what are we gonna do today?

250
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,880
Sorry, but I can't play today.

251
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,620
Stark, did you have breakfast this morning?

252
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,010
I already ate.

253
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,800
Stark, have some of this.

254
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,380
Hey, thanks.

255
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,510
The path of the warrior 
is long and treacherous.

256
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,140
Take care.

257
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,880
I will.

258
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,390
It's time to say goodbye to Äußerst.

259
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,550
People love you 
everywhere you go, Mr. Stark.

260
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,790
Yeah?

261
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,400
By the way, Fern, what spell 
did you end up asking for yesterday?

262
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,390
Can't you tell?

263
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,320
Your clothes are clean.

264
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,070
And they smell vaguely floral.

265
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,420
Could it be...

266
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,410
It's a spell to make clothes 
clean and spotless.

267
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,410
This will make laundry a breeze.

268
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,430
Serie the Living Grimoire 
lived up to her name.

269
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,180
That's a legendary-level spell 
from the era of mythology.

270
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,040
Well done, Fern.

271
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,070
That's my student.

272
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,910
Of course, Ms. Frieren.

273
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,910
Ms. Serie didn't seem at all 
happy about it, though.

274
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,830
Are you insane?

275
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,930
I'm sure. Serves her right.

276
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,330
They're here.

277
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,930
Frieren, thank you for everything.

278
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,600
We didn't pass this time, 
but we'll try again in three years.

279
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,770
I see. That's good.

280
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,740
It's been fun.

281
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,860
Take care.

282
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,500
See you later.

283
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,040
Yeah. See you later.

284
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,500
That was a rather quick goodbye, 
just like with Sein.

285
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,380
And Kraft.

286
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,220
Himmel, you always say quick goodbyes.

287
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,890
You think that's strange?

288
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,140
It doesn't seem like you.

289
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,140
It was just a side job, but we still 
spent two weeks traveling together.

290
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,340
And we drank with him practically every night.

291
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,910
You corrupt priest.

292
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,990
You're right.

293
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,290
<i>And you alright</i>

294
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,850
But I'm sure we'll run into each other again 
if we continue traveling.

295
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,790
<i>Can you hear me</i>

296
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,670
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

297
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,930
Tearful goodbyes aren't our style.

298
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,910
<i>Crying excessively</i>

299
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,180
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

300
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,930
After all, it would be embarrassing 
when we met again.

301
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,220
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

302
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,940
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

303
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,690
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

304
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,360
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

305
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,910
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

306
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,950
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

307
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,710
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

308
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,710
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

309
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,630
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

310
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,640
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

311
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,400
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

312
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,360
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

313
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,280
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

314
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,450
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

315
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,120
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

316
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,040
<i>for you to come back home</i>

317
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,600
It would be embarrassing when we met again.

318
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,950
What does that mean?

319
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Episode 28: It Would Be Embarrassing When We Met Again
