1
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,410
Hey, Sein!

2
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,500
That mage said they'd take our photo.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,460
A photo? What's that?

4
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,430
Don't worry about it. Come on.

5
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,350
This is the start of our legend!

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,020
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

7
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,440
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

8
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,360
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,990
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

10
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,320
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

11
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,660
<i>Across this land</i>

12
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,990
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

13
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,450
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

14
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:54,210
Beyond Journey's End

15
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,760
<i>The story ends</i>

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,260
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

17
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,100
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,760
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,270
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

20
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,440
<i>Makes people forget</i>

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,230
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

22
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,020
<i>Begin to rust</i>

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,860
<i>Just the same</i>

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,150
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,490
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

26
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,370
<i>And they live on</i>

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,910
<i>We chose the same path</i>

28
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,040
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,580
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,840
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,210
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

32
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,300
<i>Even now</i>

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,670
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

34
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,220
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

35
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,890
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,030
Episode 16: Long-Lived Friends

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,030
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Klar region, located in the northern lands

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,060
Is he really a strong warrior?

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,420
He's a dwarf who's protected the village 
we're heading to for almost 400 years.

40
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,350
What's the life expectancy of dwarves?

41
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,420
About 300 years.

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,750
His name is Old Man Voll.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,670
He's a long-lived friend of mine.

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,240
I want to chat with him before he dies.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,150
That's not funny.

46
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,550
But it's true that there aren't many people 
who can talk about the past with you.

47
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,260
Perhaps a detour like this one 
isn't so bad once in a while.

48
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,790
Maybe I'll stay for a decade or so.

49
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,740
We're staying one week at most.

50
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,230
That's the village?

51
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,210
Old Man Voll.

52
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,430
It's been a while.

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,340
Well? Doesn't he seem cool, 
like an old, seasoned warrior?

54
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,320
He's way beyond old.

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,890
Remind me. Who are you?

56
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,380
He's totally decrepit.

57
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,370
It's me, Frieren.

58
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,820
Ah, yes.

59
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,390
You're still pretending to be senile?

60
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,770
Huh?

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,970
Most deaths in battle 
are due to carelessness.

62
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,100
It's the greatest weakness 
of both demons and people.

63
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,110
Can't stand, can you?

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,990
Even the most experienced warriors 
can easily suffer fatal injuries

65
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,320
if they're not attempting 
to defend themselves.

66
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,030
If I'd drawn my sword then, 
you'd be short one leg.

67
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,640
Your strategies are as underhanded as ever.

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,010
Frieren.

69
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,360
You are welcome here. Make yourself at home.

70
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,990
Wait, Frieren.

71
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,330
I can't walk.

72
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,640
Stark, train with him while you're here.

73
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Okay.

74
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,950
He's one heck of an old man.

75
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,560
You're welcome to use this firewood.

76
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,260
I'd like to stay here for a decade. 
Find us some work.

77
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,450
Ms. Frieren, we're only 
staying up to one week.

78
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,810
Okay, fine.

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,170
It's a small village.

80
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,520
No one else would take the job, 
so I appreciate it.

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,490
It's not like we have anything else to do.

82
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,920
Anyway, I had no idea 
Old Man Voll had friends.

83
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,200
I've never seen him converse 
so happily before.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,750
He's a senile old man.

85
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,710
Normally he struggles 
to hold a conversation.

86
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,660
He's protected the village from monsters and 
demons for years, but nobody knows why.

87
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,180
He's like our protective deity.

88
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,570
He's been alone this whole time.

89
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,510
A week flies by, doesn't it?

90
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,260
How is Stark?

91
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,750
Humans develop quickly.

92
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,350
He's improved a fair bit.

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,550
I see.

94
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,200
I had fun, Old Man Voll.

95
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,460
I'm really grateful to you now.

96
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,910
You're the reason I got to know 
Himmel and the others.

97
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,920
Old Man Voll, why do you 
defend this village?

98
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,910
It's ancient history now.

99
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,130
It doesn't matter.

100
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,620
People don't risk their lives 
for things that don't matter.

101
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm just defending the village my wife loved.

102
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,190
She was a human.

103
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm merely keeping the promise 
I made a long time ago.

104
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,230
But I won't say more on the subject.

105
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:39,440
I couldn't adequately describe 
her face, or voice, or eyes.

106
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,870
This is my memory alone.

107
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,180
It's silly, isn't it?

108
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,910
I've been keeping a promise 
I made to a dead woman.

109
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,590
You're right.

110
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:03,840
But I'm sure she's glad 
you're keeping your promise.

111
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,450
Himmel, you're a good hero.

112
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm sure you'll defeat the Demon King.

113
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:21,750
My wife wished to see the era of peace that 
comes after the defeat of the Demon King.

114
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,010
I'll carry the memory of the great 
hero Himmel into the future.

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,200
I appreciate it, but you 
don't have to do that.

116
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,420
I have Frieren and Eisen in my party.

117
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,520
I won't live as long as an elf.

118
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,520
Then it'll be Frieren's job.

119
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,300
She'll carry our memory into the future.

120
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,030
Right?

121
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,270
Fine, I guess.

122
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,880
I see.

123
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,920
You've been blessed with good companions.

124
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,410
Later, I'll have to show you

125
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,710
the collection of handsome poses 
I came up with.

126
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,180
Actually, maybe I won't remember you.

127
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,380
I probably didn't need that collection 
of handsome poses after all.

128
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,710
I wasted my memory.

129
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,810
Do you remember that hero's face?

130
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,340
Of course I do.

131
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,910
And his voice?

132
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,230
Don't insult me.

133
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,020
I remember everything.

134
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,980
Himmel is the reason I decided 
I'd get to know people.

135
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,120
Like your reason for defending this village,

136
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,910
it's important to me.

137
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,430
I see. A reason, huh?

138
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,470
I can't remember anymore.

139
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,970
Not her face, nor her voice, nor her eyes.

140
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,340
But I continue defending this village 
for an important something.

141
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,300
You're quite the jokester, Old Man Voll.

142
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,830
By the way, where are you headed?

143
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,840
We're heading to Aureole, 
the land where souls rest.

144
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,030
Where is that?

145
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,490
Ende, where the Demon King's castle is.

146
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,280
I see.

147
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,070
So you're finally off 
to defeat the Demon King.

148
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,760
I hope that brings peace to the land.

149
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,190
Old Man Voll, the Demon King is...

150
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,090
What is it?

151
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,440
I'll carry your memory into the future, too.

152
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,260
I wouldn't mind that.

153
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,650
I'm glad I got to see you 
at the end of my life.

154
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,080
You said the same thing eighty years ago.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,360
Goodbye, Old Man Voll. Take care.

156
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,240
Frieren.

157
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,530
I dreamed of my wife.

158
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,260
I see.

159
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,380
Maybe it's because you and I 
reminisced about the past.

160
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,470
See you later.

161
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,520
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
on Rohr Road, located in the northern lands

162
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,300
Were you asking him something?

163
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm looking for someone.

164
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,790
You remember why I'm on 
this journey, don't you?

165
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,660
Isn't it to travel with a sexy older woman?

166
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,670
That's important, too.

167
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,670
But this is the goal of my journey.

168
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,300
To reunite with my friend 
who departed ten years ago.

169
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,320
Oh, right.

170
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,570
A photo? You don't see those often.

171
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,140
It was taken by a mage who visited 
my village a long time ago.

172
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,520
Have you figured out where he went?

173
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,000
We've been traveling along major 
roads in the northern lands.

174
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,940
Along the way, we've met 
people who have seen him.

175
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,170
We can probably keep heading north.

176
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
That was ten years ago, right?

177
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,890
I'm surprised anyone remembers seeing him.

178
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,950
He has a unique name.

179
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,990
It leaves a strong impression.

180
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,210
What's his name?

181
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,440
Gorilla Warrior.

182
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,210
Yeah, okay.

183
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,850
So what's his real name?

184
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,340
His real name?

185
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,310
Are you sure you guys were best friends?

186
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,930
Everyone in the village always 
called him Gorilla Warrior.

187
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,730
Actually, he made them call him that.

188
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,610
How does that even happen?

189
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,830
By the way, I'm Goatee Priest.

190
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,110
No one asked.

191
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,770
Did people call you that even 
before you could grow a goatee?

192
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,820
Are we still talking about this?

193
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,770
Either way, it's good enough if they 
recognize the name Gorilla Warrior.

194
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,390
He'd definitely be calling himself that.

195
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,390
Sounds like a weird guy.

196
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,770
Yeah. He's a weird guy.

197
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,090
Once we cross this canyon 
and walk for about a week,

198
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,910
we'll finally be in the 
magical city of Äußerst.

199
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,150
This really has been a long journey.

200
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,880
What are you looking at me for?

201
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,510
I didn't do anything wrong this time.

202
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,700
Can we stop by a village first?

203
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,040
The road branches here.

204
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,210
Sure. We'd like to rest, too.

205
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,220
Ten years ago, did someone who called 
himself "Gorilla" come this way?

206
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,490
That's a wild question.

207
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,150
Ah, you must mean Mr. Gorilla Warrior.

208
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,690
Wow, he knows who that is.

209
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,060
I remember him, since he 
left a strong impression.

210
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,300
He defeated a monster that 
appeared near the village.

211
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,630
Do you know which way he headed after that?

212
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,580
I'm not sure...

213
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,290
Oh!

214
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,350
Mr. Gorilla seemed close with the stubborn 
old woman who lives on the plateau.

215
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,020
You should ask her.

216
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,650
"Stubborn old woman"? 
That's quite the nickname.

217
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,690
I'm a stubborn old woman, you see.

218
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm not telling you for free.

219
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,850
She even calls herself stubborn.

220
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,430
What should we do?

221
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,450
You'll perform several tasks for me.

222
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:52,870
First, deliver this letter to Nagel, 
a blacksmith in the neighboring town.

223
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,330
It's just a simple errand.

224
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,080
It reminds me of my journey with Himmel.

225
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,830
You did things like this?

226
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,350
Helping people by running errands 
was a daily occurrence.

227
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:13,750
And it always turned into troublesome 
searches or monster hunts.

228
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,520
Don't jinx us.

229
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,220
In any case, let's do what we can 
to get her to open up to us.

230
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,040
This old woman just refuses to open up.

231
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,880
They don't call her stubborn for nothing.

232
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:00,000
Sorry. Himmel or Heiter could've 
gotten her to open up in half a day.

233
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,590
But our party only has 
socially awkward members.

234
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,000
This is the last one.

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,520
Polish the heroes' statue in the canyon.

236
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,880
Come with me. I'll show you the way.

237
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,860
What heroes' statue?

238
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,420
It's a stone statue of the heroes said 
to have saved the world a long time ago.

239
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,030
That's all I know.

240
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,010
They're forgotten heroes. 
No one even knows their names.

241
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,600
The village has been looking 
after it for generations.

242
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,590
Forgotten heroes, huh?

243
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,800
By the way, you're Goatee Priest, 
aren't you?

244
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,940
How'd you know?

245
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,700
We're here.

246
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,680
A priest and a warrior.

247
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,230
It's pretty old.

248
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,270
They kind of look like Mr. Sein 
and Mr. Gorilla.

249
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,050
I think I recognize the warrior.

250
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
It's Kraft.

251
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,800
You're right.

252
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,960
It looks just like him.

253
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,550
Shall we get started?

254
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,150
Sein?

255
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,480
I see.

256
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,790
So this person's name is Kraft.

257
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,420
What about this one?

258
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,470
I don't know.

259
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,800
I see.

260
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,600
What's this statue?

261
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,590
Don't they look just like us?

262
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,530
According to the chief, 
they're ancient heroes.

263
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,000
But nobody even remembers their names.

264
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,820
We won't end up like that.

265
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,990
I refuse to be forgotten.

266
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,310
I'm going to become 
an unforgettable hero like Himmel.

267
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,810
Even the greatest heroes 
are forgotten someday.

268
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,010
Even Himmel, who defeated the 
Demon King, will be no exception.

269
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,840
I guess you're right. It's impossible.

270
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,250
You think I could get this big 
if I worked out hard enough?

271
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,040
Gorilla Warrior.

272
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,630
From now on, that's my name.

273
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,790
Why?

274
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,910
If I want to become an unforgettable hero, 
then I need a memorable name.

275
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,570
You're right.

276
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,710
Then your name is Goatee Priest.

277
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,600
That's a great name.

278
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm sure a goatee would look good on you.

279
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,040
We're finally done.

280
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,130
That was a lot of work.

281
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,610
We could've used magic if it 
were a bronze statue.

282
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,040
I asked Gorilla to polish it, too,

283
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,450
but he didn't do as good a job.

284
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,670
His only strength is fighting.

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,940
But his name sure was memorable.

286
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,930
Gorilla talked about you a lot.

287
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,130
He said the two of you would become heroes 
whose names would be remembered forever.

288
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,550
Did you figure out where Gorilla went?

289
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,470
Tür.

290
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,420
It's a trading city in the middle 
of the northern lands.

291
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,770
That's a long ways east from here.

292
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,010
It's in the opposite 
direction from Äußerst.

293
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,060
Yeah.

294
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,890
What am I going to do?

295
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,570
<i>And you alright</i>

296
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,080
<i>Can you hear me</i>

297
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,960
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

298
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,290
<i>Crying excessively</i>

299
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,460
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

300
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,510
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

301
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,220
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

302
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,980
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

303
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,650
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

304
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,190
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

305
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,240
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

306
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,990
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

307
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,080
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

308
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,920
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

309
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,930
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

310
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

311
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

312
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,340
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

313
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:48,690
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

314
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,370
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

315
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,380
<i>for you to come back home</i>

316
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,870
Join me in the other room, one at a time.

317
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,450
Make yourselves at home.

318
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,870
Yeah, it's all my fault.

319
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,790
Because mediating is a priest's job.

320
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,800
The medicine is ready.

321
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,800
You're embarrassing me.

322
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm pretty handsome when 
I'm being considerate, aren't I?

323
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,570
I guess it's not so bad.

324
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,990
Episode 17
Take Care

325
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,910
Take care, then.
