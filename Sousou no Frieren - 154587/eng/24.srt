1
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:09,003
No wonder the Ruins of the King's Tomb
has been impregnable.

2
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:14,071
I certainly didn't expect
anything like this.

3
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:24,038
Denken,

4
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,088
can you deal with that, too?

5
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:34,095
The only thing I can say is that...

6
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:40,068
If this wasn't an exam,
I would have already broken my bottle.

7
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:21,089
FRIEREN: BEYOND JOURNEY'S END

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
EPISODE 24: A PERFECT REPLICA

9
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,092
We refer to the lord of that dungeon

10
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:35,001
as Spiegel, the Water-Mirror Demon.

11
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:41,056
It's a monster from a mythical era
that appears in Ewig the Sage's heroic tales.

12
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:48,008
It is believed that Spiegel can read
the memories of those who enter the dungeon

13
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:52,089
and create clones of its targets.

14
00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:00,033
There are similar monsters
that exist today like the Einsam,

15
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:04,037
but what the Spiegel produces
isn't some illusion.

16
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:06,037
They're perfect physical clones

17
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:09,067
with the original's strength, mana,
and even techniques.

18
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:14,088
That is why the Ruins of the King's Tomb
remain unmapped to this day.

19
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:19,003
Why did Sense choose
this dungeon as the exam location?

20
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:23,002
The clones are equal opponents.

21
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,064
In order to defeat them
without casualties,

22
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:29,031
one would need to calmly analyze
their own selves and work with others.

23
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:37,057
A very fitting exam
from a pacifist like her.

24
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:47,046
This is bad.

25
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,042
We must fall back for now.

26
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:59,076
Denken!

27
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:02,076
Now then...

28
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,039
What must we do here?

29
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:15,023
A dead end, huh?

30
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,069
Looks like we've been cornered.

31
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,008
Glasses Boy.

32
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:35,017
I'd like to ask for your opinion as
an expert in duplication magic. Can I?

33
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:39,047
How many times must I remind you
that my name is Land?

34
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:42,043
You can ask, though.

35
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:51,097
How much do you think
that clone perfectly copied me?

36
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:55,048
You know, Übel,

37
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:58,048
you still talk a lot
even during battle, right?

38
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,045
As if you'd die if you ever shut up.

39
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,007
Looks like you've been
observing me well.

40
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:09,005
Yeah, I might actually die if I did that.

41
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:14,006
Yet that thing is so quiet.

42
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:20,077
Does that mean it didn't copy
my memory or personality?

43
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,006
No, it probably just can't talk.

44
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,072
When it first attacked me,

45
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,085
it snatched my escape golem
from my pocket.

46
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,003
I see. It is indeed
what I would've done.

47
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,074
It also has knowledge about us.

48
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:50,029
The reason it hasn't given chase
despite cornering us

49
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:53,067
is because it's wary
of your Sorganeel spell.

50
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:59,026
Or maybe because
it likes toying with its prey.

51
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:03,001
That's not funny.

52
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,076
You're losing a lot of blood.

53
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,098
At this rate, you won't last long,
Glasses Boy.

54
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,069
So it seems.

55
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:18,077
Can I ask you one last thing?

56
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:23,002
Are you the real Glasses Boy?

57
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,002
Who knows? Can't say.

58
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:37,071
Use my bottle.

59
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,022
That is for your own survival.

60
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:46,097
Is that so?

61
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:51,015
All right then.
Wait here for a bit, Glasses Boy.

62
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,085
I'll go get your bottle back.

63
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,051
Hey, wait—

64
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:06,024
Right, of course it would
close the distance.

65
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:09,008
The requirement for activating Sorganeel

66
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,066
is to have the target's
entire body in sight.

67
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:18,058
The first one to misjudge
the distance will lose.

68
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:27,047
If our abilities are equal, then this battle
will mostly be decided by luck.

69
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,089
I've never been good with luck,

70
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:34,043
so I never liked fights
where luck is a deciding factor.

71
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:41,036
That's why I never thought
about fighting myself.

72
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,086
Good grief, I really do have
a death wish, don't I?

73
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,058
See? I really am unlucky.

74
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:59,025
This is why I hate this thing.

75
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:02,063
That said,

76
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:07,038
seems like your luck
is even worse than mine.

77
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:11,051
That was faster than expected,
Glasses Boy.

78
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:26,021
Huh, so even the bottle was fake.

79
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:36,034
Übel.

80
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:40,003
You must've already known
the dying me was just a clone.

81
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,084
So why did you do
such a dangerous thing?

82
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:46,058
Maybe because I'm sure
you would come to save me.

83
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,072
Do I seem like such
a nice guy to you?

84
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,026
No, not at all.

85
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:56,027
In fact, it doesn't matter
if you are nice or not.

86
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:02,043
You see, you didn't try
to take my bottle.

87
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:09,049
That's because you don't want to let
somebody die from your action, right?

88
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:15,063
That's why I created a situation
where I would die because of you.

89
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,046
Thank you, Glasses Boy.

90
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,063
I feel like I learned
something new about you.

91
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,075
Is that so? Good for you then.

92
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,047
Will you be able to sympathize
with me soon?

93
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:32,083
Hmm, I think that's still
going to take some time.

94
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:42,034
We should be really close
to the innermost depth.

95
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:47,015
Mistress Frieren,
there's a stairway over there.

96
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:51,002
Fern.

97
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,053
Can I double-check the map?

98
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,083
I believe we already explored
every corner of this floor.

99
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:13,055
There's a secret room behind this wall.

100
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,039
I'm sure there's a treasure in it.

101
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,052
Judging from how it feels,

102
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:23,094
it might even have
a rare grimoire in it.

103
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:29,028
But I couldn't see anything
resembling an entrance.

104
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,019
Indeed.

105
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,053
But structurally speaking,

106
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,057
there's no mistake
that there's a room here...

107
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:35,004
This is amazing, Mistress Frieren.

108
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:46,031
This seems to depict
the achievements of the buried king.

109
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:53,003
I've never seen a mural from the Unified
Dynasty era this well preserved.

110
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,078
This is a valuable discovery.

111
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,046
What a magnificent view.

112
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:19,063
Things really are going
as smoothly as they possibly can.

113
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:23,035
Maybe things will keep going smoothly
and we'll pass the exam before we know it.

114
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,049
Maybe.

115
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,061
What's wrong?
Why are you all gathered here?

116
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,024
Judging from the structure,

117
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:40,016
we should reach the depths once
we get past the hall beyond this door.

118
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:41,074
And?

119
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:46,025
That thing has been in there
for half a day.

120
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,051
It's finally getting interesting.

121
00:12:57,021 --> 00:13:00,005
This is how dungeon raids should be.

122
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,031
A perfect clone, huh?

123
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:12,052
It does indeed seem to have
the same strength as me.

124
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:18,032
We cannot reach the depths
unless we deal with that clone.

125
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,007
Do you have any ideas?

126
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,003
Let's see...

127
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:27,053
If that thing is a perfect replica of me,

128
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:31,021
then the weakness should be
the same as any living mage.

129
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,063
In order to defeat a stronger mage,

130
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,096
we need to use restraining magic
or hypnosis magic.

131
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:41,009
I'm resistant to both, though.

132
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:45,022
But it might be able to create an opening,
no matter how small it is.

133
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:49,077
That should be enough for you
to defeat that thing.

134
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,073
Methode.

135
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,071
You're good at those tricks, right?

136
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:58,036
I wouldn't say I'm good, but...

137
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:02,037
Then, excuse me.

138
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,005
How interesting.

139
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,046
The restraining spell
doesn't work on her.

140
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,063
Smells nice.

141
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,051
It usually would work as long as
there isn't a big difference in mana.

142
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:25,001
Miss Frieren,
please look into my eyes now.

143
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:32,007
Seems like hypnosis magic
isn't working either.

144
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:37,006
I can't break through
her mental defense.

145
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,009
Oh my.

146
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,076
So she really is resistant to both.

147
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:47,087
The structure of her mental defense
may be complex and strong,

148
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,054
but it seems to be a very old technique.

149
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:55,096
An expert in mental magic
might be able to find a vulnerability.

150
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:58,071
Do you know any of that
among the participants?

151
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:06,014
Second-class mage Edel
might have a chance.

152
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:10,089
That said, unlike me, her combat
capabilities are pretty much non-existent,

153
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,089
so I'm not sure
if she can make it here.

154
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,006
And to begin with,

155
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:22,036
hypnosis magic only works
if the target has a mind to affect.

156
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,041
I am not certain whether the clone
has replicated that as well.

157
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:32,016
I see we lack many
important information.

158
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,017
Edel, what do you think that is?

159
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,051
Dunno.

160
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:52,018
But it definitely has powers
equal to the first-class mage Sense.

161
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:56,048
We can only conceal our mana
and hide for so long.

162
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:58,006
Our only choice is to fight it.

163
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:01,015
Do you think you can defeat it, Blei?

164
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,082
My lack of combat capability aside,

165
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:07,032
both you and Dünste can't fight
properly inside this dungeon.

166
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:12,008
Modern magic is not suited
for dungeon battles to begin with.

167
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,083
To think the fact that
most dungeons have been raided

168
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,029
during the Demon King's reign
would bite us here.

169
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,009
We've spent too many resources focusing
on creating powerful defensive spells.

170
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:29,059
As a result, more offensive spells
now rely on natural elements.

171
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,022
Rather than creating
something from nothing,

172
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:41,006
it's more mana-efficient to manipulate
or change nearby elements instead.

173
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:45,082
But that thing is really good
in that regard.

174
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:50,045
Its hair is infused
with multiple layers of magic.

175
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:56,018
You might as well assume it has
countless ways to fight in this dungeon.

176
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,096
From how I see it, there is
no way to win against it.

177
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:06,021
The world of magic
is the world of imagination.

178
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:13,097
The fact that it can freely control hairs,
which may as well be countless strings

179
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:18,073
means she can imagine far better
than normal humans.

180
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:22,044
In other words, she's a much
stronger mage than we are.

181
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:27,025
To be honest, I think it's a miracle
that we've managed to escape so far.

182
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:31,002
We already did our best.

183
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:35,008
We're not even fighters
to begin with.

184
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:37,012
This might be the time for us to give up.

185
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:42,017
To be honest, I'm scared
and I want to go home already.

186
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:46,084
Edel, won't your voice reach it?

187
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:51,068
Hypnosis magic certainly has been
the business of our family,

188
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:56,085
but I doubt I can make
that thing follow a high-level order.

189
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:02,035
At best, I could probably make it
kneel to give us an opening.

190
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:06,019
But even then, I will still need to
make eye contact and call out to it.

191
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,011
So it's not impossible, then?

192
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:12,036
Only if it has a mind, that is.

193
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:14,099
How long do we need to hold it off?

194
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,099
Fifteen seconds.

195
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,087
Or rather, that's probably
all you can manage.

196
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,037
What do you mean?

197
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:28,092
You're about to find out.

198
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,009
Put defensive spells in all directions.

199
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,079
Huh?

200
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:51,084
In modern magic battles, there are
two ways to overcome a defensive spell.

201
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:54,036
Either you smash it
with overwhelming mass,

202
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:57,028
or you try to slip past
with techniques.

203
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:01,016
Those who attack in numbers
tend to do the latter.

204
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,066
Call me surprised.

205
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,079
I didn't think it could do both.

206
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,003
They weigh like huge boulders.

207
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:16,093
I thought the all-direction defensive
spell would last for 15 seconds,

208
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:20,085
but it was actually broken much sooner.

209
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:24,048
But we've made eye contact.

210
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:28,099
The tendencies of superior mages to make sure
to keep their enemies in clear sight.

211
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:31,022
Kneel!

212
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:42,004
I see. I understand it now.

213
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,029
It doesn't have a mind.

214
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,029
It's just imitating the original's mind,
down to the details.

215
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:53,051
It's impossible for us to win.

216
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:58,072
Our only choice is to rely
on other stronger mages.

217
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:02,006
Do everything you can to run
and find the ones that can fight.

218
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:05,006
I'm done and giving up,
so I'm going home.

219
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:07,077
I don't want to get hurt anymore.

220
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:17,007
How convenient.
It even ensures my safety.

221
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,007
Let's get away from here, too.

222
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:29,067
Can anyone even make it to the depths
with things like that around?

223
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:31,011
Just like I said,

224
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:35,055
she never has any intention
of letting anyone pass.

225
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:55,025
We have very little information
at the moment.

226
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:58,082
I suggest we prepare for the possibility
that it doesn't have a mind.

227
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:02,044
Though in that case, we'll have to
take it down by brute force.

228
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,014
Can you do that?

229
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,095
Dunno, I'm not sure.

230
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:28,031
Good grief, there's no way
to tell what they're thinking.

231
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:41,095
But we might be a good fit
for each other, as expected.

232
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:53,071
Ehre can easily overwhelm me or Scharf
when it comes to a simple contest of mana.

233
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,089
However,

234
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:09,081
I know how to win a fight.

235
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:20,024
No matter who's the opponent,

236
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:24,032
no matter what the situation.

237
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:29,079
Brute force, huh?

238
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,054
Excuse me, if that is the case,

239
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:39,065
then I might be able
to kill Mistress Frieren.

240
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:42,096
Is that so?

241
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:44,043
Yes.

242
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:46,003
Okay then,

243
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,001
let's come up with a strategy.

244
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:21,086
- Looks like things are mostly done.
- Let's come up with a strategy.

245
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,073
- So you have some information.
- Let's come up with a strategy.

246
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:23,048
- So you have some information.
- Can we cooperate?

247
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,015
- Maybe you should apologize to him.
- Can we cooperate?

248
00:24:24,015 --> 00:24:24,082
- Maybe you should apologize to him.
- How unpleasant.

249
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:26,015
- That thing has no weakness.
- How unpleasant.

250
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,074
- That thing has no weakness.
- You seem to be having fun.

251
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:30,007
EPISODE 25: FATAL VULNERABILITY
This is Frieren's fatal vulnerability.
