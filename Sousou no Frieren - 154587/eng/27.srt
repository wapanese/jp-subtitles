1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,990
The path of the warrior is without end.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,370
You've taken yet another step 
toward mastering its secrets.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,690
There is nothing left for me to teach you.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,620
You say that every time.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,110
Huh? Fern?

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,460
Hmph.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,890
She's pissed? Why?!

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,990
I'm scared...

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,010
<i>You're there like the wind</i>

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,640
<i>Closing your eyes at sunset</i>

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,270
<i>I wonder what's on your mind</i>

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,610
Beyond Journey's End

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,990
<i>With your eyelids open</i>

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,580
<i>Your eyes shone like glass</i>

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,340
<i>It faintly smelled like a sunny day</i>

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,470
<i>Clear up the sky, let flowers bloom</i>

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,680
<i>Bloom and blame it on the sunny sky</i>

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,060
<i>Even the rain, when it stops</i>

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,070
<i>Will make you shine in the sunlight</i>

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,450
<i>Calm the stirring sounds in my heart</i>

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,490
<i>We go like the sunny wind</i>

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,920
<i>Go on and fly over that cloud</i>

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,750
<i>Further and further away</i>

24
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,010
Episode 27: An Era of Humans

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,390
Ms. Frieren and I had an argument.

26
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,010
Again? You've been arguing a lot recently, 
don't you think?

27
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,030
Isn't the third test the final one?

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,020
This is hardly the time to be squabbling.

29
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,150
She was truly awful this time.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,390
My staff broke in battle 
in the Ruins of the King's Tomb,

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,660
so I told Ms. Frieren 
I wanted to get it repaired.

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,220
She told me it'd be better to buy 
a new staff than to repair my old one.

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,800
You mean that staff, don't you?

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,140
She said it couldn't be repaired 
since it was already in pieces.

35
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,400
Still, Mr. Heiter gave me that staff.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,570
It's been with me ever since I was little.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,030
We're talking about Frieren, though. 
I doubt she meant any harm.

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,010
At the very least, I never even 
would have thought of throwing it away.

39
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,410
Three years until the next 
first-class mage exam, huh?

40
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,270
Three years is a long time.

41
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,530
Just make fun of me like you always do.

42
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,370
Do you want me to?

43
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,900
No.

44
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,430
In that case, Little Miss Lawine, 
shall I pat your head?

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,570
What? You wanna fight?

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,180
Hurry up.

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,130
You're in really rough shape.

48
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,570
Hey, it's Frieren.

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,030
What's with the bag?

50
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,910
Hey, how long are you going 
to hang around here?

51
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,920
I failed the test. There's nothing 
keeping us together anymore.

52
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,560
You're interfering with my business. 
Get out of here.

53
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm here as a customer.

54
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,810
Then hurry up and choose something.

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,570
You can have some.

56
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,380
I don't want any.

57
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,820
You were unlucky this time.

58
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,270
You got the short end of the stick.

59
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,330
It could've happened to 
anyone in that position.

60
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,570
A loss is a loss. I wasn't strong enough.

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,590
Either way, don't bring that up again.

62
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,080
I may seem fine, but I'm actually 
in a terrible mood right now.

63
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,330
But you opened your shop regardless.

64
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,180
Denken, you may not realize this,

65
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,980
but people have to work to make a living 
no matter how foul their mood.

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,970
Is that right?

67
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,990
Maybe it's for the best 
that I'm the one who failed.

68
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,980
The first-class mage exam 
is held once every three years.

69
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,610
A decrepit old man like you might not 
be around three years from now.

70
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,120
You're right.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,570
Don't agree with me.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Richter, you truly are an insolent youngster.

73
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,010
You mock authority

74
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,330
and have no qualms about mistreating 
the weak in order to achieve your goals.

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,970
Your behavior is hardly praiseworthy.

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,790
And yet I feel no hatred for you at all,

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,600
probably because I was once 
an insolent youngster too.

78
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,250
And now, I'm an imperial mage.

79
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,360
What are you trying to say?

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm telling you not to be so discouraged.

81
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,020
Three years from now, you'll be 
far stronger than you are today.

82
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,790
Laufen, let's go.

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,230
Sorry. The old man's not good with people.

84
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,470
What's your relationship with Denken, exactly?

85
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,140
Damn it, old man.

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,760
He didn't buy anything after all.

87
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,910
Is today my unlucky day or something?

88
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:43,100
I asked around town and was told this shop 
can fix any staff, no matter how broken.

89
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,130
Show me.

90
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,860
What is this broken pile of scrapwood? 
Don't tell me this is meant to be a staff.

91
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm not a trash disposal service, you know.

92
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,430
It's not trash.

93
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,770
Probably.

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,310
My mood was starting to improve, 
but because of you, I feel terrible again.

95
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,540
I have the right to choose 
which jobs I work on.

96
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,410
You should give up on this staff.

97
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,810
I see.

98
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,130
If you can't do it, then never mind.

99
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,330
Frieren, you really get on my nerves.

100
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,090
When did I say I couldn't do it?

101
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,490
Can you finish today?

102
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,400
I want it to be repaired 
in time for the third test.

103
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,280
Don't be ridiculous.

104
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,580
Frieren.

105
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,410
What?

106
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,050
I'm sorry for calling it trash.

107
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,810
It's a good, well-maintained staff.

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,880
Someone must've taken really good care of it.

109
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,660
Fern, let's head back already.

110
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,890
Ms. Frieren doesn't understand me at all.

111
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,460
I don't understand you either.

112
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,970
Stop! Don't take it out on me!

113
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,240
What matters is that she 
<i>tries</i> to understand you.

114
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,930
I think Frieren is doing her best.

115
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,510
You're Frieren's kid.

116
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,390
Her student, right?

117
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,800
Am I wrong?

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,380
No, that's right.

119
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,390
Either way, the second test 
only ended yesterday,

120
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,880
but I had another terrible day 
because of your master.

121
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,280
I would've made more profit 
if you'd just bought a new one.

122
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,880
Take good care of it.

123
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,530
My staff.

124
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,540
Frieren struggles to understand emotions.

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,490
I'm sure it will cause 
difficulties and disagreements.

126
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,740
But there is one good thing about it.

127
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,730
Frieren will worry and care 
about you just as much.

128
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,470
Few masters are better than her.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,110
Ms. Frieren, about yesterday…

130
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,110
What?

131
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,680
Actually, never mind.

132
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,860
I see.

133
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,130
The third test will now begin.

134
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,620
Do you know why I came 
all the way here, Sense?

135
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,010
Nothing to say, huh?

136
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,880
You always remain silent
in troublesome situations.

137
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,100
Twelve test-takers passed the second test.

138
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,560
It's an anomaly. It's too many.

139
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,690
I have no problem with a test that requires 
all participants to work together,

140
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,070
as the current first-class mages 
lack cooperativeness.

141
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,650
Forgive us.

142
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,200
But there is one among the test-takers 
who is far too powerful.

143
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,570
You mean Ms. Frieren.

144
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,810
Because of her, many have passed 
despite lacking the requisite strength.

145
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,510
A typical third test would kill all of them.

146
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,720
Sense, that's hardly what you want,

147
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,310
and not even I wish to see 
such pointless deaths.

148
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,100
Ms. Serie.

149
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,450
There's no need to apologize. 
It's all Frieren's fault.

150
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,580
An anomaly calls for an anomaly.

151
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,800
I will proctor the third test.

152
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,570
It will be a peaceful selection.

153
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,650
In past years, you've proctored the test.

154
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,870
You don't object, do you, Lernen?

155
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,380
Your willfulness is nothing new, Ms. Serie.

156
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,810
Besides, I could not 
possibly test Ms. Frieren.

157
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,910
I could tell at a glance that 
she's suppressing her own mana.

158
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,670
Her mana is tremendous, equal to yours.

159
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,550
Falsch, did you notice?

160
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,360
No, I have no idea 
what he's talking about.

161
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,340
I observed her mana myself 
at the testing area.

162
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,350
It didn't seem to me like 
she was suppressing it.

163
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,690
I observed none of the typical fluctuations.

164
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,440
No living creature with mana 
can conceal these fluctuations.

165
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,700
Even if it were possible, it would take 
an extraordinary amount of time to master.

166
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,080
It would hardly be a practical skill.

167
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,690
Frieren has devoted her life 
to mastering that impractical skill

168
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,690
in order to deceive demons.

169
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,040
Demons are far more sensitive 
to mana than us humanoids.

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,850
Without innate talent, it takes more than 
a century or two of practice to fool them.

171
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,460
It truly is a waste of time.

172
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,130
You'd become far more powerful devoting 
your efforts to training something else.

173
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,970
It's incredibly inefficient.

174
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,600
But that inefficiency 
breeds weakness in others.

175
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,030
In a battle between experienced mages,

176
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,370
miscalculating your opponent's mana 
can lead directly to death.

177
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,340
Frieren is in fact relatively 
unskilled for her age,

178
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,950
and yet she's defeated demons.

179
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,110
Her mana control is simply that refined.

180
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,060
As far as I knew, only the Demon King 
was able to see through it at first glance.

181
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,840
That is, until this moment, Lernen.

182
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,410
It was a coincidence. I just happened 
to see a minor fluctuation.

183
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,110
That's all.

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,740
Ever modest and dependable.

185
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,580
It's been more than half a century since 
you became the first first-class mage.

186
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,050
But you're still the same timid boy.

187
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,100
That's my only disappointment.

188
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,410
You've achieved this level, and yet 
you don't have much longer to live.

189
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,670
I doubt you'll ever get the 
chance to fight Frieren,

190
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,340
even if it's a battle you could win.

191
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,100
I shouldn't take on human students.

192
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,580
It's truly disappointing.

193
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:36,770
In the end, that boy never saw 
the fluctuations in my mana either.

194
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,300
The third test will be an interview 
with Serie the Great Mage.

195
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,610
So that's how it's going to be.

196
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,020
You will be called one at a time 
when she is ready for you.

197
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,020
Serie intends to fail us both.

198
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,100
Please wait here until then.

199
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,000
You know her?

200
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,350
From a long time ago.

201
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,350
She probably intends to choose who passes 
based on her intuition.

202
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,080
But Serie's intuition is always right.

203
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,380
I still haven't become the mage 
Serie wishes I were.

204
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,510
Excuse me…

205
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,900
You fail. Now leave.

206
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,650
May I ask why?

207
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:55,160
My mana frightens you. 
You know the limits of your own abilities.

208
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,900
You can't imagine yourself 
as a first-class mage, can you?

209
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,900
In the world of magic, that which 
can't be visualized cannot be.

210
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,780
It's the most fundamental principle. 
Now leave.

211
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,740
Fail.

212
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,040
Fail.

213
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,320
Fail.

214
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
Fail.

215
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,190
Frieren, you can't imagine yourself 
as a first-class mage either,

216
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,690
but for a different reason 
from the rest of the test-takers.

217
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,060
You don't believe I'd ever let you pass.

218
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,570
It's true, isn't it?

219
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,100
I'll give you one chance. 
Tell me your favorite spell.

220
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,570
A spell to create a field of flowers.

221
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,570
That's the spell Flamme taught you.

222
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,840
How truly useless.

223
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,260
You fail.

224
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,040
Uh-huh.

225
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,980
You won't even stand your ground 
when I mock you?

226
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,990
I find it hard to believe a mage 
like you defeated the Demon King.

227
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,970
I didn't do it alone.

228
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,830
Himmel, Eisen, Heiter, and me.

229
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,530
If any one of us hadn't been there, 
we couldn't have won.

230
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,350
So you were blessed with strong allies.

231
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,260
You were lucky.

232
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,020
That's right. I was lucky.

233
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,550
Himmel, why did you recruit me?

234
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,010
Because I was looking for a powerful mage.

235
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,820
There are plenty of powerful mages 
in the royal capital.

236
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,020
It didn't have to be me.

237
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,510
I wanted you.

238
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,020
Why?

239
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:54,840
Frieren, you may not remember, 
but I once met you a long time ago.

240
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,450
Yeah, I don't remember that at all.

241
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,810
I know you don't.

242
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,650
When I was a child, I got lost 
while gathering herbs in the forest.

243
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,930
Wandering the woods for hours at night,

244
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,870
I experienced loneliness 
for the first time in my life.

245
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,170
I thought I'd never be able 
to return to my village.

246
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,760
That was when a lone elf pointed me 
in the direction of the village.

247
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:30,050
All she did was show me which way it was. 
She spoke not a word of encouragement.

248
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,730
To the eyes of a child, 
she seemed so cold-hearted.

249
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,030
Perhaps she sensed my unease, 
or perhaps it was on a whim...

250
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,220
You showed me a spell 
to create a field of flowers.

251
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,810
I thought it was beautiful.

252
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,980
For the first time in my life, 
I thought magic was beautiful.

253
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,110
It's probably just a coincidence,

254
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,520
but it was that useless spell 
my master taught me

255
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,620
that brought me and my companions together.

256
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,870
Also, Serie, I'm sure you intend 
to fail Fern as well,

257
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,240
but I doubt you'll be able to.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,040
She will exceed your expectations.

259
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,540
The era of humans has arrived.

260
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,250
<i>Exceed my expectations? Hardly.</i>

261
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,640
<i>The sight of my mana has her frozen in place.</i>

262
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,650
<i>She's no different from the other test-takers.</i>

263
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,710
Wait. What do you see?

264
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,270
It's fluctuating.

265
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,820
Fern, was it?

266
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,400
Be my student.

267
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,150
What? No.

268
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,510
I'll treat you well.

269
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I can take you to greater heights.

270
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,450
To heights no other mage has ever reached.

271
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,230
Does this affect whether or not I pass?

272
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,600
Perhaps.

273
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,310
I see.

274
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,630
Ms. Serie.

275
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,590
<i>Fern.</i>

276
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm sure Serie will have 
a lot of things to say to you,

277
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,540
but there's no need for you 
to accept her demands.

278
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,260
Just as Serie will fail me 
no matter what I say,

279
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,240
she will pass you no matter what you say.

280
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,020
After all, Serie's intuition is always right.

281
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,560
I am Ms. Frieren's student.

282
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,560
Frieren coached you, didn't she?

283
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,270
I'm not foolish enough 
to overlook a promising mage.

284
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,950
You pass.

285
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,180
Next.

286
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,100
<i>And I'm alright (I'll be alright)</i>

287
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,020
<i>Yeah, I hear you (I care about you)</i>

288
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,610
<i>The wind teases this hair that's longer now</i>

289
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,020
<i>There's meaning in everything</i>

290
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,030
<i>Even the days that came to a halt</i>

291
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:13,660
<i>Now that I finally understand,
I've caught up to you</i>

292
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,450
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

293
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,330
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

294
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

295
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,260
<i>I won't ask to see you, so at least</i>

296
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,020
<i>Let me remember the past, just for today</i>

297
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

298
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,900
<i>No more hesitations, I'd choose the present</i>

299
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,950
<i>Anytime, anywhere, yah (wherever you are)</i>

300
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,580
<i>Anytime, anywhere (smile for me)</i>

301
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,580
<i>I'll be there (close your eyes,
and I'll always be there)</i>

302
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,330
<i>Even if there are no absolutes</i>

303
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,380
<i>I'm always aware of your thoughts</i>

304
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:12,430
<i>Those tears will be alright,
dawn will surely break</i>

305
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby
for you to come back home</i>

306
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,930
Episode 28
It Would Be Embarrassing When We Met Again

307
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,810
See you later.
