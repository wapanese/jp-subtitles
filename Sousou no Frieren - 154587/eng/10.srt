1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,580
Flamme.

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,910
You mean "Master."

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,870
What is it?

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,830
Do you really think it's unfair?

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,720
Frieren, do you remember Basalt's last words?

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,630
No.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,430
Their kind uses words only to deceive humans.

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,180
That's right.

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,480
They're nothing more than monsters 
capable of speech.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,810
That's the true nature of the 
creatures I call demons.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,950
They don't play fair, 
so we must be even more unfair.

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,000
If it allows me to exterminate demonkind, 
then I will gladly embrace this dishonor.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,000
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,420
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,340
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,970
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,300
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,640
<i>Across this land</i>

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,970
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,440
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

21
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:36,200
Beyond Journey's End

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,740
<i>The story ends</i>

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,240
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,080
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,750
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

26
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,250
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,420
<i>Makes people forget</i>

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,210
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

29
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,010
<i>Begin to rust</i>

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,840
<i>Just the same</i>

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,140
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,470
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,350
<i>And they live on</i>

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,890
<i>We chose the same path</i>

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,020
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,560
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,820
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,190
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

39
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,280
<i>Even now</i>

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,660
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,200
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,870
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,010
Episode 10: A Powerful Mage

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,770
<i>The bleeding won't stop.</i>

45
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,890
<i>This is the end.</i>

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,100
Your plan has failed.

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,070
You're right.

48
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,860
But Frieren won't escape unscathed.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,240
She must be fighting Lady Aura by now.

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,120
Previously, we were forced to 
retreat by the party of heroes.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,960
But this time, there are 
no heroes to protect her.

52
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,210
It's true that Frieren is a threat to us,

53
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,880
but she has far less mana than Lady Aura.

54
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,720
If she engages her directly, 
Frieren will lose.

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Then Frieren will win.

56
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,390
She'd never directly engage a demon.

57
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,060
I know she'll trick Aura and kill her.

58
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,070
<i>Nonsense.</i>

59
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,910
<i>Frieren the Slayer has always 
engaged us directly.</i>

60
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,290
<i>Why do I feel like something is wrong?</i>

61
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,960
<i>This girl's mana is weak,</i>

62
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,840
<i>and yet I was overwhelmed by the 
sheer number of her rapid attacks.</i>

63
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,550
<i>But how was she able to do that 
without exhausting her mana?</i>

64
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,060
I understand now. Is that even possible?

65
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,310
So Frieren does the same.

66
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,810
What you've done isn't fair.

67
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,650
You're a disgrace to all mages.

68
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,280
Ms. Frieren knows that better than anyone.

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,250
What a dreadful sight.

70
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,420
Looks like an elf village.

71
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,520
Basalt the Throne,

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,810
a general of the Demon King's army.

73
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,190
He must've led his forces here 
to destroy this village.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,320
Are you the one who killed him? 
You seem nearly dead yourself.

75
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,000
That's a lot of mana.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,460
You must be powerful.

77
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,370
Did you engage the demons directly?

78
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,960
What a fool you are.

79
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,550
Why do people always engage 
their enemies directly?

80
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,090
Run, hide, take your enemies by surprise...

81
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,720
There are plenty of other options.

82
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,310
I'll never understand strong mages.

83
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,480
But you do.

84
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,230
What?

85
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,860
You should understand how I feel...

86
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,950
because you're a far more powerful mage.

87
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
What makes you say that?

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,260
Just a feeling.

89
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,390
What's your name?

90
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,850
What happened to the village?

91
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,690
Its people are dead, down to 
the last woman and child.

92
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,230
I was the strongest, but I still 
couldn't protect them.

93
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,900
You really are a fool.

94
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,280
If I'd been in your shoes, 
I wouldn't have hesitated to run.

95
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,830
Put me down.

96
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,290
No.

97
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,830
You have potential. 
You're going to be my apprentice.

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,710
And you know you wouldn't have survived 
if I hadn't happened upon you.

99
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,050
On top of failing to protect the village, 
you nearly died yourself.

100
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,640
Your death truly would've been in vain.

101
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,640
We're being pursued.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,520
They're stronger than the general you killed.

103
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,950
Interesting creatures, aren't they?

104
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,990
They had every intention 
of catching us off guard

105
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,450
by concealing their mana 
until just before they struck,

106
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,830
but the moment they realized we were mages, 
they stepped out into the open.

107
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,590
They're cunning and they don't play fair,

108
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,300
but every last one of them has a ridiculous 
sense of pride when it comes to magic.

109
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,890
Human mage, leave the elf girl and go.

110
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,020
Will you let me go if I do?

111
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,680
"Kill all the elves."

112
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,020
Those were the Demon King's orders.

113
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,940
Your life matters not to me.

114
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,730
I see.

115
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,160
Frieren, it's true that I'm painfully aware 
of what it's like to be a powerful mage.

116
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,290
I know exactly how these creatures feel, too.

117
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,170
I know the absolute confidence they 
have in the magics they've studied.

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,670
In other words, they're stupidly 
proud and overconfident.

119
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,490
Frieren, unlike you, 
they judged me a weakling.

120
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,160
Though they were exceptional mages, 
their overconfidence cost them their lives.

121
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,210
You hid your strength by controlling 
how much mana you release.

122
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,540
That's right.

123
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,340
Deceive and kill your enemies by allowing 
them to miscalculate your strength.

124
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,470
It's a cowardly and unfair way to fight 
that makes a mockery of magic.

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,610
Your injuries are looking a lot better.

126
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,740
Shall we begin your training?

127
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,500
Flamme.

128
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
You mean "Master."

129
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,460
Demons took everything from me.

130
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,670
Me, too.

131
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,760
I hate them so much that I wish 
I could exterminate every last one.

132
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,010
Me, too.

133
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,890
But I love magic.

134
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,140
So do I.

135
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,900
Which is why only you and I should become 
cowards who make a mockery of magic.

136
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,990
What should I do to train?

137
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,530
Try limiting the mana you release 
to one-tenth of its normal volume.

138
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,790
Impressive. You're controlling it well.

139
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,960
Any elf can do this.

140
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,090
While you do that, we'll work on your 
fundamentals and raise your base mana level.

141
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,130
That's all?

142
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,390
Simple, right?

143
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,520
By the way, how long should 
I keep suppressing my mana?

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,190
It starts to get tiring 
if I do it for too long.

145
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,020
As long as I do.

146
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,440
For life.

147
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,320
You'll spend your entire life fooling demons.

148
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Lügner is dead.

149
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,120
Now all your executioners 
have been eliminated.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,250
You've failed, Aura.

151
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,210
You're right. It's a shame.

152
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,880
But if I can defeat you here, 
then it won't have been for nothing.

153
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,970
In this battle, you've released numerous 
immortal soldiers from my control.

154
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,980
Was it wise to expend so much mana against me?

155
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,190
<i>The Scales of Obedience.</i>

156
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,320
<i>When two souls are placed on the scale,</i>

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,740
<i>whichever has more mana 
forces the other to submit.</i>

158
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:29,040
<i>Aura can only use such a risky spell 
because of her tremendous amount of mana.</i>

159
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,330
<i>Generally speaking,</i>

160
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,500
<i>a person's mana increases in proportion 
with the time spent training.</i>

161
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,340
<i>I can feel it in the mana pouring off Aura.</i>

162
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,510
<i>She's a great demon who has lived 
for over five hundred years,</i>

163
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,010
<i>and she's spent most of her life training.</i>

164
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,850
<i>Five hundred years, huh?</i>

165
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,150
<i>That's fairly long-lived for a demon.</i>

166
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,360
<i>I doubt she's been challenged before.</i>

167
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,530
<i>I can learn so much just from 
the mana flowing off her.</i>

168
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,910
<i>Regardless, demons don't conceal 
their mana—nor can they.</i>

169
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,120
A pity.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,540
Auserlese.

171
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,550
Master.

172
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,550
Demons are cunning, aren't they?

173
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,680
Why don't they constantly suppress 
their mana like you do?

174
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,430
They can't.

175
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,440
Demons are individualists,

176
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,940
but they form the barest connections 
needed to fight against humankind.

177
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,820
What do you think an organization 
needs to function?

178
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,530
Order?

179
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,450
That's right.

180
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,950
In other words, you need someone 
important to lead an organization.

181
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,410
In the case of humans,

182
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,460
importance is determined by status 
and wealth, like they do in this nation.

183
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,210
That well-dressed man exiting 
that palace is a man of importance.

184
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,340
It's hard to tell which humans are important,

185
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,430
so they dress themselves up 
to make it obvious.

186
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,600
Demons are different?

187
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,520
They haven't changed a bit 
since they were monsters.

188
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Might makes right.

189
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,730
It's far easier to understand than humans.

190
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,240
You can tell who's strong 
just by looking at them.

191
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,990
You mean mana.

192
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,030
Mana is to them what status 
and wealth are for humans.

193
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,490
It's dignity itself.

194
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,170
They may temporarily suppress 
their mana for the sake of stealth,

195
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,630
but none are foolish enough 
to suppress their mana all the time.

196
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,050
It's the difference between a noble 
sneaking out into town incognito

197
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,390
and that same noble debasing themselves by 
abandoning their status and wealth entirely.

198
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,180
The world of demons is cruel.

199
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,310
They'd never grant any dignity 
to those with little mana.

200
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,650
So the stronger they are, the more desperate 
they are to show off their mana.

201
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,160
For them, there's no benefit to 
constantly suppressing their mana.

202
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,910
It doesn't even occur to them to do it.

203
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,120
It's a pity, isn't it?

204
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,670
Just as humans are bound by status 
and wealth, demons are bound by mana.

205
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,460
Despite their pride in 
and unparalleled love for magic,

206
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,300
they can't control their own mana.

207
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,890
Frieren, you're lucky you're not a demon.

208
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,180
You're right. I wouldn't be able 
to deceive them if I were.

209
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,070
It's been three years since you 
started suppressing your mana.

210
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Looks like I was right about you.

211
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,580
You've grown much better at that.

212
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,000
Frieren, do you still love magic?

213
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,540
Where did that come from, Master?

214
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,210
Somewhat, I suppose.

215
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,890
Long ago, you once confidently 
answered that you loved magic.

216
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,390
That was only fifty years ago.

217
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,140
You're right.

218
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,150
In the end, all I could do 
was teach you to fight.

219
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,400
Magic for revenge.

220
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,110
Do you regret it?

221
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,990
No. I'm glad I taught my magic to you.

222
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,950
Given how long you'll live,

223
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,040
you might eventually become strong 
enough to defeat the Demon King.

224
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,340
Frieren, I have one request.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
What is it?

226
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Plant flowers around my grave.

227
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,010
That doesn't seem like you.

228
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,180
I know.

229
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,020
Frieren, my favorite spell 
creates a field of beautiful flowers.

230
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,440
My parents taught it to me when I was little.

231
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,110
It's what made me love magic.

232
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,910
Huh.

233
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,160
Teach me that spell.

234
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,880
Listen to me, Frieren.

235
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,420
You must never seek to leave 
your name in history.

236
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,800
Live in obscurity.

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,760
You won't leave your name in history 
until you defeat the Demon King.

238
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,700
I've heard there's a long-lived 
mage in these woods.

239
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,580
Are you her?

240
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,590
I've lived a long time, but I haven't 
done much with my life.

241
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,710
I'm not exceptional.

242
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,220
Huh. What do you think, Heiter?

243
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,850
She has roughly one-fifth of my mana.

244
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,220
It's not bad.

245
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,100
Who's this irritating guy?

246
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,560
Leave. You don't have business 
with a mediocre mage, do you?

247
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,240
No, you're stronger than 
any mage I've ever met.

248
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,240
What makes you say that?

249
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,910
Just a feeling.

250
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,460
Auserlese.

251
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,850
You seem happy, Aura.

252
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,100
Are you certain you'll win?

253
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,110
You'll see.

254
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,860
<i>Frieren the Slayer.</i>

255
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,820
<i>You made your first major 
appearance eighty years ago.</i>

256
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,620
<i>With the party of heroes, 
you defeated the Demon King.</i>

257
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,330
<i>You're a mysterious elven mage 
whose age is unknown.</i>

258
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,460
<i>But it doesn't matter how 
long-lived a mage you are.</i>

259
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,340
<i>Your mana tells me everything 
I need to know.</i>

260
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,800
<i>I can see it quite clearly.</i>

261
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,430
<i>You're an exceptional mage, 
but your mana itself is unimpressive.</i>

262
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,150
<i>You can't have had more than a 
hundred years or so of training.</i>

263
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,570
<i>Not only that, but you've barely 
changed since eighty years ago.</i>

264
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,280
<i>Were you honing other skills 
instead of working on your mana?</i>

265
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,070
<i>Or were you simply wasting your life away?</i>

266
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,580
<i>Either way, you are no match for me.</i>

267
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,840
I win.

268
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,350
All that's left is to sever your head myself.

269
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,690
<i>It wasn't even necessary 
to exhaust Frieren's mana.</i>

270
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,360
<i>I needn't have been so cautious.</i>

271
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,990
<i>She defeated many of my 
immortal soldiers, too.</i>

272
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,740
<i>I'll have to replenish their numbers later.</i>

273
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,240
<i>What's this?</i>

274
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,410
<i>The scales are starting to tip toward Frieren.</i>

275
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,630
You placed my soul on the scales, Aura.

276
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,460
Honestly, I would've been in trouble 
if you'd tried to overwhelm me with numbers.

277
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,390
I'm glad you're so confident in your own mana.

278
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,100
Now I can finally defeat you.

279
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,520
What do you mean?

280
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,020
You should've figured it out by now.

281
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,020
I've been suppressing my mana.

282
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,520
You misjudged the situation, Aura.

283
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,160
That's impossible. That wouldn't 
have escaped my notice.

284
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,740
There was no hint of the instability 
or variation in mana output

285
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,290
that comes with suppression.

286
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,960
I'm surprised. Demons are capable 
of observing mana that precisely?

287
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,550
Sounds like my master made the 
right call with her methods.

288
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,180
I've spent most of my life 
suppressing my mana.

289
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,390
This state has become natural for me.

290
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,060
Are you stupid? Why would you 
do something so pointless?

291
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,940
You're right. It's stupid.

292
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,690
But it lets me beat your kind.

293
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,950
This is absurd.

294
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm a great demon who's lived 
for over five hundred years.

295
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,370
Aura, the person standing before you...

296
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,630
is a mage who's lived 
for over a thousand years.

297
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,520
<i>Frieren.</i>

298
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,270
<i>Just as demons deceive humankind with words,</i>

299
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,020
<i>you must use your mana to deceive demons.</i>

300
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,030
Aura,

301
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,280
kill yourself.

302
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,750
Impossible.

303
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,380
H-How could I...?

304
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,600
<i>And you alright</i>

305
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
<i>Can you hear me</i>

306
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,980
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

307
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,320
<i>Crying excessively</i>

308
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,490
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

309
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,530
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

310
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,250
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

311
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,000
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

312
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,670
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

313
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,220
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

314
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,260
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

315
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,010
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

316
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,100
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

317
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,940
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

318
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,950
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

319
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,710
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

320
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,670
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

321
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,590
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

322
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:12,760
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

323
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,430
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

324
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>for you to come back home</i>

325
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,890
Do you have someone to praise you?

326
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,890
You're traveling to heaven, then?

327
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,060
I'm not sure I understand...

328
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,690
You've got a nice body, old man.

329
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,190
The largest magical city in the 
northern lands, Äußerst.

330
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,020
What's a first-class mage?

331
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,150
What is that trinket?

332
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,900
It means we're elves.

333
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,030
Episode 11
Winter in the Northern Lands

334
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,070
It's the winters of the northern lands.
