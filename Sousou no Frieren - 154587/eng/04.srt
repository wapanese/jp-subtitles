1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

2
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,990
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
at the Granz Channel, located in the central lands

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,780
This area has always been 
difficult to navigate,

4
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,660
so all kinds of things wash up here.

5
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,920
It used to be that the entire village 
helped clean up the shore.

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,000
But now you don't have enough people, 
so it lies neglected.

7
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,010
These waters used to be beautifully clear.

8
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,590
I know.

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,430
How about this as payment?

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
It's a book written by 
Flamme the Legendary Mage.

11
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,400
Ms. Frieren.

12
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,570
Is this the only grimoire 
you have in your village?

13
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,740
Yes.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Very well. We'll clean up the area for you.

15
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,460
That grimoire is a fake, isn't it?

16
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,800
I see you've been studying like 
I told you to. Good girl, Fern.

17
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,680
Books attributed to Flamme are never real. 
This is just another poor imitation.

18
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,050
Why did you accept the job?

19
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,600
To help someone in need.

20
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,480
I find that hard to believe.

21
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,270
You're right. I'm doing this for me.

22
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,610
Sounds like we've got another 
long stay ahead of us.

23
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,800
Thanks for being such a 
regular customer, Fern.

24
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,170
I threw in an extra one for you.

25
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,880
Thank you.

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,220
It's been three months already.

27
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,260
Have you gotten used to the village?

28
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,060
Yes.

29
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,980
The shore gets cold this 
time of year. Be careful.

30
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,860
<i>It's winter already.</i>

31
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,570
She's still asleep.

32
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,620
This place is a mess.

33
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,620
<i>I just tidied up yesterday, too.</i>

34
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,380
Ms. Frieren, it's morning. Please wake up.

35
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,640
Let's go clean up the shore.

36
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,290
So cold...

37
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,550
I've been thinking.

38
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,050
About what?

39
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,550
Are you actually a very sloppy person?

40
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,100
Every morning I wake you up, feed you 
breakfast, and help you get dressed.

41
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,060
I'm practically your mother.

42
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,520
I can do all that myself.

43
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,690
But then you'd sleep until noon.

44
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,990
Yeah.

45
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,070
Well, I've already given up hope, anyway.

46
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,160
Sorry.

47
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,950
How did you manage traveling 
with the hero's party?

48
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,410
There wasn't anyone there 
to look after you.

49
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,540
I overslept all the time.

50
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,540
And you never got in trouble for it?

51
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,630
I did, just once.

52
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,010
Just once? They must have been very tolerant.

53
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,800
They were a whole different breed.

54
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,390
Also, Heiter sometimes clicked his tongue.

55
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,770
Sorry.

56
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,390
Hey.

57
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,100
I understand how you feel, but...

58
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,570
Sounds like they were rather upset with you.

59
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,710
How is the cleanup coming along?

60
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,210
We have about a third of it left.

61
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,880
Do you think you'll be done in time 
for the New Year's Festival?

62
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,170
Just barely.

63
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,140
In that case, I hope you'll be able to watch 
the sunrise this time, Ms. Frieren.

64
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,240
Is the beach cleanup related to 
the New Year's Festival somehow?

65
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,620
In this village, it's customary to watch the 
sunrise on the day of the New Year's Festival.

66
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,500
They say it's beautiful how the light 
reflects off the clear waters.

67
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,500
You haven't seen it?

68
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,130
Do you think I'd be able 
to wake up that early?

69
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,630
I suppose not.

70
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,090
Let's hurry. We don't have much time.

71
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,930
No problems with the water quality.

72
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,010
We managed to finish by the day before.

73
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,760
It hardly looks like the same beach.

74
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,520
Thank you, Ms. Frieren.

75
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,360
You'll be joining us for the 
New Year's Festival, won't you?

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,150
Yes.

77
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
We'd love to have you.

78
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,240
Have you lost your mind, Ms. Frieren?

79
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,660
You'll have to wake up before the sun rises.

80
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,240
That's impossible for you.

81
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,910
I'll be fine. I just need 
to stay up all night.

82
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,910
You're that desperate to see the sunrise?

83
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,920
Honestly, I'm not interested, 
which is why I want to see it for myself.

84
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,670
I don't understand.

85
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,380
No, I suppose you wouldn't.

86
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,190
Why didn't you come to the 
New Year's Festival, Frieren?

87
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,440
The shock was so great, 
it left Heiter bedridden. Poor guy.

88
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,780
He's just out of commission 
because he drank too much.

89
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,030
What's the problem? 
The rest of you got to go.

90
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,410
We wanted you to enjoy it, too.

91
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,250
It's just a sunrise. 
I doubt I'd enjoy it much.

92
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,580
No, you would.

93
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,540
Why?

94
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,880
Because you're that kind of person.

95
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,050
She's asleep.

96
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,140
She's asleep!

97
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,100
Ms. Frieren, wake up. 
You'll be late for the New Year's Festival.

98
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,810
Mother...

99
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,560
Who are you calling "Mother"?

100
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,360
Why am I doing this?

101
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,570
Thank you, Fern.

102
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,300
<i>It's certainly pretty, but it wasn't 
worth waking up early for.</i>

103
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,050
<i>Himmel didn't understand me after all.</i>

104
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,560
Fern, I'm going home so I can go back to...

105
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,980
Ms. Frieren, it's beautiful.

106
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,980
Is it?

107
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,820
It's just a sunrise.

108
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,990
But you seem to be enjoying 
yourself a little.

109
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,910
That's because you're smiling.

110
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,630
I wouldn't have been able to see 
this sunrise if I'd been on my own.

111
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,590
Of course not. After all, you can't 
get out of bed by yourself.

112
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,890
Episode 4: The Land Where Souls Rest

113
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,390
Are these for your family?

114
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,480
It was a long time ago.

115
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,980
My village was attacked by demons.

116
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,400
What are you doing?

117
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,950
Praying.

118
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,910
People return to nothingness when they die.

119
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,910
No, they go to Heaven.

120
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,910
Until several thousand years ago,

121
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,920
the commonly held belief 
was that there was no afterlife.

122
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,750
Dwarves value tradition.

123
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,550
I'm skeptical about the idea 
of a heaven myself,

124
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,800
but since current magics can't 
observe the souls of the dead,

125
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,350
its existence can't be proven or disproven.

126
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,890
I don't think it matters either way.

127
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,900
You're right. I don't care 
if it exists or not.

128
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,400
Should a man of the cloth be saying that, 
you corrupt priest?

129
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,240
But even if it doesn't exist, 
I believe it should.

130
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
Why?

131
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,830
Because it's more convenient that way.

132
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,500
All those people doing their best 
to live deserve something better

133
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,750
than nothingness awaiting them.

134
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,670
I prefer to think they get to 
live the good life in Heaven.

135
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,430
That certainly is more convenient.

136
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,060
Shall we pray?

137
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,640
Yeah.

138
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,530
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Bredt region, located in the central lands

139
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,830
Eisen, I'm here to hang out.

140
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,040
You act like it hasn't been thirty years.

141
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,670
What's a mere thirty years?

142
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,500
You're right.

143
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,420
I never thought you'd take on an apprentice.

144
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,550
Eisen, is there anything you need help with?

145
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,520
Frieren, I heard you asked 
Heiter the same thing.

146
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,190
I'm not on my deathbed yet.

147
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,400
How do you know about that?

148
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,190
Because we wrote to each other.

149
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,570
You're more conscientious than you look.

150
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,950
You're just too indifferent.

151
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,740
So, do you need help with anything?

152
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,830
Voll Basin...

153
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,500
This place brings back memories.

154
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,960
You've been here before?

155
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,000
A long time ago.

156
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,430
"A long time," she said. 
How long must that be?

157
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
Perhaps she came here in prehistoric times.

158
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,470
Not even I've lived that long.

159
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,230
So, what are we looking for?

160
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,940
The notes of Flamme the Legendary Mage.

161
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,490
Fine. You know most of Flamme's 
supposed writings are fake, though?

162
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,370
I have a lead.

163
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,460
Heiter deduced the location from records 
on Flamme left in the holy city.

164
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,210
Her genuine notes are located 
somewhere in Voll Basin.

165
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,590
Frieren, you must know that.

166
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,550
That corrupt priest. 
He'd gotten that far in his research?

167
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,180
Fine. We'll begin by searching 
for a large tree.

168
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,390
A large tree?

169
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,060
That's ridiculous. There are tons of trees.

170
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,320
Well, I suppose you have 
all the time in the world.

171
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,400
That's right.

172
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,410
But Fern wouldn't like that, 
so I'll try to finish quickly.

173
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,410
Let's search as efficiently as possible.

174
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,500
You've changed.

175
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,460
You never cared about 
other people's time before.

176
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,880
Fern is scary when she's mad.

177
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,760
I see. Then I should watch myself.

178
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,800
Ms. Frieren.

179
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,090
There's a large tree to the west 
growing over some ruins.

180
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,010
This way.

181
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,850
Got it.

182
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,480
Hey. Why did you decide to 
look for Flamme's notes?

183
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,820
Because I felt sorry for you.

184
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,150
What?

185
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,780
I felt sorry for you and Himmel.

186
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,820
On that day thirty years ago,

187
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,790
you said you wished you'd gotten 
to know Himmel better.

188
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,040
You should tell Himmel himself that.

189
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,930
They say the notes of Flamme the Legendary 
Mage describe her conversing with the dead.

190
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,180
That's just a fairy tale. 
Besides, I don't want to see him now.

191
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,020
All magic started as fairy tales.

192
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,610
And don't you want to know more about Himmel?

193
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,570
That's why I talked it over with Heiter.

194
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,820
We were sure you had regrets, 
so we wanted to help you.

195
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:30,340
Ms. Frieren, both the tree and ruins 
are protected by a powerful barrier.

196
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:39,310
Even after a thousand years, I'm still 
dancing in the palm of my master's hand.

197
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,230
How's that little sapling going to keep watch?

198
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,810
Don't sell it short.

199
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,610
Once it grows, it'll still be protecting 
this place a thousand years from now.

200
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,610
You'll be dead by then.

201
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,910
But you won't be.

202
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,250
Someday, you'll make a terrible mistake 
and wish you'd gotten to know people better.

203
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,130
Do you wish I knew you better? 
Are you being needy?

204
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,550
Yeah, no.

205
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
When that happens, return to this place.

206
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,010
Then I, Flamme the Legendary Mage, 
will help you.

207
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,280
Those are Flamme's notes?

208
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,370
Are they real?

209
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,240
They're real.

210
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,250
How do you know that?

211
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,790
Frieren was Flamme's best student.

212
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,880
Flamme the Legendary Mage is an ancient hero 
who's written about in magical history.

213
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
Are you sure you haven't been 
around since prehistoric times?

214
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,300
Does it say anything about 
speaking to the dead?

215
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,770
It's already opened to that very page.

216
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,980
Did she know a thousand years ago 
that I'd come here?

217
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,110
What an unpleasant woman.

218
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,820
"On the northernmost end of the continent..."

219
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,070
<i>I arrived at the place the people 
of this world call heaven:</i>

220
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,450
<i>Aureole, the land where souls rest.</i>

221
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,080
<i>Many souls gather there,</i>

222
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,630
<i>and I spoke with friends 
who once fought alongside me.</i>

223
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,090
<i>This discovery of the century...</i>

224
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,760
"...will propel research on souls forward."

225
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,850
Do you suppose it's true?

226
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,020
Who knows? She was an irresponsible person.

227
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,190
Heaven exists.

228
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,690
It's more convenient if it does.

229
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,070
You're right. Perhaps I should 
believe in it for once.

230
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,200
Where exactly is this place?

231
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,080
Give me a moment.

232
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,080
The northern continent... Ende.

233
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,120
Ende?

234
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,080
Yes.

235
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,210
It's where the Demon King's 
castle is located now.

236
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,340
But why there?

237
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,340
Frieren.

238
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,100
You must find Aureole and speak with Himmel.

239
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,980
You said you'd help me, didn't you?

240
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,980
You've learned some cunning tricks, Eisen.

241
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,650
Thanks to Heiter.

242
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,910
Fine. I didn't have a particular 
destination anyway.

243
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,330
But it's so cold around 
the Demon King's castle.

244
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,330
I don't want to go.

245
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,630
She's already feeling discouraged.

246
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,630
She fell asleep.

247
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,430
What a carefree girl.

248
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,930
It's cold. I don't want to go.

249
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,180
She's moaning in her sleep.

250
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,060
Is it really that cold around 
the Demon King's castle?

251
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,200
Ende, where the castle is, is located at the 
very northernmost end of the continent.

252
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,160
We went through a lot in that place.

253
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,330
A lot?

254
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,540
<i>This is awkward.</i>

255
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,130
<i>Maybe I'll wake Ms. Frieren.</i>

256
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,390
Ms. Frieren. Ms. Frieren.

257
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,180
She won't wake up.

258
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,560
Say, Fern. Is she a good master?

259
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,860
That's a good question.

260
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,030
I don't really know.

261
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,950
All she does is drag me around 
while she searches for magic.

262
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,000
But she does seem interested in getting 
to know Mr. Himmel and his companions.

263
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,540
Perhaps she's not very interested in me.

264
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,260
Ms. Frieren only took me on as an apprentice

265
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,880
because she promised Mr. Heiter she would.

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,800
I see.

267
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,100
But she's such a strange person.

268
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,900
After we began traveling together, 
she started giving me birthday presents.

269
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,900
Normally she seems so disinterested in me.

270
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,660
I wonder what she's thinking. 
She's so strange.

271
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,620
Frieren, you're not going 
to stay in the royal capital?

272
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm going to keep traveling.

273
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,540
Alone?

274
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,090
It'll be nice and easy.

275
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,260
You're not going to take on an apprentice?

276
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,180
Traveling is better when you 
have someone to talk to.

277
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,850
It's a waste of time.

278
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,680
Even if I taught them, they'd die in no time.

279
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,560
Frieren, that's not how relationships work.

280
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,900
Yes, it is.

281
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,030
My adventure with you wasn't even 
one one-hundredth of my life.

282
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,570
You must understand that, Eisen.

283
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,120
I...

284
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,330
Okay, okay. That's enough depressing talk.

285
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,040
Today is a day for celebrating. Let's drink.

286
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,050
You just want a reason to drink, don't you?

287
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,590
You saw right through me.

288
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,180
You're always drinking.

289
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,840
You corrupt priest.

290
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,470
Fern...

291
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,980
She's a good master.

292
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,900
You're right.

293
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,780
Eisen, you're really not coming with us?

294
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
That's right.

295
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,990
I told you before, I'd only get in your way.

296
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,250
I see.

297
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,420
You remember how to get to Ende, don't you?

298
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,130
Yes. First we travel through the Wille region,

299
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,260
and then we cross Riegel Canyon and pass 
through the northern lands checkpoint.

300
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,890
Sorry to ask this of you.

301
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,260
It'll be a long journey.

302
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,730
It took us ten years.

303
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,100
I see.

304
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,860
We'll be following the same path Mr. Himmel's
party took to the Demon King's castle.

305
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,600
You're right.

306
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,680
It'll be a mere ten-year adventure.

307
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,440
Do you think I can become a powerful warrior?

308
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,150
They appear after death.

309
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,780
You really do only collect odd spells.

310
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,900
Travelers, may I have a moment of your time?

311
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,900
Why haven't you defeated the dragon?

312
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,780
You're searching for it, aren't you?

313
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,780
That's ridiculous.

314
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,870
Episode 5
Phantoms of the Dead

315
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,870
This is a phantom of the dead.
