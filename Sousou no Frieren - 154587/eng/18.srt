1
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,630
Beyond Journey's End

2
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,980
Episode 18: First-Class Mage Exam

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,140
So that's the largest magical city 
in the northern lands, Äußerst.

4
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,370
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Kühl region, located in the northern lands

5
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,630
We're still a long ways away.

6
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll need to hitch a ride on 
a carriage on our way there.

7
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,890
Once you get your first-class 
mage certification there,

8
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,890
we'll be able to enter the Northern Plateau.

9
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,730
I don't think I have to be 
the one to get certified.

10
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,070
I won't be able to use it for long, anyway.

11
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,840
You should get certified, Fern.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,890
Ms. Frieren, don't you know?

13
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,160
Only a handful of the most skilled mages 
have ever gained a first-class certification.

14
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,020
I certainly couldn't manage it.

15
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,450
Oh, really?

16
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,480
You don't seem interested.

17
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,970
It's a bit late to ask,

18
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,130
but why do we need to be accompanied

19
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,620
by a crazy-powerful mage to enter 
the Northern Plateau, anyway?

20
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,390
The Northern Plateau has long been inhabited

21
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,640
by many cunning, magic-using 
monsters like the Einsam.

22
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,120
It's a dangerous region that you once couldn't
cross without a priest and a skilled mage.

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,750
That said, if someone as valuable

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,390
as a skilled mage is required 
to travel through the area,

25
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,140
something pretty serious must be 
happening on the Northern Plateau.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,140
We'll look into the exam 
once we arrive in Äußerst.

27
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,600
According to Fern, there's a combat test.

28
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,960
I'll need to come up with a strategy.

29
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,410
Aren't you powerful enough to 
easily handle any kind of test?

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Even when you're suppressing your mana,

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,430
you still produce as much 
as an experienced old mage.

32
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,530
Don't call me an old mage.

33
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,260
Now she's sulking.

34
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,310
Don't you think calling her 
an old mage was a bit mean?

35
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,890
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,680
I haven't forgotten that you 
called me an old hag, Stark.

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,380
How long ago was that?

38
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,940
Forget it. I'm going to sleep.

39
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,650
Wake me when we get to Äußerst.

40
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,490
Sheesh.

41
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,250
Actually, never mind.

42
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,150
What's wrong?

43
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,150
I could only see half the sky.

44
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,690
What?

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,920
Just so you know, Fern,

46
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,170
mana isn't the only factor that 
determines a mage's strength.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,580
Technique, experience, the spells 
they use, their control...

48
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,530
There's effort and tenacity, too.

49
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,840
Some of those sound more like warrior traits.

50
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,010
Finally, there's talent.

51
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:12,960
In my life, I've lost eleven times to 
mages who had less mana than me.

52
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,980
Four of them were demons.

53
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,720
Qual was one of them.

54
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,600
One was an elf like me,

55
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,270
and the remaining six were humans.

56
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,380
The graf's city should be 
coming into view soon.

57
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,750
In the frontier of Graf Granat's domain,
located in the northern lands

58
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,040
The road to Äußerst is steep.

59
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,240
Maybe I'll take a break.

60
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,980
That's a nice staff you've got there, miss.

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,470
What's this? More bandits?

62
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,350
We're finally enjoying peace now 
that Aura has been defeated, too.

63
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,590
But now we're seeing more of these types.

64
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,300
Who told you to speak?

65
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,800
Gather your things and—

66
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,410
Bastard.

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,490
If you value your lives, 
then leave this place.

68
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,430
Let's go.

69
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,890
Thanks for saving me.

70
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,890
I'm Übel the Mage.

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,000
Kraft the Monk.

72
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,980
Huh? Are you an elf?

73
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,270
How unusual. This is my 
first time seeing one.

74
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,270
You have the eyes of a killer.

75
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,670
I didn't rescue you.

76
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,530
I found the torn-up bodies 
of bandits in the woods nearby.

77
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,240
They'd been killed by a mage.

78
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,790
A tremendously skilled one, no less.

79
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,880
Oh, yeah?

80
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,050
Did you come to lecture me?

81
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,990
No. I'm an adventurer, too.

82
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm not so hard-headed as to criticize 
someone for killing in self-defense.

83
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,590
I was simply saving the lives 
I saw in front of me.

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,060
You're a shrewd old man. You're no fun.

85
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,820
Are you headed to Äußerst?

86
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah. I'm going to take 
the first-class mage exam.

87
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,910
Frieren said the same thing.

88
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,790
I look forward to hearing about her 
adventures when I see her next.

89
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,960
Continental Magic Association,
Northern Branch

90
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,960
The exam will take place 
two months from now.

91
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,220
Keep in mind that the first-class mage exam 
is administered once every three years.

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,180
Also, a fifth-class mage or higher 
certification is required to take the exam.

93
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,850
Fern, it's all up to you.

94
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,630
Ms. Frieren, I can't do this alone.

95
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,720
Sure you can.

96
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,430
What are we going to do if I fail?

97
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,860
The first-class mage exam is only 
held once every three years.

98
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,240
We'll either hire a first-class mage 
or travel by sea.

99
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,530
That would be incredibly expensive.

100
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,460
We won't be able to afford snacks anymore.

101
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,870
But I'm uncertified.

102
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,090
My holy emblem won't work, will it?

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,790
Again, what is that antique?

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Hey, you.

105
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,610
Could I take a look at that?

106
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,320
Are you planning to take 
the first-class mage exam?

107
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,400
Looks like I get to take the exam.

108
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,150
I'm surprised there's anyone around 
who still knows what this is.

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,540
Is that thing impressive?

110
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,120
It's supposed to be.

111
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,430
Frieren, you're not part 
of a magic guild, are you?

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,550
The organizations that manage 
magic change all the time.

113
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,600
I can't be bothered to join every one.

114
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,060
Huh.

115
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,300
Besides, I have this.

116
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,510
A holy emblem. Pretty impressive, right?

117
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,630
What's this rusty necklace? Any clue?

118
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,700
None at all.

119
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,010
I see.

120
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,700
But this is the only thing 
that proves I'm a mage.

121
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,830
Frieren, it's true that we 
don't recognize that necklace.

122
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,980
But we know you're an incredible mage.

123
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,200
Isn't that enough?

124
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,090
But you'll die so soon.

125
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,320
Ms. Frieren.

126
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,860
We know you're an incredible mage.

127
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,540
You're right.

128
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,120
According to the Continental 
Magic Association's regulations,

129
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,760
a person becomes a proper mage 
once they've achieved at least fifth class.

130
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,890
Fern, why did you get a 
third-class certification?

131
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,600
Because it had the soonest 
available testing date.

132
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,720
There are 600 mages who 
are at least fifth class.

133
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,400
Even when you include apprentices from sixth 
to ninth class, there are 2,000 mages total.

134
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,550
Among them, 45 are first class.

135
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,650
The first-class exam is held 
once every three years

136
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,900
at the northern branch in Äußerst and the 
headquarters in the holy city of Strahl.

137
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,200
Many years, no one passes the test at all.

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,930
Some test-takers are expected 
to be injured or die.

139
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,970
It seems moderately challenging.

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,400
Either way, there are a lot 
fewer mages these days.

141
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,410
There used to be more?

142
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,550
A century ago, when the Demon King's 
attacks intensified,

143
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,810
you could expect to encounter at least 
one mage while walking around town.

144
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,570
These days, you hardly see 
them outside magic cities.

145
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,450
Let's train thoroughly to prepare 
for the exam in two months.

146
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,370
The first-class mage exam will now begin.

147
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,980
First Test Proctor

148
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,980
First-Class Mage Genau

149
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,710
The first-class mage 
certification is granted only

150
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,990
This year's test-takers 
seem rather exceptional.

151
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,690
Wirbel, second-class mage and 
captain of the Northern Magic Corps

152
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,090
to the most exceptionally 
talented and powerful mages.

153
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,350
Only a few mages are granted the title.

154
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,000
that has fought against the remnants 
of the Demon King's forces for years.

155
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,790
Naturally, the exam is quite dangerous,

156
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,900
Denken, the crafty old 
second-class mage who won

157
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,930
but the Association will not intervene 
regardless of what happens to you.

158
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,500
a bloody struggle for power 
to become an imperial mage.

159
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:44,270
Fern, the youngest mage to ever receive 
a third-class certification with top marks.

160
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,260
Of course, there are some 
problem children as well.

161
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,640
Übel, the third-class mage who failed 
the second-class exam two years ago

162
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,890
when she killed the first-class mage 
who proctored it.

163
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,800
Who else looks promising?

164
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,390
I see someone radiating the mana 
of an experienced old mage.

165
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,380
Who is that?

166
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,540
I don't know.

167
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,010
I will now announce the content 
of the first test in this exam.

168
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,930
You will be tested as parties.

169
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,990
The 57 exam-takers will split into teams 
of three for the first test.

170
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,910
We will now assign parties.

171
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,760
<i>Bracelets, huh?</i>

172
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,880
<i>They have numbers on them. 
I must be in the 2nd party.</i>

173
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,900
<i>Imbuing it with mana allows me to locate 
the bracelets belonging to my party members.</i>

174
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,310
<i>So this is how we identify 
our party members.</i>

175
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,060
<i>Either way, this is interesting.</i>

176
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,020
<i>Setting aside normal party compositions,</i>

177
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:56,170
<i>these improvised parties of magical 
miscreants will struggle to work together.</i>

178
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,570
<i>First impressions are important here.</i>

179
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,180
<i>I should be careful not to make waves.</i>

180
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,680
<i>I sense my party members' 
bracelets around here.</i>

181
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,480
Ow, ow, ow!

182
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,580
You're gonna rip them off!

183
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,950
You can't be serious! I'll kill you!

184
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,460
Try it.

185
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,450
<i>They're already fighting.</i>

186
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,100
Nice to meet you.

187
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,920
It's nice to meet you.

188
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,990
At the site of the first test, in Grobe Basin,
located in the northern lands

189
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,830
Allow me to explain the specific 
rules of the first test.

190
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,120
Small birds known as Stille 
live within the testing area.

191
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,810
Each party has been given one cage.

192
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,620
There are two conditions you must 
fulfill to pass the first test.

193
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,010
First, by sunset tomorrow, 
have a cage containing a Stille,

194
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,260
Stay away from me!

195
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,270
and second, have all of your party 
members present at that time.

196
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,140
You are mostly free to do as you wish,

197
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,150
but if anyone leaves the testing area,

198
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,160
their entire party will fail the test.

199
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,100
They say that like there isn't a barrier 
around the testing area

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,900
that won't let so much as 
a speck of dust through.

201
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,750
It's not like we <i>can</i> get out.

202
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,000
So they're actually listening 
to the explanation.

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,620
The first test begins now.

204
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,400
We should start by coming up with a plan!

205
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,620
Are you stupid?

206
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,740
We can't come up with a plan 
if we can't even find them!

207
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,160
They're still fighting.

208
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,590
Why don't we introduce 
ourselves while we walk?

209
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,690
Also, use rock-paper-scissors to 
decide who will carry the cage.

210
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm Frieren. Nice to meet you.

211
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,870
I'm Lawine, a third-class mage.

212
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,670
I'm Kanne, also a third-class mage.

213
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,430
Lawine and I go way back.

214
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,870
We graduated from the same magic school.

215
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,420
Do you two know anything about the Stille?

216
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,170
No.

217
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,130
Nope.

218
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,950
I do, but I've never seen 
one in person before.

219
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,270
Let's start by finding a 
Stille and observing it.

220
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,850
I'm tired.

221
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,490
You're so undisciplined.

222
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,410
Shall we take a break?

223
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,300
I can keep moving. I'll go ahead 
and check things out.

224
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,920
It's safer to stay together.

225
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,790
Oh, shut up. That's so inefficient.

226
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,930
Lawine, are you strong?

227
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,860
Stronger than her.

228
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,190
You wanna fight, huh?

229
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,070
And compared to me?

230
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,040
I wouldn't want to fight you.

231
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,080
I see.

232
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,180
Fine. Go check things out.

233
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,330
Come back if it gets too dangerous.

234
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,060
Okay.

235
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,150
And watch the skies.

236
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,430
I know.

237
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,030
<i>I wonder if our party will be okay.</i>

238
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,610
Frieren, you're like a teacher.

239
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,350
You'd make a good leader.

240
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,440
It's because you two keep fighting.

241
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,090
I don't want to lead.

242
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,650
Sorry. We've always been like this.

243
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,950
By the way, what did you mean 
when you said to watch the skies?

244
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,660
I meant exactly what I said.

245
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,620
Do you struggle to detect mana?

246
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,740
Why?

247
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,560
Hey.

248
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,070
That was quick.

249
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,540
I found a Stille.

250
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,470
Nicely done, Lawine. Now watch it closely.

251
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,010
I told you to observe.

252
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,780
It's going to run away.

253
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,760
I don't think so. Nice work, Kanne.

254
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,000
Huh. Not bad.

255
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,710
But you should probably get down.

256
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,890
What? Why?

257
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,200
Stille are incredibly tough.

258
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,850
Their top speed is faster 
than the speed of sound.

259
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,880
Trying to restrain one 
like that is pointless.

260
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,350
Seriously? It's already gone.

261
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,650
That was close.

262
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,720
Capturing one will require 
careful observation.

263
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,090
We'll use this entire day 
for Stille observation.

264
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,100
<i>Kanne controlled the water, 
and Lawine froze it.</i>

265
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,180
<i>Their timing was perfectly coordinated.</i>

266
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,010
<i>Their teamwork is superb.</i>

267
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,890
<i>It's not something you 
could achieve overnight.</i>

268
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,510
<i>I was worried for a while there, 
but this might actually work.</i>

269
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,790
Let's go after it.

270
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,760
We should search around the lake instead.

271
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,360
Why? We should go sooner rather than later.

272
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,850
<i>Nope. They're fighting again.</i>

273
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,390
I hear something. Huh?

274
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,490
Frieren's missing.

275
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,130
It's faint, but that's the sound of rain.

276
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,510
But it's not raining, so why...?

277
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,010
Oh, I see.

278
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,980
Does that mean...?

279
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,760
A monster!

280
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,230
My staff...

281
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,480
Lawine!

282
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,120
I told you to watch the skies.

283
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,680
Have you calmed down?

284
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,180
Yeah.

285
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,380
You called Lawine's name.

286
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,990
But you don't like Lawine, do you?

287
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,550
No, I don't.

288
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,870
Right? So how do you two 
work together so well?

289
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,450
It's strange.

290
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm surprisingly craven.

291
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,880
I often fail to act during critical moments.

292
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,290
It happened when I cast 
my first flying spell, too.

293
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,010
The ones who already left 
are already so far away.

294
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,840
You'll have water beneath you, 
so it's not like you'll die.

295
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,580
If you don't have the courage 
to do it, want me to kick you?

296
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,890
I hate you, Lawine.

297
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,770
I know.

298
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,470
You're always so mean to me.

299
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm the kind of person who 
grows with praise, you know.

300
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,570
You're joking, right?

301
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,900
This is what happens when you grow up 
babied by a kind mommy and daddy.

302
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,890
If it'll help you fly, 
I'll be as nice as you want.

303
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,430
Then name my strengths.

304
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,290
Are you for real?

305
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,240
You try really hard even 
though you're a coward.

306
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,010
What?

307
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,800
That's your strength.

308
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,430
Tell me more.

309
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,350
What? Why?

310
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,700
You work really hard in secret.

311
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,530
You're considerate and pay attention 
to your surroundings.

312
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,070
More.

313
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,210
You're cute when you smile.

314
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,120
What? Ew.

315
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,390
That was close.

316
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,820
So you can fly after all.

317
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,390
I'm done being kind to you.

318
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,520
Lawine is rough, but she 
pulls me along with her.

319
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,020
Because of her, I realized 
I can manage most things

320
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,520
if I just go for it, even if I'm scared.

321
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,500
By the way, Frieren...

322
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,120
I noticed something interesting.

323
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,350
Do you think this could be useful?

324
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,010
I see.

325
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,130
We might be able to capture 
a Stille easily after all.

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,680
It's strange.

327
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,730
Let's do this.

328
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,900
Why are you so relaxed?

329
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,880
They're inexperienced.

330
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,870
Someone's detected us.

331
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,770
It's time to fight other mages.

332
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,770
Shut up.

333
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,350
Then there's no need for words.

334
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,840
This is the 2nd party's well-laid plan.

335
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,980
Episode 19
Well-Laid Plans
