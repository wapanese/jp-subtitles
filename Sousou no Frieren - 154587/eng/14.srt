1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Raad region, located in the northern lands

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,770
This place seems to have a lot of shops.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,870
It'll be worth shopping around.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,690
This is a lively town.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,360
I see a lot of bars.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,490
Oh, right. Frieren, let's go 
shopping together later.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,970
This place seems to have 
a lot of nice shops.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,260
If you want.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,510
What are you doing, Frieren? Let's go.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,060
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,480
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,400
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,030
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,360
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,700
<i>Across this land</i>

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,030
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,490
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:13,250
Beyond Journey's End

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>The story ends</i>

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,140
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,810
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

23
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,310
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,480
<i>Makes people forget</i>

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,270
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,060
<i>Begin to rust</i>

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>Just the same</i>

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,190
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,530
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,410
<i>And they live on</i>

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,950
<i>We chose the same path</i>

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,080
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,620
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,880
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,250
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,340
<i>Even now</i>

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,710
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,260
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

39
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,930
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,990
Episode 14: Privilege of the Young

41
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,100
You don't need to be so harsh!

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,210
You're always so rude to me!

43
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,770
Do you really hate me that much?

44
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,080
Forget it! I'm going back to my master!

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,480
Would it kill her to listen 
to me once in a while?

46
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,210
What's all the noise about?

47
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,590
Are the lovebirds fighting?

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,210
It's Fern's birthday today, 
but Stark didn't get her a present.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,600
Fern is furious.

50
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,960
Hmph.

51
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,820
Honestly, I think you were too harsh today.

52
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,350
You never listen to anything Stark says.

53
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,410
I didn't get her anything either.

54
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,610
Men don't care about little things 
like birthdays and anniversaries.

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,360
Ow!

56
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,800
Okay, okay. I'll buy you something, 
so stop kicking me.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,910
My knees are gonna be sore later.

58
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,440
I feel sorry for Stark.

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,160
I'm old enough to let most callousness go,

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,780
but girls can make the emotions 
of boys his age swing wildly.

61
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,730
I think you should go after him.

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,050
Maybe you should go see him.

63
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,610
That's right. Her hair ornament has
 a butterfly on it, too.

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,420
That's a cute pouch.

65
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,450
You don't like it?

66
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,040
I don't like how accustomed you seem
 to the company of women.

67
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,710
I see.

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,700
Did you find Stark?

69
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,410
He was in the plaza.

70
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,270
But you couldn't talk to him, huh?

71
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,870
I get it. It's not that you don't like him.

72
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,270
You just don't know how to 
interact with boys your age.

73
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,210
Ah, to be young.

74
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,470
No matter. Choose whatever you want.

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,730
We can check out other stores, too.

76
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,990
No, it's fine.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,120
Then I'll choose something for you.

78
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,290
Anyway, even if he forgot to get you 
a gift, I think you overreacted.

79
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,640
He's not that conscientious.

80
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,910
I doubt he even remembers his own birthday.

81
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,470
You shouldn't blame him.

82
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,710
I gave Mr. Stark a present on his birthday.

83
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,980
Really? Did you choose one with him?

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,730
How did you know?

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,160
Normally, no one declines when someone 
offers to buy them whatever they want.

86
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,030
You must consider it an important memory.

87
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,480
That's why you said no.

88
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,990
I don't know.

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,480
I just felt like it.

90
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,230
I see.

91
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,360
Then go apologize to Stark 
and pick out a gift with him.

92
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,070
He's just a kid. He's slow on the uptake.

93
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,390
You want to make up with him, don't you?

94
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,640
People won't know how you feel 
unless you tell them.

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,290
You're right.

96
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,840
I'm heading back to the inn.

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,510
Um...

98
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,390
I'm sorry for kicking you.

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
Mr. Stark.

100
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,210
Fern.

101
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,980
Iâ€”

102
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,290
Sorry!

103
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,810
I wanted to choose a gift with you, 
since I don't know what you like.

104
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,530
But I thought you'd get upset with me 
again if I said that, so I couldn't.

105
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,940
I wouldn't be upset with you.

106
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,180
Mr. Stark, I'm sorry. I was too harsh.

107
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,000
It's fine. I'm used to it.

108
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,470
I'm really sorry.

109
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,340
Let's go.

110
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,490
Okay.

111
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,870
You're spying on them?

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,110
That's in poor taste, Frieren.

113
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,110
Same to you, Sein.

114
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,690
Looks like they made up.

115
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,710
You understand relationships better 
once you're older.

116
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,130
You start avoiding conflict then.

117
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,760
Those arguments are the 
privilege of the young.

118
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,950
That can't have been easy for you, Frieren.

119
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,890
Looking after two kids sounds tough.

120
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,580
What do you mean by 
understanding relationships?

121
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,380
So it's three kids.

122
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,820
Fern asked me for advice instead of you.

123
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,700
I wonder who she's comparing me to.

124
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,360
Fern was raised by Heiter.

125
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,080
She shouldn't be comparing me 
to such a great priest.

126
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,030
I'd hardly call him great.

127
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,510
He was a drunk and often hungover.

128
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,790
Has he become an undead?

129
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,490
He was picky with his food, too.

130
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,380
Quit it.

131
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,340
And he lied all the time.

132
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,130
I haven't had anything to drink.

133
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,250
He was just a corrupt priest.

134
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,810
You're even more depraved, though.

135
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,020
Sorry about that.

136
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,590
I'm surprised, though.

137
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,480
The Mr. Heiter I remember was 
a kind and dependable old man.

138
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,480
Unlike me, he was an ideal grown-up.

139
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,730
Heiter, you've changed.

140
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,340
You've matured.

141
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,240
What are you talking about? I'm an old man.

142
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,410
It happens naturally as people age.

143
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,420
Huh.

144
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,300
I wish I could say that, anyway,

145
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,560
but the truth is, my mind has 
hardly changed since I was a child.

146
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:51,010
I've simply been pretending to be an adult 
until I can make it as an ideal grown-up.

147
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,060
I'll probably keep pretending 
until the day I die.

148
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,940
Children need grown-ups 
for emotional support.

149
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,950
Fern in particular is the hardworking sort.

150
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,710
She needs lots of praise and guidance.

151
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,950
Then who will praise you for 
pretending until the day you die?

152
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,300
That's what the Goddess is for,

153
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,100
though I'll have to wait until I go 
to heaven to receive my reward.

154
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,340
Then I'll praise you down here.

155
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,460
You will?

156
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,660
But I'm a human. I doubt you 
understand how I feel.

157
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,000
How do you intend to praise me?

158
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,790
That was better than I expected.

159
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,950
Frieren, once I go to heaven, 
I'll speak with the Goddess for you.

160
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,360
You should be praised by her.

161
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Oh? Then I'll look forward to it.

162
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,450
What do you think you're doing, Frieren?

163
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,700
I think you're a proper adult, Sein.

164
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,960
I would've loved to have 
an older woman do this.

165
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,960
You should be glad, then.

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,530
Few women are older than me.

167
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,470
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Bande Woods, located in the northern lands

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,630
Thank you.

169
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,390
There weren't any passenger carriages
 around here, so we appreciate it.

170
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,980
We help each other when we're in need.

171
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,690
I'm actually a merchant in the town up ahead.

172
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,360
I run an accessory shop there.

173
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,640
Are you interested?

174
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,360
You're a good salesman.

175
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,980
I'm not too interested, but Fern 
likes that kind of thing. Don't you?

176
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,600
Huh?

177
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,490
Did you buy a new bracelet?

178
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,530
Um, this is...

179
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,400
That's a cute design.

180
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,990
I have a ring with the same design.

181
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,340
Himmel gave it to me.

182
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,130
It probably matches yours.

183
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,910
Really?

184
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,950
Now where did I put it?

185
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,040
Huh?

186
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,690
You're so disorganized.

187
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,830
Found it.

188
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,820
Sorry. I let my guard down.

189
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,080
Avian monsters are cunning 
and skilled at concealing their mana.

190
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,600
What are we going to do?

191
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,960
Can't we figure something out with flying 
magic after defeating the monster?

192
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,960
You can make a carriage levitate, right?

193
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,940
Stark, have you ever seen a flying carriage?

194
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,990
We're in one right now.

195
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:24,750
This may surprise you, but it's only been 
forty years since humankind learned to fly.

196
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,180
Until then, the skies were the 
exclusive domain of demons and monsters.

197
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,210
The flying magic we use is 
a repurposed demon spell.

198
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,210
Spare me the details and 
dumb it down for me.

199
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,910
It means we can't adapt it 
because we copied their technique

200
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,850
without understanding 
the principles behind it.

201
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,190
Things larger than humans 
can only be made to fly briefly.

202
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,780
I see.

203
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,350
We'll have to get out.

204
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,450
I'll fly out with the merchant.

205
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,240
Fern, could you take Sein?

206
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,360
Understood.

207
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,280
I'll get my cargo together.

208
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,230
What about me?

209
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,000
You can jump down.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,480
What are you talking about?

211
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,970
I'm pretty sure that would kill me.

212
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,500
You're a warrior. A fall from 
this height won't kill you.

213
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,460
Of course it would kill me!

214
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,820
Don't act like you don't understand that!

215
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,990
That's odd.

216
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,870
Eisen was never injured by 
a free fall from any height.

217
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,160
What is wrong with him?

218
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,000
Heiter was appalled.

219
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,430
That just goes to show that Mr. Eisen 
was far from normal.

220
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,400
What about levitating the carriage 
just before it hits the ground?

221
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,770
I'll need to calculate 
if I can stop a free fall.

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,620
If I don't reduce the force sufficiently, 
we'll be ground into minced meat.

223
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,540
That sounds horrifying!

224
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,530
Either way, we should probably hurry.

225
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,290
This type of monster hunts by 
slamming its prey into the ground.

226
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,020
I see.

227
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,750
Well, it's worth a shot.

228
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,110
Don't just drop us!

229
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,650
W-We're alive.

230
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,950
It seems like the plan was a success.

231
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,700
You call that a success?

232
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,810
You call that a plan?

233
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,460
The horse is only slightly injured. 
I've finished treating it.

234
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,090
But the carriage is a wreck. 
It needs repairs.

235
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,850
Sorry.

236
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,950
No, thank you.

237
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,470
If it'd just been me, I'd be dead.

238
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,240
It'll take a while to fix the carriage.

239
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,670
Huh?

240
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,500
That's odd.

241
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,330
Where did it go?

242
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,370
It's gotten warmer lately.

243
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,340
Should we start dressing lighter?

244
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,000
By the way, Fern, that bracelet...

245
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,010
It was a birthday present from Mr. Stark.

246
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,040
I spent three hours choosing a gift.

247
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,440
You ended up choosing it?

248
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,070
I asked him to choose what he wanted.

249
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,150
Oh, I see.

250
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,750
That must've been difficult, Stark.

251
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,060
Her type is the hardest to deal with.

252
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,130
Yeah.

253
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,950
<i>Will she like this?</i>

254
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,370
I spent three hours gauging her reactions.

255
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,890
I felt like I was dying.

256
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,330
Poor kid.

257
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,840
<i>I can hear everything they're saying.</i>

258
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,330
But...

259
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,810
I'm glad I did, since she likes it.

260
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,870
Anyway, good going, Stark.

261
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,410
I didn't think you knew what you were doing.

262
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,190
That design is of a mirrored lotus.

263
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,650
In the language of flowers, 
it means "eternal love."

264
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,150
In this area, people give them 
to their lovers.

265
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,050
Mr. Stark?

266
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,910
I-I didn't know!

267
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,490
This is all a misunderstanding.

268
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,860
You think I know the language of flowers?

269
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,300
That's fair enough. You're an idiot, after all.

270
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,130
You're being even harsher than usual!

271
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,620
It's not like you knew either.

272
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,300
Did you say something?

273
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,090
It's nothing.

274
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,880
Should I buy you a replacement?

275
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,970
You put a lot of effort into 
choosing this gift for me.

276
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,740
Don't ever say that again.

277
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,460
Sorry.

278
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,900
What is it?

279
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,300
Nothing.

280
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,140
Ms. Frieren.

281
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,350
We've finished repairing the carriage.

282
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,720
We'll depart early tomorrow morning.

283
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,000
I see.

284
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,200
You've been slipping out every night.

285
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,100
What are you looking for?

286
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,620
The ring Himmel gave me.

287
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll help.

288
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,050
We'll wait to depart until we've found it.

289
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,480
No.

290
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,080
If I don't find it tonight, 
I'll give up on it.

291
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,170
I'm used to losing things.

292
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
Besides, that's not the 
only thing Himmel gave me.

293
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,450
Wasn't it a mirrored-lotus 
design ring like this one?

294
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,390
In the language of flowers, 
it means "eternal love."

295
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,650
Does it? I didn't know.

296
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,220
It doesn't matter. I doubt Himmel 
knew what it meant either.

297
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,850
Regardless, I'm sure it's important.

298
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,420
Let's look for it together.

299
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,660
You should've told me.

300
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,150
A few people in my village have 
lost accessories over the years.

301
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,230
I intended to give you this spell 
for finding lost accessories

302
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,300
as a reward for your assistance.

303
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,700
<i>Frieren.</i>

304
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,380
You worked really hard 
to defeat the Demon King.

305
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,410
Choose whatever you'd like.

306
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,180
An accessory, huh?

307
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,790
I would've preferred 
something from a magic shop.

308
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,640
This one will do.

309
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,670
That was quick. Put more thought into it.

310
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,740
What's wrong?

311
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,390
Nothing.

312
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,400
Frieren.

313
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,350
Thank you.

314
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,810
Aren't you glad you didn't 
give up, Ms. Frieren?

315
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,920
Maybe.

316
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,900
By the way, why are you wearing 
a mirrored-lotus bracelet?

317
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,030
Because Mr. Stark is an idiot.

318
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,530
How could you say that?

319
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,510
<i>And you alright</i>

320
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,020
<i>Can you hear me</i>

321
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,900
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

322
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,230
<i>Crying excessively</i>

323
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,400
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

324
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,450
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

325
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,160
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

326
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,920
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

327
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,590
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

328
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

329
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,180
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

330
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,930
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

331
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

332
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

333
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,870
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

334
00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,620
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

335
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,580
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

336
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

337
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,680
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

338
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,350
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

339
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,270
<i>for you to come back home</i>

340
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,810
I have battle magic, too.

341
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,940
I feel anxious.

342
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,000
He doesn't have his brother's talent.

343
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,700
Yes, Father.

344
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,810
This is starting to look bad.

345
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,290
In any case, it looks like we should hurry.

346
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,290
It's hell.

347
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,400
This smells like trouble.

348
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,930
Episode 15
Smells like Trouble

349
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Let's head to the next village.
