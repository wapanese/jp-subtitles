1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,086
NORTHERN LANDS, RUINS OF THE KING'S TOMB

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:09,007
All of you here are the 18 people
who have passed the first exam.

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,048
PROCTOR OF THE SECOND EXAM
SENSE, FIRST-CLASS MAGE

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,002
First of all, congratulations on passing.

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,089
Regarding the exams
that I have been in charge of,

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,096
there have been many rumors
of their results all over the place.

7
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:27,047
I'm sure some of you
have heard about them.

8
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,011
That said,
there is no need to be so wary.

9
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,026
The exam itself is simple.

10
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:36,022
Anyone aiming to become
a first-class mage

11
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:38,041
should be able to clear it
without difficulties.

12
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:44,015
Now then, I shall explain
the details of the second exam.

13
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:12,089
FRIEREN: BEYOND JOURNEY'S END

14
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,099
EPISODE 23: CONQUERING THE LABYRINTH

15
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,087
The second exam is a dungeon raid.

16
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:26,001
You will all attempt to conquer
the Ruin of the King's Tomb.

17
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:30,009
There is only one condition
to pass the exam.

18
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:34,001
You must reach the innermost
depths of the tomb.

19
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,045
You see, I'm a pacifist.

20
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,076
I do not enjoy bloodshed.

21
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,052
Therefore, anyone who reaches
the goal will pass.

22
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,069
Wait.

23
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:50,027
This is an unmapped dungeon
where many adventurers never returned alive.

24
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,019
Are you trying to make
everyone fail again?

25
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,053
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:59,041
You're all aiming to become
among the greatest of mages.

27
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,075
First-class mages make
the impossible possible.

28
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:09,013
You must keep going forward, even if
the path is unexplored or untrodden.

29
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:15,034
How should we prove that
we've reached the innermost depth?

30
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:18,001
Do we need to bring back
treasures or the like?

31
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:20,049
There is no need to prove it.

32
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:23,064
I will accompany you
all the way down.

33
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:27,011
Of course, I won't lend a hand
to any of the participants.

34
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:32,023
One more thing,
I'm giving you these bottles.

35
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:37,003
This thing was designed
by the first-class mage Lernen.

36
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,031
It's a golem that will help you escape.

37
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,099
By breaking the bottle,
you will summon the golem,

38
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,057
and it will carry you
out of the dungeon.

39
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:49,013
It's still a prototype,
but it's safe enough.

40
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,011
If you use it, you will fail the exam,

41
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:55,013
but if you think you can no longer
continue due to injury or the like,

42
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,067
do not hesitate to use it.

43
00:03:57,022 --> 00:04:00,067
I can't let people
with promising futures die.

44
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:06,064
Also, the bottles will break
on their own at dawn tomorrow.

45
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,007
That is the time limit
of the second exam.

46
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,047
Now then, let the second exam begin.

47
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:38,038
Looks like there are several entrances.

48
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,051
This seems to be a dungeon
from the Unified Dynasty era.

49
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:45,089
The dungeons from that era
tend to have multiple entrances,

50
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,056
but they all lead
to the innermost depths.

51
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:50,073
If we take a look at each entrance,

52
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:53,077
we should be able to figure out
the internal layout to a degree.

53
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,028
We should divide the work and...

54
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:59,003
Why do you think
we would cooperate?

55
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:08,004
There's no element
of competition in this exam.

56
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:11,029
We should all work together.

57
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,054
I'm not doing that.

58
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:20,005
Unlike the first exam, the survival of
allies is not a prerequisite for passing.

59
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:23,055
Even if we form a team,
we're not obligated to help each other.

60
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,049
There's also the risk that I might be
used as a sacrificial pawn if needed.

61
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:31,092
Especially by you, who seem
to know a lot about dungeons.

62
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,001
I'm going alone.

63
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:52,025
Well, we at least knew each other
from the first exam.

64
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:55,096
At the very least, I'm not going to
team up with someone I don't know.

65
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,029
Let's go.

66
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,055
Hey, wait for me.

67
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:09,032
Fools.

68
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:13,069
They can't even see
the advantages of cooperating.

69
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:16,002
Let's go, Fern.

70
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:18,057
Are you sure, Mistress Frieren?

71
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,004
They won't be cooperating.

72
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,002
It's impossible at this point.

73
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,095
Hmm...

74
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,098
Then I shall follow you two.

75
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:39,021
It would seem to be
the safest way to reach the depths.

76
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,096
Just don't get in the way, okay?

77
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:46,001
I won't.
I will not bother nor help you.

78
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:56,033
This is the safest route.

79
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:01,061
Let's move forward carefully
and make a map as we go.

80
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,037
That tile over there.

81
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:17,054
It's a trap, so be careful.

82
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:26,065
You're always so knowledgeable
about dungeons.

83
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:30,025
I didn't use to be like this.

84
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,099
But Himmel liked dungeons.

85
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:38,019
We've raided lots of dungeons
on quests to exterminate monsters.

86
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:42,057
What do you mean
by liking dungeons?

87
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,007
It's literally what it means.

88
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,041
It makes him excited.

89
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:50,011
It's so weird, isn't it?

90
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,079
This stairway should
lead to the next floor.

91
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:01,071
I see. So this is the wrong route.

92
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:04,071
Let's head back to the branching paths.

93
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,022
Right.

94
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:08,063
Why?

95
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:12,001
Our target is the monster
down in the depths.

96
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,022
When will you learn, Eisen?

97
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:21,077
You only proceed to the next level
of a dungeon after exploring every corner.

98
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:23,073
That's the basics of being an adventurer.

99
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,032
I've never heard that before.

100
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,032
You must think I'm being ridiculous.

101
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:35,091
But wouldn't it be best if we could help
others while also enjoying ourselves?

102
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:38,021
This can't keep on forever.

103
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:41,025
As we continue our journey,
the dungeons will become more dangerous.

104
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,005
That's right.

105
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,017
I intend to enjoy it to the end.

106
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:48,076
I'll enjoy the adventure,
raiding dungeons,

107
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,076
defeating monsters,
and finding treasures.

108
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:54,076
By the time I realized it,
I already saved the world.

109
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,049
That's the journey I want.

110
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:01,016
Besides,

111
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:06,053
we might find a rare grimoire
at the end of the other route.

112
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,061
What are you waiting for?
Let's hurry back.

113
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:10,069
Huh...

114
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:14,007
It's so, so weird, isn't it?

115
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,005
Let's go, Kanne.

116
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:46,018
In the end,
only the five of us stayed.

117
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:50,069
Had we cooperated
and divided the tasks,

118
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,049
we would've had a good chance
at beating the dungeon.

119
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:58,024
With all the talented people here,
it would've been possible.

120
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:03,008
Denken, not everyone
can be as rational as you.

121
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:07,034
You said so yourself
at the end of the first exam.

122
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,076
They just don't like it.

123
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,067
At least the more clever ones stayed.

124
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,064
Just look at it that way.

125
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,022
At least, among these people,

126
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:24,077
there's nobody stupid enough to fall
for simple traps like mimics.

127
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,025
Isn't that enough, Denken?

128
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,078
As if a fool like that would make it
to this exam in the first place.

129
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,017
Let's go.

130
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,035
This mana...

131
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,017
There might be a grimoire inside.

132
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:52,055
Mistress Frieren, you saw the result
of the Mikheit spell, didn't you?

133
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,033
It's a mimic.

134
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,037
Fern,

135
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,043
that spell is 99 percent accurate.

136
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,043
And your point is?

137
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:09,002
It's only because there are great mages
that see through that one percent

138
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,044
that historic discoveries can happen.

139
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:18,062
Yes, I'm sure of it.

140
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:23,008
There is a rare grimoire inside.

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,008
That's what my experience
as a mage tells me.

142
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:36,088
It's so dark in here! It's scary!

143
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,085
So dark! So scary!

144
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,085
It's dark! It's scary!

145
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:59,055
Did I choose the wrong people to follow?

146
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,054
Don't step on the middle floor.

147
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,042
The ceiling will fall on you.

148
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,001
Don't tell me,
that person-shaped stain is...

149
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:24,022
How gruesome.
Not even any bone was left.

150
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,058
Gargoyles!

151
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:47,008
Denken, someone got trapped.

152
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:47,097
I know.

153
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:50,023
She's behind that wall.

154
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,031
Stand back.

155
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,082
I knew it, it's not enough.

156
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,057
There's no other choice.

157
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,057
Break the bottle!

158
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:23,068
Wow...

159
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:26,035
So we already lost one person.

160
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:32,085
Even letting our guard down
for a bit can be fatal.

161
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,019
So this is the Ruins of the King's Tomb...

162
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,074
Say, Fern, listen to me for a bit.

163
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:54,025
Can you stop pulling me for now?
You'll tear me apart.

164
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:55,065
Sure.

165
00:14:57,054 --> 00:15:01,026
In this situation, you should do
the opposite and push me in.

166
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,013
The mimic will gag and stop biting.

167
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,089
Is it a dog or something?

168
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,035
I'm saved...

169
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,052
Goodness me.

170
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,006
How did you deal with these
when you're alone?

171
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:22,048
I would blow them up from
the inside with an offensive spell.

172
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:27,003
But I don't like doing that
because it makes my hair frizzy.

173
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,003
I'm back...

174
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:31,016
I got ringlet curls...

175
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:35,096
So that's why you sometimes
have different hairstyles.

176
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,089
But why?

177
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:40,009
All right, let's pull ourselves together

178
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,053
and continue raiding the dungeon.

179
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,001
It's gargoyles.

180
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:54,072
We'll defeat them
before they start moving.

181
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:01,099
We've seen these medals
in several places, didn't we?

182
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:04,065
Apparently, some people
with unusual tastes collect these.

183
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:12,074
This seems like the right route,
so let's head back.

184
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:13,083
But why?

185
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:19,096
It's going smoother than expected.

186
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:24,013
You're right. It's quite strange
for an uncharted dungeon.

187
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:27,084
Structurally speaking, we should be
close to the innermost depth, as well.

188
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:31,026
In any case,
we shouldn't let our guard down.

189
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:35,001
How about we take a break
when we find another burial chamber?

190
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:40,081
We got quite some good stuff here.

191
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,086
They all look like junk to me.

192
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,036
I don't get it.

193
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,041
Me neither.

194
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:55,005
How could she be
so happy from just that?

195
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,033
She's even rubbing her cheeks on it.

196
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:03,001
What I don't get is you, Fern.

197
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:08,061
I've never seen a young mage
as talented as you.

198
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,055
You must have gone
through many trainings.

199
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:15,089
And yet I don't sense any passion
or obsession from you.

200
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,018
You're a strange girl.

201
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:26,044
I became a full-fledged mage
to repay my debt to a certain someone.

202
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,045
That was my goal in life at the time.

203
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:35,028
I kept pouring all my effort into it

204
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:38,063
without ever thinking
about the future beyond.

205
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I must have exhausted
all of the passion I had back then.

206
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,059
Then why do you continue
your pursuit of magic?

207
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,072
Doesn't Mistress Frieren
look happy to you?

208
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,067
She does.

209
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,019
The first time I raided a dungeon,

210
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:10,049
I saw how much fun she had collecting
magical tools that looked like junk.

211
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:17,075
That made me smile as well.

212
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:22,091
It must've been that I liked
seeing Mistress Frieren happy

213
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:26,021
that I decided to pursue magic
together with her.

214
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,001
We should start moving.

215
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:40,056
Seems like I was right
to follow you two after all.

216
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:46,019
I'm sure you can have fun
even in this cruel dungeon.

217
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,026
The atmosphere changed.

218
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,055
I guess we're close
to the innermost depth.

219
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:19,027
Wirbel.

220
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,081
What is it?
Are you too tired to walk...

221
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,052
I've been restrained.

222
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:27,085
There are three mages concealing
their mana. It's an ambush.

223
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,032
Scharf, block their vision.

224
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:38,007
Ehre is restrained
with a Sorganeel spell.

225
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:38,099
I know.

226
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:58,055
No wonder the Ruins of the King's Tomb
has been impregnable.

227
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:04,027
I certainly didn't expect
anything like this.

228
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:09,056
Scharf, you take care of me.
Ehre, you go after Scharf.

229
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:11,094
I'll take down Ehre.

230
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,099
We'll break through them.

231
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,099
A clone made through magic.

232
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,041
It must be the work
of a demon or a monster.

233
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:08,079
But I've never seen such
a perfect copy of another person.

234
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,029
Its mana and skill were exactly
the same as Laufen's.

235
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:15,009
It even behaves the same way.

236
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,034
There's a chance
it copied her memories.

237
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,008
I can't say I feel happy about this.

238
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:24,026
If there's a silver lining about this,

239
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,072
is that we can tell it's an impostor
from a single glance.

240
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:31,009
At least there's little
to no chance of friendly fire.

241
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:38,019
If this caster can control
multiple clones at the same time,

242
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,069
then it would be a terrifying threat.

243
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:47,037
In any case, teaming up
was the right call.

244
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,061
With it, we have more options
on how to deal with them.

245
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,057
Denken,

246
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:22,007
can you deal with that, too?

247
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,029
The only thing I can say is that...

248
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,025
if this weren't an exam,
I would have already broken my bottle.

249
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:23,082
- Now then, what shall we do?
- If our ability is equal...

250
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:24,048
- Can't even laugh at this.
- ...then it's all up to luck.

251
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:26,044
- Look into my eyes.
- ...then it's all up to luck.

252
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,011
- So it's not impossible.
- How long do we need to hold it off?

253
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:30,003
EPISODE 24: A PERFECT REPLICA
What it creates is a perfect replica.
