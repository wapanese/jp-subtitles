1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,040
Who are you? Visiting hours are over.

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,170
I am Draht, one of Aura the 
Guillotine's executioners.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,600
I am here to kill you.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,160
I see. Done pretending to negotiate?

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,040
We're just getting started.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,740
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,560
Just so you know, I'm strong.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,370
Stronger than me?

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,970
Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,350
Doesn't seem like it to me.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,860
Why not?

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,870
This fight is already over.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,950
Magical wire, huh? 
It's an interesting spell.

14
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,090
So you saved yourself from decapitation 
by concentrating mana around your neck.

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,930
You're level-headed.

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,840
A common mage would've lost her head 
without even realizing what had happened.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,260
But this wire is among the 
strongest of demonkind's spells.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,710
Humanity's magic doesn't 
stand a chance against it.

19
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,590
I'll cut through both 
your neck and your mana.

20
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,600
You're right. I doubt I can 
do anything about this wire.

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,490
That's enough to convince you you've won?

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,570
Demons these days are hopeless.

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,690
They lack actual battle experience.

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,830
<i>This mage...</i>

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,030
<i>She took my arm!</i>

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,460
You bitch—

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,240
Wait! Let's talk this—

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,050
That's one down.

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,030
<i>If I report this attack to the graf and kill 
the other two, surely he'll pardon me.</i>

30
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,860
The guard is dead.

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,050
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,470
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,390
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

34
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,010
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

35
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,350
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

36
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,680
<i>Across this land</i>

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,020
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

38
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,480
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

39
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:02,240
Beyond Journey's End

40
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,780
<i>The story ends</i>

41
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,290
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

42
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,120
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,790
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,290
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,460
<i>Makes people forget</i>

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,260
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

47
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,050
<i>Begin to rust</i>

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,890
<i>Just the same</i>

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,180
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,520
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,390
<i>And they live on</i>

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,940
<i>We chose the same path</i>

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,060
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,610
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

55
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,110
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

56
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,240
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,320
<i>Even now</i>

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,700
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,240
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,910
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

61
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,010
This is delicious.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,130
My master said any town that serves 
tasty food is a good, peaceful town.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,640
Wait!

64
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,330
That must be true of this town, too.

65
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,170
Mr. Stark.

66
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,580
You can't have any.

67
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,950
Let's directly petition Graf Granat 
to release Ms. Frieren.

68
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,600
I think it's only a matter of time 
until harm comes to this town.

69
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,320
We should release Ms. Frieren from the 
dungeon and have her defeat the demons.

70
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,100
That's our only option after all, huh?

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,050
We wouldn't stand a chance against them.

72
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,490
Especially not that Lügner guy. 
He's unbelievably strong.

73
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,430
He was only looking at Frieren.

74
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,240
Even though we were standing there 
next to him with the guards,

75
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,930
he was only looking at Frieren.

76
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,670
It's because he thinks he 
can kill us at any time.

77
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,190
My hands still haven't stopped shaking.

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,460
See? I even spilled my drink 
so it looks like I wet myself.

79
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,890
That's just how strong he is.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,050
You should wipe that up. Let's go.

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,740
Lügner and his guys are with the graf.

82
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,490
Worst case, a fight will break out.

83
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,510
That wouldn't stop the party 
of heroes from going.

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,490
You're right.

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,130
If I lost my nerve here, I'd never 
be able to face my master again.

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
Let's go.

87
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,000
You can keep the handkerchief.

88
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,410
Huh?

89
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,760
What's the matter?

90
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,140
I'm paralyzed with fear.

91
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,730
I'm no longer detecting Draht's magic.

92
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,700
He must be dead.

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,730
What an idiot. He underestimated her.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,100
Underestimated her?

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,370
We are the right-hand men of 
Lady Aura. Her executioners.

96
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,490
You think we'd die from merely 
underestimating someone?

97
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,000
Who is that mage?

98
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,250
Sorry I kept you waiting.

99
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,320
The mage I captured has escaped.

100
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,150
The soldier guarding her cell was beheaded.

101
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,310
That can't be good.

102
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,570
We'll help you look for her.

103
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,530
Linie is skilled at locating magic—

104
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,850
No, that's all right.

105
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,090
By the way, one of your men 
seems to be missing.

106
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,900
He's in the privy. He'll be back soon.

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,240
Without asking a servant for directions?

108
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,140
Even I can tell she's a skilled mage.

109
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,220
But she allowed my guards 
to seize her without a fight.

110
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,990
She understands the seriousness 
of killing a guard.

111
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,510
Lord Lügner, I'll ask you one last time.

112
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,370
Where is your man?

113
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,030
Honestly.

114
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,900
That idiot Draht.

115
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,940
He ruined everything.

116
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,630
It's strange, though.

117
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:48,000
Now that violence has become the only way 
to resolve this mess, I'm overjoyed.

118
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,080
Graf Granat, what are words?

119
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
How do they differ from swords?

120
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,630
No matter what we use, the weak die.

121
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,850
Just like this sword's former owner.

122
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,970
Lügner!

123
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,410
In the end, we are wild beasts.

124
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,170
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

125
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,090
You're going to help us remove 
this town's defensive barrier.

126
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,370
We should be arriving at 
the graf's mansion soon.

127
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,160
Ms. Frieren?

128
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,730
You're Ms. Frieren, aren't you?

129
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,990
What are you doing here?

130
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,510
Don't tell me you broke out of the dungeon.

131
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
I didn't have a choice.

132
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,420
Some demon named Draht 
attacked me while I was in there.

133
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,510
I defeated him,

134
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,820
but when demons die, they turn into 
mana particles and disappear.

135
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,490
What do you mean by that?

136
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,260
He'd already killed the dungeon guard.

137
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,530
The only ones down there were a guard

138
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,520
who had been beheaded using 
magical wire and me, a mage.

139
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,160
How would you read that situation?

140
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,500
That you're a guard-killer 
who should be executed.

141
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,580
Right? This is becoming a pain. 
I'm leaving town.

142
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,980
Wait.

143
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,840
If you leave, the remaining 
demons will run wild.

144
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,000
Are you really going to abandon this town?

145
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,620
Why don't you two defeat them?

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,250
You make it sound so easy.

147
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,760
We don't stand a chance against them.

148
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,880
You're not going to fight them 
just because they're strong?

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,480
Besides, I don't think you're 
weaker than them at all.

150
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,110
Wait!

151
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,870
We'll fight, okay? At least help us!

152
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm begging you!

153
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,610
Peek.

154
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,630
Hey, wait!

155
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,620
Please, Frieren!

156
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,260
You don't know when to give up, 
do you? Let's steel ourselves.

157
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,140
But... it's impossible...

158
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,780
Don't be childish.

159
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>About ten kilometers from town...</i>

160
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,850
<i>I sense a great deal of mana.</i>

161
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,300
<i>We're being observed.</i>

162
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,910
Aura the Guillotine, one of the 
Seven Sages of Destruction.

163
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,520
I hate fighting powerful opponents, too.

164
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,980
All the more reason to finish this quickly.

165
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,880
Should we be sneaking 
into the mansion like this?

166
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,390
Would you rather tell the gate guards 
that we're here to kill the peace envoys?

167
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,890
It's oddly quiet.

168
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,000
I love magic.

169
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,370
Just as Qual, the Elder Sage of Corruption,

170
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,230
spent most of his life 
developing a killing spell...

171
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,760
demons dedicate the entirety of our long 
lives to researching a single kind of magic.

172
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,320
We develop our research 
daily over years and years.

173
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,760
Ten years from now, our 
magics will be even greater,

174
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,930
and we will become even stronger.

175
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,290
But magic is a strange thing.

176
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,350
Flamme the Legendary Mage's 
defensive barrier has prevented demons

177
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,700
from invading and protected this town.

178
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:25,770
Sometimes a spell cast by a genius a thousand
years ago outmatches spells of the present.

179
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,910
I despise geniuses.

180
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,280
They lack the beauty of accumulated effort.

181
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,170
The Granat family has been entrusted with 
maintaining the barrier for generations.

182
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:49,800
If you could allow us into this town, 
then there must be a way to control it.

183
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,290
Teach it to me.

184
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,020
I'll give you some time.

185
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,350
Consider it carefully.

186
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,330
Making someone wait is an effective 
diplomatic strategy for humans as well.

187
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,630
If you won't talk, then all that 
awaits you is further torture.

188
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,900
There must be a grimoire 
related to the barrier somewhere.

189
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,170
Search the bedroom. I'll search the study.

190
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,500
You're just that adventurer kid 
from this afternoon.

191
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,720
I thought my son had come for me.

192
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,130
You look awful. 
Those demons did this to you?

193
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,640
I'll release you.

194
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,760
You're trembling.

195
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,300
Is that a problem?

196
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,340
No. It's valiant.

197
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,620
My dead son was trembling 
before he headed off to battle, too.

198
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,940
Damn it. I can't cut the rope.

199
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,150
Is it magical?

200
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,340
Don't worry about me. 
I'm done for either way.

201
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,890
Evacuating the townsfolk is more important.

202
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,400
They're not gonna listen without you.

203
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,420
The Granat family crest hangs from my neck.

204
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,580
Show this to the guards, 
and they'll do whatever you say.

205
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,810
And speaking so casually to me 
is a serious crime in this town, brat.

206
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,840
I know. Given the circumstances, 
I'll overlook this offense.

207
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,310
Now go.

208
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,620
I see.

209
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,890
Sorry, old man.

210
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,630
I'm gonna break this 
expensive-looking chair.

211
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,980
I can't afford to replace it.

212
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,540
Lord Lügner, a rat.

213
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,170
Graf Granat, do you know him?

214
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,670
No. He's one of the adventurers 
from this afternoon.

215
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,360
He must've come to petition me directly

216
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,050
without realizing the mage 
he was with escaped.

217
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,800
What a stupid kid.

218
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,520
I see.

219
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,810
<i>Again.</i>

220
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,320
You can leave, boy.

221
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
I'll let you live.

222
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,360
<i>He's doing it again.</i>

223
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,150
<i>He's not even looking at me.</i>

224
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,590
What's the matter? Move.

225
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,120
If you get in my way, I'll kill you.

226
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,580
Go ahead and try!

227
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,630
<i>He's fast.</i>

228
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,200
But you're only human.

229
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,570
You protected your vitals. 
Your reflexes aren't bad.

230
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,490
That said, the young are rash, 
whether they're humans or demons—

231
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,210
thoughtless and reckless.

232
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,620
But you challenged me alone. 
I commend your valor.

233
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,610
Alone?

234
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,030
I see. You can't detect her after all.

235
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,110
What?

236
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,950
Fern, I created the opening you asked for.

237
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,360
Lord Lügner, I'm sensing a mage!

238
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,910
<i>Impossible.</i>

239
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:18,350
<i>A mere human mage evaded Linie's detection?</i>

240
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,410
<i>And this spell...</i>

241
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,820
Lord Lügner, let me handle this.

242
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,710
Don't.

243
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Girl, what is that spell?

244
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,080
Ordinary offensive magic.

245
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,510
I believe it's known as Zoltraak 
in your magic system.

246
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,890
This is Zoltraak?

247
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,150
Don't be absurd.

248
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,060
Demonkind overcame Zoltraak 
half a century ago.

249
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,370
Who taught you this spell?

250
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,590
You're trying to buy time, aren't you?

251
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,400
I should finish you now.

252
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,620
I won't allow it.

253
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,880
Fern!

254
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,900
The graf is gravely injured.

255
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,550
We don't have time to fight.

256
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,470
Let's retreat!

257
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,520
Very well.

258
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,200
We'll go after them once 
I've stopped my bleeding.

259
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,260
You kill the warrior.

260
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,260
My blood is on those two.

261
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,360
We won't lose them.

262
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,160
You needn't fight them yourself, Lord Lügner.

263
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,460
I can handle the mage as well.

264
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,140
If you'd been struck by that spell, 
it would've killed you.

265
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,150
That spell has been modified 
to specialize in killing demons.

266
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,920
It can hardly be called Zoltraak anymore.

267
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,360
It's a demon-killing spell.

268
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,560
The way that girl moved 
reminds me of another mage.

269
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,360
And I've been struck by 
that same magic once before.

270
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,390
I see.

271
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,600
I remember now.

272
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,270
It was Frieren.

273
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,190
The mage who contributed significantly 
to humanity's analysis of Zoltraak

274
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,960
and slew more demons 
than anyone else in history.

275
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,480
Frieren the Slayer.

276
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,930
Episode 8
Frieren the Slayer

277
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,550
One of the geniuses I despise.

278
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,470
<i>And you alright</i>

279
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,970
<i>Can you hear me</i>

280
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,860
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

281
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,190
<i>Crying excessively</i>

282
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,360
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

283
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,410
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

284
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,120
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

285
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,870
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

286
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

287
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,090
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

288
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,140
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

289
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,890
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

290
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,980
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

291
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,820
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

292
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,830
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

293
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,580
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

294
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,540
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

295
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,460
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

296
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,630
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

297
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,300
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

298
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,220
<i>for you to come back home</i>

299
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,140
Lord Lügner will be upset with me again.

300
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,560
Seriously? This is crazy.

301
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,120
You'll have to rest for a while.

302
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,930
You demons are monsters after all.

303
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,730
Any demon can do it.

304
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,960
Because I have an overwhelming advantage.

305
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,580
I can kill you without mercy.

306
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,940
It was Aura, one of the 
Seven Sages of Destruction.

307
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,890
Episode 9
Aura the Guillotine
