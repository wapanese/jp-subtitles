1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,020
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,440
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,360
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,980
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,320
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>Across this land</i>

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,990
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,450
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>The story ends</i>

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,260
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,090
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,270
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>Makes people forget</i>

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,230
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,020
<i>Begin to rust</i>

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,860
<i>Just the same</i>

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,490
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>And they live on</i>

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,910
<i>We chose the same path</i>

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,040
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,580
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,830
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,210
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,290
<i>Even now</i>

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,670
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,220
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,890
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,980
Episode 15: Smells Like Trouble

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,990
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Laub Hills, located in the northern lands

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,500
How long have you been traveling together?

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,330
Um...

35
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,880
I first embarked on my journey with 
Ms. Frieren about four years ago.

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,270
It's been about a year for me.

37
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,330
I see.

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,910
There's something this party lacks.

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,010
What do you think that is?

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,950
We've got a front-liner, mages, and a priest.

41
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,430
A thief, perhaps?

42
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,090
Since Ms. Frieren is always 
falling for mimics.

43
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,540
Aw, yeah.

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,660
Oh, come on.

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,170
Treasure chests contain unlimited potential.

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,240
No.

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,690
What we lack is something 
even more important.

48
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,550
An older lady!

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,050
Most parties have at least 
one sexy older lady!

50
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,010
Do they?

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,020
But we've got Frieren.

52
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,100
No. She's not an older lady.

53
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,720
<i>He looks so distraught.</i>

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,020
Sorry about that.

55
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,980
H-Hey, the next village is coming into view.

56
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,340
They're breathing.

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,300
Same over here.

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,300
What's going on here? Everyone's asleep.

59
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
This smells like trouble.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,890
Let's head to the next village.

61
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,390
Don't make me angry, Ms. Frieren.

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,670
I'm just kidding.

63
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,920
It's a curse.

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,550
I thought so. What a hassle.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,460
Hey, Frieren. What are curses?

66
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,070
Among the spells cast by monsters and demons

67
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,090
are those that put people to sleep 
or turn them to stone.

68
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,120
Those which humankind has yet 
to unravel are known as curses.

69
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,600
Humanity's magic can't explain the principles
behind them or how to remove them.

70
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,050
Does that mean it's too late for this village?

71
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,590
I'm only talking about humanity's magic.

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,810
The magic of the Goddess, 
which priests use, is a different story.

73
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,430
Tackling curses has long been 
the business of the clergy.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,820
Well, Sein? Think you can help them?

75
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't rush me.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm currently determining the 
type and source of the curse.

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,450
How is the magic of the Goddess 
different from other magic?

78
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,450
The magic of the Goddess 
is recorded in holy scriptures

79
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,970
and can only be used by 
the owners of said scriptures.

80
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,230
Like the demons' magic, we don't understand 
the principles behind most of it,

81
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,470
so it's not very interesting.

82
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,390
And it's difficult to use unless you're born 
with the specific knack for it,

83
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,480
which also bestows an 
increased resistance to curses.

84
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,490
I believe they call it 
"the blessing of the Goddess."

85
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,990
Anyway, that's why priests 
are strong against curses.

86
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,300
So not even you can effectively 
defend against curses?

87
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,710
Mages can't detect curses.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,980
I can sense I'm being attacked in some way,

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,130
so I know this village is still under 
the effects of the curse.

90
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,660
I feel anxious.

91
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,970
Does that mean we're actively 
being cursed? I'm scared!

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,730
I've determined that it's 
a rather unusual curse.

93
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,740
You can't remove it?

94
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,040
I'd need tools to conduct 
a specialized ritual.

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,410
It'd be faster to defeat 
the source of the curse.

96
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,880
It's coming from a monster. 
I've determined its location.

97
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,780
Let's go.

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,050
That'll save time.

99
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,740
Ms. Frieren.

100
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,920
It's Mr. Stark.

101
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,930
He's asleep.

102
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,450
Can you wake him temporarily?

103
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,300
With my current abilities, five seconds 
is the longest I can keep him awake.

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,220
That's practically nothing.

105
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,750
In any case, it looks like we should hurry.

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,400
Fern won't wake up.

107
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,700
She said she was just taking a little break.

108
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,090
So Fern has fallen asleep, too.

109
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,900
This is starting to look bad.

110
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,380
I put up a barrier.

111
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,430
We'll hide them in here.

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,600
We're almost there. I can tell it's close.

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,900
I see.

114
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,250
Sein, wake me when the monster shows up.

115
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,010
Don't fight it alone.

116
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,980
I promise I'll defeat it.

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,470
I told you, five seconds 
is the longest I can...

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,190
Frieren?

119
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,440
We can't do anything with five seconds.

120
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,270
Fine.

121
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,050
I have battle magic, too.

122
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,250
<i>It's a subspecies of chaos flower.</i>

123
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,430
<i>It must be feeding off 
the sleeping villagers.</i>

124
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,240
<i>It'll sap away their mana 
until it eventually kills them.</i>

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,550
<i>Chaos flowers merge with the 
local flora to create subspecies.</i>

126
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,530
<i>It's like a mirror.</i>

127
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,510
<i>But no matter what they look like, 
their weakness is always their core.</i>

128
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,850
Three Spears of the Goddess!

129
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,870
<i>What happened?</i>

130
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,880
<i>Did it reflect my magic?</i>

131
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,800
<i>Unless I score a direct hit on the core,</i>

132
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,930
<i>the leaves could deflect 
my spells in any direction.</i>

133
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,180
<i>If I'm not careful, it could hit Frieren.</i>

134
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,060
<i>Damn it. This can only get worse.</i>

135
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,020
<i>Should I wake Frieren?</i>

136
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,640
<i>But she's the mage from the party of heroes.</i>

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,640
<i>If a powerful spell were deflected,</i>

138
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,650
<i>it could destroy not just the forest, 
but the village, too.</i>

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,640
<i>It's just five seconds.</i>

140
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,910
<i>That's not enough time to explain.</i>

141
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,510
<i>And Frieren and I haven't had the time 
to establish a mutual understanding</i>

142
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,920
<i>or learn to trust each other.</i>

143
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,100
<i>I don't even know what Frieren's thinking.</i>

144
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,520
<i>That's right.</i>

145
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,120
I never know what she's thinking.

146
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:41,390
I don't believe adventurers require 
mutual understanding or trust.

147
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,260
My companion Frieren was 
especially terrible at both.

148
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,060
So I decided to trust her words.

149
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,840
She swore she would defeat the Demon King,

150
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,730
and I chose to believe her.

151
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,530
<i>Trust her words, huh?</i>

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,700
Don't fight it alone.

153
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,260
I promise I'll defeat it.

154
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,880
She looked like a mess.

155
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,970
Don't blame me for whatever happens!

156
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,240
Awakening spell!

157
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,400
Frieren, only the core—

158
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,300
Got it.

159
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,310
What's going on here?

160
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,980
Thank you.

161
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,860
I won't forget this.

162
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,200
We didn't do much.

163
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,310
No.

164
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,200
I've never been happier to be 
awakened, thanks to you.

165
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,780
The moment I woke up, I knew that it 
was the kind that reflects magic.

166
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,830
You really are an incredible mage.

167
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,330
But we made it out alive 
because of you, Sein.

168
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,680
Thanks.

169
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,280
Good boy.

170
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,220
That lady from the village sure was pretty.

171
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,350
You're still saying that?

172
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,830
That's Vorig?

173
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,540
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
at the fortress city of Vorig, located in the northern lands

174
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,540
It's the relay point to Äußerst.

175
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,890
We're finally halfway there?

176
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,130
This really is a long journey.

177
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,680
We'll resupply in Vorig, and—

178
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,040
Ms. Frieren, this is awkward, 
but we're nearly out of funds.

179
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,670
Hey, you.

180
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,790
What is it?

181
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,550
That's a noble's carriage.

182
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,190
Huh?

183
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,300
What? What's going on?

184
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,310
You've got a nice body. 
Your appearance isn't too bad either.

185
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,940
Come to my mansion.

186
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,840
What's going on?!

187
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,370
What's your name?

188
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,210
Stark.

189
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,670
Lord Orden, you can't do this.

190
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,710
You know who I am?

191
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,500
This is the mansion of the Orden family,

192
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,790
one of the Three Great Families 
of the northern lands.

193
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,340
Your grandfather was a high-handed man, too.

194
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,760
What is this nonsense?

195
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,360
Either way, I'm having a conversation 
with Stark right now.

196
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,090
He's my party's front-liner.

197
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,640
Stark, do you need your mommy's 
permission to have a conversation?

198
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,230
Please don't fight.

199
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,860
I have a request. I'll pay you.

200
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,620
This is ridiculous. We're leaving, Stark.

201
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,190
Ms. Frieren.

202
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,640
What are those copper coins?

203
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,870
They're all the funds we have left.

204
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,710
I guess we can at least hear you out.

205
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,400
Frieren...

206
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,500
Stark, where are you from?

207
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,140
A warrior village in the Klee region 
of the central lands.

208
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,770
I see. My family line is originally 
from that village, too.

209
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,930
My eldest son, Wirt.

210
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,280
My heir and hero of this city.

211
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,120
He looks like you, Mr. Stark.

212
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,960
You're practically identical.

213
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,410
If we got you cleaned up,

214
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,180
only someone from within the family 
would be able to tell the difference.

215
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,550
What does that have to do with your request?

216
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,040
A month ago, we fought a 
large battle against demons.

217
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,860
Wirt died in action.

218
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,560
He and the enemy commander 
killed each other.

219
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,010
The silver lining was that 
it was a large-scale melee.

220
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,240
The only ones who know of Wirt's death 
are Gabel over there

221
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,180
and a few of my most trusted men.

222
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,570
What are you planning to make Stark do?

223
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,720
The fortress city of Vorig is key 
to this region's defense.

224
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,970
We can't allow morale to fall while 
we're rebuilding the forces we lost.

225
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,570
So you want to cover up 
your son's death until then.

226
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,950
Three months from now, this region's 
influential figures will meet at a soirée.

227
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,480
We'll show them that Wirt is alive and well.

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,440
How much will you pay us?

229
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,480
Ten Strahl gold coins.

230
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,230
That's three meals a day 
plus snacks for a year.

231
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,740
Throw in a grimoire.

232
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,980
You can take one of your 
choosing from the library.

233
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,570
Hold on. I can't do this.

234
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,840
What am I gonna do about 
this scar on my forehead?

235
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,600
The people already believe 
Wirt is recuperating.

236
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,840
That's an honorable battle scar.

237
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,070
Mr. Stark, we need the money.

238
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,330
This is sad.

239
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,400
Gabel, teach Stark proper etiquette.

240
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,610
Mr. Stark, how is your etiquette 
training coming along?

241
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,010
It's hell.

242
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,580
What do you think?

243
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,670
It doesn't suit you.

244
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,640
That's not nice.

245
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

246
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,340
Lord Orden.

247
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,830
Aren't I always telling you 
to call me "Father"?

248
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,170
You never know when someone 
might be watching.

249
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,530
Aren't you being too cold?

250
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,510
It's been less than two months 
since your son died.

251
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,150
I'm simply following my son's final wishes.

252
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,880
I even had a double prepared.

253
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,050
He didn't look as much like him 
as you do, though.

254
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,510
I can't say I enjoy this.

255
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,470
But it's what my son wanted.

256
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,680
I'll need your cooperation.

257
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,840
You're so awkward.

258
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,500
Mut, stand up taller.

259
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,170
Yes, Father.

260
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,860
My second son, Mut.

261
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,840
He's to be my heir, but he 
shows little improvement.

262
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,440
But by contrast, Stark is a failure.

263
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,850
Skill with a sword affects one's posture.

264
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,560
I'll teach you the Orden family technique.

265
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,870
What's wrong?

266
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,010
It's all right. Take deep breaths.

267
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,430
This isn't your village.

268
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,080
Lord Orden, what do you think of Mut?

269
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,380
He doesn't have his brother's talent.

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,650
But he's a hard worker.

271
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,710
What he's worked to build up 
won't let him down.

272
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,770
Someday he'll become 
a stronger knight than me.

273
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,370
I see.

274
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,760
You should tell that to Mut.

275
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,590
I do.

276
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,140
But it's gone to his head, 
so he doesn't improve.

277
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,700
Now that's a problem.

278
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,030
What?

279
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,660
I have to learn etiquette, too?

280
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,650
It's a soirée.

281
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,710
You expect a young man to attend it alone?

282
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,200
Or will his mommy escort him instead?

283
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
Good luck.

284
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,440
This past month has been hell.

285
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,600
We need the money, right?

286
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,990
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,730
We practiced. We might as well dance.

288
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,610
That really doesn't suit you.

289
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,050
Shall we dance as well?

290
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,740
I'm going to eat cake.

291
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,760
I see.

292
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,700
If not for this injury, 
I would've been in the vanguard.

293
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,340
Perhaps then, Wirt wouldn't have died.

294
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,480
Milord...

295
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,070
Looks like the soirée is over.

296
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,330
You've completed the job.

297
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,300
Gabel, give Frieren her reward.

298
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,270
Stark, you're an incredibly 
powerful warrior.

299
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,350
If you'd like—

300
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,110
I can't replace your son.

301
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,170
You're right.

302
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,610
And I can't replace your father.

303
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,720
But you don't have a home to return to.

304
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,950
The warrior village of the Klee region 
was destroyed by demons.

305
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,500
I know that much.

306
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,030
My son and I parted in anger.

307
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,010
We got into an argument 
over something trivial.

308
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,490
I told him I never wanted 
to see his face again.

309
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,330
I didn't mean it.

310
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,900
When I found you, 
I thought it was a miracle.

311
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,670
All the more reason I can't stay here.

312
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,900
I said something I didn't mean, too,

313
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,500
to the man who raised me.

314
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,220
So I have to bring him back 
stories of my travels.

315
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,910
I see.

316
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,800
Which grimoire should 
I choose for my reward?

317
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,330
Ms. Frieren, it's been half a day.

318
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,930
You're distressing Mr. Gabel.

319
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,020
Please hurry up.

320
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,610
Look. All the life has left him.

321
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,290
It'll be some time until 
they rebuild their forces.

322
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,960
What is it?

323
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,240
Nothing.

324
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,160
At the very least, he won't 
have to worry about his heir.

325
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,860
A forgotten hero, huh?

326
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,210
He's a forgotten hero. 
No one even knows his name.

327
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,710
He's totally decrepit.

328
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,980
He's been alone this whole time.

329
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,950
Humans grow quickly.

330
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,030
Episode 16
Long-Lived Friends

331
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,090
He's a long-lived friend of mine.
