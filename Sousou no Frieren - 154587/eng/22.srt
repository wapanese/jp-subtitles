12
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:53,087
FRIEREN: BEYOND JOURNEY'S END

13
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,001
EPISODE 22: FUTURE ENEMIES

14
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:14,049
So it's already evening...

15
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,066
It's actually pretty nice to be
able to laze around like this...

16
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,067
Who's that?

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,076
I'm coming!

18
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:46,002
Wait, Fern?

19
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:48,081
Didn't you two go
to the first-class mage exam?

20
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:53,033
We returned last night
after the first exam was over.

21
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:58,000
Master Stark,
it's already evening, you know?

22
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,041
You were sleeping, didn't you?

23
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,054
Did you stay up late?

24
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,042
Yes...

25
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:10,092
Anything else?

26
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:14,003
I also drank a juice
in the middle of the night...

27
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:18,076
Argh! Sorry! I said I'm sorry!

28
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:21,018
Oh boy, you've made her angry.

29
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:25,031
You just woke up too,
Mistress Frieren.

30
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,006
Now she's angry at me as well.

31
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,073
Looks like we're going to spend
this whole day trying to please her.

32
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,069
Do we have any plans?

33
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,049
How about we go eat something delicious?

34
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,082
Something delicious?

35
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,085
It's a little expensive,

36
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:45,058
but I found a nice place the last time
I was here with Himmel and the others.

37
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:49,021
That was over 80 years ago, right?

38
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,007
Will it still be there?

39
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:11,004
Oh my, the light is back on.

40
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,044
Like I said, it's not hard to fix.

41
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:17,049
Thank you as always, Richter.

42
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,002
Of course.

43
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:21,046
Oh, almost forgot.
You can have this.

44
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,043
Bye then.

45
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:32,092
Hey, old lady!

46
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:36,059
I'm not a kid anymore.
I'm a grown man.

47
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,013
In my eyes, you're still a child.

48
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:42,097
You liked those, right?

49
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:57,047
I'm sorry, but the shop is closed.

50
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:01,074
Some crazy old man made me
have a fistfight, you see.

51
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,058
So I have to get some rest.

52
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:08,041
Why, that must be rough, Richter.

53
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,004
Then how about we get
some food together?

54
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:13,025
There's a restaurant I'm looking for,

55
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:16,013
but Laufen and I don't know
our way around here.

56
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:21,001
Before that, why are you even
with Denken in the first place, Laufen?

57
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,026
And what's with those?

58
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:27,051
The old man bought it for me.
I'm not giving them to you.

59
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:30,031
Come on now, he's totally
treating you as his granddaughter.

60
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,002
Go home.
We are no longer a party.

61
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:38,032
You don't know how to
succeed in life, do you?

62
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:41,082
If you're going to keep
living as a mage,

63
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:45,007
you can profit
from getting on my good side.

64
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,079
There are tons of restaurants here.
Just pick any of them.

65
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:52,008
My wife...

66
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:56,079
It's a place I went to with my late wife.

67
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,017
I still can't forget the taste.

68
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:03,054
I assume you're paying?

69
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:06,009
Of course.

70
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,093
I told you, you won't regret this.

71
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,025
Glasses boy.

72
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:42,084
Übel.

73
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:45,009
Nice to finally meet you.

74
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,014
So you don't use your
clone in town, huh?

75
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:51,081
If you want to chat,
can we do it while we talk?

76
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,039
I mean, sure,

77
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,031
but I might accidentally kill you
if you started running.

78
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,086
Can I ask you a question?

79
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,069
You...

80
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,016
You don't think much
about murdering people, do you?

81
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,099
So why didn't you kill Wirbel?

82
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,008
You had the chance, right?

83
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,079
So you were watching?

84
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,054
I can't ever let my guard down, can I?

85
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:26,055
It's a bit hard to explain, but...

86
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:28,043
What a surprise.

87
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:30,093
You already had blood
on your hands for a long time,

88
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:33,056
and yet you still wish
to stay human?

89
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:36,006
That's right.

90
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:39,044
All this time is to prepare me
for the killing.

91
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,057
Maybe it's because
I empathized with him.

92
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:47,078
I also want to take my time
before I kill.

93
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:54,041
I can't move my body.
This is...

94
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,058
Sorganeil.

95
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,008
A spell to restrain
someone the user sees.

96
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,005
Magic that a certain
person specializes in

97
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:05,059
is deeply related
to their life and character.

98
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,051
You see, I've been this way
for a long time.

99
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,069
By empathizing with others,
I can use their magic.

100
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,067
But if I can't empathize with them,
then I can't use their magic.

101
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,073
Glasses boy,

102
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:25,048
your clones are perfect replicas, able to
have the exact same capabilities as you.

103
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:30,011
What goes in your head?
What kind of life have you lived?

104
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,074
Tell me.

105
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,058
I see.

106
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:38,016
So you're the type
that uses magic by feelings.

107
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:43,063
You can use magic without fully
understanding how it works.

108
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:50,038
I don't like dumb kids like you.

109
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,026
That doesn't answer my question.

110
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:57,047
I'm saying I'm not telling you
because I don't like it.

111
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,052
I don't care if you kill me.

112
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,003
Though you'll never be able to
empathize with me if you do that.

113
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,053
Actually, never mind.

114
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:19,005
I think I understand
who you are a little bit.

115
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,025
Is that so?

116
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,079
I'd like to get to know you better.

117
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:29,013
Where are you heading to?

118
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,055
Who knows.

119
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:32,003
Don't follow me.

120
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,008
This is it.

121
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:38,022
You have excellent taste, Denken.

122
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:42,031
This is the best restaurant in town.
I often come here as well.

123
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:47,098
It's been over 50 years since
I visited this place with my wife,

124
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:50,053
yet the atmosphere is still the same.

125
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,053
How curious.

126
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,002
Are you serious?

127
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:05,017
I can order as many
desserts as I want?

128
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:05,096
Yup.

129
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:08,046
Denken, It's Frieren.

130
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:10,092
Which one should I pick?

131
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:12,042
My recommendation would be...

132
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:16,043
Can I really have all these
even when it's not my birthday?

133
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,043
Leave them be.
They seem to be having fun.

134
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:23,048
Food is something to be enjoyed.

135
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,094
We're here for the same reason.

136
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,012
All right, time to gobble up.

137
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,012
That sure is a lot...

138
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:44,037
Mistress Frieren does this
every now and then, doesn't she?

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,041
I thank you for retrieving
the heirloom knife from the demons.

140
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:58,022
I, Lecker, the greatest
culinary genius of this century,

141
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:03,002
shall honor you with the utmost hospitality
and reward as much as I can offer.

142
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:05,089
You ordered quite a lot.

143
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,044
The food here is amazing, after all.

144
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,048
I need to savor the flavor.

145
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:14,003
No need to eat all that at once.
You can just come here again.

146
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,003
There have been many flavors I thought
I could experience again, but I couldn't.

147
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,079
Worry not, Mistress Frieren.

148
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:29,058
I intend to keep the flavor of this
restaurant for the next generations.

149
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:32,003
Even after 100 or 200 years
in the future.

150
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,009
Is that so?

151
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,008
It's funny.

152
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:40,009
Every chef always says that.

153
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,098
Yet they change the flavor
of other people's dishes

154
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,068
in order to leave their mark in history.

155
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:51,006
When that happens, you can go
search for even better flavors.

156
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:53,082
With all due respect, Master Himmel,

157
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:57,045
there is no one who can create
flavors that surpass mine.

158
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:00,091
Then make sure it stays
that way in the future.

159
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:04,083
That is the reward
that I ask from this quest.

160
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,017
If that is what the hero wishes for,

161
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:15,013
then I shall accomplish something
no other chef has ever achieved.

162
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,085
Frieren, this tastes really good!

163
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:27,039
Is it really okay for me
to feel this happy?

164
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,078
Well well.

165
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:39,003
Even after all that talk,
the taste did change.

166
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:41,078
That said,

167
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:45,066
I didn't have to go out
and search for better flavors.

168
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:49,012
This is much better
than how it was back then.

169
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,013
This is really great.

170
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,094
It's on your cheek, Master Stark.

171
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:03,005
You must eat your vegetables, too.

172
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,043
You really are turning
into her grandfather.

173
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,006
Huh, you surprisingly
don't eat much, do you?

174
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,044
What's wrong with that?

175
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:16,002
That was really delicious,
Mistress Frieren.

176
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:21,024
I'm glad she's feeling better now.

177
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:24,095
By the way, is your wallet doing okay?

178
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,013
There go my secret savings...

179
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:33,021
That is truly the state
of spiritual nothingness.

180
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:38,059
I'm proud of you for reaching
the quintessence of the art of war.

181
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:43,058
I have nothing left to teach you.

182
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:56,004
Who was that old man?

183
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:58,015
I don't know.

184
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,082
He just started talking to me
while I was training.

185
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:04,045
You always attract weird people,
don't you, Stark?

186
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:07,008
Well anyway, do you have a minute?

187
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,024
I need your help.

188
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:11,083
What happened?

189
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,042
She looks really angry.

190
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,063
This looks even worse than yesterday.

191
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:22,067
What did you do?

192
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:27,005
I overslept even though
I was in charge of shopping today...

193
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:29,006
But that happens all the time.

194
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:31,002
Why is she making a fuss now?

195
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:34,094
Fern is the type who keeps
bottling things up until it explodes.

196
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,085
And what happens when she does?

197
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:40,036
She completely ignores me.

198
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:42,036
What is this, a fight between kids?

199
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,007
I'm begging you, Stark!

200
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:48,078
Step in for me!
She won't talk to me at all!

201
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,084
What? No way!
I'm scared as well!

202
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,087
Right, of course.

203
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,075
I'm sorry for asking the impossible.

204
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,008
Um, Miss Fern?

205
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:10,035
Frieren has reflected
on her mistakes, so...

206
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:13,068
I want to eat.

207
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:16,094
I want to eat snacks.

208
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,011
She's such a pain...

209
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:27,061
W-Why don't we all go
get something to eat together?

210
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:30,012
Do I even have any
secret savings left?

211
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:39,088
Wait, isn't that...

212
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:44,005
Wirbel from the Northern
Magic Corps, wasn't it?

213
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:47,072
You're a warrior, aren't you?

214
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,026
Huh? What is this all of a sudden?

215
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:51,005
What do you think?

216
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,085
W-What...?

217
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,048
Nah, he's no good.

218
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:03,061
What are they doing?

219
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,057
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kanne.

220
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:12,002
You're wearing a much cuter
outfit than usual, Lawine.

221
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:15,087
It's because my brothers
returned from the royal capital.

222
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:22,038
They always brought back
so much unnecessary stuff.

223
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not some dress-up doll.

224
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:29,038
And my Mum enjoys it so much,
she just can't stop.

225
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:34,032
You're more spoiled than I am.

226
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:37,006
If that's how you think,
then please switch places with me.

227
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,039
Always being compared
to my excellent brothers is hell.

228
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,002
Come on, let's go.
I'm suffocating in this.

229
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:52,091
Then, let me be your escort
for today, sweet Lawine.

230
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,004
Ouch! Ouch!
You're going to tear them off!

231
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:27,057
Umm, Miss Fern...
Which one would you like?

232
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,032
Any will do.

233
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,009
You can choose, Master Stark.

234
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:36,058
Whenever she says that,
it means that none of them are good.

235
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:39,083
What must I do...?

236
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,000
I can't exactly help with that either...

237
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,017
Isn't that Frieren?

238
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:57,035
What a coincidence, I was just
thinking of visiting you at the inn.

239
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,006
Who are they?

240
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:02,089
They were in my party
for the first exam.

241
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:07,011
You see, Frieren helped us a lot!

242
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:09,073
Oh, and she was like a teacher to us.

243
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,086
Only because you two
kept fighting each other.

244
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:16,003
That's Lawine's fault.

245
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:19,074
It doesn't feel right
being the only guy here.

246
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:20,087
Hey!

247
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:23,062
- You're a warrior, aren't you?
- Huh?

248
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,071
Uh, hold on...

249
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,063
Please stop... What is this?

250
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:33,001
You're excellent, you know?

251
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,002
What does that even mean?!

252
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:37,035
The Continental Magic Association
gave a request

253
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:41,037
to exterminate a Fresser that's been
laying waste to some fields.

254
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,007
So we've been searching
for a vanguard.

255
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:48,027
I saw you back at the exam.
Is he your comrade? Can we borrow him?

256
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,004
- Go ahead.
- So mean!

257
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:55,049
- She's so mean...
- Are you sure it's okay to let him go?

258
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,023
I'm sure he'll be fine.
I didn't sense any malicious intent.

259
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,058
I almost couldn't believe
he was the same person.

260
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,091
Maybe he's the type that keeps
his work and private life separate?

261
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:06,058
My brothers are the same.

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,029
Here you go, Frieren.

263
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,019
A token of my gratitude.

264
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:16,093
But I didn't do anything
to deserve it.

265
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:18,076
That's not true.

266
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:23,081
If you weren't there, we couldn't have
advanced to the second exam.

267
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,014
Thank you again.

268
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:30,009
Thank you, Master Himmel!

269
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,075
You don't have to worry anymore.

270
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:34,093
Okay!

271
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:37,078
Go on. Your father
and mother are waiting.

272
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,086
Okay!

273
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,083
Why do you help people?

274
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,033
Because I'm a hero.

275
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,004
That's not what I meant.

276
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:55,092
Right...

277
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:59,018
Perhaps I do it for myself.

278
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:05,006
Maybe I want someone to remember me,
even for a little.

279
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:14,015
To live is to have someone to know
and remember you.

280
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:19,007
What do you need to do
to be remembered?

281
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,054
You just need to change their life,
even for just the slightest bit.

282
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,046
I'm sure that will be enough.

283
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:41,034
So you see, back then, Lawine was...

284
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:44,047
Nope, that was you, right?

285
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,031
Wait, was it?

286
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,041
Even that other time as well,
remember?

287
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:55,002
Mistress Frieren, this sweet
she gave is really delicious.

288
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,086
You're finally in a good mood...

289
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,023
Speaking of which, Frieren,

290
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,074
it took you a while to get up
on the second morning.

291
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:05,062
Please don't talk about that.
It'll put her in a bad mood again.

292
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,082
Hmph...

293
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,079
Frieren.

294
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:14,017
If it's anything like the previous ones,
the mage exam will have three parts.

295
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:16,009
We'll be rivals next time.

296
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,063
You're right.

297
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:28,027
What's that?

298
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,094
It's a notice of the next exam.

299
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:33,085
The location and date
are written here.

300
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:37,011
And the examiner in charge as well.

301
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:39,061
Sense is the examiner, huh?

302
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:41,007
We're so unlucky.

303
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:43,086
It's a shame after
we passed the first exam.

304
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:45,082
What do you mean?

305
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,083
Sense has been in charge
of four exams in the past.

306
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,096
No one passed in any of them.

307
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:26,032
This meat is delicious!

308
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:29,096
You're amazing.
That was some real art of war.

309
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:37,084
Such a cruel exam you're planning.

310
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,088
Is it?

311
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:44,022
I'm a pacifist.

312
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:48,068
Unlike you, Genau.

313
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:22,094
- Didn't know that would be here.
- Gargoyles!

314
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,086
- That's a mimic.
- How nasty.

315
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,049
- I'm afraid that is impossible.
- Not even any bone was left.

316
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,007
They're turning into
a fearsome threat.

317
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:31,003
EPISODE 23: CONQUERING THE LABYRINTH
The second exam is a dungeon raid.
