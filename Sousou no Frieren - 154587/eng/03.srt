00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

2
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,990
27 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the trade city of Warm, located in the central lands

3
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's split up and replenish 
our traveling supplies.

4
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,630
"Split up"? You've assigned me 
most of the necessities.

5
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,880
Food, water, daily essentials.

6
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,260
What are you going to buy?

7
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,020
Herbs and stuff.

8
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,520
<i>That's the face she makes when 
she's hiding something from me.</i>

9
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,860
<i>I've known Ms. Frieren for a long time.</i>

10
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,030
<i>Nothing good ever happens 
when she makes that face.</i>

11
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,570
<i>She's definitely going to buy 
something we don't need.</i>

12
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,450
I bought this.

13
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,040
What are you going to use that for?

14
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,040
This potion only dissolves clothing.

15
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,290
Go return it.

16
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,670
It's a book on magical history. 
Classroom study is important, too.

17
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,340
<i>Well, I wouldn't call that one unnecessary.</i>

18
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,140
I'll meet you at the inn later.

19
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,940
<i>We can't afford to waste 
our traveling funds.</i>

20
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,110
<i>I'd better keep a close eye on her.</i>

21
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>An accessory shop?</i>

22
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,380
You went to sleep without 
drying your hair again.

23
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,630
<i>So she's interested in fashion after all.</i>

24
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,720
<i>She seems really conflicted.</i>

25
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,770
<i>What's with that face?</i>

26
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,560
<i>I've never seen Ms. Frieren 
look so troubled before.</i>

27
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,840
<i>She spent a lot of time on that.</i>

28
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,010
<i>I suppose an accessory wouldn't hurt.</i>

29
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,720
<i>It's better than weird bones or medicines.</i>

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,520
<i>Maybe I'll resume my shopping soon.</i>

31
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,020
Is there a shop around here 
that sells good desserts?

32
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,150
<i>Now that's not fair.</i>

33
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,820
There's a tavern in the basement 
of that building. Try asking there.

34
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,740
Thank you.

35
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,000
<i>I haven't eaten anything sweet in months!</i>

36
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,680
This must be it.

37
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,440
Is there a shop around here 
that sells good desserts?

38
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,230
<i>This clearly isn't the right 
place to ask about desserts.</i>

39
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,530
A dessert joint? Who do you 
think you're talking to?

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,030
<i>Gulp.</i>

41
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,700
You better believe this city's got 
mountains of delicious desserts.

42
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,670
We can recommend you places all over.

43
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,540
<i>So they do know about desserts here.</i>

44
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,760
For such rough-looking guys, 
you know a lot about desserts.

45
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,680
A bit of sugar gives us the energy 
we need to adventure.

46
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,810
Nothing beats rewarding yourself with 
something sweet after a hard day's work.

47
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,850
<i>So they're adventurers. Though I'd say 
even "rough" is an understatement.</i>

48
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,270
<i>They're terrifying.</i>

49
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,230
See ya.

50
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,570
<i>Is she going to a dessert shop?</i>

51
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,490
<i>Huh? She's heading in 
the direction of our inn.</i>

52
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,080
<i>Is she going back?</i>

53
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,160
<i>I'm not even close to finishing my shopping.</i>

54
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,960
You're late.

55
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,050
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,220
Well, no matter. Put your things down.

57
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,600
Shall we go get something sweet to eat?

58
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,620
What a nice view. No wonder 
they recommended this place.

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,380
Ms. Frieren, I'm sorry for doubting you.

60
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,880
What are you talking about?

61
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,630
Nothing.

62
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,220
Choose whatever you'd like.

63
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,180
Can we afford it?

64
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,430
I've been saving up secretly.

65
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,470
<i>She's been keeping secret savings?</i>

66
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,770
Ms. Frieren, what will you have?

67
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,280
Well, today I feel like...

68
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,160
Merkur pudding, right?

69
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,910
You feel like eating Merkur 
pudding today, don't you?

70
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,660
How did you know?

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,330
How many years do you think 
we've traveled together?

72
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,880
I can just tell.

73
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,050
I don't know anything about the rest of you.

74
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,930
Then maybe I'll try harder 
to teach you about myself.

75
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,810
Incidentally, my favorite 
food is Ruf-omelette.

76
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,810
Mine's grapes. The sourer, the better.

77
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,020
Mine is—

78
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,770
Alcohol, right?

79
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,360
I knew that already, you corrupt priest.

80
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,990
That's nothing to blush about.

81
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,030
It's not a good sign that the one thing 
she remembers is your drinking.

82
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,410
Fern, I'm sorry.

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,660
Why are you apologizing?

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,960
I don't know anything about you,

85
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,340
so I don't know what you like.

86
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,010
Come to think of it, it's my birthday today.

87
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,070
What a beautiful hair ornament.

88
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,610
Thank you. I'm delighted.

89
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,490
Really?

90
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,620
You seem to be hopelessly dense, 
so let me be clear.

91
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm overjoyed that you 
tried to get to know me.

92
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,380
Only because I tried?

93
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,760
You really don't understand 
people's feelings, do you?

94
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,570
Shall we get going?

95
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,150
Sure.

96
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,420
By the way, Ms. Frieren, 
does this journey have a purpose?

97
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,170
Not particularly. I'm satisfying 
my desire to collect spells.

98
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,600
But whenever possible,

99
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,140
I'd like to retrace the adventures 
I had with Himmel and the others

100
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,060
before all sign of them fades away.

101
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,440
That's something important to you, right?

102
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,070
I don't know, so I'm trying 
to figure that out.

103
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,120
You've finally grown taller than me.

104
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm sixteen now. I could be your older sister.

105
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,960
My older sister?

106
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,550
Our diets are mostly the same, 
so it can't be that.

107
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,380
How strange.

108
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,970
Episode 3: Killing Magic

109
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,980
27 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in Größe Forest, located in the central lands

110
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,710
You've grown quite accustomed 
to casting defensive spells.

111
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,670
Let's put that into practice.

112
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,550
What?

113
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,690
I aimed for the gaps in your defenses.

114
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,020
If this had been a real battle, you'd be dead.

115
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,820
Now, then...

116
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,650
How will you handle this?

117
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,650
Like this.

118
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,780
I see.

119
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,030
Can you withstand this?

120
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,290
That's enough for today.

121
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,180
Defensive magic is powerful, 
but it rapidly depletes your mana.

122
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,560
You'll exhaust your mana supply in seconds 
if you try to maintain it over a large area.

123
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,440
So the best option is to cast it in select 
locations at the moment of impact.

124
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,530
Exactly.

125
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,910
Hup.

126
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,670
We've been practicing nothing 
but defensive magic.

127
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,300
It directly improves your chances of survival.

128
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,430
You're right.

129
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,390
A single defensive spell can defend 
against most offensive spells.

130
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,770
It's strange how powerful they are.

131
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,270
Fern, you haven't read the book on 
magical history I gave you, have you?

132
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,480
Magic is about theory as much as practice.

133
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,570
I suppose I'll have to read 
it to you at bedtime.

134
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,030
I'll read it myself.

135
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm not a child, after all.

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,170
This village is where you wanted to go, right?

137
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,050
Are you here to collect odd spells again?

138
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,050
No, not this time.

139
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,350
Now it's up to the weather.

140
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,050
Yeah.

141
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,390
I have a question.

142
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,980
It's an elf.

143
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,060
White hair...

144
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,320
Are you Ms. Frieren?

145
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,780
How did you know?

146
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,910
You're here to see the place where 
Qual was sealed, aren't you?

147
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,740
I'll show you the way.

148
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,000
Qual?

149
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,870
The Elder Sage of Corruption, Qual.

150
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,800
He's a demon who committed terrible 
atrocities in this region eighty years ago,

151
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,840
before being sealed away 
by Himmel the Hero and his party.

152
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,770
That seal will break soon, 
so I'm here to defeat him,

153
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,850
but how did you know?

154
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,520
I haven't told anyone about this.

155
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,780
Mr. Himmel visited this town every year 
until about thirty years ago.

156
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,070
He was apparently checking 
on the condition of the seal.

157
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,030
He always was a softie.

158
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,910
He used to talk about you.

159
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,670
He called you heartless 
for not checking on him.

160
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,960
She's cold, isn't she?

161
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,670
Quite cold.

162
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,920
Sorry about that.

163
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,680
But she's not so heartless that 
she'd leave the village to its fate.

164
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,810
She'll come when the seal is about to break.

165
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,440
That's what he said.

166
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,190
I see.

167
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,450
This is it?

168
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,800
It's become rather unstable.

169
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,680
I'll dispel the seal tomorrow 
and take care of Qual.

170
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,230
You're the one who sealed Qual, aren't you?

171
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,810
Is there a reason you did that?

172
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,820
He was simply too strong.

173
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,490
I couldn't beat him.

174
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,540
Even among the Demon King's forces, 
Qual was an exceptional mage.

175
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:45,710
He developed the first piercing spell 
in history, which he called Zoltraak.

176
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,880
It pierced not only defensive spells but 
the magic resistance of armor as well.

177
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,590
It directly targeted and destroyed the body.

178
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,770
It's said that in this region,

179
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,230
40% of adventurers and 70% of mages 
were killed by Zoltraak.

180
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,860
That's too powerful.

181
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,490
Yes, it was. Much too powerful.

182
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,740
And that's why it backfired on him.

183
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,160
What do you mean?

184
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,250
You really haven't read that 
history tome, have you?

185
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,130
Are you sure I shouldn't read it to you?

186
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll start reading it right now.

187
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,970
No, it's fine.

188
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,260
It's more important that 
you get a good night's sleep.

189
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,060
You'll see tomorrow, anyway.

190
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,650
I'm dispelling the seal.

191
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,400
Don't let your guard down.

192
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,730
It's been a while, Frieren.

193
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
How many years has it been?

194
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,310
Eighty.

195
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,070
A mere eighty years, huh?

196
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,990
For us, anyway.

197
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,660
And the Demon King?

198
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,870
We killed him.

199
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,780
I see.

200
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,250
Then I shall avenge him.

201
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,750
Fern, cast a defensive spell in front of us.

202
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,800
Zoltraak!

203
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm surprised.

204
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,770
You blocked Zoltraak.

205
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,150
That defensive spell of yours 
must be powerful indeed.

206
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,990
Ms. Frieren, what's going on?

207
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,660
That was ordinary offensive magic.

208
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
That's Zoltraak.

209
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,790
The killing magic he developed.

210
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,800
Qual, your magic was simply too powerful.

211
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:45,180
After you were sealed away, mages across 
the land studied and analyzed Zoltraak.

212
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,650
In just a few years, Zoltraak was 
incorporated into humankind's magic system,

213
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,860
and powerful new defensive spells 
were developed.

214
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,570
The magic resistance offered by equipment 
has improved significantly as well,

215
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,450
making Zoltraak no longer killing magic.

216
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,040
Now it's just "ordinary offensive magic."

217
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,420
Eighty years is quite a long time for humans.

218
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,930
Qual, if you don't resist, 
I'll make your death painless.

219
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,310
I see.

220
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,180
I see, I see.

221
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,440
It attunes itself to the offensive 
magic and disperses its power.

222
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,730
A complex spell indeed.

223
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,110
It must consume a great deal of mana.

224
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,070
He figured out the weakness 
of defensive magic.

225
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,910
Fern, you know what to do, right?

226
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,830
Yes. I saw it in our practices.

227
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,080
Then protect me as well.

228
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,610
So you can fly? Interesting.

229
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,530
Zoltraak.

230
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:43,630
Frieren... My spell...

231
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,320
Now we can live in peace.

232
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,410
That hat...

233
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,280
This thing?

234
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,910
Around here, the sun's rays are strong 
even at this time of year,

235
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,000
so all farmers wear them.

236
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,250
I've seen this hat before.

237
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,720
You're the brat who flipped my skirt up.

238
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,760
Take that!

239
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,940
What do you think you're doing, brat?

240
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,060
I'll kill you! You saw what I've 
been wanting to see all this time!

241
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,650
You'd better not kill him.

242
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,110
I'll show you mine.

243
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,110
Yikes.

244
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,030
You're still alive.

245
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,790
Thanks to you, 
I'll be able to live even longer.

246
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,040
I'm glad I trusted Himmel's words and waited.

247
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,430
Ms. Frieren, they thanked you.

248
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,930
They didn't thank me.

249
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,060
The people of this village 
believed in Himmel.

250
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,450
I don't understand, exactly, 
but I think Mr. Himmel believed in you.

251
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,790
What is it?

252
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,290
Nothing.

253
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,720
Because I felt sorry for you.

254
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,720
Because it's more convenient that way.

255
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,850
She was an irresponsible person.

256
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,720
That's enough depressing talk.

257
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,390
Are you sure you haven't been 
around since prehistoric times?

258
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,060
You're more conscientious than you look.

259
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,060
It was a long time ago.

260
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,140
Aureole, the land where souls rest.

261
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,940
Episode 4
The Land Where Souls Rest
