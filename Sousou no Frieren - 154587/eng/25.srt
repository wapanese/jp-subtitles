1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,078
We have very little information
at the moment.

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:08,024
I suggest we prepare for the possibility
that it doesn't have a mind.

3
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:11,087
Though in that case, we'll have to
take it down by brute force.

4
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,054
Can you do that?

5
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,037
Dunno, I'm not sure.

6
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,000
Excuse me,
if that is the case,

7
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,051
then I might be able
to kill Mistress Frieren.

8
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:31,064
Is that so?

9
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:33,014
Yes.

10
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:45,002
Okay then, let's come up with a strategy.

11
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:13,009
FRIEREN: BEYOND JOURNEY'S END

12
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,099
EPISODE 25: A FATAL VULNERABILITY

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,058
Okay, just to confirm,

14
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:26,013
in case the clones do have a mind,

15
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,059
then the plan is to use
Edel's mental magic

16
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:33,008
in order to break my mental defenses,
and have Fern kill it, okay?

17
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:33,051
Okay.

18
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,053
Okay? Just like that?

19
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,064
DÃ¼nste.

20
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:50,024
Where is Edel?

21
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,095
Sense's clone attacked us
and she decided to drop out.

22
00:02:57,062 --> 00:03:00,002
I see.
Did Blei drop out as well?

23
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:07,013
He bought some time
that allowed me to escape.

24
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:11,069
I hope he managed
to escape to safety.

25
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,018
Don't mind me, just go!

26
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,009
B-But...!

27
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,083
It's better than
not having any of us pass!

28
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,041
I have information for you.

29
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,074
Can we cooperate?

30
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:46,033
That was my intention all along.

31
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:50,036
Is there anyone here who can heal?

32
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,072
I have a holy scripture with me,
so I can cast simple healing magic.

33
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,007
Please do.

34
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:05,031
I see.

35
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:08,031
So the clones do not have a mind.

36
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:11,094
Yes. According to Edel,

37
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:15,044
they only imitate
how the original's mind works.

38
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:17,095
They don't have a mind of their own.

39
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:21,007
So we've lost
the easy way to defeat it.

40
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,095
We need to form a strategy
with that in mind.

41
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:28,083
Even so, Frieren,

42
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,058
there are still too many
unknown factors.

43
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:37,084
The biggest issue is the true identity
of the clone and its summoner.

44
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:42,009
We mustn't take action
until we understand their nature.

45
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:46,097
We need to figure out whether the clone
has any weakness specific to them.

46
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:50,085
If that clone really is
as strong as Frieren,

47
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:52,056
there will likely be casualties.

48
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:56,082
I am not telling you.

49
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:57,099
Right, of course.

50
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:00,091
They don't have any weaknesses.

51
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,066
The one controlling the clones

52
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:07,041
is a monster from the mythic age
called Spiegel.

53
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,002
Lawine...

54
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:10,079
How do you know that?

55
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:15,007
My eldest brother was a member
of the advance party

56
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:18,081
that the Continental Magic Association
sent to raid the Ruins of the King's Tomb.

57
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:22,023
So you have information
regarding this place.

58
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:24,089
No wonder you could make it this far.

59
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:30,002
But your action doesn't seem logical.

60
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:35,069
You should've shared your information
and cooperated with us from the beginning.

61
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,049
It doesn't seem like everyone was
in the mood to work together back then.

62
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:43,045
And before we knew it,
Frieren and Fern were already gone.

63
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:44,099
Besides, old man,

64
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,062
you're the type to ruthlessly abandon
their allies unless there's a rule, right?

65
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,054
What makes you think
we'd cooperate with you?

66
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:56,017
They sure hate you, huh?

67
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:58,088
Yes, I may already be old,

68
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,008
but it's still not nice
to hear it so directly.

69
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,068
Maybe you should apologize for that.

70
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:06,018
My bad, old man.

71
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,081
According to the advance
party's observations,

72
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:17,023
the Spiegel is beyond that door,
inside the treasure vault.

73
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:22,057
They say that the monster itself is frail
and incapable of attacking.

74
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,071
If we defeat it,
all of the clones will disappear.

75
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:31,014
We reached the same conclusion
after using our mana detection.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,075
The main body is beyond that door.

77
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:40,009
But the door has a powerful seal on it.

78
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,051
I can confirm that as well.

79
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:45,084
It has to be the work of my clone.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,085
It's a spell that shuts the door
of a treasure vault at the risk of one's life.

81
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,023
It's one of the folk magic's
strongest binding spells.

82
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,094
That door won't open
until the caster dies.

83
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:04,045
We can bypass the door
by breaking through the wall,

84
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:06,061
but it's probably ready
for that as well.

85
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:12,033
So what you're saying is,
in order to defeat the Spiegel,

86
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:16,015
we have to defeat that clone
no matter what, huh?

87
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,005
If you want to defeat it,
I suggest you hurry.

88
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,071
What do you mean?

89
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:27,055
Spiegel creates clones
of everyone in the dungeon.

90
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:29,068
Those clones have a habit

91
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:33,047
where they start gathering
at the innermost depth as time goes on.

92
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:41,044
The last advance party was mostly
annihilated aside from my brother's unit.

93
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:48,002
They were defeated right before the depth,
which happens to be exactly here.

94
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,016
I see.

95
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,062
Umm...

96
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,034
The clones imitate
the target's mind, right?

97
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:05,096
Then if the original has
a weakness in their behavior,

98
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:07,084
the clone must have it as well,
correct?

99
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,059
I would believe so.

100
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:14,097
In that case,
I believe we might have a chance.

101
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:17,069
What is that weakness
you're talking about?

102
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:22,044
Mistress Frieren.

103
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,073
Could you please stand
next to that wall?

104
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:26,074
Sure.

105
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:47,092
My word...

106
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,068
Impossible...

107
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:52,018
How could this be?

108
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,022
Did you notice it?

109
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,042
You noticed something?

110
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,043
Nope.

111
00:08:57,073 --> 00:09:01,085
Indeed, this is Frieren's fatal vulnerability.

112
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:05,069
How did I miss this
when I was fighting her?

113
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,007
No, it's exactly because I expected her
to be an expert, so I didn't realize it.

114
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,016
The second she casts a spell,

115
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:19,033
her mana detection breaks off
for just a split second.

116
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,054
Isn't that a common mistake
that apprentice mages make?

117
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,084
I've never been good at it.

118
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:29,059
If you were aware of it,
why didn't you tell us?

119
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:32,026
I mean, it's embarrassing...

120
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:34,051
This isn't the time for that.

121
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:39,073
But she's still too skilled
in all other areas.

122
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:45,023
I doubt there's any mage
that could make use of that opening.

123
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,048
In any case, we're going
to hold a strategy meeting.

124
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,076
Even if we can somehow
defeat Frieren's clone...

125
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:16,093
Mistress Frieren,
you seem happy for some reason.

126
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,077
I am.

127
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:29,065
I think we've mostly
figured it out now.

128
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:34,007
So, Eisen, you keep the enemy's attention,
and we'll flank it.

129
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:37,024
You provide covering fire, Frieren.

130
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:38,028
What about Heiter?

131
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,091
He's got a hangover today,
so he's no good.

132
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,004
He's gone...

133
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,001
I'm just reminded

134
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:09,006
of how we used to discuss things
like this to defeat dungeon bosses.

135
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:32,096
All right.

136
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,035
Let's begin conquering this dungeon.

137
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,022
Can we win?

138
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,005
Don't worry.

139
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:43,022
There isn't a dungeon
that can't be beaten.

140
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:47,001
And I can say that
as the mage of the party

141
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:49,094
that has conquered
the most dungeons in history.

142
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:59,066
Are you sure we should leave fighting
Frieren's clone to just you two?

143
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:04,041
It's easier to predict its movement
with a smaller party.

144
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:10,029
It's true that we'd most certainly win
if everyone fought together,

145
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,088
but most of us would end up dead.

146
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:17,005
There probably won't even be time
to use the escape golems.

147
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:18,063
So you're saying...

148
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,044
It's more important for us to stop
the other clones from reaching here?

149
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:33,002
If they flank us,
we'd be wiped out, after all.

150
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,011
All right, let's proceed with the plan.

151
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:39,003
Very well. I pray for your success.

152
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:43,008
Open it.

153
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,056
Now then.

154
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:10,002
Let's tell each other who would be
the worst opponent for you to fight against.

155
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,005
Judrajim.

156
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:44,003
It's moving exactly
as Mistress Frieren said it would.

157
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,007
Vollzanbel.

158
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:06,066
Its mana detection is interrupted.

159
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:11,008
"I" would be wary of Fern
who took the opportunity to hide.

160
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:16,009
But it would have its hands full with
fending an opponent of equal strength.

161
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:19,084
It can't possibly afford
to look for Fern.

162
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,026
After all,

163
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:26,001
no one knows how dangerous I am
more than myself.

164
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,023
It'll be all right.

165
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:37,073
Even I can't easily detect you
once you completely conceal yourself.

166
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,069
But would it really be enough
to attack it with just Zoltraak?

167
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:46,007
It's the quickest to cast, after all.

168
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:52,045
Besides, Zoltraak is
a relatively new spell for elves.

169
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:57,071
It hasn't been around long enough
for me to block it by instinct.

170
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:01,026
No matter what I do,
it may be for just a moment,

171
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,047
but when I have to deal with it,

172
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:06,097
my reaction is always slightly delayed.

173
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,076
But it's different for you, Fern.

174
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:15,001
For you, Zoltraak is something that
always existed since you were born.

175
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:19,061
Since it's fundamental to mages now,
you should be able to do it without thinking.

176
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:25,036
Your Zoltraak will be able to kill me.

177
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:28,091
Put every bit of your mana into it.

178
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,003
Frieren.

179
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,064
I'm pretty sure you hate me.

180
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:53,027
So why did you come to me?

181
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:57,057
I honestly thought
we'd never see each other again.

182
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:01,065
I've come to deliver my master's will.

183
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,004
It has been 50 years since then...

184
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:09,053
I see.
So Flamme has died.

185
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:12,053
Aren't you sad?

186
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:15,021
She's just an apprentice
I raised on a whim.

187
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,057
This is almost like a report.

188
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,005
What did she write?

189
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:31,068
It seems the Emperor approved
nationwide research into magic.

190
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,094
Until now, humans always considered
magic to be the work of demons,

191
00:16:38,023 --> 00:16:41,048
so any open research
was considered taboo.

192
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:44,019
Flamme convinced him to change it,

193
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:49,086
and has been working as the instructor
for the newly established imperial mages.

194
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:55,008
She's asking me to take over
that training in this will.

195
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,029
What a greedy girl.

196
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:04,034
Getting an approval for the research
of magic is already a huge achievement,

197
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:06,063
and yet she's asking for more?

198
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,047
Is that something incredible?

199
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:12,076
It means that the largest
single empire on the continent

200
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:16,085
will begin researching magic
and using it for military purposes.

201
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:20,052
The surrounding countries
won't ignore this.

202
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:24,086
In just a few decades, the use of magic
will spread throughout the continent.

203
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,074
The era where any human
can use magic is coming.

204
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,024
This means that in the near future,

205
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:37,012
humanity will have the power
to fight back against the Demon King.

206
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:40,081
I see. That is indeed
very incredible.

207
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,071
It really is.

208
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,076
But, that is not what I want.

209
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,001
Go home, Frieren.

210
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:56,051
I can't possibly comply with her will.

211
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,002
It truly disgusts me.

212
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,094
An era where anyone can use magic?

213
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:06,002
Magic is meant to be special.

214
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:10,015
I have no intention of teaching it
to those without the potential.

215
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,095
How dare she ask me for this.

216
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,016
In the end, Flamme and I
could never understand each other.

217
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,033
She was nothing but an apprentice
I raised on a whim.

218
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:21,091
My master said

219
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:26,092
that you would get angry
and tear up the will.

220
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:32,013
Even so, she wanted to let you know,

221
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,068
that her dream came true.

222
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:37,018
I don't really understand it, though.

223
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:43,014
I will be leaving, then.

224
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,004
I don't think we'll ever
see each other again.

225
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:47,061
Frieren.

226
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,094
Before you leave,
how about a little walk?

227
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:55,078
We have all the time
in the world, after all.

228
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:02,007
An era where anyone can use magic.

229
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,029
That was Flamme's dream.

230
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,008
I'm sure that she initially didn't
even think about helping humanity

231
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:12,026
or gaining the power
to fight back against demons.

232
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,004
It didn't matter to her back then.

233
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,027
Do you know her favorite spell?

234
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,052
It was a spell to produce
a field of flowers.

235
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:31,032
A pointless spell
that is good for nothing.

236
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:39,024
She truly did love magic.

237
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:45,005
She seriously wished that everyone
in the world could use it.

238
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,081
It was revolting.

239
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:52,071
It was like a cute dream
a little girl would have.

240
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:56,005
But that was actually the case.

241
00:19:57,068 --> 00:20:04,014
It was a fantasy that she would tell me
when she was far shorter than me.

242
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:10,044
To be honest, I think such a time would
only come much farther in the future,

243
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:13,057
or that it wasn't something
that she could make happen.

244
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:22,012
I always thought that her life is so short
that it may as well be nonexistent,

245
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,008
and yet she ascended to become
the bringer of magic to humanity.

246
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,021
Master would always
make decisions so quickly.

247
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:32,021
As if something was rushing her.

248
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,059
Humans have a limited lifespan.

249
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,069
They're in a place much closer
to death than we are.

250
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:46,081
There are many moments in life
when we all must make important decisions.

251
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:50,048
And for them, they cannot afford
to delay those choices.

252
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:56,023
We can postpone a decision
for a century or two.

253
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,091
It won't even hinder us in the slightest
if we leave it for a millennium.

254
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:06,012
Our time is nearly infinite, after all.

255
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:09,054
Frieren.

256
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:15,005
A long time has passed since humans
established what they call civilization.

257
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,055
Things will move faster
and faster from now on.

258
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,051
In just one thousand years...

259
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:29,001
In just one thousand years,
the era of humans will arrive.

260
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:37,003
We will be overtaken by humans.

261
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:46,079
Do not neglect your training, Frieren.

262
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:00,055
If someone would end up killing you,

263
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:02,055
it would be the Demon King...

264
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,018
...or a human mage.

265
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,098
Isn't that exciting, Serie?

266
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:20,036
From this point,
we will see so many mages,

267
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,053
and so many different kinds of magic.

268
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:22,069
- Now then, let's get this over with.
- Worst case scenario, we both might die.

269
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,065
- Amazing...
- Worst case scenario, we both might die.

270
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:24,073
- I'm counting on you.
- This opening won't do either.

271
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:25,057
- Mistress Frieren...
- This opening won't do either.

272
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:27,007
- This is within expectations.
- I guess I have no choice.

273
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,099
EPISODE 26: THE HEIGHT OF MAGIC
This is the height of magic.
