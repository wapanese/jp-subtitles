1
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,540
<i>Now that's scary.</i>

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,530
<i>She's probably using magic 
that cuts through physical objects.</i>

3
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,480
<i>It's a simple type of magic, 
but I can't see its trajectory.</i>

4
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,710
It's impossible to block all of them, but...

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,250
What's the matter? You're not 
going to follow up on that?

6
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,130
I might've gone a bit too hard.

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,980
Maybe.

8
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,100
The range of your magic is 
about five meters, isn't it?

9
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,680
Correct. So, what do we do now?

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,410
Are we going to whale on each 
other with basic spells again?

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,060
No, that won't be necessary.

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,490
<i>His magic is devoid of character.</i>

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,710
<i>It's underhanded, 
for the sole purpose of winning.</i>

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,010
<i>The girl fighting Wirbel now 
will probably be killed.</i>

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,130
Now, then.

16
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,100
<i>A saturation attack?</i>

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,950
<i>How can she control so many 
attack spells at once?</i>

18
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,370
This is an absurd feat of strength.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,190
It doesn't have a shred of character.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,680
I can't... handle them all.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,610
Beyond Journey's End

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Episode 20: Necessary Killing

23
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,980
Sorganeil.

24
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,800
I can't move.

25
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,720
<i>I can't control my mana, either.</i>

26
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,020
<i>It's a powerful binding spell.</i>

27
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,040
<i>If he has this, why didn't 
he catch a Stille himself?</i>

28
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,320
<i>Though I suppose it's useless 
if he can't find one.</i>

29
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,250
My spell binds those I can see.

30
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,960
As long as I keep looking at you, 
you won't be able to move.

31
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,560
I could easily kill you in your current state.

32
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,960
<i>Not only that, but he was holding back.</i>

33
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,600
<i>If he'd truly intended to kill me,</i>

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,830
<i>he would've bound me during his initial ambush.</i>

35
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,470
This is your last chance.

36
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,190
Leave the Stille and walk away.

37
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,820
<i>Aw, he's no fun.</i>

38
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,520
<i>And I thought I'd finally 
found a fight to the death.</i>

39
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,020
<i>So threatening me into handing over 
our Stille was his goal after all.</i>

40
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,680
Wait a minute.

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,740
Why do you need to order me to do that?

42
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,500
You could just take the Stille 
from me while I couldn't move.

43
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,550
So you need to keep my entire body in view.

44
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,440
No wonder you don't use it 
against multiple targets.

45
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,530
You were aiming for my eyes.

46
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,730
That's the logical choice, isn't it?

47
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,110
No. If I were you, I'd go for 
the kill and attack the neck.

48
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,410
That would end the fight.

49
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,260
You should've been able to do that.

50
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,490
There were people on the battlefield 
who did similar things.

51
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,760
They were all perverts who enjoyed killing.

52
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,260
I guess I should kill you now.

53
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,700
Have you ever killed women 
and children before?

54
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,090
You think I haven't?

55
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,020
Huh. What hells have you seen?

56
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,210
Trying to buy time?

57
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,750
Fine. I'll play along.

58
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,000
The Northern Magic Corps are mercenaries 
who specialize in fighting demons,

59
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,890
but in times of need, we're mobilized 
to fight in wars between nations.

60
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,530
People know exactly what makes 
other people weak.

61
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:20,940
The fiendish act of sending women 
and children to war wasn't uncommon.

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,200
It wasn't hell.

63
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,100
It's commonplace in the far north.

64
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,580
I see. I've heard enough.

65
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,890
You're not going to kill me?

66
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:56,480
I think the magic a person specializes in 
is strongly related to their life and nature.

67
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,350
A spell that binds your opponent feels like 
a way to delay killing them.

68
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,330
I see. That's why you let me buy time, too.

69
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,510
I'm surprised.

70
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:17,000
Your hands are already drenched in blood,
and yet you still want to remain human.

71
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,460
That's right. I use this time 
to prepare myself to kill.

72
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,730
But you know, miss...

73
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,860
Though I may hesitate, 
I've always killed everyone I had to.

74
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,060
Later, miss.

75
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,720
Don't move.

76
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
You're kidding, right?

77
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,290
You beat Ehre?

78
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,570
<i>I didn't sense her at all.</i>

79
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,870
I'm surprised. You can 
completely conceal your mana?

80
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,540
You must be the one who captured the Stille.

81
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,640
We just got lucky.

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,430
We happened upon a Stille's roost,

83
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,410
and her master had taught her 
a spell that captures a bird.

84
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,560
And you've got a spell that binds anything,
 so I guess you just got really unlucky.

85
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,290
Seriously. I've got no luck.

86
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,060
You were fighting Ehre.

87
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,310
What happened to her?

88
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,800
I killed her.

89
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,470
The conditions for passing the first test

90
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:41,990
are possessing a Stille by sunset tonight 
and having all your party members present.

91
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,800
We lost. I'm getting out of here.

92
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,120
I thought you were going to kill me.

93
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,720
I've already failed the test.

94
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,880
Killing you would be unnecessary.

95
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,850
Later.

96
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,700
You can attack me from behind if you want.

97
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,470
You'll just be turning an unnecessary kill 
back into a necessary one.

98
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,670
Ms. Übel.

99
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,600
I know.

100
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,980
You're a good liar.

101
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,870
We should go to assist 
Mr. Land while we can.

102
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,420
That four-eyes will be fine. 
He's quite the pretender.

103
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,260
It's over.

104
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,540
This is impressive.

105
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,020
You turned countless petals into metal 
and controlled them precisely

106
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,650
to slip them through my defenses.

107
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,560
But this is your own invention, isn't it?

108
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,280
Spells like that often 
neglect the fundamentals.

109
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,170
I always watch and wait when 
fighting an opponent I don't know.

110
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,390
I know exactly what your weaknesses are.

111
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,550
I'll probably win.

112
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,320
Talkative, aren't you?

113
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,540
How do you intend to win when 
I've ruined your dominant arm?

114
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,020
If you won't surrender, 
then I'll take your head off.

115
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,280
I told you, I'm still observing you 
before the battle begins.

116
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,640
You're not very good at 
detecting mana, are you?

117
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,410
Illusion magic.

118
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,900
It has substance, so strictly speaking,
 it's more like a clone.

119
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,020
How long—

120
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,770
Since the beginning, 
when the first test started.

121
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,930
I don't trust other people.

122
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Killed her, my ass.

123
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,230
That bitch lied like it was nothing.

124
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,950
Wake up, Ehre.

125
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,370
Out of mana? Pathetic.

126
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,400
Didn't you graduate at the top of your class?

127
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,610
She overwhelmed me with 
ordinary offensive magic.

128
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,280
I couldn't block them all.

129
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,290
You don't believe me, do you?

130
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,660
No, I do.

131
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,290
Why'd you attack her head-on like an idiot?

132
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,430
It's not like you couldn't have won.

133
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,360
<i>But if she could pull off this stunt 
with ordinary offensive magic alone,</i>

134
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,920
<i>she must be one nasty monster.</i>

135
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,110
Let's go. We'll meet up with Scharf.

136
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,920
Wait. I can't walk.

137
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,640
Oh, fine.

138
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,670
Are you really going to float me 
there like an object?

139
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,870
Carry me on your back!

140
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,000
Why am I doing this?

141
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,280
Do you sense Scharf nearby?

142
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,560
He's on the other side of those bushes.

143
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,690
Hey, Scharf. Help me carry...

144
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,590
Wirbel, carry me on your back.

145
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,650
I feel numb and can't move.

146
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,320
Damn it.

147
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,400
Seriously, what the hell is going on?

148
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,910
What's this sound?

149
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,740
Probably the rain.

150
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,210
It's started raining outside the barrier.

151
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,630
It's like my current mental state.

152
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,460
The sun will set in two or three more hours.

153
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,610
The first test will end.

154
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,480
Two of us are out of the fight.

155
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,580
We can't steal anyone's Stille like this.

156
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,140
We're going to fail.

157
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,990
But you're helping us anyway. 
You're a nice guy.

158
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,090
I don't mind ditching you 
two here, you know.

159
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,450
Please don't abandon us.

160
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,670
Don't cry. You're a man, aren't you?

161
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,080
Is that kindness the reason 
you fight demons?

162
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,140
You saved my village, too.

163
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,160
Are you stupid?

164
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,680
I couldn't risk my life for kindness.

165
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,600
People fight for their own desires.

166
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,810
In my case, I had ulterior motives.

167
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,730
I was in love with a girl from my hometown.

168
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,800
Exactly 29 years ago, the demon activity 
in the northern lands increased.

169
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,990
She and her entire family 
fled to the central lands.

170
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,610
I was a dumb kid.

171
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,570
I decided to show off for her.

172
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,050
I'll kill all those shitty demons.

173
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,910
When I do, come back to this village.

174
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,670
I was only four or five years old.

175
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,580
I don't even remember 
her face or name anymore.

176
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,840
What an idiot.

177
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,790
Yeah. I'm an idiot.

178
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,160
Are we sailing back home again? 
I get seasick easily.

179
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,390
Want me to introduce you to my grandpa?

180
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,880
Since he's a first-class mage, 
we can travel by land to...

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
Hey, Wirbel.

182
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,970
What is it?

183
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,040
Look.

184
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,550
You can't be serious. 
What was all that effort for?

185
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,740
Took long enough for luck to go my way.

186
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,640
Frieren, she's not doing anything.

187
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,110
<i>An elf, huh?</i>

188
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,110
<i>She's a skilled mage.</i>

189
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,560
<i>I doubt Laufen's magic would work a 
second time now that she's seen it.</i>

190
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,560
<i>But just once was enough.</i>

191
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,120
<i>We're not trying to kill each other here.</i>

192
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,890
She vanished?

193
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,090
Frieren, the Stille...

194
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,140
She took it, huh?

195
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,960
That's an interesting spell.

196
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,360
It's comfortable inside the barrier 
even when it's raining.

197
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,090
Come to think of it, aren't you the proctor 
for the second test, Sense?

198
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,200
Looks like you killed a few promising 
test-takers again, Genau.

199
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,960
Don't make me laugh.

200
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,950
No promising test-taker would die from this.

201
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,550
Besides, first-class mages 
simply have that much worth.

202
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,340
You should know that.

203
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:55,150
Either way, choosing a target immune to 
mana detection for a mage test wasn't nice.

204
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,370
Whether or not they'll catch one 
comes down to luck.

205
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,610
This is a battle masquerading 
as a competition.

206
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,920
Luck is a skill.

207
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,180
And some test-takers seem to have captured 
a Stille without relying on luck.

208
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,300
The sun will set in three hours.

209
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,560
The battle will grow more intense.

210
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,910
Who do you think will survive?

211
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,140
A third will remain.

212
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,570
Denken will be among them.

213
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,780
His skill is comparable 
to a first-class mage's.

214
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,530
What's an old man only interested 
in wealth and political power

215
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,870
doing getting certified now?

216
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,180
Is he doing it for the privilege after all?

217
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,540
Who knows?

218
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,350
He's getting up there in years.

219
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,700
I'm sure he's got something on his mind.

220
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,290
The spell that girl used 
was Jilwer, wasn't it?

221
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,680
That's a folk spell used by a mountain tribe 
in the southern lands.

222
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,940
That's right.

223
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,700
What's a Jilwer?

224
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,570
A spell that allows you to move at high speed.

225
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,050
Then the two of you 
should've remained hidden.

226
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,560
She could've simply taken 
the Stille on her own.

227
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,340
Laufen is still inexperienced. 
She left too many traces of mana behind.

228
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,690
You could have easily followed her, Frieren.

229
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,620
You must really find 
our presence troublesome.

230
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,370
Well, yes. You know who I am?

231
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,020
There isn't a mage of our generation 
who doesn't know that name.

232
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,000
It's my first time seeing 
you with my own eyes,

233
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,250
but I knew who you were 
as soon as I saw you.

234
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,260
You are Frieren, the mage 
from the party of heroes.

235
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,940
Is she famous?

236
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,680
She's a legendary mage. 
I knew it might be possible, but...

237
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,280
I guess elves really don't age.

238
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,440
You're challenging me rather openly.

239
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
You've been sniffing around us 
this whole time, haven't you?

240
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,660
I was expecting something underhanded.

241
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,150
This is plenty underhanded.

242
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:13,030
While Denken keeps you busy, 
I'll kill one of those two kids.

243
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,790
I see.

244
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:21,300
If we can't pass because we're lacking a 
party member, we'll be forced to back off.

245
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,890
Interesting. Try me.

246
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,080
Lawine, he's strong.

247
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,430
I know.

248
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,030
Don't, Richter. All we need 
to do is keep them busy.

249
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,180
We can win this fight.

250
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,200
Denken, I thought you were a 
more merciless and cold man.

251
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,700
You're an imperial mage, aren't you?

252
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,270
I'm sure you've killed political enemies 
more than a couple of times.

253
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,460
I simply don't believe being a first-class mage 
is worth killing someone.

254
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,090
I can agree with that.

255
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,110
"First-class mage" is just a title.

256
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,350
It's not that valuable.

257
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,150
You can't be serious.

258
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,450
You mean you took this test without 
knowing the privilege that title grants?

259
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,350
Privilege?

260
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,340
More than fifty years ago, 
the great mage and founder

261
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,020
of the Continental Magic Association, 
Serie, suddenly appeared

262
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,420
to reign over humanity's magic.

263
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,170
She's still searching for mages refined 
during the long war against the Demon King.

264
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,470
So she promised to grant a special 
privilege to anyone who achieved

265
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,060
the rank of first-class mage.

266
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,800
She will grant them any 
one spell they desire.

267
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,760
Serie is a living grimoire who knows nearly 
every spell in humanity's history.

268
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,450
She's the closest mage in our world to the 
all-knowing and all-powerful Goddess.

269
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,320
You could acquire massive wealth,

270
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,380
cure the gravest of diseases, 
or gain overwhelming power.

271
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,860
For mages, to gain whatever spell they want 
is equivalent to having a wish granted.

272
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,390
People are simple.

273
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,400
So modern first-class mages are all
 monsters who barely seem human.

274
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,250
It's that valuable a privilege.

275
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,700
I see.

276
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,780
This is nonsense.

277
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:44,020
Denken, people like you who don't care 
about the privilege are the minority.

278
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,040
Let's begin.

279
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,900
Denken, keep her busy for one minute.

280
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,370
That's enough time for me 
to kill the two of them.

281
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,800
Don't make me say it again, Richter.

282
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,180
They're just kids.

283
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,030
We're simply going to put them 
to sleep for three hours.

284
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,340
You can handle looking after 
some children, can't you?

285
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,300
Denken.

286
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,150
I'll crush her.

287
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,250
That should be enough.

288
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,260
You old fart.

289
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,760
Bargland.

290
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,950
The young are too hot-blooded.

291
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,100
You inexperienced fool.

292
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,100
What spell do I desire?

293
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,260
The difference between our mana is too great.

294
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,270
But she underestimates us.

295
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,620
Give me a break.

296
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,980
That old man fights rather spectacularly.

297
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,580
I know!

298
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,670
This is Frieren.

299
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,900
In the world of magic, sometimes 
the world is turned upside down.

300

Episode 21
The World of Magic
