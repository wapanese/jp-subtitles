1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,620
Frieren.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,710
You must find Aureole 
and speak with Himmel.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,240
"On the northernmost end of the continent..."

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,880
<i>I arrived at the place the people 
of this world call heaven:</i>

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,800
<i>Aureole, the land where souls rest.</i>

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,590
<i>Many souls gather there,</i>

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,310
<i>and I spoke with friends 
who once fought alongside me.</i>

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,140
Sorry to ask this of you.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,470
It'll be a long journey.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,930
It took us ten years.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,340
I see.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,080
We'll be following the same path Mr. Himmel's
party took to the Demon King's castle.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,140
You're right.

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,240
It'll be a mere ten-year adventure.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,490
One one-hundredth, huh?

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,020
Frieren, you're not going 
to stay in the royal capital?

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,110
I'm going to keep traveling.

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,520
Alone?

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,180
It'll be nice and easy.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,280
You're not going to take on an apprentice?

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,260
Traveling is better when you 
have someone to talk to.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,840
It's a waste of time.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,760
Even if I taught them, 
they'd die in no time.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,660
Frieren, that's not how relationships work.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,940
Yes, it is.

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,030
My adventure with you wasn't even 
one one-hundredth of my life.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,580
I might've said something like that.

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,080
It's funny, isn't it?

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,710
What is?

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,990
That one one-hundredth changed you.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,480
Well, I'll see you later.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,100
See you again.

33
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,650
It's been half my life, you know.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,610
The time I've spent with you.

35
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,390
It's going to be even more 
than that from now on.

36
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,050
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

37
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,460
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,380
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,370
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

41
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,700
<i>Across this land</i>

42
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,020
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

43
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,470
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

44
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:02,240
Beyond Journey's End

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,780
<i>The story ends</i>

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,290
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

47
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,130
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

48
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,780
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,290
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

50
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,470
<i>Makes people forget</i>

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,250
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,040
<i>Begin to rust</i>

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,880
<i>Just the same</i>

54
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,170
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

55
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,510
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

56
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,380
<i>And they live on</i>

57
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,930
<i>We chose the same path</i>

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,080
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,610
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

60
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,860
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

61
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,240
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

62
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,320
<i>Even now</i>

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,700
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

64
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,250
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

65
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,900
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,970
Episode 5: Phantoms of the Dead

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,230
Listen to me, Fern.

68
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,070
From now, you must listen carefully to what 
Frieren tells you and be a good girl,

69
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,230
or else...

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,740
Or else what?

71
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,510
I'll haunt you after I'm dead.

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,590
Mr. Heiter, do you mean that if I'm a bad 
girl, you'll come see me after you die?

73
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,960
You've grown into a clever girl. 
Who taught you to act like that?

74
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,820
I take it back.

75
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,030
If you're a good girl, then I might 
be willing to visit you sometimes.

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,390
We're almost at the village.

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,150
I see.

78
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,360
Nothing.

80
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,330
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Wille region, located in the central lands

81
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,380
You're heading to the mountain pass, right?

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,780
I wouldn't if I were you.

83
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,630
A bunch of people have gone missing.

84
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,890
Was it monsters?

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,210
Taken by ghosts, or so the rumors say.

86
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,430
Some people have seen them 
with their own eyes.

87
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,110
Could be the undead.

88
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,650
Do you know what the ghosts look like?

89
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,610
I'm afraid not.

90
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,480
But if you're curious, 
why not ask them yourselves?

91
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,760
To summarize,

92
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,530
people saw the ghosts of dead family and 
acquaintances as they appeared in life.

93
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,760
Some witnesses claimed the 
ghosts spoke to them.

94
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,960
This isn't the work of the undead.

95
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,490
It's not?

96
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,380
The undead are corpses controlled by magic,

97
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,950
like zombies or skeletons.

98
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,820
But these ghosts appeared 
as they did in life.

99
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,370
A reanimated corpse wouldn't look like that.

100
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,080
This is the work of a completely 
different type of monster.

101
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,340
You seem to have some inkling 
of what it might be.

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
It's a nasty one. We'd best 
be careful to avoid it.

103
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,820
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

104
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,610
Ms. Frieren, the villagers need help.

105
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,940
You sound like Himmel and the others.

106
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,710
Unlike you, I'm a good girl.

107
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,720
If you want to help, then I suppose we can.

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,280
We'll be traveling through the 
mountain pass either way.

109
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,450
This is where the villagers have 
been disappearing recently.

110
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,110
At least there are plenty of clues.

111
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,750
There are signs of magic use here.

112
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,350
Yes. What kind of magic do you think it was?

113
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,700
Illusion magic.

114
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,360
I read in a book on magical ecology 
that there's a monster

115
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,640
that uses illusions to lure prey.

116
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,620
The Einsam.

117
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,160
Even among monsters of its type,

118
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,510
it's an especially crafty and greedy 
monster that consumes only humans.

119
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,630
It shows people phantoms 
of the dead to lure them in.

120
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,630
Does that really work?

121
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,850
They're illusions of people very dear to them.

122
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,650
But the Einsam's illusions 
aren't a threat to mages.

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,520
They're easily dispersed by high-density 
mana such as offensive magic.

124
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,910
So we just need to shoot 
the phantoms of the dead.

125
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,360
Could you?

126
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,950
Of course.

127
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,870
After all, I know they're fake.

128
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,130
I shot a phantom of my master 
begging for her life.

129
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,130
But I was used to hearing her 
beg for her life,

130
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,200
so I didn't feel particularly 
guilty about it.

131
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,770
Either way, it doesn't feel good.

132
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,660
What does it mean that you were accustomed 
to hearing her beg for her life?

133
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,490
It's gotten misty.

134
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,680
We're close.

135
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,950
If you see a phantom, 
don't hesitate to shoot it.

136
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,010
Fern.

137
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,970
<i>There it is. A phantom of the dead.</i>

138
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,210
<i>I'm calm.</i>

139
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,710
<i>I can shoot it.</i>

140
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,600
You've become quite the mage.

141
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,480
I decided to pay you a visit 
because you've been a good girl.

142
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,810
<i>My memories...</i>

143
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,510
You were right to choose the path of a mage.

144
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,930
You've always loved magic.

145
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,980
<i>It's using my memories against me.</i>

146
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,380
You were so happy when 
I gave you that staff.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,710
<i>How cruel.</i>

148
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,950
<i>One of my most cherished memories...</i>

149
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,230
You slept with it every night.

150
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,150
Fern.

151
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,120
No, huh?

152
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,150
So it's Himmel this time.

153
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,520
I assumed it'd be my master again.

154
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,150
Does this mean I've changed?

155
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,670
Frieren, shoot me.

156
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,200
Right. That's what Himmel would say.

157
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,060
Now the mountain pass is safe again.

158
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,510
Ms. Frieren...

159
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,940
That was a phantom of Mr. Heiter.

160
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,930
An impostor.

161
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,110
Yes.

162
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,130
Let's go see the real Heiter now.

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,340
After all, we're trying to reach Aureole.

164
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,130
You're right.

165
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,720
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in Riegel Canyon, located in the central lands

166
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,220
That's a dragon?

167
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,670
I've never seen one before.

168
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,070
Look at its nest.

169
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,390
See that grimoire?

170
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,540
It's one I've been looking for.

171
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,670
You do love your grimoires.

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,140
But what's it doing there?

173
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Dragons use objects infused 
with magic to build their nests.

174
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,330
That's a solar dragon.

175
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,910
It's eaten numerous adventurers.

176
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,380
Either way, we should probably take it out.

177
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,160
Be careful you don't hit the nest.

178
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,960
Got it.

179
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,970
Ms. Frieren, that didn't do anything.

180
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,280
Figures. Dragons really are tough.

181
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,360
We have no choice, then. Let's run.

182
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,150
We finally lost it.

183
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,660
It's a quick flyer, too.

184
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,930
I doubt we can beat it in an aerial battle.

185
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,380
I... I thought I was going to die.

186
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,680
Let's head back.

187
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,630
If we repeat that process enough times, 
we'll beat it eventually.

188
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,350
Of course.

189
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,120
Mages don't play tag with dragons.

190
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,960
I guess we'll just have 
to take on a companion.

191
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,730
A front-liner?

192
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,590
Yeah. You're searching 
for someone, aren't you?

193
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,000
There's a warrior named Stark 
in a village near Riegel Canyon.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Pick him up on your way 
into the northern lands.

195
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,690
He's my apprentice.

196
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,350
Huh. Is he a good warrior?

197
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,750
It's so peaceful, it's hard to 
believe there's a dragon nearby.

198
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,080
You're right.

199
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,650
Ms. Frieren, what kind of magic 
does that grimoire contain?

200
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,390
A spell that lets you see through clothes.

201
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,770
You really do collect a lot of odd spells.

202
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,430
It's my hobby, after all.

203
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,440
But it's practical, too.

204
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,710
Depending on what you consider clothes, 
it can reveal hidden weapons—

205
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,360
Travelers, may I have a moment of your time?

206
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,280
Mr. Stark would like to meet you.

207
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,190
Well, that saves us having to look for him.

208
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,450
Three years ago, that dragon 
attacked the village.

209
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,050
That's when Mr. Stark appeared.

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,320
He stood his ground in front of that dragon.

211
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,190
After a long standoff, the dragon left.

212
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,450
Since then, because he's stayed here,

213
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,830
the dragon hasn't attacked, 
and we've lived in peace.

214
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,230
Then perhaps we could defeat 
the dragon with Mr. Stark's help.

215
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,090
I hope you're right.

216
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,960
Do you think I can become 
a powerful warrior like you?

217
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,100
Sure you can.

218
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,340
But a warrior's job is hardly a noble one.

219
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,740
Grandma!

220
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,200
So you're the ones who 
messed with the dragon.

221
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,700
Don't get it too worked up. 
You'll put the village in danger.

222
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,450
Dragons are far more terrifying 
than you think they are.

223
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,800
I got this scar on my forehead 
fighting a shadow dragon—

224
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,950
It's not that serious an injury.

225
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,650
Did my master put you up to this?

226
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,720
Who are you?

227
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,730
Frieren the Mage.

228
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,840
Grandma, could you give us some privacy?

229
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,460
It's all right. 
They're acquaintances of my master.

230
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,820
My master must be furious.

231
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,620
I left him without so much as a word.

232
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,900
Stark, why haven't you defeated the dragon?

233
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,420
You have no reason to remain in this village.

234
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,930
Why don't you tell me what you want first?

235
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,590
If you're here to send me back 
to my master, then forget it.

236
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,280
We want you to join us as our front-liner,

237
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,010
though before that, we'd appreciate 
your help in defeating the solar dragon.

238
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,310
I want the grimoire in its nest.

239
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,150
Why?

240
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,650
It's just a hobby. No particular reason.

241
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,400
We're talking about a solar dragon here.

242
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,900
It's not something you fight 
for no particular reason.

243
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,810
Wow!

244
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,670
You're right.

245
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,710
There was once an idiot who 
complimented the spells I collected.

246
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,300
Is that enough of a reason for you?

247
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,990
Complimented you, huh?

248
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,940
That's ridiculous.

249
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,960
Right?

250
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,340
I don't mind joining your party.

251
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,640
My master told you to take 
me with you, didn't he?

252
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,050
But I need the solar 
dragon dealt with first.

253
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,180
Honestly, I've had trouble 
defeating it alone.

254
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,690
Frieren, you can defeat it, can't you?

255
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,710
If you can keep it busy 
for thirty seconds, certainly.

256
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,480
I see. Thirty seconds, huh?

257
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,040
Do I really have to do that?

258
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,450
What is he talking about?

259
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,040
I thought so.

260
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,960
Stark, how much experience 
do you have fighting monsters?

261
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,710
Zero!

262
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,480
Help me, Frieren!

263
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,720
I confronted the dragon at first.

264
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,740
But I was so scared, 
I couldn't move a muscle!

265
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,500
It slices through houses 
like they're vegetables!

266
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,750
A human doesn't stand a chance against it!

267
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,970
I figured it spared me on a whim, but then...

268
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,140
For some reason the dragon stopped attacking 
the village, and I was treated like a hero.

269
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,370
And the villagers are such nice people!

270
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,680
You're still young. Get plenty to eat.

271
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,760
Stark, show me your new killer move!

272
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,880
I couldn't leave if I wanted to.

273
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,510
Ms. Frieren, this one is no good. 
Let's find someone else.

274
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,220
Please don't abandon me!

275
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,020
No, he can fight the dragon. I know he can.

276
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,210
He'll need more than just encouragement...

277
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,480
Stark, you have until tomorrow morning.

278
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,940
Think carefully.

279
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,440
I know you realize 
you can't keep this up.

280
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,160
You met Mr. Stark?

281
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
He's a nice young man, isn't he?

282
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,170
He seems to really enjoy our cooking.

283
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,290
People really love Mr. Stark.

284
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,290
Well, he seems like a kind person.

285
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,170
Kind?

286
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,620
He only seemed cowardly to me.

287
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,820
I won't deny the cowardly part.

288
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,190
But in your first battle against monsters...

289
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,820
Okay, okay. I'll forget about that.

290
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,830
Honestly, you were so meek 
and cute when you were little.

291
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,260
By the way, why doesn't the 
dragon attack this village?

292
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,820
Who knows? It could be 
mere whimsy, or perhaps...

293
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,080
What's that sound?

294
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,080
Stark, probably.

295
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,580
If you're curious, why not check on him?

296
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm going to bed.

297
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,830
Huh. Is he a good warrior?

298
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:58,760
He was the only one who ran when monsters 
attacked his hometown. A coward.

299
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,150
He's like me.

300
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,220
So I taught him everything I knew.

301
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,220
Now he's someone who can fight for another.

302
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,110
I see. He's a good warrior, then.

303
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,450
So this fissure was left by your training.

304
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,500
<i>And you alright</i>

305
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,020
<i>Can you hear me</i>

306
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,920
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

307
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,250
<i>Crying excessively</i>

308
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,420
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

309
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,460
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

310
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,150
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

311
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,940
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

312
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,610
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

313
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

314
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,180
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

315
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,940
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

316
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,040
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

317
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

318
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,870
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

319
00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,630
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

320
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,580
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

321
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

322
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,700
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

323
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,340
<i>I’m whispering our lullaby</i>

324
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,260
<i>for you to come back home</i>

325
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,260
The passage of time is cruel.

326
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,980
That old hag...

327
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,100
Isn't that a bit dangerous?

328
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,350
Don't cause any trouble in this town.

329
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,480
He must've been disappointed in me.

330
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,000
We parted in anger.

331
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,730
His hands are trembling.

332
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,870
They even tremble the same way.

333
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,930
Episode 6
The Hero of the Village

334
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm Stark, the hero of this village.
