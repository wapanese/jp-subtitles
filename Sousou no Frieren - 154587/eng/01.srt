00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

2
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:39,740
At the northernmost end of the continent,
I arrived at the place that
the people of this world call heaven:
Aureole, the land where souls rest.

3
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:48,000
Many souls gather there, and I spoke with
friends who once fought alongside me.
—Flamme the Legendary Mage

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,850
Frieren.

5
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,560
The royal capital's in sight.

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
The adventurers are making 
their triumphant return.

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,230
They must be celebrating in the city.

8
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,320
We'll have to look for work once we're back.

9
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,990
You're already thinking about that?

10
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,990
It's important, after all.

11
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,080
We've defeated the Demon King, 
but it's not over.

12
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,170
We have the whole rest 
of our lives ahead of us.

13
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,750
Work, huh?

14
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,920
I'd like something where 
I can drink on the job.

15
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,510
Aren't you a priest?

16
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,800
I suppose you're right.

17
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:51,440
Frieren, the life ahead of you will surely 
be much longer than we can imagine.

18
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,610
Perhaps.

19
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,950
Beyond Journey's End

20
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,480
Himmel the Hero,

21
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,980
Eisen the Warrior, Heiter the Priest,

22
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,730
and Frieren the Mage.

23
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,910
Thank you for defeating the Demon King.

24
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,990
Now our world will enter an age of peace.

25
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,930
The king's going to erect 
statues of us in the plaza.

26
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,310
I'm not sure they'll be able to faithfully 
recreate my handsome looks, though.

27
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,900
How self-serving of him.

28
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,480
He only gave us ten copper coins 
when we left on our adventure.

29
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,780
Now, now, Frieren. 
Tonight, we drink for free.

30
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,740
I'd say we're even, wouldn't you?

31
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,450
You corrupt priest.

32
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,210
It's over.

33
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,210
Yeah.

34
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,590
This is the end of our adventure.

35
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,930
It's been ten years, huh?

36
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,970
We've been through a lot.

37
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,390
The day we departed...

38
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,480
Himmel and Eisen were nearly executed 
for speaking rudely to the king.

39
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,810
Kill them.

40
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,480
We'll give them a talking to.

41
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,480
Shall we lick your boots?

42
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,900
One misstep, and our adventure 
would've ended there.

43
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,530
Sometimes, Heiter was too 
hungover to do anything.

44
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,500
You're as pallid as an undead. 
Are you all right?

45
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,460
No.

46
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,620
No, huh?

47
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,380
It was a weekly occurrence.

48
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,380
I, on the other hand, was exceptional.

49
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,220
We thought about leaving you behind 
when that mimic tried to eat you.

50
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,390
Seriously? We told her it was a trap.

51
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,100
It's dark and scary in here!

52
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,100
Why don't we leave the elf behind?

53
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,350
We have nothing but terrible memories.

54
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,360
But I had fun.

55
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm glad I got to adventure with all of you.

56
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,240
Likewise.

57
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,990
It was a mere ten-year adventure.

58
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,700
"A mere ten-year adventure"?

59
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,120
But that's an entire decade 
we spent adventuring together.

60
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,080
Look at Heiter. He's turned into an old man.

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,630
That's rude.

62
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,170
He always looked like that.

63
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,460
That's rude.

64
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,220
It's nearly time.

65
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,690
The Era Meteor Shower, was it?

66
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,570
It happens once every fifty years.

67
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,490
Perfect for marking the 
start of an era of peace.

68
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,240
They're beautiful.

69
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,620
The view's not so good 
from inside the city, though.

70
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,750
I'm having a moment over here. 
Don't spoil the mood.

71
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,250
Next time, then.

72
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,970
I know a place where you 
can see them more clearly.

73
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,510
I'll take you there in fifty years.

74
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,390
What?

75
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,720
It's nothing.

76
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,730
You're right. Let's go see them together.

77
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, I should go.

78
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,260
What are you going to do now?

79
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,340
I'm going to continue collecting spells.

80
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,850
I plan to travel around the central lands 
for the next hundred years or so.

81
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,220
I'll stop by once in a while.

82
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,940
I can't understand what 
being an elf must be like.

83
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,610
Seriously, how long has she been around?

84
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,610
To her, fifty or even a hundred years 
might be a trifling thing.

85
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Shadow dragon horns?

86
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,590
We don't have those here.

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,920
Haven't seen a shadow dragon 
in twenty or thirty years.

88
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,930
I see. That's no good. 
I need one for summoning.

89
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:05,020
<i>Come to think of it, I think Himmel still has
the horn we got at the Demon King's castle.</i>

90
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,940
It's exuding some kind of evil aura.

91
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,900
It's not harmful to people, is it?

92
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,030
I don't know.

93
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,900
You don't know, huh?

94
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,320
<i>It's nearly time for the 
Era Meteor Shower again.</i>

95
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,910
<i>I'll pick the horn up when I visit him.</i>

96
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,330
<i>The city's changed quite a bit 
since I was last here.</i>

97
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,890
It should be around here.

98
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,940
Frieren?

99
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,730
Himmel...

100
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,950
You're so old.

101
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,360
Do you have to put it so bluntly?

102
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,620
I'm still pretty handsome 
at this age, though, aren't I?

103
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,880
It's been fifty years. 
You look the same as you ever did.

104
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,090
I thought I'd never see you again.

105
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,380
The Era Meteor Shower, huh?

106
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,550
That brings back memories.

107
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,720
About that thing we looted from 
the Demon King's castle...

108
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,770
You mean the shadow dragon horn?

109
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,020
I've never forgotten about it.

110
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,020
My cabinet's been exuding 
an evil aura all this time.

111
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,780
Sorry, I think.

112
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,240
You could've stashed it 
in a shed or something.

113
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,910
I couldn't do that.

114
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,830
You may not have thought much 
of leaving it with me,

115
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,420
but to me, it was a treasure 
entrusted to me by a dear friend.

116
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,180
I had to return it to you someday.

117
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,730
It's not that big a deal.

118
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,880
Himmel, are you ready yet?

119
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,460
You're bald, anyway. There's no point 
in fussing over your appearance.

120
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,880
There are things we bald men 
are particular about.

121
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,520
Now, shall we go see the Era Meteor Shower?

122
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,490
You've become rather dignified, Heiter.

123
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,410
I'm a bishop of the holy city, after all.

124
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,830
You haven't changed at all.

125
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,660
Don't pat my head.

126
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,500
Eisen, you haven't changed much.

127
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,590
Is that how I seem to you?

128
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,000
I would expect as much from a dwarf.

129
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,470
So, where's this place where we can 
see the meteor shower clearly?

130
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,430
We're going there now?

131
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,430
It's a bit early to see the 
Era Meteor Shower, isn't it?

132
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,520
Yeah. It's about a week's walk from here.

133
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,020
It's that far away?

134
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,610
Unbelievable.

135
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,020
You should be kinder to the elderly.

136
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,860
This brings back memories.

137
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,030
Traveling together like this makes me 
feel like we've returned to those days.

138
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,040
We journeyed to all sorts of places.

139
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,050
Everything seemed so brilliant and new.

140
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,910
And you were always there 
in those beautiful memories.

141
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,750
I'd been looking forward to the day 
when we'd all be together again.

142
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,380
Thank you, Frieren.

143
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,680
Because of you, I had this delightful 
adventure at the very end.

144
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,330
They're beautiful.

145
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,860
I think Himmel was happy.

146
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,820
You think so?

147
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,910
She was one of Mr. Himmel's companions?

148
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,420
I haven't seen her look sad once today.

149
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,630
How heartless.

150
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,300
Now, now! We're not wearing 
sad expressions, either.

151
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,840
Show some respect, Bishop!

152
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,050
You're heartless!

153
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,090
You wound me.

154
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,370
It's not like I knew anything about him.

155
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,350
We only traveled together 
for a mere ten years.

156
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,820
I knew human lives were short, but...

157
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,860
Why didn't I try to get to know him better?

158
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,170
Don't pat my head.

159
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,970
I should return to the holy city.

160
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,730
Let me get a good look at your faces.

161
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,600
This will probably be 
the last time I see you.

162
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,360
Are you unwell?

163
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,110
My years of drinking have caught up to me.

164
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,860
It's divine punishment.

165
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,990
If you're ever in the holy city, 
offer a drink at my grave.

166
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,540
Heiter, you're not afraid of dying?

167
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,460
We're the party of adventurers 
that saved the world.

168
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,210
We'll surely be living the good life 
in Heaven after death.

169
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,930
That's the whole reason 
I fought alongside you.

170
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,510
You corrupt priest.

171
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,480
If you'll excuse me.

172
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,690
I should get going, too.

173
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,700
You're off to collect more spells?

174
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,530
There's that, too,

175
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,410
but I want to learn more about humans.

176
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,500
I see.

177
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,920
So I wanted to ask you something.

178
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,010
Seeing as how I'm a mage, having a powerful 
warrior to defend me would be a huge help.

179
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,720
Give me a break.

180
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,970
I'm too old to swing an axe now.

181
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,810
Don't make that face, Frieren.

182
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,110
Surprisingly, life slows down 
once you've lost your vigor.

183
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,860
I see.

184
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,860
I'll see you later, Eisen.

185
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,860
Yeah. See you later.

186
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,940
Episode 1: The Journey's End

187
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,410
That's the tree I saw earlier.

188
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,280
I always get lost in these woods.

189
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,580
Where am I?

190
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,290
20 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
on the outskirts of the holy city of Strahl in the central lands

191
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,040
Are you looking for something?

192
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,050
Is something the matter?

193
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,930
I'm looking for the home 
of a man named Heiter.

194
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,600
Then you're a visitor.

195
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,190
You're still alive, you corrupt priest?

196
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,230
Turns out it's harder than I thought 
to make a stylish exit.

197
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,990
I brought some liquor to offer at your grave.

198
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,610
Would you like a drink?

199
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,950
I gave up drinking.

200
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,780
I see.

201
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,370
I doubt the Goddess will forgive you 
even if you clean up your act now.

202
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,470
Thank you.

203
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,600
Who is she?

204
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,470
Her name is Fern.

205
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,810
She's a war orphan from the southern lands.

206
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,400
It's not like you to 
volunteer to help people.

207
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,070
You're not Himmel, after all.

208
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,910
Frieren, why did you come to visit me?

209
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,080
I was in the holy city 
picking up some things.

210
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,410
I've been trying to get to know the people 
I meet on my travels as much as possible.

211
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,420
And I owe you a lot, so I came to 
repay my debts before you died.

212
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,180
In that case, I have a request.

213
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,260
Will you take on an apprentice?

214
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,020
Fern has potential as a mage.

215
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,150
Will you take her with you on your travels?

216
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,150
I'm sorry, Heiter. 
That's the one thing I can't do.

217
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,110
She'd only get in my way.

218
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,280
You know how often 
apprentice mages die in battle.

219
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,660
I'm not sending a child my friend 
asked me to look after to her death.

220
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,590
I see. Then I have another request.

221
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,640
This was unearthed from 
the tomb of Ewig the Sage.

222
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:37,440
This grimoire is said to contain lost 
spells of resurrection and immortality.

223
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,070
I find it hard to believe 
such magic really exists.

224
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,070
That's part of why I'd like you to decipher it.

225
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,570
Can you do that?

226
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,370
It's written in code using pictures.

227
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,160
The people of this era 
really liked this kind of thing.

228
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,950
I could do it, given five or six years.

229
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,170
I see.

230
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,750
But why do you want this deciphered?

231
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,420
I thought you weren't afraid of dying.

232
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,550
I have two reasons.

233
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,550
The first is that I when I said that, 
I was just putting on a brave face for you.

234
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,930
The second is that I'm now more 
afraid of dying than I was before.

235
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:24,110
Even if I can't achieve immortality, 
I'd like a bit more time.

236
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,370
Besides, the holy texts tell us 
to live healthy lives.

237
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,580
A long life is the ultimate 
expression of that, Frieren.

238
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,250
You corrupt priest.

239
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,340
Also, in your spare time, 
will you teach Fern magic?

240
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,970
As a priest, I don't have that knowledge.

241
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,060
I could do that.

242
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,900
There you are.

243
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,650
I've been looking everywhere for you.

244
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,740
Do you always train in the woods?

245
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,320
Was finding me difficult even for you?

246
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,120
Mr. Heiter often tells me 
I'm practically invisible.

247
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,290
It's a very good thing, isn't it?

248
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,000
It is.

249
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,010
<i>It's true. I can barely detect her mana.</i>

250
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,970
<i>Her control over her mana is exceptional.</i>

251
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,270
<i>How much has she studied at such a young age?</i>

252
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,770
Mr. Heiter said when I can blast a hole 
in that rock, I'll be a proper mage.

253
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,690
Oh? Heiter knows what he's 
talking about. That's—

254
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,700
As you just saw, my magic 
dissipates and doesn't reach it.

255
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,710
I see.

256
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,250
What should I do to train?

257
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,460
Can I ask you something first?

258
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,970
Do you like magic?

259
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,470
Somewhat.

260
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,930
Just like me, then.

261
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,190
Is Fern's training coming along smoothly?

262
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,190
Are you trying to put on 
a brave face again, Heiter?

263
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,190
It saddens me to see him treated like this.

264
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,150
But they're worth looking for.

265
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,150
Magic sure is amazing, isn't it?

266
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,150
You keep collecting the strangest spells.

267
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,740
It'd be a waste for you to die.

268
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,780
Someday, I'd like to show them to you.

269
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,950
Episode 2
It Didn't Have to Be Magic...

270
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,950
It didn't have to be magic...
