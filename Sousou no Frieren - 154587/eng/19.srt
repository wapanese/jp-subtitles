1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,350
The first-class mage exam will now begin.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,790
You will be tested as parties.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,890
The 57 exam-takers will split into teams 
of three for the first test.

4
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,620
Beyond Journey's End

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Episode 19: Well-Laid Plans

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,660
See? I knew you could do it.

7
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,550
You think so?

8
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,010
Lawine is rough, but she 
pulls me along with her.

9
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,450
Our first battle against a dragon is tomorrow.

10
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
Are you scared, Eisen?

11
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,890
You're shaking.

12
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,910
Yeah.

13
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,920
I see. In that case...

14
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,280
Wait, what? You're scared?

15
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,730
Yeah.

16
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,360
I see. I'm scared, too.

17
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,010
What kind of conversation is this?

18
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,540
I thought I'd copy other adventurers 
and inspire you, but...

19
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,670
I'm sorry. It doesn't seem to have worked.

20
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,320
No. Thanks to you, I'm no longer tense.

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,270
Himmel, just be yourself.

22
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm sure this sort of thing 
differs from party to party.

23
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,810
You're right.

24
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,950
I see. It really does differ 
from party to party.

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,470
We finally caught a Stille.

26
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,660
Now we don't have to worry.

27
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,730
Why are you so relaxed?

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,000
The hard part's still to come.

29
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,610
We have to keep our Stille 
from being stolen by other parties.

30
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,590
It's time to fight other mages.

31
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,370
Let's review what we learned 
from observing the Stille.

32
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,520
First, like Frieren said, those birds 
fly faster than the speed of sound.

33
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,580
We could never catch up to it at that speed.

34
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,430
Furthermore, they're as tough as dragons.

35
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,990
Common attack spells have no effect, 
and they break free of most restraints.

36
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,000
On top of that, they're sensitive to mana.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,690
Even when we suppress our mana to 
approach one, it quickly flies away.

38
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,410
The biggest problem of all is because the 
Stille themselves have practically no mana,

39
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,770
we can't find them using mana detection.

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,140
Because of that, we have 
no idea where they are now.

41
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,780
We don't know how many there are either.

42
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,910
The only ones we ever spotted were 
those three yesterday morning.

43
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,290
They're probably being cautious because 
the test-takers are searching for them.

44
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,630
Worst case, they might 
never show themselves again.

45
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,690
And even if we do find one, 
we have no idea how to catch it.

46
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't worry about that.

47
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,780
Last night I experimented with a spell 
that might be useful for catching a Stille.

48
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,080
I remember you going out.

49
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,530
What kind of spell is it?

50
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,550
I already showed you, Kanne.

51
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,550
A spell that captures a bird.

52
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,620
It's a folk spell developed by 
a tribe of hunters during an era

53
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,710
when mages and magic were far more common.

54
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,540
Come to think of it, you did use 
a spell to restrain that creature.

55
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,770
But wasn't that a monster and not a bird?

56
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,990
It's folk magic, after all.

57
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,890
It appears it can be used to capture 
anything that broadly resembles a bird.

58
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,030
It's a powerful binding spell.

59
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,140
I think it'll probably work on the Stille.

60
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,060
Why didn't you say so earlier?

61
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,540
We could've caught one yesterday 
if we'd used that.

62
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,900
Actually, we couldn't have.

63
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
That spell's range is 50 centimeters.

64
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,520
You have to get that close to use it.

65
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,140
Fifty centimeters?

66
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,780
How close have we gotten so far?

67
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,180
Three meters was the closest.

68
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,300
Not only that, but they noticed us 
by the time we got within 20 meters of them.

69
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,380
So we're one step short 
of meeting the requirements.

70
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,640
That's one huge step.

71
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,790
Just to confirm, it's difficult for you two 
to stop the Stille with your magic, right?

72
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,450
It'd probably work if we could freeze one,

73
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,030
but they're sensitive to mana, tough, 
and resistant to freezing.

74
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,210
It'd probably escape before 
we could fix it in place.

75
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,410
I bet we could easily stop one with my magic 
if we had access to a ton of water.

76
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,150
But my magic only allows me to control water.

77
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,160
I can't create it out of nothing.

78
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,530
So I can't use it unless 
there's water present,

79
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,060
and mana struggles to penetrate 
large bodies of water.

80
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,950
I'd probably have to infuse it 
with my mana beforehand.

81
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:58,090
I can quickly take control of even large 
amounts of water if it's scattered, like rain.

82
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:04,060
But if I infused water with mana, the mana-
sensitive Stille would definitely stay away.

83
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,850
Stay away?

84
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,050
I see. They'd stay away.

85
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,340
This plan might work.

86
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,040
It's not bad, but it's risky.

87
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,850
We'd be picking a fight 
with all the other teams.

88
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,730
But I doubt we'll catch one otherwise.

89
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
Are you scared, Lawine?

90
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,910
Ow, ow, ow! You're gonna rip them off!

91
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,910
Fine.

92
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,760
Let's do this.

93
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,130
4th Party
Land, Second-Class Mage

94
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,120
For now, let's hide until the test is over.

95
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,640
4th Party
Ãœbel, Third-Class Mage

96
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,760
What? That's no fun.

97
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,650
We're mages. We should fight openly.

98
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,010
4th Party
Fern, Third-Class Mage

99
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,000
Mages also avoid unnecessary fighting.

100
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,130
But first, we should get water.

101
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,370
I think there was a lake 
in the middle of the area.

102
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,630
Either way, I'm glad 
we caught a Stille so quickly.

103
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,330
If we can remain hidden until sunset, 
we'll pass the first test.

104
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,340
What is it?

105
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,330
Looks like it won't be that easy.

106
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,590
I thought this was a road, 
but it's actually a dry riverbed.

107
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Not only that, but I saw similar 
terrain in a few other places.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,570
Isn't there a barrier around the testing area?

109
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,430
Yeah. That's standard for tests.

110
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,820
They're powerful physical barriers 
that keep out even specks of dust.

111
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,810
Do they block water, too?

112
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,010
Oh.

113
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,210
Judging by the dryness, 
the barrier was erected over a week ago.

114
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,930
Then most of the water will have collected 
in the lake in the middle of the valley.

115
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,180
Since the test-takers are living creatures,

116
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,830
we need some amount of water to stay active.

117
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,030
That doesn't guarantee test-takers 
would gather around the lake.

118
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,080
You're right.

119
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,590
We can carry water with us.

120
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,840
But the Stille, which are 
also living creatures, cannot.

121
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,660
I see. And those who have realized that

122
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,400
will be waiting around the lake, 
the largest body of water in the area.

123
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,830
Okay, I've made my decision. 
We'll give up on finding water.

124
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,550
That'll be tough. I'm already parched.

125
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm sure we can find a small pond.

126
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,700
Is that sanitary?

127
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Perhaps if we boil it.

128
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,570
8th Party
Scharf, Third-Class Mage

129
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,070
8th Party
Ehre, Second-Class Mage

130
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,330
8th Party
Wirbel, Second-Class Mage

131
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,320
What a pain in the ass. 
I was shooting to kill.

132
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,200
You're quick enough to react to that?

133
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,090
Well, whatever. 
Leave the cage with the Stille.

134
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,850
And if we refuse?

135
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,330
Then there's no need for words.

136
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,350
<i>The lake is that way.</i>

137
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,460
They froze the lake.

138
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,470
Seriously? What are they doing?

139
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,080
This isn't funny.

140
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,480
That's the mana of one of 
the 2nd party's members.

141
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,490
What are they thinking?

142
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,990
Are they trying to antagonize 
all the other parties?

143
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,600
What are you doing?

144
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,650
Hurry up and melt it!

145
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,880
Denken, what should we do?

146
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,330
It's a waste of time and effort.

147
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,370
13th Party
Denken, Second-Class Mage

148
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,880
There's no point in melting it now.

149
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,870
13th Party
Richter, Second-Class Mage

150
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,390
After that showy display of magic, 
the Stille won't come near this lake again.

151
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,380
13th Party
Laufen, Third-Class Mage

152
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,770
We'll steal our Stille from the 2nd party.

153
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,860
If they went this wild, 
they must have a plan to catch one.

154
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,030
<i>Ms. Frieren, what are you doing?</i>

155
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,200
Let's scatter for now.

156
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,470
We have to melt the frozen lake quickly!

157
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,470
Those fools.

158
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:20,460
Using that much magic to melt the ice 
will make the lake truly useless.

159
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,950
The Stille won't come near here again.

160
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,080
Let's go.

161
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,600
Yeah.

162
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,390
That way!

163
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,460
Those who realized that are searching 
for other watering holes,

164
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,670
but their mana detection is inadequate.

165
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,850
They won't be able to handle airborne threats.

166
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,960
They're inexperienced.

167
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,170
Apparently the 2nd party froze the lake.

168
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,250
Are they trying to ruin the test?

169
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,560
Ruin it? No.

170
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,720
The 2nd party has a well-laid plan.

171
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,220
Until we unravel it, we won't get anywhere.

172
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,070
Monsters got them.

173
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,340
They're already dead.

174
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
Let's go.

175
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,020
Sir, let's at least take them down.

176
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,360
You can see them, can't you?

177
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,400
They're circling above.

178
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,910
Not just one or two of them either.

179
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
There's magic on those corpses.

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,520
They'll detect you 
if you try to take them down.

181
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:59,150
Geisel. That's how they lure 
and hunt their next prey.

182
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,530
This party fell for their trap 
and got themselves killed.

183
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
It's strange that they chose

184
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,110
to administer the test in an area 
inhabited by monsters like these.

185
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,260
It's like they think nothing 
of the test-takers dying.

186
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,340
Laufen, this is your first time 
taking the first-class exam, isn't it?

187
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,350
Their reasoning is incredibly simple.

188
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,890
Anyone who would die here is 
unqualified to be a first-class mage.

189
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,230
The Continental Magic Association

190
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,900
is very mindful of maintaining 
the quality of first-class mages.

191
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,220
There are those who still dream

192
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,590
of the powerful and noble mages 
who fought the Demon King's forces.

193
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,000
Damn their outdated ideas.

194
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,910
I'm surprised, Denken.

195
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,280
I thought you'd be on their side.

196
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,020
The quality of a mage is irrelevant.

197
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,630
First-class mages need only 
be symbols of power.

198
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,930
No matter how powerful you are,

199
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,660
unless you can control people's hearts, 
you're as good as powerless.

200
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,910
I've seen countless mages 
far more skilled than myself

201
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,940
fall from power and be persecuted.

202
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,700
Great power is feared, 
and rule by fear doesn't last long.

203
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,320
Besides, magic isn't a noble thing.

204
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,580
I see. So someone as weak as you 
is perfect for the job.

205
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,740
Watch your tongue, boy.

206
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,260
I could beat you with my eyes closed.

207
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,670
We've had no luck detecting the 2nd party.

208
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,830
They're concealing their mana and hiding.

209
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,500
This place, too. All the watering holes 
we've seen are the same.

210
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,260
It's faint, but there's mana in the water.

211
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,560
I don't sense anything.

212
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,520
Do you?

213
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,390
No. Is it the 2nd party?

214
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,230
I doubt even the person 
who cast it could detect it.

215
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,490
There's that little in it.

216
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,020
But a Stille could sense it.

217
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,520
They won't come near this water again.

218
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,910
What's the point of doing this?

219
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,030
I see. There's a watering hole somewhere 
that doesn't contain mana.

220
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,650
And that's where the 2nd party will be.

221
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,700
How will we find it?

222
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm going to rest a bit.

223
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,050
Denken.

224
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,520
The testing area is enormous.

225
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,810
It'd be impossible to find a mage 
who truly doesn't want to be found.

226
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,390
We'll wait.

227
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,530
They'll show us where they are eventually.

228
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,580
I infused every lake and pond 
I could find with mana.

229
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,820
It's possible there are bodies of water 
we don't know about, though.

230
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,580
Just limiting the watering holes 
the Stille can use is enough.

231
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,800
I'll wait here for a Stille.

232
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,090
Seriously? It's possible to completely 
suppress your mana?

233
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,120
Not completely.

234
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,090
When I move, I release a little mana. See?

235
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,480
I can't sense it.

236
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,980
We'll stand watch.

237
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,910
Don't hold us back.

238
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,280
Shut up.

239
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,880
If it'd just rain, 
I could be useful in a fight.

240
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,420
But the barrier would deflect all of it.

241
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,700
Frieren, did you do it?

242
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,690
It was worth picking a fight 
with the other parties.

243
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,450
Now we'll pass the first test.

244
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,940
No.

245
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,200
Found them.

246
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,010
So they used magic after all.

247
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,090
Not even the most skilled mage 
can conceal that moment.

248
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,970
Someone's detected us. 
We should get away from here.

249
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,250
Looks like it's too late to run.

250
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,150
Jubelade.

251
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,280
Doragate.

252
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,890
<i>It's like a cannon.</i>

253
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,020
<i>She backed off again.</i>

254
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,950
<i>Her technique is refined 
and shows no openings, but it's old.</i>

255
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,430
<i>It's like fighting against my grandfather.</i>

256
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Ordinary offensive magic and defensive magic.

257
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,350
You only use basic spells.

258
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,420
Are you playing things close to the chest?

259
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,940
I was taught to only use 
basic spells in combat.

260
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,820
That's your master's philosophy, then?

261
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,560
Yes. She said it's enough 
to defeat mages of this era.

262
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,100
Oh, yeah?

263
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,780
<i>Again. What is this feeling of wrongness?</i>

264
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,250
<i>It's like I'm fighting an experienced mage.</i>

265
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,810
You're going to struggle.

266
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,920
If you fought Wirbel with your technique, 
you'd be dead by now.

267
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,850
That doesn't make sense.

268
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,220
You're the strongest one here, aren't you?

269
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,270
Wirbel is the captain of the 
Northern Magic Corps that fought

270
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,630
against the remnants 
of the Demon King's forces.

271
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,490
He has far more experience in battle.

272
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,040
His magic is devoid of character.

273
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,500
It's underhanded, 
for the sole purpose of winning.

274
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,100
The girl fighting Wirbel now 
will probably be killed.

275
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,410
Is that so?

276
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,730
What hells have you seen?

277
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,730
I'll take your head off.

278
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,730
I'll crush her.

279
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,100
He's strong.

280
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,230
Interesting. Try me.

281
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,230
This is impressive.

282
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,230
What's this sound?

283
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,560
You old fart.

284
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,080
I've always killed everyone I had to.

285
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,030
Episode 20
Necessary Killing
