1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,020
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,440
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,360
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,980
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,320
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>Across this land</i>

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,990
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,450
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,210
Beyond Journey's End

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>The story ends</i>

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,260
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,090
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,270
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>Makes people forget</i>

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,230
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,020
<i>Begin to rust</i>

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,860
<i>Just the same</i>

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,490
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>And they live on</i>

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,910
<i>We chose the same path</i>

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,040
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,580
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,830
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,210
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,290
<i>Even now</i>

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,670
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,220
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,890
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

31
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,480
I see.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,670
I remember now.

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,390
It was Frieren.

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,180
The mage who contributed significantly 
to humanity's analysis of Zoltraak

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,080
and slew more demons 
than anyone else in history.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,040
Frieren the Slayer.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,150
One of the geniuses I despise.

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Episode 9: Aura the Guillotine

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,190
You'll have to rest for a while.

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,580
Thank you.

41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,340
Hey!

42
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,050
Are you okay?

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,170
Because of you, I'll survive.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
You have my thanks.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll pardon your mage companion as well.

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,600
She was right.

47
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,170
Now Frieren can return to town.

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,270
Let's have her defeat Lügner 
and the other demon.

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,000
Ms. Frieren didn't kill the guard.

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,040
I know. The demons did it.

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,710
More importantly, 
that mage's name is Frieren?

52
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,530
Yes.

53
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,840
The elven mage who adventured with the Hero?

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,670
Then I've committed a grave discourtesy.

55
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,550
The Granat family owes the 
party of heroes a debt.

56
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,370
When this town was attacked by demons 
during my grandfather's rule,

57
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,440
they were the ones who drove them off.

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,810
They faced the same enemy as we do now.

59
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,240
It was Aura, one of the 
Seven Sages of Destruction.

60
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,190
It's been a while, Aura.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,180
Indeed, Frieren. About eighty years, I'd say.

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,940
You're heading to the town 
up ahead, aren't you?

63
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,440
I'd appreciate it if you turned back.

64
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,360
No.

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,110
Why not?

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,140
Because I have an overwhelming advantage.

67
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,030
Oh?

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,760
You have more puppets than before.

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,200
Demon magic must be unbelievably 
powerful to control this many.

70
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,950
Humanity's magic could never 
dream of reaching such heights.

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,720
But your magic couldn't be more disgusting.

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,790
It makes me want to puke.

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,720
That's not a nice thing to say.

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,250
It took a lot of work to gather this many.

75
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,890
I recognize some of those suits of armor.

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,310
Aura, it seems I must 
kill you here after all.

77
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,540
The Scales of Obedience.

78
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,510
It's the reason we haven't been able 
to defeat Aura in all these years.

79
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,470
Her magic allows her to force 
others to obey her will.

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,540
The magics of the Seven Sages of Destruction

81
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,970
are beyond human knowledge and reason.

82
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,140
Aura places her own soul 
and that of her target on the scales

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,640
and weighs the magnitude of 
their mana against each other.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,730
The one with greater mana 
gains control of the other,

85
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:47,740
turning them into a puppet for all eternity—
until their body withers to dust.

86
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,500
It's a risky spell, but that's 
what makes it powerful.

87
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,650
And in the hands of someone with mana 
as tremendous as Aura, it's unbeatable.

88
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,910
Is there no way to counter it?

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,990
Though the weight of Aura's mana 
is enough to fully tip the scales,

90
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,970
the scales themselves do judge fairly.

91
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,880
If a soul with greater mana than Aura's 
were to be placed on the scales,

92
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,520
Aura could be defeated.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,330
But they say that hasn't happened 
once in the five hundred years

94
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,520
since Aura became a Sage of Destruction.

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,020
Then there's no way to fight it?

96
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,830
There was.

97
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,530
Those with powerful wills could 
temporarily resist the spell.

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,550
The greater the individual, 
the more iron their will.

99
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,680
And even then, it was only temporary?

100
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,620
But it was a fatal flaw.

101
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,060
The strong-willed must have been 
an obstacle to her.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,550
So...

103
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,690
Aura the Guillotine dealt with them in the 
most logical way after gaining control.

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,700
It's a tragic tale.

105
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,410
Well? My immortal army 
is powerful, isn't it?

106
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,300
I'm surprised.

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,300
You dispelled the magic I'd cast on them.

108
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,310
No one's ever done that before.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,090
Such powerful dispelling magic must expend 
a considerable amount of mana.

110
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,330
Why would you use such a roundabout method?

111
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,210
The last time we fought, you blew them away 
with flashy spells left and right.

112
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,400
Himmel scolded me afterward.

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,710
Then that's all the more reason 
not to do this.

114
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,090
Why?

115
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,850
Himmel is long gone, isn't he?

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,340
I see. Good.

117
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,300
You demons are monsters after all.

118
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,120
I can kill you without mercy.

119
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,820
Okay.

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,150
I've regained most of my mobility.

121
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,730
Father, this place is safe, right?

122
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,460
Yes. It's not as strong as the 
town's defensive barrier,

123
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,450
but there is a barrier around this church.

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,160
Then wait here, Graf.

125
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,720
Brat, what do you plan to do?

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,890
Do you think the demons will just leave 
if we all hole up in here?

127
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,000
Mr. Stark, are you serious?

128
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,220
We only landed that hit before 
because we caught him off guard.

129
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,770
We couldn't find enough of an 
opening to finish him off.

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,050
If we'd kept fighting, we would 
have been the ones killed.

131
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,000
Someone's gotta do this, right?

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,580
You're right. Then let's 
do our best together.

133
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,870
No, you go to the guard station.

134
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,350
You need to evacuate the townsfolk.

135
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,840
Then you're going to...

136
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,350
Yeah.

137
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,990
I'm going to...

138
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,350
get on my hands and knees 
and beg Frieren to return.

139
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,940
What?

140
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,340
Come on! Having her defeat him 
is our only option!

141
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,510
I suppose that's more realistic.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,460
The guards will listen to you 
if you show them this.

143
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,260
Very well.

144
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,130
I'm heading straight out of town.

145
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,380
What is it?

146
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,270
Your arm is in a terrible state.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Can you pass through the castle gate 
looking like that?

148
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll be fine. This is normal for a warrior.

149
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,220
Is there something weird about it?

150
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,600
I've never seen a warrior walk 
around town with two bloody hands.

151
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,600
You're one to talk. You're 
covered in blood, too.

152
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,520
Huh? Whose blood is this?

153
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,110
It's not mine.

154
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,160
Hey! What's the matter with—

155
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,500
Mr. Stark, there's mana in this blood.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,140
Fern!

157
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,820
<i>An axe?</i>

158
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,830
I don't believe it. Am I dreaming?

159
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,000
That was my master's technique.

160
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,250
I'd meant to hit your vitals, 
but then you went and moved.

161
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,950
It wasn't my intention to make you suffer.

162
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,580
Why are you surprised?

163
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,130
Is it because I'm standing here when 
I supposedly suffered a fatal blow?

164
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,130
Or because you didn't detect our approach?

165
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,550
You aren't the only one who knows how to 
conceal her presence by controlling her mana.

166
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,640
Any demon can do it.

167
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,660
That said, it's hardly fitting 
for a battle between mages.

168
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,200
You sure like to talk.

169
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,410
Aren't you going to finish me off?

170
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,960
Since I failed to kill you instantly, 
I thought I'd ask you some questions.

171
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,700
Or would you rather die right now?

172
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,720
Go ahead.

173
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
Is that boy strong?

174
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,150
He's Eisen the Warrior's best student.

175
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,440
I see. How unfortunate.

176
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,800
Poor boy.

177
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,230
He won't die a decent death 
at Linie's hands.

178
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,700
One more question.

179
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,210
Where is Frieren?

180
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,990
She fled the town

181
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,290
because you killed the dungeon guard.

182
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,550
Graf Granat said something similar.

183
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,260
Killing a guard is a serious crime, it seems.

184
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,220
The punishment is execution.

185
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,550
Execution?

186
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,640
That wouldn't be enough 
to make that woman flee.

187
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,530
She holds a powerful grudge against demons,

188
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,580
enough to teach her own student 
a spell purely for demon-killing.

189
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,650
Someone like that wouldn't run.

190
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,450
She must be after something.

191
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,570
It must be Lady Aura.

192
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,460
Don't move.

193
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,280
You know where Ms. Frieren 
is headed, don't you?

194
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,680
You're wasting your time.

195
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,880
You lied about failing to kill me.

196
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,970
You wanted revenge for my surprising you.

197
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,370
You're proud and arrogant.

198
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,060
You still don't see us—see anyone 
besides Ms. Frieren as a threat.

199
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,160
That's why you granted me an opportunity.

200
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,150
From this distance, I can blast 
a hole clean through your heart.

201
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,900
Try it.

202
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,830
Your head will fly before 
you get the chance.

203
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,750
Ms. Frieren, am I useful?

204
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,860
Why would you ask that?

205
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,530
I'm not as good at magic as you are.

206
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,820
I've lived for much longer than you.

207
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,690
In that regard, you'll never catch up to me.

208
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,070
I see.

209
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,840
But that only applies to mana and technique.

210
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,490
I often let you handle 
battles against monsters.

211
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,350
Yes, you've forced those on me many times.

212
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,410
I'm sorry, okay?

213
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,700
But battles end quicker when you fight

214
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,200
because you fire off spells 
faster than I do.

215
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,980
Girl, I have dedicated the majority 
of my life to the pursuit of magic.

216
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,290
So have I.

217
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,450
<i>How is she responding so quickly?</i>

218
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,670
<i>If I hadn't reflexively defended myself, 
that would've pierced my heart.</i>

219
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,900
You blocked it.

220
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
So your heart is your weak point.

221
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,710
<i>This girl...</i>

222
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,210
I see.

223
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,460
You weren't lying about 
dedicating your life to magic.

224
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,530
Then I shall crush you with all my might.

225
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,230
Balterie.

226
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,800
Sounds like they've begun as well.

227
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,230
It's a shame, though.

228
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,730
We're nearly finished here.

229
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,020
Perhaps I'll observe their battle.

230
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,070
Lord Lügner gets cross when I interfere.

231
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,500
Oh?

232
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,510
We're not finished yet.

233
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,260
You're tough. Perhaps I'll be 
able to enjoy this a little.

234
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,760
<i>My mana, technique, and control 
are all far greater than hers.</i>

235
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,520
<i>This girl cannot compare to me.</i>

236
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,510
<i>However, she's fast.</i>

237
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,090
<i>I'm being overwhelmed by the sheer 
number of attacks, pure and simple.</i>

238
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,290
<i>Damn you, Frieren. 
How did you train this girl?</i>

239
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,610
<i>I'll engage her in a battle of attrition 
and wait for her to exhaust her mana.</i>

240
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,130
<i>No, I can't.</i>

241
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,580
<i>The battle will be over before then.</i>

242
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,190
<i>If I could just create an opening...</i>

243
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,410
Linie, what are you doing?

244
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,150
Hurry up and defeat him!

245
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,310
Honestly, how selfish.

246
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,070
He's refusing to do anything 
but fight defensively.

247
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,210
How are you wielding your axe like that?

248
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,240
Those are my master's techniques.

249
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm skilled at reading mana.

250
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,360
I memorize the flow of mana 
inside a person when they move

251
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,450
and imitate their movements.

252
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,140
Just like this.

253
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,720
I knew it from the first time I saw 
your movements at the mansion.

254
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,090
They're the same as those of the 
powerful warrior I once memorized.

255
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,040
Coincidences really do happen.

256
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,550
Fate is an interesting thing.

257
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,310
You don't mean...

258
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,070
I am imitating the movements 
of Eisen the Warrior.

259
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,050
<i>Seriously? This is crazy.</i>

260
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,360
<i>I can't win this fight.</i>

261
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,320
He finally fell.

262
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,030
I must hurry.

263
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,230
Lord Lügner will be upset with me again.

264
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,910
<i>"Fell"? Have I fallen?</i>

265
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,560
Stand up, Stark.

266
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,540
No matter how battered you get, 
you cannot fall.

267
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,890
Yeah, but there's no way I can beat you.

268
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,810
Of course you can't.

269
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,580
I'm stronger than you.

270
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,630
Then...

271
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,270
But you got back up.

272
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,350
That means you haven't lost yet.

273
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,960
What kind of logic is that?

274
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,770
Stark, I'll teach you the secret 
to defeating powerful opponents.

275
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,080
It's simple.

276
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,890
Keep getting back up and hitting them.

277
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,740
For warriors, whoever's still standing 
at the end is the winner.

278
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,560
Damn it, Master.

279
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,690
You and your weird logic.

280
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,670
I guess your brain's made of muscles,
 like the rest of you.

281
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,680
You should've just stayed down.

282
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,410
You already lost.

283
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,050
I'm still standing.

284
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,400
Besides, I remember now.

285
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,970
My master's blows were heavier.

286
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,270
Yours are just imitations after all.

287
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,440
Then I will use those imitations 
to send you to your end.

288
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,650
Erfassen.

289
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,560
Balterie!

290
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,360
<i>A wide swing, with no regard for defense.</i>

291
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,770
<i>He's lost his mind.</i>

292
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,370
I was prepared for us to kill each other, 
but I shouldn't have been so scared.

293
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,080
Your attacks don't have any 
weight behind them at all.

294
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,810
Lightning Strike!

295
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,950
Linie!

296
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,160
Shi—

297
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,610
Zoltraak.

298
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,500
<i>Demon-killing magic...</i>

299
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,550
<i>And you alright</i>

300
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
<i>Can you hear me</i>

301
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,940
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

302
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,270
<i>Crying excessively</i>

303
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,440
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

304
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,490
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

305
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,200
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

306
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,960
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

307
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

308
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,170
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

309
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,220
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

310
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,970
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

311
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,060
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

312
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,900
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

313
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,910
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

314
00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:00,660
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

315
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,630
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

316
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,550
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

317
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:12,720
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

318
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,390
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

319
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,310
<i>for you to come back home</i>

320
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,730
She has roughly one-fifth of my mana.

321
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,130
I've heard there's a long-lived 
mage in these woods.

322
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,700
If she engages her directly, 
Frieren will lose.

323
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,760
You are no match for me.

324
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,230
What do you think, Heiter?

325
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
It's an elf village.

326
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,680
Kill all the elves.

327
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,990
Because you're a far more powerful mage.

328
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,980
Episode 10
A Powerful Mage
