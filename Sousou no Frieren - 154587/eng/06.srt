1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,790
So this fissure was left by your training.

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,030
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,450
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,370
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,330
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,670
<i>Across this land</i>

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,460
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:42,220
Beyond Journey's End

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,770
<i>The story ends</i>

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,270
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,110
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,780
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,280
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,450
<i>Makes people forget</i>

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,240
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,040
<i>Begin to rust</i>

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,870
<i>Just the same</i>

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,160
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,380
<i>And they live on</i>

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,920
<i>We chose the same path</i>

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,050
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,590
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,850
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,220
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

28
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,310
<i>Even now</i>

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,230
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,900
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 6: The Hero of the Village

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,390
You don't intend to fight 
the dragon, do you?

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,570
So why do you continue training?

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,140
When I arrived here,

36
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,540
all the villagers wore grim expressions 
and lived in fear of the dragon.

37
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,170
Now those same people are smiling happily.

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,270
They say this village is safe 
because I'm around,

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,290
even though I haven't done anything.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,650
The dragon simply hasn't attacked this 
village because it doesn't feel like it.

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,800
If the dragon attacks the village, 
will you fight it?

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,760
I don't want to die.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,680
But to the people of this village, 
I'm a hero.

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm Stark, the hero of this village.

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,860
I have to defend it.

46
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,690
That said, maybe I'd actually run away.

47
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:06,780
I got this scar on my forehead during a 
fight with my master, not against monsters.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,210
That was the first time he ever hit me.

49
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,310
He must've been disappointed in me.

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,440
In the end, he never praised me. Not once.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,490
What?

52
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,800
I don't think you'll run.

53
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,060
You think you know me?

54
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,960
I don't know the first thing about you, but 
I recalled my own terrifying experience.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,580
A terrifying experience?

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,670
My first battle against a monster.

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,630
I'd trained plenty until then.

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,810
But my fear made me weak in the knees,

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,480
and I ran.

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,340
The monster wouldn't stop chasing me.

61
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,470
For some reason, Ms. Frieren 
wouldn't help me.

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,550
My master was like that, too.

63
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,400
When it finally cornered me

64
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,730
and I steeled my resolve,

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,070
my body moved.

66
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,980
All I needed was resolve.

67
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,330
All the training you've done 
won't let you down.

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:44,140
Though you're a hopeless coward, I believe 
your resolve to protect the village is real.

69
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,150
Resolve, huh?

70
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,350
How did it go?

71
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,490
I don't know.

72
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,950
I don't know,

73
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,350
but I think it'll be all right.

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,660
He's not here.

75
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,790
I guess he ran.

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,230
It's a shame. I had high hopes for him.

77
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,770
We have no choice.

78
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,550
Fern, we're going to play tag 
with the dragon.

79
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,090
What?

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,870
Frieren.

81
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,570
You need me to keep it busy 
for thirty seconds, right?

82
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,490
You're late.

83
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,610
Will you promise me one thing?

84
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,970
If I die during the battle, 
I want you to finish off the dragon.

85
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,200
Very well. I promise.

86
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,830
But why are you willing to go 
that far for the villagers?

87
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,630
What?

88
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,700
I just thought it was a strange question.

89
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,220
I've lived in this village for three years.

90
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,070
That's not very long.

91
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,100
Like heck it isn't.

92
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay. Let's do this.

93
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,530
Your hands are trembling.

94
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,780
I'm afraid, after all.

95
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,480
You don't have to laugh.

96
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,860
You're just like Eisen.

97
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,870
My master?

98
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,210
Now this is a powerful foe.

99
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,360
Eisen, your hands are shaking. 
Are you scared?

100
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,380
Yeah.

101
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,830
You'd admit it, just like that?

102
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,650
Being afraid isn't a bad thing.

103
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,490
It's my fear that brought me this far.

104
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,850
You even tremble the same way.

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,590
<i>I see.</i>

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,310
<i>My master was afraid, too.</i>

107
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,170
<i>All I need is resolve.</i>

108
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,940
He's entered the dragon's range.

109
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,880
It's not attacking.

110
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,650
It's being cautious.

111
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,230
I thought so.

112
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,390
No wonder it stopped attacking the village.

113
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,240
The dragon is a smart creature.

114
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,640
It's not stupid enough to pick a fight 
against a powerful opponent.

115
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,160
Eisen didn't hit Stark for being weak,

116
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,570
or because he was disappointed in him.

117
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,540
<i>We parted in anger.</i>

118
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,480
You hit him?

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,270
My body moved on reflex.

120
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,460
I'm sorry for what I did to him.

121
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,640
I was afraid.

122
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,290
I was afraid of him, Frieren.

123
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,150
I couldn't believe it.

124
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,620
<i>My student will become 
an incredible warrior.</i>

125
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,450
Now! Fire!

126
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,600
Hey, why aren't you shooting at it?

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,590
I did exactly what you told me to do!

128
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,760
You expect me to fight it myself?

129
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,830
You can't be serious, you old hag!

130
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,900
You're just like my master after all!

131
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
It's already dead.

132
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,230
What?

133
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,000
An old hag, huh?

134
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,890
<i>I'm scared of what she'll do later.</i>

135
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,870
<i>I... killed it?</i>

136
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,550
<i>I defeated the dragon by myself?</i>

137
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,570
Stark.

138
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,090
You did well.

139
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,400
You exceeded my expectations. Well done.

140
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,090
Look at this mountain of treasure. Yippee!

141
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,290
We can't take it all with us.

142
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,220
No more than three items.

143
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,300
This is ridiculous.

144
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,920
You're interested in this stuff?

145
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,440
This stuff is a mountain of treasure.

146
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,150
My master said that you made the 
heroes' adventure ridiculous.

147
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,560
Oh?

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,230
He said it was a ridiculous and fun journey.

149
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,860
Wow, you actually made shaved ice!

150
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,790
I told you it was worth searching for.

151
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,030
Not only that, but it's 
fluffy instead of icy!

152
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,050
You're right.

153
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,020
This is ridiculous. Should we 
be wasting time on this?

154
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,420
Why not? Our journey's only just begun.

155
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,700
The Hero of the South, said to be 
humanity's strongest fighter,

156
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,410
was defeated by the Demon King's 
Seven Sages of Destruction.

157
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,270
We don't know if we'll make it back alive.

158
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,650
Eisen, would you prefer a 
difficult and painful journey?

159
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:32,920
I'd rather enjoy a ridiculous and fun 
journey I can laugh about when it's over.

160
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,540
Look! It melts as soon as you touch it!

161
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,290
Don't touch it. We're going to eat that.

162
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,310
Ridiculous.

163
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,200
By the way, Frieren, what about syrup?

164
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,380
I don't have a spell to produce syrup.

165
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,230
You don't?

166
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,250
Truly ridiculous.

167
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,710
Well? Can you see through them?

168
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,070
Yes, but it's not a very interesting spell.

169
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,030
Sorry my body's not more interesting.

170
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,860
What?

171
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,690
So small.

172
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm not small!

173
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,710
So, Stark, what will you do now?

174
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,480
You can go back to Eisen, you know.

175
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,970
My master told you to take me 
with you, didn't he?

176
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,670
Besides...

177
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,710
I feel like going on a 
ridiculous journey, too.

178
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,990
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero, in the fortress city of Waal,
located in Riegel Canyon in the central lands

179
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,510
Monsters are active in the northern lands.

180
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,590
No one's allowed to pass through 
the checkpoint currently.

181
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,830
When will the checkpoint open again?

182
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,410
Dunno.

183
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,360
At the very least, we've let none 
through since I was posted here,

184
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,010
monsters and people alike.

185
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,590
Excuse me.

186
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,000
Sir, the castellan would like to see you.

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
I'll be right there.

188
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,250
Listen here, adventurers.

189
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,310
Don't cause any trouble in this town.

190
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,840
That wasn't a very warm welcome.

191
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,880
You're right. He's a good guard.

192
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,710
Harsh on outsiders,

193
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,070
as town guards should be.

194
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,100
Anyway, this city seems safe.

195
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,310
We'll wait here for a while.

196
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,700
It'll be a good opportunity 
to take our time studying magic.

197
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,040
Once we drop our things off at the inn, 
I'm going to the magic shops.

198
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,830
What? The checkpoint's closed. 
It's not like we have a choice.

199
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,650
Go on. You're free to go.

200
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm going to get us a room at the inn.

201
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,910
Wanna get something to eat?

202
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,410
Right. I'll go by myself.

203
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,900
Scary...

204
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,960
I heard the sea routes have 
been shut down recently, too.

205
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,030
The northern lands' army 
plans to defeat them,

206
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,470
but it'll be at least two years 
until the checkpoint opens.

207
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,330
Business is at a standstill.

208
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,360
I haven't had this in forever.

209
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,740
The jumbo-berry special.

210
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,080
I was just a kid when I came here before, 
so I could hardly finish it.

211
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,130
I had to split it with my master.

212
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,320
I don't remember it being 
this small, though.

213
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,960
It seems that way because 
you're all grown up now.

214
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,980
I see. I've gotten bigger, huh?

215
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,790
Everything seemed so big when I was a kid.

216
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,580
Even my master's back that 
once looked so broad

217
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,920
started looking small at some point.

218
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,950
Eisen's getting up there in age.

219
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,390
I hope you're being a dutiful student.

220
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,080
That's what I'm doing right now.

221
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,380
Really, though, was it always <i>this</i> small?

222
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,780
The passage of time is cruel.

223
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,750
What? Got a problem?

224
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,530
I bought it with my own money.

225
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,640
Excuse me. Could I get a glass of milk?

226
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,820
Sure thing.

227
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,040
What? Why are you mad?

228
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,300
Mr. Stark.

229
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,520
Fine. You can have half.

230
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,180
That's not what I was going to say.

231
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,850
What if I told you we might have to 
wait more than two years in this city?

232
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,330
What? No, thanks.

233
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,830
Right? I don't want to, either.

234
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,000
Uh, yeah.

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
<i>What's her deal?</i>

236
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,770
I'm relieved. You're normal.

237
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,700
Hey, did I do something to offend you?

238
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,350
A way through the checkpoint?

239
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,530
Sure, I'll help you look for one.

240
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,340
Thank you.

241
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,350
Would it be possible to fly over it?

242
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,530
The border with the northern lands

243
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,630
is protected by a powerful barrier that 
extends to maximum flying altitude.

244
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,590
It can't be crossed.

245
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,770
That makes sense. Otherwise flying 
monsters would get right through.

246
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,340
Then we have no choice. 
We'll hit up the merchants' guild.

247
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,480
They might at least be trading.

248
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,620
Trade has been shut down completely.

249
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,910
If guarded caravans aren't allowed through,

250
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,730
then the northern lands 
must be quite dangerous.

251
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,740
We'll have to wait until 
the situation settles down.

252
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,370
No, let's hit up the black market 
and thieves' guild first.

253
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,670
Isn't that a bit dangerous?

254
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,980
We'll be fine. People think I look pretty 
strong, and I'm a decent bluffer.

255
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,890
And you've got the face of a scoundrel.

256
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,840
Shut up.

257
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,720
Well, that didn't work.

258
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,990
I shouldn't be surprised. They're 
basically fighting a defensive battle.

259
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,300
There's nothing we can do 
if the gates won't open.

260
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,860
Well, we've got nothing to lose. 
Let's visit the guard station next.

261
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,830
What?

262
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,510
I was just thinking you're being 
especially cooperative.

263
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,910
This was your idea.

264
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,070
I thought you didn't want to wait.

265
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,080
You seem more desperate than me.

266
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,940
Well, I don't have a lot of time.

267
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you mean?

268
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,950
The view from here is nice, isn't it?

269
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,830
You can see the north side clearly.

270
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,220
When I was little, 
my master brought me here.

271
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,030
We departed for the 
northern lands from this city.

272
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,620
What was your journey like, Master?

273
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,970
You wanna know? Back then, we...

274
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,110
Normally he hardly spoke about himself,

275
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,820
but he happily told me about 
the heroes' adventure.

276
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,490
Across his long life,

277
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,010
nothing was more important to him 
than that ten-year adventure.

278
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,740
I'm sure the same is true for Frieren.

279
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,550
I wonder.

280
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,430
But he's too old to travel now.

281
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,180
And he told you to take me with you.

282
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:37,810
So I need to experience lots of 
ridiculous and fun adventures in his place

283
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,940
and bring back stories to tell him.

284
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,140
It's all I can do to repay my debt to him.

285
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,280
If I take too long, my master will die.

286
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,410
Then we can't allow ourselves 
to be stopped here.

287
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,060
I bet he's still got plenty 
of years left, though.

288
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,690
Ms. Frieren, what are you doing here?

289
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,610
Quiet.

290
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,640
I'm being pursued.

291
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,450
Wh-What did you even do?

292
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,810
I don't know.

293
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,620
I was just visiting various 
magic shops, and then...

294
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,870
I'm sorry, Ms. Frieren!

295
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,290
Please forgive me!

296
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,600
Wait. I don't like where this is going.

297
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,640
It seems the guard captain was rude to you.

298
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,900
As the castellan of this city, 
I offer my apologies.

299
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,400
It doesn't bother me. He was 
just doing his job as a guard.

300
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,600
I'm actually not in any kind of hurry. 
I'm taking my timeâ€”

301
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,970
You plan to travel north again, don't you?

302
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,930
I hear the northern lands are currently 
engaged in an endless conflict

303
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,030
with the remnants of the Demon King's forces.

304
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,180
You must be concerned about 
the present situation.

305
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,930
Truly, you have the kindness of a hero.

306
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,020
The people of the northern lands 
will be delighted as well.

307
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,440
Please feel free to pass 
through the checkpoint.

308
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,200
I can't believe we're getting
 through this easily.

309
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,280
Shouldn't we have told them 
who you were from the start?

310
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,600
I didn't think there was any point.

311
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,200
I wanted to take my time, anyway.

312
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,300
And I don't really like this kind of thing.

313
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,490
It's an unsettling sight.

314
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,100
I'm glad I got to see it, though.

315
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,600
This must be how my master 
departed for the north, too.

316
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,500
You're right.

317
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,340
Aw, darn. I wanted to do 
more magical research.

318
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,660
You're still saying that?

319
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,340
We went through a lot of trouble 
after that, you know. Right?

320
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,150
Yes.

321
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,500
<i>And you alright</i>

322
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,020
<i>Can you hear me</i>

323
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,920
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

324
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,250
<i>Crying excessively</i>

325
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,420
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

326
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,460
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

327
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,150
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

328
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,940
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

329
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,610
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

330
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

331
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,180
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

332
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,940
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

333
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,040
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

334
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

335
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,870
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

336
00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,630
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

337
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,580
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

338
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

339
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,700
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

340
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,340
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

341
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,260
<i>for you to come back home</i>

342
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,780
It hurts...

343
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,520
Humans love to make a fuss.

344
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,490
He died in battle against 
Aura ten years ago.

345
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,530
Mom...

346
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,650
The Liberation Festival is tonight.

347
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,290
Then we'd be no different from the demons.

348
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,910
They're capable of speech.

349
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,790
I'm curious about that mage.

350
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,770
What a pain in the rear...

351
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,930
Episode 7
Like a Fairy Tale

352
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,850
It's like a fairy tale.
