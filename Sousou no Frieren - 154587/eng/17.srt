1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,040
But this is the goal of my journey.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,110
To reunite with my friend 
who departed ten years ago.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,000
Did you figure out where Gorilla went?

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,110
Tür.

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,830
It's a trading city in the middle 
of the northern lands.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,120
That's a long ways east from here.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,380
It's in the opposite 
direction from Äußerst.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,450
Yeah.

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,690
Frieren, I came on this journey 
to chase after Gorilla.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,410
I know.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,620
The sun's about to set.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,160
Can't we wait until tomorrow 
to make a decision?

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,230
I asked the village to lend us a cabin.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,090
They said we can use it 
however we want.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,840
Thank you.

16
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,650
Beyond Journey's End

17
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,010
Episode 17: Take Care

18
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,730
I got firewood.

19
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,190
I bought ingredients for dinner.

20
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,720
My hands are freezing.

21
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,430
It has gotten rather cold.

22
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,630
You're right.

23
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,350
Wow, this might be a new record.

24
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,380
Let me see.

25
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,630
You're right. They're really cold.

26
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,640
Right?

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,260
Don't!

28
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,390
Isn't this a new record?

29
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,340
Yeah. They're freezing.

30
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,710
Ridiculous.

31
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,770
It's snowing.

32
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,400
Will we need to wait 
for winter to pass again?

33
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,670
We won't be crossing any 
steep mountains this time.

34
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,280
Unless there's a serious blizzard, 
we'll be fine.

35
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,400
It's blizzarding.

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
It sure is.

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,550
Yup.

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,590
In this region, cold waves 
last an entire month.

39
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,930
I wouldn't recommend venturing far.

40
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,710
You can keep using the cabin for a while.

41
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,130
What do you want to do, Sein? 
Should we leave?

42
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,570
Do you even need to ask?

43
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,330
So we're stuck here until 
the cold wave passes.

44
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,700
That's what it sounds like.

45
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,590
But there are bars and shops here, at least.

46
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,510
This cabin's nice and large, too.

47
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,670
It's a lot better than the mountain cabin 
we stayed in before.

48
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,650
And most importantly, there's a magic shop 
in this village run by a shady old man.

49
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,450
In my experience, shops like those 
tend to have legendary-level spells.

50
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,570
Getting to take my time 
exploring it is a big win.

51
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,530
Legendary-level spells?

52
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,680
What kinds have you encountered so far?

53
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,530
A spell to get rid of mold 
and a spell to remove tough oil stains.

54
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,680
Incredible.

55
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,840
Those spells are so convenient, 
they changed my world.

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,290
They sound like a grandma's household wisdom.

57
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,560
In any case, the only thing 
we can do now is wait.

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,640
We'll die if we underestimate 
the winters of the northern lands.

59
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,540
Mr. Stark <i>did</i> nearly die 
in the Schwer Mountains.

60
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,340
I'm from the northern lands.

61
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,940
I know that much.

62
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,910
Anyway, sounds like we'll be staying 
together for a while longer.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,750
The cold wave should be ending soon.

64
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,250
It won't be long before you adventurers 
can finally continue on your journey.

65
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,780
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,990
Wait. Didn't we spend most of our time apart?

67
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,480
Sein.

68
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,120
Do you have a minute?

69
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,170
What is it, Frieren?

70
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,610
You don't often come to the tavern.

71
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,060
Stark and Fern are acting strange.

72
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,420
I think they're fighting. 
Could you mediate?

73
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,800
Sure, but why are you asking me?

74
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,680
Because mediating is a priest's job.

75
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,640
Is it?

76
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,420
What a sorry state of affairs.

77
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,360
What happened here?

78
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,640
It's Mr. Stark's fault.

79
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,360
Yeah, it's all my fault.

80
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,080
We won't get anywhere like this.

81
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,570
Join me in the other room, one at a time.

82
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,670
So, what happened?

83
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,270
Remember how Fern touched my cheek

84
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,520
with her cold hands when we 
first arrived at the cabin?

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,700
Yeah, I remember that.

86
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,320
Today, when I paid her back in kind,

87
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,660
she got upset.

88
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
What are you, a child?

89
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,970
Of course girls don't like it when 
you put your hands on their face.

90
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,440
Are you okay with leaving 
things the way they are?

91
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,740
I'd like to make up with her.

92
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,070
Stark. Unlike me, you're good at heart.

93
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,240
Be honest, and tell her how you feel.

94
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,840
If you want to make up, 
then you have to tell her that.

95
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,210
Frieren won't mediate for you.

96
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,050
I know. I'll apologize to Fern.

97
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Stark feels bad about what he did.

98
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,760
He's just a kid. He didn't mean any harm.

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,320
I know. I'm being stubborn.

100
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
I'd like to apologize to him.

101
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,270
It was my fault to begin with.

102
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,250
I don't mind that he touched me.

103
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,060
It's just... the arm he used to 
restrain my shoulder was so strong.

104
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,300
It scared me a little.

105
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,390
Do you not like Stark?

106
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,460
Why would you ask that?

107
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,920
Is that how it seems to you?

108
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,660
Then tell him you were scared and make up.

109
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,410
Be gentler.

110
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,860
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,680
Just start dating already!

112
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm not sure what happened, 
but I think you're trying really hard, Sein.

113
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,590
Thanks for the help.

114
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,610
Frieren, you're the only one 
who praises me like I'm a kid.

115
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,500
But you <i>are</i> a kid.

116
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,250
I guess it's not so bad.

117
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,510
You know, I've been wondering.

118
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,410
Why do you trouble yourself with me,

119
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,560
like when you invited me to travel with you?

120
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,510
Maybe it really is a dislike of my own kind.

121
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,750
The way you refused to go on an adventure

122
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,670
reminded me of myself before 
I left to defeat the Demon King.

123
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,980
It made me angry.

124
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,550
That doesn't explain why you 
concern yourself with me.

125
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,840
I think I wanted to give you a reason.

126
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,820
What does that mean?

127
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,550
It's what Himmel the Hero would've done.

128
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,970
Take my hand, Frieren.

129
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,060
I'll be your reason to go on a journey.

130
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,050
They gave me the courage to travel

131
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,170
and taught me the joy 
of spending time with friends.

132
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,570
Well, Sein?

133
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,200
Haven't you had fun?

134
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,990
Yeah.

135
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,640
This has been a lot of fun.

136
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,590
I'm going to become 
an unforgettable hero like Himmel.

137
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,990
I'm talking about the present, Sein.

138
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,490
So I decided to trust her words.

139
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,340
Gorilla talked about you a lot.

140
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,820
He said the two of you would become heroes 
whose names would be remembered forever.

141
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,930
I've decided to go after Gorilla.

142
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,920
I won't live with regrets anymore.

143
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,130
I know.

144
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,520
Take care, then.

145
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,450
See you later.

146
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
Later.

147
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,080
Well, that was a quick goodbye.

148
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,110
Unlike you two, Sein is an adult.

149
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,340
I'm sure he'll be fine.

150
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,870
It's so quiet traveling alone.

151
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,010
29 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in the Offen mountain range, located in the northern lands

152
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,010
Huh?

153
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,510
That's unusual. They're still asleep.

154
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,350
We've been walking a lot recently.

155
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,900
Maybe they're tired.

156
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,840
Good enough.

157
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,760
Hey, breakfast is ready. Get up.

158
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,740
Fern?

159
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,340
Frieren, wake up.

160
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,740
Just twelve more hours...

161
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,230
You can't sleep that long.

162
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,990
More importantly, Fern doesn't look well.

163
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,660
Hey.

164
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,420
Don't.

165
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,610
You've got a fever.

166
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,340
You need to keep warm and rest.

167
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,720
Let's see...

168
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,380
Huh? That's odd.

169
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,900
I brought water.

170
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,730
Found it.

171
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,320
What is that?

172
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,710
Sein left us some notes on medicinal herbs.

173
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,620
Sein did, huh?

174
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,200
I can use magic to identify her illness 
and figure out which herbs to use.

175
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,390
But I thought identifying illnesses 
was magic of the Goddess.

176
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,160
Didn't you say only the owner 
of a holy scripture could cast it?

177
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,250
I've got a holy scripture.

178
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,880
What?

179
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,460
You're using it as a pot stand!

180
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,120
I'm not cut out to be a priest, 
but even I can identify simple illnesses.

181
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,930
I can't identify complex ones, though.

182
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,300
You sure you're okay?

183
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,700
Yeah. It's just a cold.

184
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,750
Which of the applicable herbs 
are found in this region?

185
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,940
Come to think of it,

186
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,990
there's a place nearby where I once 
gathered herbs with Himmel and the others.

187
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,310
For now, let's head someplace 
where we can get out of the cold.

188
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,150
You're right.

189
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,640
Oh?

190
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,640
You're a lifesaver.

191
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,410
I didn't think anyone lived 
this deep in the mountains.

192
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,420
There was a whole village here 
when I stopped by before.

193
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,110
That was decades ago.

194
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,330
It was a prestigious village 
once visited by the hero.

195
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,580
Anyway, make yourselves at home.

196
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,470
Thank you.

197
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,010
By the way, isn't there an icicle 
cherry blossom tree near here?

198
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,590
Yes, north of here.

199
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,900
It's a bit difficult to get there, though.

200
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,630
It's all right.

201
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,220
I've been here before.

202
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,810
Well, I'll be working.

203
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,930
Wait here, Fern.

204
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,620
We'll gather the ingredients 
we need for your medicine.

205
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,930
You've been holding her hand 
since we arrived.

206
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,150
Because she seems to be in pain.

207
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,220
When Fern has a cold, 
holding her hand makes her feel better.

208
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,880
She's been that way since she was a child.

209
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,910
What's wrong?

210
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,670
Ms. Frieren, you're embarrassing me.

211
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,680
How?

212
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,980
Don't treat me like a child.

213
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,680
I see. You're right.

214
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,690
In two years, she'll be a full-grown adult.

215
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,270
It wasn't long ago that 
she only came up to here.

216
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,890
I was way taller than her.

217
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,630
But in the blink of an eye, she grew up.

218
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,380
In my mind, Fern is still a child.

219
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,480
I'll probably always think of her that way.

220
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,460
Frieren...

221
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,220
We'd better hurry and get those herbs.

222
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,400
Yeah.

223
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,910
We should be arriving at the 
icicle cherry blossom tree soon.

224
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,930
Is the icicle cherry blossom tree 
the last ingredient we need for the medicine?

225
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,800
We'll actually be using the mushrooms 
that grow at the base of the tree.

226
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,080
It's beautiful.

227
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,250
I wish we could've showed Fern.

228
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,450
It might be my favorite flower 
that blooms in winter.

229
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,460
Be careful. The flowers are poisonous.

230
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,720
Hey, why'd you hold Fern's hand?

231
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,080
Normally you don't treat her 
that much like a child.

232
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,450
I wasn't trying to treat her like a child.

233
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,590
I simply held her hand because 
it looked like she was in pain.

234
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,220
It's the only way I know to relieve her pain.

235
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,730
What should I have done?

236
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,360
I guess you just have to do 
what you want to do.

237
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,730
At least, that's what my master did.

238
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,770
People probably need emotional support.

239
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,330
Nobody dislikes receiving support.

240
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,380
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,660
You were moaning in your sleep.

242
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,020
We feel helpless when we're sick.

243
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,640
I lost my mother when I was young, 
but she used to hold my hand like this.

244
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,290
It's strangely calming.

245
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,640
You mean when you were a child, right?

246
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,130
It's not just children who 
need emotional support.

247
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,110
It doesn't bother you, does it?

248
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,140
You're right.

249
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,180
I guess it's not so bad.

250
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,360
I'm pretty handsome when 
I'm being considerate, aren't I?

251
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,860
Please just be quiet.

252
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,510
The medicine is ready.

253
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,850
Fern was probably embarrassed 
because I was there.

254
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,080
Nobody likes to be seen acting 
like a pampered child.

255
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,150
Thank you, Stark.

256
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,670
I'll try doing what I want to do.

257
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,580
To thank you, I'll hold your hand 
when you get sick.

258
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,880
Don't. It's embarrassing.

259
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,880
Okay, let's gather some mushrooms.

260
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,240
Hup.

261
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,260
They're bigger than I expected! Scary!

262
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,750
Now we just add the other ingredients...

263
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,020
And mix very, very well.

264
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,510
You're like a witch! Really scary!

265
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,030
Open your mouth, Fern.

266
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,570
You're good at that. Thanks for the help.

267
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,490
You think so?

268
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,490
It's all right. You'll feel better soon.

269
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,010
Ms. Frieren, I'm not a child anymore.

270
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,880
I know.

271
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,980
I know that.

272
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,280
Take care of yourselves!

273
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,290
Thank you so much!

274
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,580
You're looking a lot better.

275
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,280
I have the two of you and 
Mr. Sein's notes to thank for that.

276
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,260
The owner of that home was very kind, too.

277
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,800
Okay.

278
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,030
Our destination is Äußerst, the city of magic.

279
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,810
Could I take a look at that?

280
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,790
Try it.

281
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,600
Maybe I'll take a break.

282
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,530
This year's test-takers 
seem rather exceptional.

283
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,310
You wanna fight, huh?

284
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,440
I can't do this alone.

285
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,230
You have the eyes of a killer.

286
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,350
Don't call me an old mage.

287
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,250
Dunno.

288
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,580
The first-class mage exam will now begin.

289
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,020
Episode 18
First-Class Mage Exam
