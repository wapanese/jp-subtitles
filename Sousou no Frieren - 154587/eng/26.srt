1
00:00:02,082 --> 00:00:05,031
If someone would end up killing you,

2
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:07,036
it would be the Demon King...

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,074
...or a human mage.

4
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:40,085
FRIEREN: BEYOND JOURNEY'S END

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
EPISODE 26: THE HEIGHT OF MAGIC

6
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,061
It blocked it.

7
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,087
It's still within our expectations.

8
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:05,037
From here on,

9
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:08,033
it will be a battle of attrition.

10
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,051
They're really here.

11
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,071
Just like Methode predicted.

12
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:21,066
Don't get in my way.

13
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,027
That's my line.

14
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:31,048
Methode figured out
the exact location of the clones.

15
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,099
We have no chance of winning
if it becomes a free-for-all fight.

16
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,074
Before the clones can gather here,

17
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,099
we have to split up
and hold them back.

18
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,075
We have told each other
who our worst match-ups are.

19
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:47,000
Any opponent you find difficult

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,088
will also be a tough opponent
for your clones.

21
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:55,059
Our advantage is that we can
communicate and cooperate.

22
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:02,096
By choosing the right opponent,

23
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:07,048
we can make the fight more favorable
for us to some degree.

24
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,082
Against enemies
you can't win on your own,

25
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:20,045
you fight them with numbers.

26
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,059
It's almost amusing
how easy this fight is.

27
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,019
This way, we can hold back the clones.

28
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,065
All right, let's proceed with the plan.

29
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,028
Very well.
I pray for your success.

30
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:07,054
I have one concern.

31
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,088
The number of clones I detected

32
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:13,054
is slightly less than
the number of participants.

33
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,000
Most importantly,

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,055
I cannot detect Sense's clone,
which is our biggest threat.

35
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:22,068
You're right.
I couldn't detect it either.

36
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:26,031
We definitely cannot ignore Sense's clone.

37
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:30,077
If we got hit by a pincer attack,
I wouldn't be able to protect Fern.

38
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:33,015
Worst case, we might both die.

39
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:38,061
I still haven't figured out the locations
of Fern's and Denken's clones either.

40
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:42,045
Our only choice is to use more accurate
close-range detection methods.

41
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:48,066
We wouldn't have to worry this much
if you weren't here.

42
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,008
A first-class mage must be able
to overcome unreasonable odds.

43
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,092
This is still nowhere near that.

44
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:04,043
Besides, you can pass
by watching each other's back.

45
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:08,056
It's truly a kind and peaceful exam.

46
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,077
We defeated them.

47
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:22,011
It doesn't exactly feel good, though.

48
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,025
A surprise attack!

49
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,088
You monster...

50
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,063
I never even let up my mana detection.

51
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,078
Lawine, break your bottle, too.

52
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,026
You're old enough to know
when to quit, right?

53
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,014
We can retake the exam in three years.

54
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:55,006
Dammit...

55
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,069
I didn't make it in time.

56
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:09,007
That said, even if I helped,
the result probably won't change.

57
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:15,058
Even when its back was facing me,
I couldn't feel any opening.

58
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:20,029
In any case,
I need to at least buy some time.

59
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,084
You're Denken,
the imperial mage, wasn't it?

60
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,064
What's the situation here?

61
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,006
Are you planning to fight that?

62
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,023
I don't think you can win.

63
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,073
I'm well aware of that.

64
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,087
Say, Denken.

65
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,099
Is doing this
necessary to beat the dungeon?

66
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,011
Right now, Frieren is...

67
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:47,099
No need for the details.
Is it necessary or not?

68
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,037
It is.

69
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:55,012
Then I'll defeat it.

70
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:57,016
What are you talking about?

71
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:59,088
Denken is the strongest amongst us here.

72
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:03,025
You couldn't even beat Wirbel
in the first place.

73
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:07,026
That's not the problem here.

74
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:11,006
I certainly am a third-class,
inexperienced mage.

75
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:15,002
I'm so much weaker
compared to Denken or Wirbel.

76
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:18,052
But if it's against Sense,
I think I can win.

77
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,002
This is the spell I'm best at.

78
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:26,078
The spell that slashes
almost anything, Reelseiden.

79
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,028
It can cut anything I think I can cut,

80
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,091
and it can't cut anything
I think I can't cut.

81
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,033
What's your point?

82
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,017
That spell can easily be blocked
with defensive magic.

83
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:44,042
Oh right, you were watching my fight
with Wirbel, Glasses Boy?

84
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:49,013
Well, defensive magic is something that is
supposed to block other magic.

85
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:52,072
Makes it hard to imagine
cutting through it, you know?

86
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:57,001
I see. Then all the more reason
it won't work on Sense.

87
00:08:57,085 --> 00:09:00,064
Even from just what I can see,

88
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:04,004
her hair has layers of spells equal
to defensive magic cast on it.

89
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:08,011
I'm saying that logic
doesn't matter here.

90
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,068
This is all about visualization.

91
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:12,066
Hey, wait.

92
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:20,041
I knew it.
Sorganeel doesn't work against it.

93
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,046
Well, hair is still a part of the body.

94
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:26,092
It's impossible to get
her entire body in sight.

95
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,093
Reelseiden.

96
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,068
As expected, Übel would be
the one facing my clone.

97
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,043
I already know who will win.

98
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:42,056
It's probably not even much of a fight.

99
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:48,007
It was back at the second-class
mage exam two years ago.

100
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:53,095
The examiner for the second exam
was Burg, a first-class mage.

101
00:09:54,082 --> 00:10:00,079
Ever since becoming a first-class mage,
he has never been injured even once

102
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,071
because he specialized in defense.

103
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,005
The Immovable Cloak.

104
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,009
The cloak he created
with magic is embedded

105
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,077
with defensive techniques that prevent
any offensive spells from getting through.

106
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,072
In the second exam,

107
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:21,073
the participants have to use offensive magic
on Burg who is wearing his cloak.

108
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:26,048
If they can make him take a step back,
they pass. A very simple test.

109
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,066
There is a rule
that disqualifies anyone who kills.

110
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:32,086
It encourages the participants to at least
control their offensive magic,

111
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:36,032
to ensure the safety of other candidates.

112
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,037
Next.

113
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:45,049
No one was worried about Burg.

114
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,093
Oops, cut a bit too much.

115
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:05,064
And yet a no-name girl who had
just become a third-class mage...

116
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:08,086
...killed him like it was nothing.

117
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:15,045
I'm getting disqualified, right?
I know.

118
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,016
Can I go home now?

119
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,062
I have just one question.

120
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:21,037
Go on.

121
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:25,000
How did you cut through
the immovable cloak?

122
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,017
Let's see...

123
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:32,025
Have you ever sewn anything, Sense?

124
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,038
No. Why?

125
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,084
Of course, you look like you come
from a good family.

126
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:41,064
Or maybe you just take care
of those kinds of stuff with magic.

127
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:48,015
Well, I've never sewn either
since I'm so clumsy.

128
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:55,099
But I often watch my sister do it.

129
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:02,062
When you cut fabric,

130
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:07,038
you place the scissors like this
and cut it smoothly.

131
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:11,025
It makes such a good sound.

132
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:17,035
I always liked that sound.

133
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,001
I don't see your point.

134
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,081
It's about visualization, you see.

135
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:26,048
You see, fabric is something
that can be cut.

136
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,073
It's something meant to be cut.

137
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,048
She lost her mind.

138
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:37,015
Of course, anyone can
visualize cutting fabric.

139
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,086
Even an idiot can do that.

140
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,091
But the world of magic
is not that simple.

141
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:48,025
You can't make something happen with magic
unless you can visualize it perfectly.

142
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:55,000
Just like how a small ant can't imagine
crushing a huge dragon with its foot.

143
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:59,005
And against a cloak protected by
the iron-wall defensive techniques,

144
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:02,072
barely any mage
can visualize cutting through it.

145
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:08,001
If one is a mage,
they can tell from a single glance

146
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:11,048
that no offensive spell
can get through that cloak.

147
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,004
They would know
no matter how stupid they are.

148
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:21,078
Humans cannot escape that
as long as they are intelligent beings.

149
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,041
And yet, she followed her feelings.

150
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,059
Even though she has the intelligence
to know that she cannot cut it,

151
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:36,017
she managed to visualize slicing through
the Immovable Cloak with her feelings.

152
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:41,002
I'm not sure she can even think
like a normal human being.

153
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,003
This is in the realm of genius.

154
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,089
Can I go now?

155
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:48,073
Yes.

156
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:54,031
By the way, Sense.
Your hair is so beautiful.

157
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:57,007
It must be hard
to take care of them, right?

158
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:04,091
Perhaps I already lost
to her at that point.

159
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,058
I cannot imagine beating her.

160
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,078
She's the worst opponent for me.

161
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:20,017
Everyone thinks too much.

162
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,022
Hair is something to cut, isn't it?

163
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,022
Taking care of my hair?

164
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,072
It's pretty much hell.

165
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:30,038
I don't even want to think about it.

166
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:35,011
You should've just cut them off.

167
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,048
I think I get what
you're trying to say.

168
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:46,062
You guys are buying time
for Frieren to defeat that Spiegel.

169
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:48,033
Yes, that is correct.

170
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:52,000
We also took out
three clones ourselves.

171
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,025
Then I can cut to the chase.

172
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,093
So...

173
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,038
Oh my.

174
00:14:57,038 --> 00:15:02,005
I think Sense's clone
has just been defeated.

175
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:03,076
This mana...

176
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,068
Übel the third-class mage
must be the one who took it out.

177
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,071
Quite surprising.

178
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:13,043
You think? That thing
has no chance against her.

179
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:18,031
A battle between mages is like
a rock-paper-scissors match, after all.

180
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:21,011
But we have countless moves to win,

181
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:24,003
so it's an extremely complex
rock-paper-scissors match.

182
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:28,062
And that's why you want to increase
the number of moves as much as possible.

183
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,054
Sure.

184
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,087
I'll help you hold back the clones.

185
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:38,092
I'm not the type to trust others easily,

186
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:41,088
but I'm not stupid enough to let
a winning horse get away.

187
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:49,014
Currently, there are two dangerous clones
that we must stop no matter what.

188
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:55,014
And I've figured out the location
of one of them. Denken's clone.

189
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:57,064
I'd like to ask you people
to deal with that.

190
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:04,009
As for the other one, Fern's clone,
you can leave it to me.

191
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:09,066
It seems she's especially good
at concealing her mana.

192
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:13,079
If I don't find it, there will be
casualties from its ambush.

193
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,058
Are you sure you'll be okay alone?

194
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:20,038
I can focus my mana detection
better if I'm alone.

195
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:22,084
She's quite strong, you know?

196
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,099
I have many talents,

197
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:27,055
but what I'm really good at
is stopping others.

198
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,055
Also, I've made sure that...

199
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,055
- There.
- ...restraint magic would work

200
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:35,043
- I can't move...
- by testing it on Fern herself.

201
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:37,043
All right then.

202
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:40,044
Time to kick some ass.

203
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:44,069
So, Übel...

204
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,074
I'm not hallucinating, right?

205
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,032
Probably not.

206
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,007
I mean, you can't move, right?

207
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:58,046
My clone has returned.

208
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:09,097
Does this mean this will continue
until we defeat that Spiegel thing?

209
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:14,022
It's a war of attrition.
Now things are getting exciting.

210
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:16,047
Quite so.

211
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,052
Shouldn't we just give up already?

212
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,089
This opening is no good.

213
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,089
Right now,
Fern isn't good enough to notice it.

214
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,044
I guess I have no choice.

215
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:13,057
Just an opening from lack of
mana detection won't be enough to kill it.

216
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,082
You're right.

217
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:18,085
We could've won if we can
create a bigger opening.

218
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,037
You can beat it then, right?

219
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,054
Then let's make that opening.

220
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,042
Is that possible?

221
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,039
If I let my guard down,

222
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,009
it will let its guard down even more.

223
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,093
But then you would...

224
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:38,056
It won't be a fatal wound
if I focus on my defense.

225
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,027
So the strategy in that situation is...

226
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,073
I leave it to you.

227
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:50,069
If you think you can win,
then you will.

228
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,032
How can you be so certain?

229
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:57,099
Because I have always
underestimated you.

230
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,008
That's good then.

231
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:07,000
That means we have more
than enough of a chance to win.

232
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,052
It's still standing.

233
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:05,063
But it has taken a fatal wound.

234
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,023
I need to finish it...

235
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,003
What happened?

236
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,095
Was that an attack?

237
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,062
I don't sense any mana.

238
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:26,037
I don't recognize
this attack as magic.

239
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,088
Incredible, Mistress Frieren...

240
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:33,021
So this is the height of magic.

241
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,034
But that's so unlike you.

242
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,026
Your guard is completely down.

243
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,002
You did great, Fern.

244
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:58,099
It's been 80 years or so
since I was cornered into showing that.

245
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,075
Now then, let's get this over with.

246
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:28,018
So it is over.

247
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,002
I can't move...

248
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:35,002
Wirbel, carry me on your back...

249
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:38,028
Why do you two always
end up collapsing?

250
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:51,058
So this is the innermost depth
of the Ruins of the King's Tomb...

251
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:56,017
You have successfully conquered
the Ruins of the King's Tomb.

252
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:59,074
This is a historical achievement,

253
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:02,055
enough to make you equal
to first-class mages.

254
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:07,001
As promised, everyone who made it
to this innermost depth

255
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,043
has passed the second exam.

256
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:15,063
And where did the biggest
contributor to our victory go?

257
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:20,019
It's dark in here!

258
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,028
It's so scary!

259
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,064
So dark! So scary!

260
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:28,002
- So dark, so scary.
- Well, I guess I know the feeling.

261
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:30,079
So dark, so scary.

262
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,058
And with this,
the second exam is over.

263
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:40,001
See, it can even use healing magic.

264
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,042
Well? Isn't that amazing?

265
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:49,021
Who are you again?

266
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:21,095
- It has always been with me since I was little.
- You were unlucky this time.

267
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,098
- The spell Flamme taught you, huh?
- You were unlucky this time.

268
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:23,099
- Despite how it looks,
- You're severely depressed, huh?

269
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,094
- I'm in the worst mood right now.
- You're severely depressed, huh?

270
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:26,046
- The third exam will now begin.
- Let's go home already, Fern.

271
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,086
- Just make fun of me like always.
- Let's go home already, Fern.

272
00:24:27,086 --> 00:24:30,003
