1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,220
A grimoire by Flamme the Legendary Mage?

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,220
They say books attributed 
to Flamme are never real.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,150
Only forgeries have been found until now.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,580
This is probably the best imitation 
I've seen so far, though.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,300
Not bad as a reward for defeating monsters.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,640
I really don't understand the appeal.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,210
That said, when all you see are fakes,

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,100
you start to doubt whether the 
genuine article ever existed at all.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,550
Flamme, the founder of humanity's magic, 
is like a fairy tale herself.

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,820
A fairy tale, huh?

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,740
I suppose. It's been long enough since then.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,620
I'm probably the only one 
who remembers her face.

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,120
It's morning.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,440
Ms. Frieren woke up early!

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,850
Is that so impressive?

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,120
Of course it is.

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,970
We must be sure to praise her.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,740
<i>What are we doing?</i>

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,020
<i>Like a fairy tale</i>

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,440
<i>It's a sign the story has reached its end</i>

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,360
<i>Like a single passage taken from</i>

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,990
<i>A journey that was too long</i>

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,320
<i>Of the evil that once cast a shadow</i>

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,660
<i>Across this land</i>

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,990
<i>And the memories of the short journey</i>

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,450
<i>With the hero who defeated it</i>

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:55,210
Beyond Journey's End

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,760
<i>The story ends</i>

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,260
<i>And the hero goes to sleep</i>

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,100
<i>Leaving this land with</i>

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,770
<i>Days of peace and quiet</i>

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,270
<i>The passage of time heartlessly</i>

33
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,440
<i>Makes people forget</i>

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,230
<i>Even the tracks left behind by his life</i>

35
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,020
<i>Begin to rust</i>

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,860
<i>Just the same</i>

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,150
<i>Your words and wishes and courage</i>

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,490
<i>Are still inside of me</i>

39
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,370
<i>And they live on</i>

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,910
<i>We chose the same path</i>

41
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,040
<i>That's all it was supposed to be</i>

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,580
<i>Why is it that at some point</i>

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,090
<i>I wanted to understand the reason for</i>

44
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,210
<i>The tears that fall down my cheeks</i>

45
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,300
<i>Even now</i>

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,670
<i>If I retrace the journey we walked together</i>

47
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,220
<i>Even though you're not there</i>

48
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,890
<i>I know I'll be able to find it</i>

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,030
Episode 7: Like a Fairy Tale

50
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,750
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
on Eng Road, located in the northern lands

51
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,190
Thank you.

52
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,450
With the road blocked, 
I didn't know what I was going to do.

53
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,680
Hey, is this really necessary?

54
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,190
You're not happy about it? 
The reward isn't bad.

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,320
No, I mean, couldn't you just use magic 
to carry the cart to the other side?

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,310
That wouldn't help the 
people who come after us.

57
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,570
That's what Fern said, anyway.

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,350
You're rather selfish, Stark.

59
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,360
That's rich, coming from you.

60
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,960
Thank you.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, thanks.

62
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,960
By the way, why was there 
a landslide in just this area?

63
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,520
The northern lands have been 
fighting demons here and there, too.

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,560
This landslide was probably 
caused by one such skirmish.

65
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,670
The scars of battle, huh?

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,950
Mr. Stark, could you take a break 
from that to help me over here?

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,450
Mr. Stark?

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,570
Hey, could you stop calling me Mr. Stark?

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,590
It weirds me out. 
We're not that different in age.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,810
I see. Very well.

71
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,230
Stark, quit wasting time 
and help me already. Hurry up.

72
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,220
So rude!

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,550
I meant more like, can't you speak to me 
in a more casual or familiar way?

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,230
I see.

75
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,490
And can't you be friendlier, too? 
I'm sensitive, okay?

76
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,960
What a pain in the rear.

77
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,500
What'd you call me?!

78
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,990
Are you making progress over there?

79
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,790
Let's hurry, Mr. Stark.

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,220
Okay.

81
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you so much.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,190
If you'd like, I can show you 
the way to the town.

83
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,710
An elf, huh?

84
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,470
I've lived many years, but this 
is my first time seeing one.

85
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,600
I suppose we're something of a rarity.

86
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,980
Come to think of it, I've never 
seen an elf besides you.

87
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,230
There aren't very many of us.

88
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,590
I've only seen my own kind a handful of times.

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,300
Elves may live a long time,

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,180
but across the board, we lack romantic 
feelings and reproductive instincts.

91
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,250
We're quietly going extinct.

92
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,180
The last time I met a fellow elf 
was more than 400 years ago.

93
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,670
Perhaps we're closer 
to the end than I thought.

94
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,150
We can see the town now.

95
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,480
There's a line of wagons.

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,950
Those look like merchants.

97
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,280
The Liberation Festival is tonight.

98
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,030
Today's the day Himmel 
and his party of heroes

99
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,990
once defeated the demons who ruled this land.

100
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,610
Is that right?

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,040
That's what the Liberation 
Festival commemorates.

102
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,280
The statues of Mr. Himmel and his companions 
in the central plaza are decorated,

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,490
and the entire town 
throws a grand celebration.

104
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,320
Humans love to make a fuss.

105
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,050
They hold festivals for everything.

106
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,190
It's been more than eighty years 
since the demons were defeated.

107
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,670
That's more than enough time for something 
to pass from human memory.

108
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,010
But on this day, everyone 
remembers the party of heroes.

109
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,870
Nice work.

110
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,390
Five retakes, huh?

111
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,040
We finished sooner than usual this time.

112
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,040
You're always getting statues made, Himmel.

113
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,460
Because I want everyone to remember us.

114
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,270
Unlike you, we don't live that long.

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,730
I need future generations to 
remember how handsome I was.

116
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,390
I'm heading back to the inn.

117
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,910
But I guess the biggest reason

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,160
is so you won't be alone in the future.

119
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,300
What does that mean?

120
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,170
We're not fairy tales.

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,410
We really existed.

122
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,810
Every year, we celebrate the great deeds 
accomplished by the party of heroes.

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,800
Come to think of it, you look a lot

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,810
like the statue of Ms. Frieren 
from that very party.

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,190
Will they still be doing this 
a hundred years from now?

126
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,280
Yes, as long as this town still stands.

127
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,950
How about a thousand?

128
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,350
Well, I don't know.

129
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,500
Shall we go?

130
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,570
We're heading far to the north.

131
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,850
Come to think of it, you haven't 
told me your destination yet.

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,460
Where are we going?

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,490
Heaven.

134
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,050
Now that sounds fun.

135
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,070
28 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
in Graf Granat's domain, located in the northern lands

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,670
There are a lot of guards here.

137
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,830
Do you suppose something happened?

138
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,860
Let's decide who's going shopping.

139
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,740
Ms. Frieren, we're in a town.

140
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,890
I sense demons.

141
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,700
What?

142
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,980
Hey, you! What are you doing?!

143
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,520
Graf Granat, did you put her up to this?

144
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,710
Lord Lügner, while it's true 
I despise you and wish you dead,

145
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,970
I'm not foolish enough to openly attack 
peace envoys in the middle of town.

146
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,950
Peace envoys?

147
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,900
They're probably adventurers 
who don't know what's going on.

148
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,950
If you say so.

149
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,530
There's bloodlust in those calm, cold eyes.

150
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,370
Even the townsfolk who hate us 
look upon me as a person,

151
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,750
even as they tremble in fear.

152
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,190
But you look at me as 
though I'm a wild beast.

153
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,790
Aren't you?

154
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,880
You demons are wild beasts who 
imitate human speech

155
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,780
but can't be communicated with.

156
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,650
Throw her in the dungeon 
beneath the mansion.

157
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,400
Yes, milord.

158
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,280
Huh?

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,770
Hey!

160
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,280
I'm bored.

161
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,880
Ms. Frieren.

162
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,460
They said to reflect on your 
actions for two or three years.

163
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,840
That's shorter than I expected.

164
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,350
Could you bring me some grimoires later?

165
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,120
You really do love to waste time.

166
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,310
I'm not here because I want to be.

167
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,080
So, what did he mean when he referred 
to those demons as peace envoys?

168
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,950
I looked into it while shopping.

169
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,200
You know of Aura the Guillotine, don't you?

170
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,770
She's one of the Seven Sages of Destruction 
who served the Demon King.

171
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,110
She lost most of her followers 
fighting against us.

172
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,200
Last I heard, her whereabouts were unknown.

173
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,170
Did something happen recently?

174
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,930
Aura regained her power 28 years ago.

175
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,190
Her forces have been embroiled in battle 
with this town for a long time,

176
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,420
but they've become exhausted 
by the fruitless fighting,

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,780
so they're suing for peace.

178
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,700
So that's why they were allowed in as envoys.

179
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,190
That was a bad move.

180
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,480
Trying to talk to demons is pointless.

181
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,240
It can't be pointless.

182
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,850
They're capable of speech.

183
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,460
Surely the best option would be 
to resolve things by talking them out?

184
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,560
They can't resolve things that way. 
That's why it's pointless.

185
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,850
Demons are man-eating monsters.

186
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,900
Have you ever wondered why they 
speak the same language as humans?

187
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,970
Hero, you must slay the fiend!

188
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,790
It's only a child.

189
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:25,490
So what? That thing ate our daughter!

190
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,570
It hurts...

191
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,430
It hurts, Mom...

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,670
Enough. I'll do it.

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,700
Then we'd be no different from the demons.

194
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,380
It's not as though they have to 
eat humans to survive, right?

195
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,230
Why don't we give her 
the opportunity to atone?

196
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,190
Chief...

197
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,650
You can't be serious!

198
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,640
Give us back our daughter!

199
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,500
I'll tend your wounds at my home.

200
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,820
I've been looking for someone 
to help on the farm.

201
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,840
Himmel, you'll regret not 
killing it now. It's a—

202
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,840
Frieren, we're capable of speech 
with each other.

203
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,530
We'll be staying in this village anyway.

204
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,580
Why don't we see how it goes?

205
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,170
Fine.

206
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,280
Why did you kill the village chief?

207
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,030
We should've killed it back then.

208
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,280
There it is again.

209
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,780
Every day I felt your desire to kill me.

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,180
I just want to live in peace.

211
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,950
So I brought you a replacement 
for the daughter I ate.

212
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,710
That's the village chief's daughter.

213
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,960
But the village chief is gone now.

214
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,630
It seems I've made a mistake somehow.

215
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,030
Then I have no choice. 
I'm taking this child hostage.

216
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,240
You won't stop me again, will you?

217
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,110
No.

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
Mom...

219
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,200
"Mom" again?

220
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,880
Like monsters, demons don't raise their young.

221
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,930
They spend most of their time 
after birth living in solitude.

222
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:49,540
You're solitary creatures by nature. 
You have no concept of family.

223
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,450
So why do you use the word "mom"?

224
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,820
Because it stops you from killing us.

225
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,750
A wonderful, magical word...

226
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,350
For them, words are a means 
of deceiving humans.

227
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,290
Flamme the Legendary Mage defined 
monsters capable of speech as demons.

228
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,210
They're descended from 
monsters who cried "help"

229
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,210
from the shadows to lure humans to them.

230
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,200
Don't forget to bring me grimoires.

231
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,940
Graf Granat is late.

232
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,470
A human diplomatic tactic.

233
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,200
In any case, I'm curious about that mage.

234
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,010
I know her face from somewhere.

235
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,590
Wild beasts who can't be 
communicated with, huh?

236
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,790
That's an accurate description.

237
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,360
She's the only one in this town who 
understands the true nature of us demons.

238
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,630
There's only one reason that predators

239
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,100
who prey on humans would 
speak the human language.

240
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,600
They speak not to understand us 
but to deceive us.

241
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,140
This town won't be around much longer.

242
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,450
I should take advantage of 
the confusion to escape.

243
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,990
What is this?

244
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,390
My son's room.

245
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,710
He was a good boy.

246
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,940
He'd often boast about how he'd take over 
the family soon so I could take it easy.

247
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,070
His Majesty gave him this sword 
when he fought in his presence.

248
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,880
Where is your son now?

249
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,350
He died in battle against 
Aura ten years ago.

250
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,840
All that came home to me was his sword.

251
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,510
Lügner!

252
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,360
I only invited you here to avenge my son.

253
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,970
I'm going to kill all of you 
envoys here and now.

254
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,610
Your peace means nothing to me!

255
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,610
This room is quite clean.

256
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm sure you've been keeping it 
just as it was ten years ago.

257
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,590
So what if I have?

258
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,580
I've kept my father's room the same 
since you killed him, too.

259
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,850
Why don't we put an end 
to this, Graf Granat?

260
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,140
Or shall we continue to shed each other's 
blood and cause even more grief?

261
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,810
We're capable of speech with each other.

262
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,610
Please grant us the opportunity 
to settle this with discussion.

263
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,180
Show them to the guestroom.

264
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,530
I'll consider it.

265
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,890
Lord Lügner,

266
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,970
what is a "father"?

267
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,400
Who knows?

268
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,990
Graf Granat resents us, but he 
seems to be an empathetic man.

269
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,920
If we win him over, we may 
be able to convince him

270
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,870
to lower this town's defensive 
barrier in the name of peace.

271
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,890
Then Lady Aura's forces will raze this town.

272
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,220
By the way, Linie, I don't see Draht.

273
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,410
He said he was off to eliminate an obstacle.

274
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,220
He's acting rashly.

275
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,100
What am I to do with that 
hot-blooded youngster?

276
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,420
Lord Draht, you should not be here.

277
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,000
Please return to the guest—

278
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,300
Who are you? Visiting hours are over.

279
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,430
I am Draht, one of Aura the 
Guillotine's executioners.

280
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,780
I am here to kill you.

281
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,430
I see. Done pretending to negotiate?

282
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,070
We're just getting started.

283
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,270
Uh-huh.

284
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,510
<i>According to Lord Lügner, 
this girl is the only obstacle in our way.</i>

285
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:39,210
<i>If I kill her, and we win over Graf Granat, 
this town will fall easily.</i>

286
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,790
Just so you know, I'm strong.

287
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,910
Stronger than me?

288
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,270
Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.

289
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,640
<i>And you alright</i>

290
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
<i>Can you hear me</i>

291
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:02,020
<i>Trailing along deserted train tracks</i>

292
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,360
<i>Crying excessively</i>

293
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,530
<i>Wanting you to smile</i>

294
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,580
<i>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh</i>

295
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,290
<i>There's something I'd like to tell you</i>

296
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,040
<i>With words more precious than a goodbye</i>

297
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,710
<i>Unremarkable yet special</i>

298
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,260
<i>See, things that couldn't have been</i>

299
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,300
<i>Seen if it weren't for these eyes</i>

300
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,060
<i>Why? They begin to overflow</i>

301
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,150
<i>So, if I were to be born again</i>

302
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:48,990
<i>I would surely choose this place once more</i>

303
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,990
<i>So, if we were to meet again</i>

304
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,750
<i>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present</i>

305
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,710
<i>Even if no promises were made</i>

306
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,630
<i>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness</i>

307
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,800
<i>Those tears will be alright, 
dawn will surely break</i>

308
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,470
<i>I'm whispering our lullaby</i>

309
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,390
<i>for you to come back home</i>

310
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,890
Who is that mage?

311
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,200
Speaking so casually to me 
is a serious crime in this town...

312
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,610
We don't stand a chance against them.

313
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,880
You're a guard-killer who should be executed.

314
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,770
I hate fighting powerful opponents, too.

315
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,410
This fight is already over.

316
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,910
She slew more demons 
than anyone else in history.

317
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,060
Episode 8
Frieren the Slayer
