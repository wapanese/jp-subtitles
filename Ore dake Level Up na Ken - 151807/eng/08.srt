1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,350
An item that can cure all diseases, huh?

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,610
With it, maybe I could cure
Mom's Eternal Sleep Disease.

3
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,340
The Elixir of Life has three ingredients...

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,890
I don't have any of them,
but it's obvious where they are.

5
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,510
That said, it'd be suicide to enter
that castle without getting stronger.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,960
I need to level up more...

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,480
I need to get stronger.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,330
You accept, then?!

9
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,350
Things have changed on my end.

10
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,540
I'm willing to join you on the nineteen
C-Rank raids you mentioned.

11
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,910
Yes!

12
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,770
Under one condition, though.

13
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,590
Sure! Whatever you want!

14
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,430
You and I will be going in alone.

15
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,470
As in... You and I would be the only ones
clearing the C-Rank dungeon, Boss?

16
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,600
That's right.

17
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,440
But C-Rank gates require a minimum
of eight team members to enter.

18
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,150
So we hire people to meet the quota.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,620
The same way Hwang Dongsuk did.

20
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,580
I-Isn't that... kind of risky?

21
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,620
Think about it this way...

22
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,000
If it's just the two of us, we can clear
these nineteen raids with no casualties.

23
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,540
A strike team capable of handling
nineteen operations with zero injuries—

24
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,430
wouldn't that be the perfect thing
to impress your dad with?

25
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,430
I get you.

26
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,940
Let's do it, Boss!

27
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,080
I'll arrange the extra members and the gates!

28
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,060
And how can I help you?

29
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,980
Impressive. But I'd expect nothing less
from an S-Rank hunter.

30
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,980
I was waiting for the right moment
to approach you...

31
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,950
I hope you'll excuse the
interruption to your training.

32
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,430
Here is my card.

33
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,800
It's been over a decade
since the gates appeared,

34
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,300
and the world's changed at
a dizzying pace since then.

35
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,470
Infrastructure, the economy,
the media, even politics...

36
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,020
The dungeons have changed all those things.

37
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,940
In particular, our infrastructure,
the foundation of everyone's lives,

38
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,400
can no longer operate without
the resources from dungeons.

39
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,870
And hunters are the only ones capable of
retrieving these vital resources for our world.

40
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,550
Those hunters are in turn overseen by

41
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,290
the Hunter's Association,
a public institution.

42
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,750
The Association takes awakened
hunters, grades them for rank,

43
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,120
registers them, and handles oversight.

44
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,250
They manage the gates
that don't go to auction,

45
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,970
as well as deal with dungeon breaks.

46
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,730
But the Association is nothing more
than a function of the state.

47
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,380
The vast majority of those vital resources
from dungeons are collected by

48
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,110
the guilds: the businesses who
hire out hunters as a service.

49
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,820
The guilds have become extremely wealthy
from the dungeon resources they collect.

50
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,250
Among them, the Hunters Guild,
the White Tiger Guild, the Reaper Guild,

51
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,060
the Fame Guild, and the Knights Guild
are the largest five guilds in the country.

52
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,350
They have a functional monopoly
on dungeon-related profits.

53
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,550
And I see no reason to sit back
and simply let that continue.

54
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,420
Especially considering how important
these resources are to everyday life.

55
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,390
Leaving their collection to a group
of mercenaries is out of the question.

56
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,190
We've contributed so much to this country.
It's our responsibility to handle this, as well.

57
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,990
And the establishment of this guild
is crucial to our accomplishing that.

58
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,660
Y-Yes, sir.

59
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,580
Even if that's true,
there's a lot of risk involved

60
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,420
in recruiting an S-Rank hunter to act
as my brother's business partner...

61
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,630
Which isn't the case for me.

62
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,690
Looks like anything extra I do
isn't counted anymore.

63
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,690
It seems that cursed random loot box
that was offered in the secret quest

64
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,470
is out of my reach now.

65
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,780
I had hoped for an item as valuable
as the key to the Demon's Castle...

66
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,550
Wait. There's still the chance that
the regular random loot box

67
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,000
could have a key to something like
the instance dungeon from before...

68
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,770
Or not.

69
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,620
With my stats as high as they are now,

70
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,350
three points aren't enough
to make a real change anymore.

71
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,740
I'd like to level up more efficiently,

72
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,820
but I have to wait on Jinho
for the C-Rank dungeons.

73
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,090
Wait, the penalty zone!
Maybe if I fight that centipede...

74
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,950
No. I might have an easier time
running now, but beating it...?

75
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,770
And there's no guarantee
I'd get any experience points.

76
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,560
They need hunters for a D-Rank gate?

77
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,170
The Hunter's Association
is forming a strike team...

78
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,680
which means I wouldn't be
able to fight on my own.

79
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,250
Should I say no?

80
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,600
But I guess it's better than nothing.

81
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,810
This is frustrating.

82
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,210
I didn't stand a chance against you, Master.

83
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm just not ready to be
beaten yet. That's all.

84
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,540
It's a shame, though. I wish I could've
fought you at your best...

85
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,780
Still worried about that?
It's been months since I lost my arm.

86
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,110
An emergency summons?

87
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,010
Low-ranked hunters get a lot of calls
for what amounts to running errands.

88
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,770
You seriously won't consider retiring, Master?

89
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,250
Retirement?

90
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,330
You've got a point. An old man with one arm
missing might not be of much help at all.

91
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,290
That's not what I meant, sir!

92
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,180
Still, I may have lost an arm, but I survived.

93
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,580
My best years are already behind me,

94
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,120
but I'd like to spend what I have left
contributing to society.

95
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,640
Looks like I've got my next raid.

96
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,100
Say, honey...

97
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,220
Isn't it about time you considered
something other than hunting?

98
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,230
We're talking about this again?

99
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,420
But it's so dangerous. All those people
died in the raid from before,

100
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,930
and you only barely survived, right?

101
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,410
Well, yeah...

102
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,200
Daddy! Up!

103
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
The thing is, Eunji is starting
preschool next year,

104
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,780
and Eunha will be in middle school.

105
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,230
We need the money, don't we?

106
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,750
That might be true, but...

107
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,720
It'll be fine. The Association doesn't send
low-ranked hunters into dangerous dungeons.

108
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,680
The other time was just an exception.

109
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,410
You're right. I'm sorry
for making such a fuss.

110
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,770
Don't worry about it.

111
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,980
Be careful, okay?

112
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,890
You bet! I love you.

113
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,010
Daddy?

114
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,730
Yeah? What's up?

115
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,910
Daddy, are you strong?

116
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,770
You bet I am!

117
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,280
I can beat scary monsters, y'know!

118
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,660
Wow! You really are strong!

119
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,480
You've got some damn nerve.

120
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,130
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,780
I can't believe you stuck me with
that interview. It was a waste of time.

122
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,070
I managed to catch it.
You made a good impression.

123
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,720
I found your answers to be quite profound.

124
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm not here for a bunch of empty flattery!

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,310
And I'm pretty sure the interview was
meant to be for you in the first place!

126
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,990
Well, considering the offer
made to Chairman Go

127
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,270
was for a talented hunter of great character
who is dedicated to the job...

128
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,460
I mean, does that really sound like me?

129
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,240
Well, at least you realize
how sketchy you are.

130
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,210
Whatever! So, what's this about, anyway?

131
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,580
There's no way you asked me to come over
just so I could chew you out.

132
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,630
There was something
I thought you should know...

133
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,000
Yoojin Construction are getting ready
to launch their own guild.

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,010
I know. They've been trying
to make moves in secret.

135
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,130
There's been rumors about
headhunting at my guild.

136
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,690
I suppose if you already know,
then I wasted your time.

137
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,200
And I already know that you knew I knew.

138
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,080
Can we please cut the crap?

139
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,070
I'll ask you one more time.
What's this really about?

140
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,330
You haven't called much lately.
Is everything goin' okay?

141
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,650
Yeah.

142
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,300
How 'bout work?

143
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,170
Well... fine.

144
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,680
You've always been such a scaredy-cat.
Are you really handlin' being a hunter?

145
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,620
You're B-Rank, right? I'm sure most folks
would be pretty strong in that case,

146
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,680
but wouldn't you just be gettin' in the way?

147
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,390
You should come back home
an' help out with the business.

148
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,810
Your Pa's worried—

149
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,690
Quit trying to run my life!

150
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,170
I can make my own decisions!
So just drop it!

151
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,150
What are you—

152
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,660
I'm just in the way...?

153
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,620
But...

154
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,450
I wanna try a little more.

155
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,580
Excuse me.

156
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,210
How can I help you, Hunter Cha Hae-in?

157
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,370
While I was training, I was approached
by a scout from Yoojin Construction.

158
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,680
I thought you should know.

159
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,060
They're apparently launching a new guild
and wanted me to join them as guild master.

160
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,960
And I assume, since you're telling me this,
that you turned them down?

161
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,790
Right. I refused the offer.

162
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,100
That's a relief. Thank you for telling me.

163
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,530
It's nothing. I was wondering...

164
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,710
I saw President Baek on my way in.

165
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,000
What were you talking about?

166
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,560
What do you think about Jeju Island?

167
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,940
Jeju Island? Why do you ask?

168
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,540
Since the failed raid,
the island has been sealed off,

169
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,910
with only occasional reconnaissance
done from the shore.

170
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,570
And the public receives a single
annual update about any changes.

171
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,680
People are trying to forget about the island—
and the terror it represents.

172
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,490
Yeah, but can you blame them?

173
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,470
Except, no matter how commonplace
gates may have become,

174
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,480
or how much I get fawned over as
the "ultimate weapon" of humanity,

175
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,590
I can never forget about that island,
or what happened there.

176
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,840
I intend on clearing that island
in the near future.

177
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,840
And to do that, I need you
and the others on the same page.

178
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,360
We must gain strength, gather allies,
and sway public opinion.

179
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,360
That's why you arranged for the interview
and are training new hunters.

180
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,780
Isn't there something you left
behind on that island, as well?

181
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,060
Eunseok... Byung-gu...

182
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,480
Please. I'm begging you...

183
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,850
They have to die.

184
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm heading out.

185
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,440
It's a holiday, but you've got work again?

186
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,370
You keep busy lately.

187
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,650
I guess.

188
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,020
Hard to believe you're the same guy

189
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,690
who had to take time off to recover
from his injuries after every gate.

190
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,450
All the training pay off?

191
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,190
Probably. In any case, I'm able
to make a steady living now.

192
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,620
That's a good thing, right?

193
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,690
I guess it is.

194
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,150
Wait, Jinwoo! What about your stuff?

195
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,540
It'll be fine. I'm heading out.

196
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,980
Wait, hang on...

197
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,760
It's not like you're making
a quick trip to the store.

198
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,410
I didn't awaken to a physical power,
which means my sword

199
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,300
is useless against magic beasts.

200
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,590
The martial arts I've spent decades on
are useless inside of a dungeon.

201
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,590
A swordsman like myself gaining magic-focused
powers is quite the twist of fate.

202
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,350
But I'm sure there's a reason for it.

203
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,280
Are you...?

204
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,750
Mr. Song?

205
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,350
I wasn't sure it was you, but it is! Sung!

206
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,840
It's been a while.

207
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,340
I never thought I'd run into you
in a place like this!

208
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,900
I must say, where'd that
gentle-looking boy go?

209
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
How have you changed so much
in just a few months?

210
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,060
Plus...

211
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,520
Didn't you lose a leg?

212
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,850
When I woke up in the hospital, it was back.

213
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,270
I see!

214
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,030
There must've been a high-ranked healer
among the hunters who came to collect you!

215
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,080
Whatever the case, it's a relief seeing
a young man like yourself has fully healed.

216
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,770
That's nice of you to say.

217
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,140
But, Mr. Song, your arm...

218
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,740
Too much time had passed
since my injury, I'm afraid.

219
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,530
I don't mind, though.

220
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,710
You know, someone from the Association
had told me you were alive.

221
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,820
It's so good to see you!

222
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,260
What are you doing here, anyway, Mr. Song?

223
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,460
Answering a summons from the Association.
It's supposed to be urgent.

224
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,970
You, too?

225
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,570
What a coincidence.

226
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,560
This is quite the reunion.

227
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,410
Jinwoo?

228
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,030
Joohee...

229
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,430
Along with... Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

230
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,090
It's only natural.

231
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,930
We sacrificed Sung in order
to escape on that day.

232
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:41,100
And I can't blame Kim for being too ashamed
to face me, after what he did.

233
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,240
That said... five survivors from
that tragedy have been reunited.

234
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,310
In that case...

235
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,780
It really is you, isn't it, Jinwoo?

236
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,950
You look like a whole different person!

237
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,990
Yeah. It's been a while.

238
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,120
You're so much taller,
and your leg is healed...

239
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,790
I guess you were fine
after I visited you, after all.

240
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,380
You visited me?

241
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,090
Nice! We got a fine little lady in this group.

242
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,090
What's up, baby? You and this guy an item?

243
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,210
You should play with us—

244
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,570
Shut your mouths.

245
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,020
This outing isn't for recreation.

246
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,690
I'll now brief our regular hunters,
if you'd come this way.

247
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,650
What's going on here...?

248
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,130
These men are the prisoner substitute
hunters who will be joining you today.

249
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,370
Substitute hunters?! We're supposed
to fight alongside criminals?!

250
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,920
They are hunter convicts, but they're
here to reduce their sentences

251
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,980
and are unlikely to cause trouble.

252
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,510
We're short-staffed due to a exodus
of local hunters. I hope you'll understand.

253
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,670
What a mess...

254
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,100
You'll be accompanied by an overseer from
the Hunter's Association, Kang Taeshik, too.

255
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,050
He's B-Rank, so even in
the worst-case scenario,

256
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,370
he should be able to handle
three C-Rank criminals with ease.

257
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,100
Please, rest assured.

258
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,600
I don't know if this is a good idea.
You should sit the raid out, Joohee.

259
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,820
What about you, Jinwoo?

260
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,780
I'm going.

261
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,370
Then I am, too.

262
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,080
I understand.

263
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,670
Damn, it's good to be free.

264
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,630
We're not slaves here, man.
Is this kinda thing allowed?

265
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,170
Shut up. You're convicts.

266
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,430
You know what happens if you act up, right?

267
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,650
I'm Kang Taeshik, an inspector with the
Hunter's Association Surveillance Team.

268
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,920
I'll be responsible for them,
so you can relax.

269
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,930
Who's going to take point on the raid today?

270
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,460
Sung... Do you mind if I lead?

271
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,740
No, go ahead.

272
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,050
Thank you for giving me this chance.

273
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,160
M-Mr. Song?

274
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,030
On that day, seven people died because of me.

275
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,510
The magnitude of my failure to protect
everyone can not be understated.

276
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,100
But... six of us did survive, because of you.

277
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,840
So let me say this, as a
representative of the others:

278
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,680
I am so grateful to you.

279
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,920
You don't have to bow, Mr. Song.

280
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,720
Is it all right with you, as well, Kim?

281
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,610
Go ahead.

282
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,800
Well, with that being the case,
I will take point in the dungeon.

283
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,670
Understood. Let's get underway, then.

284
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,130
Off we go, now...

285
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,010
Into the dungeon.
