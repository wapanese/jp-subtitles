1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>I lost track of the instant 
teleportation stone!</i>

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,870
<i>And I don't have time to look for it!</i>

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,380
<i>The only way I can survive 
is by beating them all!</i>

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>Stamina's at its limit!</i>

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,180
<i>I can't use Stealth or Murderous Intent!</i>

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,180
<i>But that doesn't mean...</i>

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,930
<i>that I'm giving up!</i>

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,930
<i>I am going...</i>

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,940
<i>to survive!</i>

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,740
<i>I was always at the bottom. 
I know what it's like better than anyone.</i>

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,200
<i>But I could never give up 
on striving for more!</i>

12
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,140
<i>His nickname is "The Weakest 
Hunter of All Mankind."</i>

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,850
<i>Weakest? Not strongest?</i>

14
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,660
<i>Nope.</i>

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,870
<i>Like, a trip through an E-Rank gate 
landed him in the hospital.</i>

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,690
<i>He might be the weakest hunter there is.</i>

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,700
Sung, that's enough. You don't need 
to keep forcing yourself.

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,210
He's right, Jinwoo. 
You'd be better off if you stopped.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,960
You're getting what you deserve.

20
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,590
Why insist on something so dangerous?

21
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,090
You were an E-Rank, 
but look how far you've come.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,050
That should be more than enough. 
Shouldn't it...

23
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,470
Jinwoo?

24
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,260
The third Jeju Island raid...

25
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,550
My body was no longer fit for combat 
by then, so I wasn't there.

26
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,450
How about you?

27
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,350
I was. I was on perimeter security, 
acting as a point of contact, sir.

28
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,140
So many lost their lives.

29
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,010
And those who survived still bear 
the mental scars...

30
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,470
The kind of scars that all hunters have.

31
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,900
And they must overcome that pain,

32
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,180
or destruction will be all that awaits.

33
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,150
I gotta ask, is this really me? 
I can hardly recognize myself.

34
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,730
Taller, and in much better shape.

35
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,190
Looking pretty strong!

36
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,990
But the differences are only skin deep. 
On the inside, I'm still weak.

37
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,120
And it looks like I'm about to die again.

38
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,850
Sung Jinwoo, E-Rank hunter. 
That's all you'll ever be.

39
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,800
A dreamer who never learned 
his place in the world.

40
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,420
Shut up.

41
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,900
Still not good enough.

42
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,950
This is what you get for patting yourself 
on the back about how "ready" you are.

43
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,410
You're gonna get yourself killed.

44
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,660
<i>Is it all the same...</i>

45
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,060
<i>as back then...?</i>

46
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,480
<i>What happened after that...?</i>

47
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,180
<i>The quest is ending?</i>

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,830
I guess luck is a factor in skill after all.

49
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,480
It seems they don't want you to die just yet.

50
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,220
Until next time, then.

51
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,470
This is... the penalty zone?

52
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,280
Oh, yeah... I never did 
the daily quest for today.

53
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,180
Well, either way...

54
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,550
Nice timing. That "penalty" saved my life.

55
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,260
<i>"Good luck," huh?</i>

56
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,040
<i>Because the quest was just that hard?</i>

57
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,880
<i>Or because the system wants me to survive 
enough that it's cheering me on?</i>

58
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,500
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

59
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,820
Store.

60
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,190
<i>I've never seen my exhaustion 
exceed 90 before.</i>

61
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,970
<i>So if you're seriously injured, 
potions can't restore your HP anymore?</i>

62
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,480
<i>I can either wait to heal naturally 
or try and get restored by leveling up...</i>

63
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,510
Looks like I was worried for nothing.

64
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,160
<i>"Until next time"?</i>

65
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,320
<i>Right. If I manage to survive, 
I'll see him again.</i>

66
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,770
<i>And as long as it doesn't kill me, 
any pain I go through</i>

67
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,030
<i>is only going to make me stronger!</i>

68
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,070
That was a weird dream.

69
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,050
And Jinwoo still isn't home yet?

70
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,140
He can't be working this late, can he?

71
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,910
Could he have gotten a girlfriend...?

72
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,740
Nah, no way.

73
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,440
And I told him there's 
a guardian-teacher meeting today...

74
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,080
Will he be able to make it?

75
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,820
Being able to recover by leveling up 
really is convenient.

76
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,040
I've got over ten minutes left. 
I should sort out my gear in that time.

77
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,440
Buy.

78
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,730
"Knight Killer." Deals 25% more damage 
to armor-type beasts.

79
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,640
A little pricey, but that's not half bad.

80
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,100
Okay, that just leaves this:

81
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,970
the rune stone I got in my fight with Igris.

82
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm sure the skill will come in handy.

83
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,030
Ruler's Hand...

84
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,120
A skill that doesn't require mana? 
Should be easy to manage, then.

85
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,660
The ability to affect objects 
without directly touching them, huh...

86
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,610
Is that what he did?

87
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,560
I guess I can't move anything large yet.

88
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,020
That's all the preparations 
I can manage for now.

89
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,190
The rest will come down to luck.

90
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,660
It's only been a few hours, but you guys 
sure have grown in number.

91
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,610
We'll be arriving in the airspace over 
Jeju Island's security perimeter shortly.

92
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,900
Understood.

93
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,470
I'm sorry. I know this 
must be painful for you.

94
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,940
No. It's not a problem.

95
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,640
I wasn't a hunter during the third raid,

96
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,780
but I understand how 
you must feel, Guildmaster.

97
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,160
It's a relief to hear that.

98
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,260
Guildmaster Choi!

99
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm detecting multiple sources 
of mana from the water!

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,790
Bringing up the feed!

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,970
What the...?

102
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,250
<i>The Knight Killer is coming in handy!</i>

103
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,130
<i>This is way better 
than fighting bare-handed!</i>

104
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,590
<i>But...</i>

105
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,690
<i>What's this weird sensation?</i>

106
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,550
<i>I keep killing them, 
but it doesn't feel like it.</i>

107
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,760
<i>Plus, there's no sign of me leveling up.</i>

108
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,980
<i>And what are their mages doing?</i>

109
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,890
<i>They've been casting spells, 
but no attacks are incoming.</i>

110
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,690
<i>Only the knights have been attacking.</i>

111
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,520
<i>So what have they been doing?</i>

112
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,860
<i>Gates! It's summoning magic!</i>

113
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,360
<i>The knights are just weapons 
that they've been summoning!</i>

114
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,350
<i>I can beat them, but it won't 
give me any experience!</i>

115
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,160
<i>Which means I should target...</i>

116
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,890
<i>you mages!</i>

117
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,880
I was right. I need to go after the mages.

118
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,970
Now that I know that...

119
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
<i>Five more to go!</i>

120
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,340
<i>Four more!</i>

121
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,080
How long are you gonna hide back there?!

122
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,420
<i>Three left!</i>

123
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,370
<i>A golem?!</i>

124
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,830
<i>I bet they think a single, stronger enemy 
will fare better than the knights...</i>

125
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,070
<i>but having fewer targets 
just makes it easier to go after you guys!</i>

126
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,640
The casters are already gone!

127
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,590
So why don't you...

128
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,850
shut the hell down?!

129
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,480
It's over, right? Now what happens?

130
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,870
I can switch to a more advanced class 
with the points I've earned...

131
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,270
I'm getting a class based on 
my performance during the quest?

132
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,480
So I don't get to choose?

133
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,410
Huh? What's that mean?

134
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,070
The shadow... army?

135
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,590
Hang on, what the hell is this?!

136
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,640
This is my new job class...?

137
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,060
Necromancer?!

138
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,190
Hang on a second! I haven't put 
anything into my intellect stat!

139
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,640
So how did I...?

140
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,400
<i>Necromancers are usually a magic-type class 
that summons undead monsters as servants.</i>

141
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,200
<i>But I'm an assassin build,</i>

142
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,340
<i>with a close-range combat style.</i>

143
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,870
<i>My main stat is strength, 
and my skills fit that style, too!</i>

144
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,550
<i>If I get a back-line class like necromancer, 
all that will be wasted!</i>

145
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,300
Yes or no? I can reject it?

146
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,820
<i>Changing my class to necromancer... 
The benefits are too unclear.</i>

147
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,830
No.

148
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,050
A hidden class?!

149
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,650
<i>Does this mean it has 
some kind of special power?</i>

150
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,110
A necromancer... If I had some 
kind of example to judge by...

151
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,240
<i>Summoning magic!</i>

152
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,710
<i>That's right. Those mages 
were using summoning magic.</i>

153
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,000
<i>In terms of commanding others, that's a 
similar power to that of a necromancer.</i>

154
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,920
<i>Not only that, but my previous fights here</i>

155
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,010
<i>all felt like I was revisiting 
my past battles...</i>

156
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,240
<i>It was called a job-change quest, 
but was this all prearranged?</i>

157
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>Is the system doing this?</i>

158
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,140
<i>Still, it's interesting.</i>

159
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,540
<i>These guys weren't very strong on their own.</i>

160
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,430
<i>But I am.</i>

161
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,610
<i>There's no rule that says necromancers 
can't fight on the front lines.</i>

162
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,860
<i>If classes work like stats do, 
then as I level up, my skills will, too.</i>

163
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,080
<i>It makes sense that this shadow army
thing would become stronger as a result.</i>

164
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,640
<i>In other words,</i>

165
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,590
<i>I won't be solo leveling anymore!</i>

166
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,770
All right, then. Yes.

167
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,010
Here you are.

168
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,330
Thank you.

169
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,680
It's already dawn.

170
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,450
Hunter Choi and his people should 
have arrived at the island by now.

171
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,310
Right.

172
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,500
Sorry to keep you so late.

173
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,650
It's fine.

174
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,810
Since you're here, would you 
mind humoring me for a bit?

175
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,920
<i>"Shadow monarch"? 
I've already got another class?!</i>

176
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>Did I really earn that many points?</i>

177
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,880
<i>Unique class skills and 10 ability points... 
Along with a new title...</i>

178
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,970
<i>If my rewards are ready, 
is the quest finally over?</i>

179
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,870
<i>Have I completed the job change?</i>

180
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:28,280
<i>I can hear something like a moaning... 
It sounds like people in pain.</i>

181
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,570
<i>Shadow Extraction...</i>

182
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,750
I have to designate a command word...

183
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,880
Arise.

184
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,320
This is awesome!

185
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,330
<i>The unique skills are Shadow Extraction 
and Shadow Storage.</i>

186
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
<i>A skill that lets you drain mana 
to create shadow soldiers,</i>

187
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,160
<i>and one that lets you hold onto those shadows 
and summon them whenever you want...</i>

188
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,050
<i>These must be those shadow soldiers.</i>

189
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,130
<i>I'll have to be careful, 
since the extraction can fail</i>

190
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,300
<i>depending on the strength of the target 
and the time since death.</i>

191
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,030
<i>And I've got the mages, 
as well as the knights.</i>

192
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,670
<i>They come in different ranks, too.</i>

193
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,650
<i>If it's possible to extract 
A or S-Rank shadows,</i>

194
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>and their strength reflects 
how strong they were in life...</i>

195
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,900
Good!

196
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,370
There seems to be an upper limit 
to extractions and storage.

197
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,780
I'll release 11 of the infantry.

198
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,470
Sorry to wake you for nothing.

199
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,840
Now, then...

200
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,560
<i>Knight Commander Igris the Bloodred.</i>

201
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,290
<i>If I can bring him under my control...</i>

202
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,760
Arise.

203
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,190
<i>What?!</i>

204
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,480
This must've been what it 
was warning about before.

205
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,520
Two more tries...

206
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Arise!

207
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,970
Damn it!

208
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,750
It goes without saying, but unless 
we hunters undergo a reawakening,

209
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,260
our powers will neither 
grow stronger or weaker.

210
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,470
Which is why we train our combat 
techniques and gather allies.

211
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,430
Are you waiting for your king's return?

212
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,650
When you have no idea when that might be?

213
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,460
Knight Commander Igris...

214
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,040
You're a warrior.

215
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,400
Cutting down foes with that sword 
should be your purpose in life.

216
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,990
Do you really intend to let it rust 
in this dank and decrepit place?

217
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,610
If you need someone to whom you 
can dedicate your sword, serve me.

218
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,210
Instead of defending the throne 
of one long gone,

219
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,120
defend the man who stands before you.

220
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,880
Arise.

221
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,930
Which is why... there's something 
I like to envision occasionally.

222
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,740
About how there are new awakenings every day.

223
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,540
It should be obvious.

224
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,790
Igris.

225
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,670
That's your name.

226
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,360
Someone who defies all our expectations,

227
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,050
strong enough to become a new guiding light,

228
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,990
could be born this very moment.

229
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,910
You're with me now.

230
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,540
Guildmaster Choi...

231
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,080
What in the world is this?

232
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,390
I don't know.

233
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,760
To my knowledge, 
this has never happened before.

234
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,520
But now...

235
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,490
They're evolving?
