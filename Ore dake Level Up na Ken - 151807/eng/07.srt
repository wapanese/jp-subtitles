00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:29,099
SOLO LEVELING

2
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,078
Excuse me, Chief Woo.

3
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,087
What is it?

4
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:38,054
Please take a look at this.

5
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:43,003
This is a report on the six Hunters
who died in a C-Rank dungeon.

6
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,075
The survivors are a D-Rank
and an E-Rank Hunter.

7
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,042
Looks like they ran away.

8
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,084
It happens all the time.

9
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:52,097
No, they didn't run, but they managed
to kill the Boss and escaped.

10
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:58,001
The D-Rank Hunter Yoo Jinho
had quite expensive equipment.

11
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,043
It's not surprising that they—

12
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,073
What do you want to say?

13
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:03,039
Investigate it yourself
if you think it's suspicious.

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,065
No...

15
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:07,032
It's just one of the survivors

16
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:09,086
is the survivor from the Double Dungeon,

17
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,002
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

18
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:13,024
Sung Jinwoo?

19
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,083
And one of the six who died

20
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,065
is Hunter Hwang Dongsuk.

21
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:27,025
The brother of
Hunter Hwang Dongsoo, huh?

22
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,038
Then it is indeed concerning...

23
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,017
I'm back.

24
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,063
Welcome home.

25
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,026
Eh?

26
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,001
Ah, souvenirs?

27
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,039
It's fried chicken!

28
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,064
Did something good happen?

29
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:43,012
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

30
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:47,005
I've saved up for Mom's medical
bills and our living expenses.

31
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:50,063
That's unusual for my stingy
brother to spend money.

32
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:53,024
Oh, right.

33
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:57,003
What happened last time?

34
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:57,091
What?

35
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,007
The raid mission.

36
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,049
They paid you a lot, right?

37
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,091
But you didn't seem
to have any injuries,

38
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:05,059
so I thought your companions
must be strong.

39
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,032
Well, yeah.

40
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:14,037
So you guys killed
the enemies easily, right?

41
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,093
Yes, that was easy.

42
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,038
Regardless of the difference in strength,

43
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,000
at that moment,
I had no hesitation.

44
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,035
Moreover,

45
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:28,065
I didn't even despise them.

46
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:32,086
If it were the old me,
I would have tried to run away.

47
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:36,007
Has my bravery increased with my level?

48
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,078
But my opponents aren't magic beasts.

49
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:40,049
They are people...

50
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:43,004
Brother?

51
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,029
You okay? Are you feeling sick?

52
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:49,038
I thought the clerk didn't give me
the change, but I was mistaken.

53
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:50,005
What?

54
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:53,013
Seriously, don't scare me.

55
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:59,047
Don't think about that now.

56
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:02,031
I must keep getting
stronger for my family.

57
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,014
And I mustn't die.

58
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,081
If the same thing happens again,
I will do just the same.

59
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,073
What is this?

60
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,023
Harmful substance?

61
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,016
Is it detoxifying me?

62
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,062
Thanks for the food.

63
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,003
Are you done eating?

64
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,058
Then I'll eat it all up.

65
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,002
Then don't complain
if you getting fat.

66
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,088
I can't get drunk at all.

67
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:43,097
The system's special ability
has broken down the alcohol.

68
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,006
Is it the effect of some skill?

69
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:50,039
SECRET QUEST: COURAGE OF THE WEAK
Blessing...

70
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,000
Health and longevity...

71
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:57,041
Improved my regenerative capacity
and disabled toxic and abnormal conditions...

72
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,068
This is it.

73
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,091
The reward for the Double Dungeon mission.

74
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,066
So much has happened,
so I never bothered to check.

75
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:08,045
Is this why my limbs could regenerate?

76
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:11,068
There are many things
I'm unclear about.

77
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,059
Brother.

78
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:20,088
Someone named Yoo Jinho
called for you.

79
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,088
Huh?

80
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,085
I'll be right there.

81
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,064
You've drank too much.

82
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:29,006
Alcohol is poison to the body.

83
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:30,056
I'm fine.

84
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:36,027
Even if I became a doctor,
I wouldn't treat you.

85
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:37,015
CAFE PENE

86
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,069
Sorry for suddenly calling you out.

87
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,078
I didn't expect to see you again.

88
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:43,041
I'm really happy.

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,066
You saved my life after all, Jinwoo.

90
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,087
Thanks for giving me the magic gem too.
You helped a lot.

91
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,008
And thank you,

92
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,096
for keeping quiet about that "incident."

93
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,084
T-That's because they tried to kill us first!

94
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:00,046
It was self-defense.

95
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:03,088
So, what did you want from me?

96
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,051
Sir, I plan to build an attack te—

97
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:08,051
I refuse.

98
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,052
Huh?

99
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,076
U-Umm...

100
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,006
At least hear me out first.

101
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:15,006
I'm not interested in
hanging out with a rich guy.

102
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,006
20 times!

103
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,023
No...

104
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:20,015
Just 19 times!

105
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,053
19 times?

106
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:23,053
You want to be a Guild Master?

107
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,091
Please let me finish first.

108
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,074
Please!

109
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,006
Go on then.

110
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,063
Yes!

111
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:39,075
As you speculated,

112
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:42,059
I want to obtain
the Guild Master's license.

113
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,034
One of the conditions

114
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:47,051
is that a Hunter must participate
in raid missions at least 20 times.

115
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,058
And the last mission was my first one.

116
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:52,089
To take over the company,
I've studied hard.

117
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,073
So I'm confident about the written exam.

118
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:55,077
But...

119
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,048
My real combat skills...

120
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:01,061
Aren't you the second young
master of Yoojin Construction?

121
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:05,007
I'm also doing this for our company.

122
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:08,057
Honestly, my father wants
to establish a guild.

123
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:10,087
Yoojin Construction
wants to establish a guild?

124
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,004
Yes.

125
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:18,005
Dungeons are certainly dangerous,
but they contain many rare treasures.

126
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:22,046
Magic gems and mana crystals
are just a part of it.

127
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:25,072
The bodies of high-rank beasts can
be used as materials for equipment.

128
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:30,003
One can say that everything
in the dungeon can be monetized.

129
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:34,077
You plan to have your own Hunters conquer
the dungeons and take all the spoils,

130
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,073
so as to establish
a self-sufficient system?

131
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,055
That's right.

132
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:41,036
My father plans to hire an S-Rank
Hunter to be the Guild Master

133
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,032
and my brother as the Vice-Guild Master

134
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:45,007
to run the guild like a company.

135
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,004
A S-Rank Hunter?

136
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:48,041
There are only seven of them nationally.

137
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,032
Yes.

138
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:53,045
Moreover, Min Byung-Gu,
the only one who hasn't joined a guild,

139
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,091
has already retired.

140
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:57,062
Are you planning to poach
from other guilds?

141
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,088
I advise you not to do that.

142
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:04,051
The guilds that you poach
from will give you trouble.

143
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,008
My brother is not one of the Awakened,
so he can't be the Guild Master.

144
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:11,043
So you want to gain experience
and become the Guild Master

145
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,001
to compete with your brother?

146
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:16,093
If you want to hide your power
and participate in missions,

147
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,039
you will need companions.

148
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,094
Rather than teaming up
with high-ranked Hunters,

149
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:23,065
completing the raid missions
with an E-Rank Hunter

150
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:25,036
would be more convincing to my father.

151
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,095
You are at least B-Rank...

152
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:31,024
No, it might even be higher.

153
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:34,012
Teaming up with
the wrong one could be fatal.

154
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,029
But if it's you...

155
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,067
Take a look at this.

156
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,055
This building is planned
to be the guild's office.

157
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:47,001
It's currently valued at 30 billion.

158
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:51,022
This is the reward I am offering you.

159
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:54,056
30 billion for 19 C-Rank missions.

160
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:57,018
Before, I would have accepted right away.

161
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,043
But...

162
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:03,011
If I'm the only one in the world
who can level up, that's a different story.

163
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:05,078
If I keep developing like this,

164
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,036
someday I will be S-Rank...

165
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,036
No,

166
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:10,057
I may be even higher than that.

167
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:14,074
In that case, 30 billion seems trivial.

168
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,095
More importantly,

169
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,066
teaming up with people

170
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:21,079
without understanding
the impact of leveling up

171
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,029
is too risky.

172
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,077
Sorry.

173
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,034
Please wait!

174
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,018
As long as you help me,

175
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:35,047
I will keep this secret
for you for a lifetime.

176
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,078
I want the information
on those two survivors.

177
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:54,007
Bring me their documents immediately.

178
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,066
Excuse me.

179
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,004
I have brought the documents.

180
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:01,096
Mr. Hwang.

181
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,009
My brother was killed.

182
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,034
This has not been confirmed...

183
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,038
The documents?

184
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,043
Yes, right here.

185
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:20,014
Laura, what would happen if I killed
someone in another country?

186
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,014
Are you serious?

187
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:32,036
In a country with a treaty regarding
Hunter crimes, you would be prosecuted

188
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:34,032
under that country's laws.

189
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,091
But if there's no extradition treaty,

190
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:39,041
you would be subject to
the laws of our own country.

191
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:41,033
So...

192
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,012
Depending on negotiations with
the government, there might be leniency.

193
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:48,054
Adjust my schedule.

194
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:52,051
Sudden changes in schedule will affect
the operation of the guild.

195
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:54,047
What's my schedule like?

196
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,051
It's fully booked for now.

197
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:59,085
Then clear it for later.

198
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,043
I understand.

199
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,052
I will arrange it.

200
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,069
D-Rank Hunter Yoo Jinho.

201
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,077
E-Rank Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

202
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:16,066
I just hope you both
are still alive until then.

203
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:24,037
It's rare to see you exercising.

204
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:28,008
Studying all the time
is harmful to health, right?

205
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,047
Oh? You ate too much fried chicken, right?

206
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:32,083
Hmph!

207
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,018
Hey.

208
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:41,043
If you had 30 billion,
what would you do?

209
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,014
Why are you asking?

210
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,054
Just a random question.

211
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:48,095
Pay mom's medical bills
and college tuition fees.

212
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,061
And the rest?

213
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,009
Hmm...

214
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,057
Save it up.

215
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,065
I don't know.
That's too much money.

216
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,065
Hmm.

217
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:58,028
That's true.

218
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,082
Just keep up at your own pace.

219
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,007
Eh?

220
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:03,066
Wait, brother!

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,033
Even as an E-Rank one,
he is still a Hunter.

222
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,092
Yes...

223
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:16,092
No, don't check.

224
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,083
11 kilometers?

225
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,064
Why are the numbers exceeding
when I accomplish the goal?

226
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,085
I see.

227
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,048
Then let's see how far I can go.

228
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,015
Brother...

229
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,061
I finally caught up...

230
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,003
I'll have another lap.

231
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:44,015
Eh?!

232
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,005
It stopped at twice the goal.

233
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,079
Then the rest...

234
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:00,097
SECRET QUEST:
STRENGTH TRAINING HAS ARRIVED

235
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:05,006
The daily quest became the secret quest?

236
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:06,091
Yes.

237
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,077
I can choose different boxes.

238
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:14,073
CURSED RANDOM LOOT BOX
Guess I'll choose Blessed Random Loot Box.

239
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:30,046
A key again?

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The Demon's Castle...

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,088
Acquisition difficulty of S-Rank?!

242
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:47,097
Cures all illnesses with powerful magic...

243
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,056
...Elixir of Life!

244
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:01,003
If that Elixir of Life

245
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:04,011
really can cure all illnesses...

246
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:07,041
I've decided.

247
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:19,008
If the acquisition difficulty of the key
is proportional to the difficulty of dungeon,

248
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,055
then I am opening an S-Rank dungeon.

249
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,055
If so,

250
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,047
what awaits me inside will be magic beasts

251
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,047
similar to those on Jeju Island
that even S-Rank Hunters can't handle.

252
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:41,019
With my current strength,

253
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,095
can I deal with beasts of that level?

254
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,083
It'd be a lie to say I'm not scared.

255
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,075
If things don't go well,

256
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:57,096
I will use this teleportation stone
I got from the Instant Dungeon.

257
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,068
If I give up, everything is over.

258
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,097
I need to become stronger,

259
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:11,064
to level up even higher.

260
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,081
HELL'S GATEKEEPER CERBERUS
I must take back everything.

261
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,081
How could I die here?

262
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,077
TITLE: WOLF ASSASSIN

263
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,045
ACTIVE SKILL: DASH

264
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,059
I can hardly inflict any damage.

265
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,009
The gap is still so huge
after I use the title skills?

266
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:46,034
ACTIVE SKILL: MURDEROUS INTENT

267
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,047
THE DEBUFF HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT
It's useless!

268
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,056
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS. DRAIN.

269
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:01,011
THE DEBUFF HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT

270
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,063
A warning?

271
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,051
A third of my HP was gone in an instant!

272
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:33,081
HELL'S GATEKEEPER CERBERUS
HAS USED SKILL: RAGE

273
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,001
ALL ABILITIES +100% WITHIN THREE MINUTES

274
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,027
All abilities doubled?

275
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,002
So fast...

276
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:47,053
Only a half left?!

277
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:50,041
There's no other way.

278
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,074
Full Recovery!

279
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,054
I stabbed it.

280
00:16:58,054 --> 00:17:00,000
NOTIFICATION:
THE ENEMY DOES NOT FEEL PAIN.

281
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,096
What?

282
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:27,011
ACTIVE SKILL: WILLPOWER
HP: 30% OR LESS, BUFF: DAMAGE -50%

283
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,084
The warnings keep popping up.

284
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:49,001
The system issues warnings at critical
moments to prevent my death

285
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,003
because I am a player?

286
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,022
No matter what,

287
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:56,001
this thing can't be
an ordinary second awakening.

288
00:17:56,085 --> 00:18:00,015
I must hold on for at least
3 minutes until its skill ends...

289
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:02,048
No, this is too dangerous.

290
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,027
I must use—

291
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,069
What can I do to survive?

292
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:26,038
A few more hits and I'll be dead.

293
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:28,015
Is there any way?

294
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:30,088
The shop...

295
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:32,009
I completely forgot it!

296
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,009
EXCLUSIVE HEALING POTION, 300G.

297
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,003
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PURCHASE
EXCLUSIVE HEALING POTION?

298
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:35,091
One bottle costs 300 gold coins...

299
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:37,052
3 bottles.

300
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,065
One bottle only restores
100 points of HP?

301
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,028
This is simply...

302
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,069
Poison?

303
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:53,078
You've drank too much.
Alcohol is poison to the body.

304
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,049
I'm fine.

305
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,007
I have to do this.

306
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:17,068
Okay.

307
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,052
It's not over yet!

308
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:32,032
I can still move!

309
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,087
Its skill effect has ended!

310
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,017
YOU HAVE DEFEATED
THE HELL'S GATEKEEPER CERBERUS

311
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,077
Is this the item I obtained?

312
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:31,098
Another key?

313
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:36,032
Is this the door that
Cerberus was guarding?

314
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,015
What is this?

315
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:43,032
FORMULA: ELIXIR OF LIFE

316
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:46,091
The pattern for the Elixir of Life...

317
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:50,083
THREE ITEMS ARE NEEDED
TO CRAFT ELIXIR OF LIFE.

318
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,033
This experience made me
understand my current strength.

319
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:57,000
Entering the castle at my current level
would surely mean death.

320
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,002
But...

321
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,003
I will return in the near future.

322
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,043
Definitely.

323
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:41,048
EPISODE 8: THIS IS FRUSTRATING
