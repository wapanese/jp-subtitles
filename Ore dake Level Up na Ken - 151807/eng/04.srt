1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:03,073
STEEL-FANGED LYCAN

2
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:17,021
Eh?

3
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:21,083
My body feels light!

4
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,008
I've tried so hard
to get this second life!

5
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,041
I can't succumb to fear!

6
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,093
I will not die here!

7
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:37,068
Huh?

8
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:41,015
Is it because my strength ability
has improved?

9
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,002
But...

10
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,036
It's still stronger than me.

11
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,091
No, my attacks didn't work!

12
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,037
What should I do?

13
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:32,008
SOLO LEVELING

14
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,073
I can't do this alone.

15
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,011
I had no party or healers.

16
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,057
All I have is water and food.

17
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,043
If this goes on...

18
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,028
If only I had a weapon
with magic power...

19
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,053
A weapon?

20
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,029
Inventory!

21
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,019
Though I don't know
why this is in my inventory.

22
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:24,023
Mr. Kim said this sword
cost him 3 million.

23
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,094
This is an item that I couldn't afford.

24
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,015
I can't think about that now.

25
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:30,057
I'll use this sword for now.

26
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:33,023
Huh? My body stopped hurting.

27
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,032
As long as I have a weapon,

28
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,002
there's nothing to fear.

29
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,053
Huh?

30
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,095
What?

31
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:44,087
I can't pull it out!

32
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,092
Please, come out!

33
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,067
Your steel fangs seem genuine.

34
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,068
I finally got this sword.

35
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:07,039
Don't even try to damage it!

36
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,015
Now that I think about it...

37
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:16,069
Compared to those things,

38
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:19,016
these beasts are nothing.

39
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,097
Huh? I'm level 2 now.

40
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:41,057
I never leveled up
when I completed daily quests.

41
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:44,089
I see. Because this is actual combat.

42
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:46,089
And my wounds just healed before.

43
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:51,044
If I level up, will all my abilities
increase by 1 point?

44
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:53,094
A total of 5 points.

45
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:56,003
I only get 3 points from daily quests.

46
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:59,004
So leveling up through combat is faster.

47
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:03,016
How much will my abilities grow
with each point increase?

48
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,087
Even intelligence and perception
have been quantified.

49
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,079
Strength is the easiest to understand.

50
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,092
With only 32 points,

51
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,087
my movements became much lighter.

52
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,034
I'm only guessing.

53
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,088
But I think the higher
the basic ability,

54
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:20,055
the more points I'll be able to get.

55
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,043
So... I really can become stronger.

56
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,006
But they are just five small magic beasts.

57
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,069
I may have got carried away.

58
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:37,086
Do they have magic gems on them?

59
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,057
ITEM: LYCAN FANG

60
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,057
I got an item instead of a magic gem?

61
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:46,091
Strange things are happening to me.

62
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,058
If I am controlled by
a system like a game,

63
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:55,025
will this dungeon and magic beasts
differ from the ones in reality?

64
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:59,000
Ah, I found the shop.

65
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,034
Purchase.

66
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:01,038
SHOP

67
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,022
YOU CANNOT BUY ANYTHING AT YOUR LEVEL
New players can't use it?

68
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:05,072
Sell.

69
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,098
20 gold coins?

70
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:15,056
How much would that be in cash?

71
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,023
But this dungeon is at most E-Rank,

72
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,086
so 20 gold coins probably isn't much.

73
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:24,061
Alright.

74
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,091
What should I do now?

75
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:28,099
I can't leave unless I defeat the Boss.

76
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:32,025
It seems I could leave once
I get the teleportation stone,

77
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,042
but I have no idea where that is.

78
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,003
If this drags on, I'll be short of food.

79
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,008
Although it's an E-Rank dungeon,

80
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,023
it's still so hard for me
to defeat the Boss alone.

81
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,059
Wait...

82
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:49,022
If I keep leveling up,
I might stand a chance.

83
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,027
Although it's possible

84
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:55,023
I'll be dead before that.

85
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,083
There's nothing to be afraid of.

86
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,079
I've already died once before.

87
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:32,014
I won't die that easily.

88
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,089
So you all shouldn't die too easily either.

89
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,075
If I kill you in an instant,

90
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,036
I'll feel really bad.

91
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:45,031
You are qualified as a Hunter.

92
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,012
Now I can pay mom's medical bills.

93
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,051
If I could have another chance...

94
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:55,012
Let's...

95
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:58,017
Let's have a fierce battle!

96
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,017
As long as I'm alive,

97
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,084
I'll fight to the last moment.

98
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:10,005
As long as it makes me stronger...

99
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,001
I can abide by any rules.

100
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,064
NOTIFICATION LEVELED UP
I can abide by any rules.

101
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,085
YOU HAVE ACQUIRED TITLE:
WOLF ASSASSIN

102
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,015
That doesn't look good.

103
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:27,061
Can't the guild come
to deal with it quickly?

104
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:40,096
This sword is almost done for.

105
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:45,055
Weapons are just expendables after all.

106
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,086
No matter what weapon I get,

107
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:50,043
it'll wear out
after a few times in the dungeon.

108
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:51,064
However...

109
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,028
It seems like the battle is over.

110
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:57,073
TITLE: WOLF ASSASSIN

111
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:59,056
INVENTORY

112
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,098
34 wolf fangs.

113
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:04,019
Two worn-out short swords.

114
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,057
Traveler's attire.

115
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,059
And...

116
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:11,024
The teleportation stone is easier
to get than I imagined.

117
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,085
Should I return?

118
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:20,005
But, there's no guarantee that there will be
another chance to become stronger this easily.

119
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,063
What will happen to this dungeon
if I use the teleportation stone?

120
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,067
Will it disappear?

121
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:31,063
Will it disappear like
a time-limited event in a game?

122
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:33,064
Regardless...

123
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:36,081
It seems like I am being toyed
with by some unknown force.

124
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,081
And I cannot escape.

125
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:46,074
Should I continue forward or turn back?

126
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:04,015
Yes, this is Lee Joohee.

127
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,022
Ah, you're from the Hunter's Association.

128
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,081
I'm really sorry about earlier.

129
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,047
Eh?

130
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:15,003
That Gate had a Dungeon Break?

131
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:17,005
That's right around here.

132
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,077
It's all because I rejected him.

133
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:24,006
We're currently assembling
available Hunters to deal with it.

134
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,097
But there's a serious shortage of healers.

135
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:33,045
I understand.

136
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:36,087
Every time I level up,

137
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:41,013
my battles with magic beasts become easier.

138
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:52,062
The color denoting the magic
beast's name also changes.

139
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:55,047
White means it's weaker than me.

140
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,035
Orange means it has the same level as me.

141
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,089
And red means it's stronger than me.

142
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,098
Lycan, which was initially marked red,

143
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,085
is marked white now.

144
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,095
This indicates I have
become much stronger.

145
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,094
Even so...

146
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:13,035
I'm not sure I can beat that monster
down there with my current strength.

147
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,091
I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.

148
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:18,078
I can clearly feel...

149
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,099
...that the monster below...

150
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,054
...is terrifying.

151
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:28,046
My level doesn't seem
to be rising anymore.

152
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,092
If I keep fighting like this,
this sword probably won't last.

153
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:48,023
I don't remember the stairs
at this station being this long.

154
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:04,007
It no longer looks like a station.

155
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,069
So fast!

156
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,026
The sword...

157
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,023
I've leveled up a lot.

158
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,056
But its name...

159
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,004
...is still orange.

160
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,065
KING OF THE SWAMP
BLUE VENOM-FANGED KASAKA

161
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,036
You're the boss here, right?

162
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:39,045
It is covered in scales.
This sword is useless against it.

163
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,082
Going bare-handed will be worse.

164
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,025
Its attacks are fast and heavy!

165
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,059
I can only try to weaken
its defense first!

166
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,068
But how can I pierce
through these thick scales?!

167
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,023
If I took this hit head-on,

168
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,027
I would be dead.

169
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:34,025
I thought I had become a bit stronger...

170
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:46,064
Is it still not enough?

171
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:50,068
How much stronger do I have to get...

172
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,086
...to escape this life of constant ridicule?!

173
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:02,024
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind?

174
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:05,062
Everyone has been calling you that lately.

175
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:06,066
Yes.

176
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:08,024
Good grief.

177
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,062
There are always people
who speak childishly.

178
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:14,054
You must work hard and make them
change their mind.

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,013
Yes.

180
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,042
I understand.

181
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:39,061
They gave me that nickname
because I was too weak.

182
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,009
I was looked down upon
because I was too weak.

183
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:47,045
I also felt useless.

184
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,033
As long as I'm strong enough...

185
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:56,000
One with overwhelming power
can naturally remain undefeated.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The weak are powerless before the strong.

187
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:02,071
The weak can only stand still,
trembling in fear.

188
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:04,097
People are looked down upon
because they are weak.

189
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:10,031
Even if they're knowledgeable,
smart, or considerate,

190
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:12,031
before the strong,

191
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:15,056
they will be betrayed!

192
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,065
Gentleness is meaningless.

193
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,011
So I must become stronger.

194
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,023
That's why I came here!

195
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:37,004
I...

196
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:45,017
I must become stronger.

197
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:52,056
Not enough!

198
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,035
Compared to that thing...

199
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,007
Compared to the fear back then...

200
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:00,019
You have nothing to make me afraid!

201
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,012
I've put all my ability
points into strength!

202
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,084
With my current self...

203
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,076
With my current self...

204
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:35,072
I'm going to kill you!

205
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:42,011
Die!

206
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:58,071
NOTIFICATION LEVELED UP

207
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,063
NOTIFICATION LEVELED UP

208
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,005
It seems...

209
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:17,026
...I got a bit stronger.

210
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:21,023
YOU HAVE DEFEATED A KING OF THE SWAMP,
BLUE VENOM-FANGED KASAKA

211
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:29,007
Thanks to that, I got good stuff.

212
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,078
This dagger isn't made from bone
but from teeth?

213
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:37,016
Its power is twice that of Mr. Kim's sword,

214
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,066
and it comes with paralysis and bleeding effects.

215
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,004
By comparison...

216
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:44,008
This thing is too terrifying to use.

217
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,088
Anyway, I'll collect it for now.

218
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:49,008
AS THE BOSS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, THE DUNGEON
WILL NOW REVERT TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE.

219
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,079
Is it over?

220
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:07,065
HAPJEONG STATION

221
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,044
Not a person in sight.

222
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,086
What time is it?

223
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,057
Hey!

224
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,007
How can you just walk in here?

225
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,066
Didn't you hear the announcement?

226
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,091
Announcement?

227
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,073
Don't play dumb with me.

228
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,062
Are you a Hunter?

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,088
Yes, I am a Hunter.

230
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,038
Sorry for being rude.

231
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,088
I'll take you to the site.

232
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:28,092
This way, please.

233
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:30,034
Ah, okay.

234
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,067
Has something happened?

235
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:39,081
Dungeon Break.

236
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:42,031
Did magic beasts get out?

237
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,098
Almost all of them have been killed.

238
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:47,069
Only a giant magic beast
has been left.

239
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,049
I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.

240
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:52,001
I can feel it.

241
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:54,007
That thing over there is the Boss.

242
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,066
Please do not take photos.

243
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:04,016
This place is very dangerous.

244
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:07,079
Kill it quickly.

245
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,099
What if the land prices here drop?

246
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,092
All healers!

247
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:14,038
Please focus on healing the Tanker!

248
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:16,026
I don't need you to tell me!

249
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:20,081
What are the Fighters doing?

250
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:23,066
Why is it not weakening at all?

251
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:27,006
Its defense is just too strong.

252
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:29,065
We have few Mages among us.

253
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:31,069
Excuse me, let me through.

254
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,033
Is it because it's a temporary team?

255
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,069
They don't work well together.

256
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,007
Their ranks are too low.

257
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:42,033
It should be eight E-Rank Hunters
and one D-Rank Hunter.

258
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,048
And because that Tanker is D-rank,

259
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:47,029
it became a prolonged battle
as no one could deliver a fatal blow.

260
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,029
As for the Healers...

261
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,025
Two D-Rank healers
and one B-Rank healer?

262
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:53,063
Hey, Miss!

263
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,067
Hurry up and heal them!

264
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,047
Aren't you a B-Rank healer?

265
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:59,051
What are you dazed about?!

266
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,076
Ah, yes!

267
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,073
Damn it, pull yourself together.

268
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:14,061
So she still hasn't gotten over it
after a week.

269
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:16,004
It's no surprise.

270
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:18,036
After all, I also...

271
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,099
No.

272
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,002
This is a D-Rank Boss.

273
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,051
It's weaker than
the one I just defeated.

274
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:32,042
We'll get wiped out if this continues!

275
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,088
We can't defeat it
without a high-rank Hunter!

276
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,059
As long as I can break its defense,

277
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,026
I can defeat it.

278
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:45,093
I'll give it the most powerful hit.

279
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,098
Take this!

280
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,048
Huh?

281
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:52,007
Good, its defense is broken.

282
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,048
We can defeat it.

283
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,024
We did it.

284
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:04,083
We defeated it.

285
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:08,041
All attacks were ineffective against it.

286
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,058
Why were we able to break its defense?

287
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:14,009
Our attacks had no effect.

288
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,076
What was that thing that just flew in?

289
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:23,026
A Boss Golem that remained unscathed
under the attack of a dozen Hunters

290
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:25,018
was defeated by this thing?

291
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:28,027
Sorry.

292
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:28,081
Yes.

293
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,077
Who threw this?

294
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:34,006
Oh, it was the Hunter over there...

295
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:35,023
Huh?

296
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,064
- He was just here.
- Such terrifying destructive power.

297
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,077
Is he a high-rank Hunter?

298
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:51,005
I didn't expect to take it
down with a single strike.

299
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:54,086
Perhaps that Golem was running
out of vitality anyway.

300
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:01,047
Jinwoo...

301
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:39,098
EPISODE 5: A PRETTY GOOD DEAL
