1
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:04,019
Did you see it?

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,004
I did.
That E-Rank Hunter, right?

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:10,062
He has a great body, right?

4
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:13,062
His looks are average,
but he is cute.

5
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:18,096
The type that surprises you
when he undresses?

6
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:20,096
Since when did we have
someone like that?

7
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:22,054
I completely missed it.

8
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:27,084
He was unremarkable at first.

9
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:31,043
But he has been in shape
since he started working out.

10
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:32,055
Really?

11
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,072
Can people gain muscles so quickly?

12
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,023
Excuse me.

13
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:38,081
Mr. Sung Jinwoo...

14
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:42,015
Ah.

15
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:44,002
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,071
No, I should apologize too!

17
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:51,053
His muscles are so firm.

18
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:57,029
Did he have such a good physique before?

19
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:59,079
What do you want to tell me?

20
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,037
Ah, right.

21
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:03,064
Today is your day of discharge.

22
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,088
Do you have any discomfort?

23
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:07,022
No, thanks to you,
I've fully recovered.

24
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:08,003
I see.

25
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:11,088
Then, please complete the procedures
at the counter later.

26
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,008
Okay.
Thank you for everything.

27
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,056
Excuse me...!

28
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,006
Yes?

29
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:21,069
Could you give me your contact?

30
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,065
My contact?

31
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,083
Yes.

32
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,061
If you don't mind...

33
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,032
Will they inform me of the examination
results after my discharge?

34
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,032
I understand.

35
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:03,096
SOLO LEVELING

36
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:06,004
ULTRA MORNING NEWS

37
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,013
Good morning, everyone.

38
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:11,017
This is our special guest for today.

39
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:13,067
Hello, I'm Baek Yoonho.

40
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:21,022
Hunter Baek is one of seven S-Rank Hunters
and has had impressive achievements.

41
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:25,081
What kind of life do you lead
when you're not on missions?

42
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:28,073
Well, it's mainly training.

43
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:30,077
Daily training is indispensable.

44
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,003
If I don't simulate actual combat,

45
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,049
my skills would get rusty.

46
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,099
Every day?

47
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,059
Is it not tiring?

48
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:42,016
In my case, because of my previous job
as a firefighter,

49
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:44,087
I'm used to regular training.

50
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:48,096
A small mistake of mine could
endanger my companions' lives.

51
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,059
That always makes me tense up.

52
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,008
I see.

53
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:55,097
Is it already this late?!

54
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,034
Brother.

55
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,031
Jinah, morning.

56
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,043
You're up?

57
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:05,063
I've been up for a while.

58
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,048
Be careful on the road.

59
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:12,002
The meal I made yesterday
is in the fridge...

60
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,036
Brother, have you been exercising?

61
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,028
Uh... a little.

62
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,007
You're getting taller, aren't you?

63
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,078
Is that the result of your training too?

64
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,063
So men can grow after they've
reached adulthood, huh?

65
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,054
I'm heading out.

66
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,071
Hey!

67
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,088
You forgot the umbrella.

68
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,072
It's sunny today.
I don't need it since it's heavy.

69
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:39,043
It's not heavy.

70
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:41,064
Geez, it's fine.

71
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:43,068
Better safe than sorry.

72
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:44,068
Go.

73
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:47,048
Sigh, I'm leaving.

74
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,052
Be careful.

75
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:54,098
I'll run later.

76
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,079
The muscle I've gained must
be due to the ability stats.

77
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:02,095
If I keep training,
I might become a bodybuilder.

78
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,004
I still have some points left.

79
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,059
Now, which one should I choose?

80
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:13,038
I need strength to increase damage.

81
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,088
But it's pointless
if I can't hit the target.

82
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,013
Then I need to improve my agility.

83
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,076
I'll boost both strength and agility.

84
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,072
It's also good for enhancing vitality.

85
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,043
Perception is useful too.

86
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,097
As for intelligence...

87
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:29,003
It feels related to magic.
Do I need it?

88
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,001
Okay, I've decided.

89
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,085
That should do it.

90
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,007
LANDLORD

91
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,019
Hello, this is Sung Jinwoo.

92
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,085
You finally answered the phone.

93
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:43,057
Sorry, I was hospitalized.

94
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:45,045
I need to pay the rent, right?

95
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,033
Yes.

96
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:49,004
I still haven't received
the rent for this month.

97
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,043
If you're tight on money,
I can collect it later.

98
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,083
Ah, no, I'll transfer it in a bit.

99
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,074
Is that so? Then, I appreciate it.

100
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:57,092
Take care of yourself, okay?

101
00:05:57,092 --> 00:06:00,001
Yes, thank you.

102
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:05,097
I don't know if the phenomenon
on me is a second awakening.

103
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:10,022
But now I can kill goblins in an instant,

104
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,094
I should be able to earn money
to pay the rent easily.

105
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,027
That being said,

106
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,086
it's not so easy to find work.

107
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:22,009
I need to enter a higher-level Gate
to make money.

108
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,007
However,

109
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:27,086
an E-Rank Hunter like me
has no chance of getting in.

110
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,033
Should I go for a re-evaluation?

111
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:33,077
If my Hunter rank is higher,
I could enter the high-level Gate.

112
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:36,033
The more attention I get,
the more money I might make.

113
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,094
But it would attract too much attention.

114
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:41,008
People with second awakening are rare.

115
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:46,034
Not to mention Hunters who grow
stronger as their level increases.

116
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:49,076
That would attract a lot
of unnecessary attention.

117
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:52,014
The media are annoying.

118
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,035
I might even become a target.

119
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,004
Better not.

120
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:59,007
At least I should be able
to protect myself first.

121
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:02,069
Also, it's better to keep it down
before I know what this power is.

122
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:16,029
Confirm.

123
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:19,021
Hello there.

124
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,009
I'm Hwang Dongsuk.

125
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,023
I'm Sung Jinwoo.

126
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:26,034
An E-Rank, right?

127
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:26,097
Yes.

128
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:28,092
Ah, I know him.

129
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,068
He's super famous.

130
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:34,089
I remember his nickname is
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

131
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,006
What the hell is that?

132
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,004
Hey, stop that.

133
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,017
Sorry, my members are rude.

134
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,058
No, it's true that I am an E-Rank Hunter.

135
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:44,044
Can I join?

136
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:46,011
No problem.

137
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,012
I just need you to make up the numbers.

138
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:52,054
I said it over the phone,
but let me confirm it again.

139
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,066
At least eight people are required
to enter this C-Rank dungeon.

140
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,058
And half of them must be C-Rank.

141
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:03,055
You're not counted as combat power,
so you will not share the spoils.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,008
However, we will pay your
commission fee of 2 million in cash.

143
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,097
Four C-Rank Hunters
and two D-Rank or lower ones?

144
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:14,077
I understand.

145
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,022
What should I do?

146
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,044
You'll carry our luggage.

147
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:21,081
Inside are our meals, as well as
spare clothes and equipment.

148
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,004
There's also a first aid kit.

149
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:26,036
You're not bringing a Healer in?

150
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,041
It's difficult for private teams
like us to recruit Healers.

151
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,007
You should know that.

152
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,058
We have always managed like this.

153
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,057
Okay.

154
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:39,000
A team with only Tankers and Fighters?

155
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,079
They are reckless.

156
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,017
And the fact that there's
no Healer is quite concerning.

157
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:46,051
Then please sign the contract.

158
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:53,047
The other party won't be held accountable
for any incidents in the dungeon.

159
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,064
Done.

160
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,018
Thank you.

161
00:08:57,098 --> 00:09:00,085
It seems we are in the same boat.

162
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:04,004
My name is Yoo Jinho,
21 years old, and a D-Rank Hunter.

163
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:06,078
I was also brought in to make up numbers.

164
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,009
Okay.

165
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,082
D-Rank with such gears?

166
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,011
His family must be rich.

167
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:14,099
Is this your first time
in a C-Rank dungeon?

168
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:16,058
Don't worry.

169
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,000
I will protect you.

170
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go then.

171
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:26,013
Aren't the bags heavy?

172
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,005
Will you be okay?

173
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,051
Yes, I'm fine.

174
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,074
I am younger than you.

175
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:33,051
You don't have to speak so formally.

176
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:35,022
I understand.

177
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:39,039
Have you heard? The president
who marked this project

178
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,002
escaped abroad with 900 billion
funds two months ago.

179
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:45,086
The employees and investors
are all complaining.

180
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,065
Hmm...

181
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,028
Ah... Did I talk too much again?

182
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,065
I'm not used to paying attention
to people's reactions.

183
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,058
This is it.

184
00:09:57,088 --> 00:10:00,096
Wow, what a large entrance.

185
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:03,054
Such size is really rare.

186
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,042
Dongsuk, is this really a C-Rank Gate?

187
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,084
Isn't it too big?

188
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:13,002
The investigators confirmed twice
before giving a C-Rank evaluation.

189
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:14,001
It must be C-Rank.

190
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:16,043
This Gate is huge.

191
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,018
Is it okay to enter?

192
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,056
The size of the Gate isn't very important.

193
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:23,048
What matters is the flux of magic
power emanating from the inside.

194
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,046
The Association will measure
that value and classify it.

195
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:32,019
Normally, B-Rank and above dungeons
are handled by large guilds.

196
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:34,007
Those below C-Rank aren't as dangerous.

197
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,053
You know a lot about this, Jinwoo.

198
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,066
I have been a Hunter for some time.

199
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:43,087
But still, this is my first time
in a C-Rank dungeon.

200
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,038
Please follow me.

201
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,013
Yes.

202
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,063
Jinwoo, let's go.

203
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:52,048
Yeah... Got it.

204
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:59,005
Kyuhwan, create some light.

205
00:10:59,005 --> 00:10:59,076
Okay.

206
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,009
What's going on here?

207
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,048
Not a single magic beast.

208
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:09,032
There are no lights as well.

209
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:11,091
There are normally luminescent
stones in dungeons.

210
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,099
A pitch-black dungeon...

211
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:16,082
...reminds me of the Cartenon Temple.

212
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,082
Jinwoo,

213
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,083
what is "luminescent stone"?

214
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,054
Well...

215
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:26,096
Luminescent stones are glowing rocks
that are common in cave-like dungeons.

216
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:30,017
The stones are usually found
on the walls or floor,

217
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:32,013
emitting light to illuminate the cave.

218
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:36,088
So, the magic gems
obtained from magic beasts,

219
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,068
the mana crystals collected in dungeons,

220
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:43,035
and the luminescent stones
that light up the caves.

221
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:45,048
They are quite confusing.

222
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,098
You will get used to it soon.

223
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:53,032
By the way, there's nothing here.

224
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,069
Jinwoo.

225
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,082
Can there be a dungeon
without magic beasts?

226
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,049
Quiet.

227
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,024
This sound...

228
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,091
There are magic beasts here.
They just haven't shown up.

229
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,087
Get ready!

230
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,083
Yes!

231
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:09,063
Moving as a group in the dark,

232
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,084
and swarming towards any light source.

233
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,059
It's insect-type magic beasts!

234
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,006
- Insects?!
- Darn it!

235
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,058
Insects, of all things!

236
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:19,025
Dongsuk, do you see anything?

237
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,008
No, I can't see a thing!

238
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,039
Is this an ant nest?

239
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,093
Then we're in trouble!

240
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,052
The sounds are getting closer!

241
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,098
Where will they emerge from?!

242
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:28,044
There are too many holes here!

243
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:30,077
Above!

244
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:35,057
Kyuhwan!

245
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,074
I'll draw their attention!

246
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,041
Yes!

247
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:43,016
Jinwoo, please don't leave my side.

248
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,096
Look over here, bugs!

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,021
Amazing, all the bugs are
heading towards Hwang.

250
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,084
It's a taunting skill.

251
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,055
C-Rank Hunters are indeed better.

252
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,049
Jinsuk, 11 o'clock direction.

253
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:01,059
Understood.

254
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,001
- I'll also...
- Step back.

255
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:04,093
Start the countdown.

256
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,002
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

257
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,002
...0!

258
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:12,051
This is my trump card!

259
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,048
Take this!

260
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,061
Good, take them down!

261
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,003
I've been waiting.

262
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,078
What a good teamwork.

263
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,099
They've been working together for long.

264
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:28,091
Maybe it's because they don't have a Healer,
the way they fight is rough.

265
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:31,017
As for Jinho...

266
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,088
His equipment compensates
for the lack of strength.

267
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,005
Everyone is doing well.

268
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:42,063
But I feel...

269
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:47,039
...a bit frustrating.

270
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,006
Alright.

271
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:51,001
This should be the last one.

272
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:51,089
Jinsuk.

273
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,036
Yes, no more enemies.
We've taken care of them.

274
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,026
Good, it's over.

275
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:00,086
Take all the magic gems
and split them into seven parts.

276
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,053
Yeah!

277
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,028
I love this moment.

278
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,049
Me too.

279
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:09,001
Thanks for your help.

280
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:11,052
It would have been dangerous
if we had noticed them later.

281
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:11,096
It's okay.

282
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:15,017
How did you know
they were coming from above?

283
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:17,013
It's intuition.

284
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:20,021
Your intuition is surely sharp.

285
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,051
Dongsuk.

286
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,009
Come take a look at this.

287
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,008
Look at their wounds.

288
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:27,005
These aren't sword wounds.

289
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:30,031
Right? They don't look like burns
caused by magic either.

290
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:35,027
Many of them were bitten
to death like this.

291
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:38,019
Did the magic beasts fight
each other over territory?

292
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,078
So there must be a stronger
magic beast around here.

293
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,074
Is that so?

294
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:47,066
A high-rank beast
that preys on these insects.

295
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:53,021
Did you see the way
I slayed the magic beasts?

296
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:54,013
Yeah.

297
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,004
Jinho.

298
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:58,046
Your sword and shield
are expensive, right?

299
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:00,003
Eh? Yeah.

300
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,065
Because this was my first mission,

301
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,063
my father bought me high-quality gear.

302
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,038
I see.

303
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,009
I don't know for sure yet,

304
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,011
but it's better to be cautious.

305
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:18,044
There!

306
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,067
What was that sound? An explosion?

307
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,009
Stay calm.
It happens all the time here.

308
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,015
Look.

309
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,007
The guild master is in training.

310
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,071
Amazing.

311
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,095
He pierced through
that huge boulder in one strike.

312
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,005
This isn't even a warm-up.

313
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,055
Hey, clean this up.

314
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:50,014
We've been walking for quite a while.

315
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,072
The size of the dungeon...

316
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,097
Is unrelated to its level, right?

317
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,006
It's related to the flux of magic power.

318
00:15:56,006 --> 00:16:00,069
Although the dungeon is big,
it's quite empty, right?

319
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,052
Yes.

320
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,061
But transporting luggage becomes
quite laborious in such a big dungeon.

321
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:07,086
Jinwoo, can you still manage?

322
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:10,007
It's not that heavy.

323
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:14,024
It's good to earn money
without having to fight.

324
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,025
A good deal.

325
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,025
No.

326
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,046
Too good, actually.

327
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,017
Something fishy is here.

328
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:27,037
A battle-hardened team
yet without a Healer.

329
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:30,039
They even needed
to make up the number.

330
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,043
These magic beasts are also half-dead.

331
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,039
Nice.

332
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,027
Yeah.

333
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,006
It really is strange.

334
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:42,056
We haven't encountered a single
uninjured magic beast during the walk.

335
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,078
All we've seen are either corpses
or those barely alive.

336
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:47,078
The Boss should be somewhere.

337
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,003
If there's no Boss, the Gate won't open.

338
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:52,016
Wait.

339
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,091
Kyuhwan, light it up.

340
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,099
Okay.

341
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:02,038
I think the Boss room should be ahead.

342
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:03,021
Let's go.

343
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:16,077
This is...

344
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,001
Unbelievable!

345
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,081
Mana crystals!

346
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,098
There's quite a lot!

347
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:24,023
It's not as valuable as the magic gem,

348
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:25,023
but the amount...

349
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,009
They are worth about a billion!

350
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:32,011
Dongsuk, your brother
would be jealous...

351
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:33,002
Hey!

352
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:36,029
You shouldn't talk so lightly
about his brother.

353
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:39,083
Dongsoo, I've told you.

354
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,075
You're not always right.

355
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:46,034
I'm no longer the guy who always
listens to his younger brother.

356
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:50,067
I will use these as capital
to build my team.

357
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,008
What a haul.

358
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:55,026
Everyone will get well over 100 million.

359
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:56,084
How are we going to move these out?

360
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:57,076
Jinwoo.

361
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,005
Please let me see your contract.

362
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,094
I know the law very well.

363
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:02,085
Okay.

364
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:06,002
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

365
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:06,098
What?

366
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:09,082
This is the contract
you signed with Jinwoo.

367
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:12,045
It only mentions
the ownership of the spoils.

368
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:16,041
But mana crystals don't count as spoils.

369
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,062
So it should be divided
into eight parts, right?

370
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,037
Of course.

371
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,079
We must divide it fairly.

372
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,042
I'm clear on that.

373
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:25,092
However,

374
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,025
we need to deal with that guy first.

375
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:30,063
The dungeon Boss?!

376
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,005
I think you understand this.

377
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,034
After defeating the Boss,
the Gate will close.

378
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:38,097
So we must move all the mana crystals out
before defeating that spider.

379
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:42,048
Luckily, it's sleeping.

380
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:45,022
Now might be a great opportunity to mine.

381
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,047
Lee Chul-Jin, where are our tools?

382
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:52,007
I didn't know there'd be so many.

383
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,016
So I left the tools in the car.

384
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:58,012
Haven't I always told you
to keep the tools with you?

385
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,091
I'm really sorry.

386
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,037
Sorry.

387
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,079
Can you two stay here?

388
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,005
We need to get the tools.

389
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:05,087
Huh?

390
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:09,021
Just the two of us in the Boss room?

391
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,008
Don't worry.

392
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:13,059
It should be full and sound asleep.

393
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,076
It should be fine for now
as long as you don't provoke it.

394
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,072
But...

395
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,097
Yoo, it's your first mission, right?

396
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:24,023
Mr. Sung, this is also your first time
at a C-Rank dungeon, isn't it?

397
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,023
Just trust me, guys.

398
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,089
Okay?

399
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,065
I need to tell my members something.

400
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:33,019
I'll come back after a smoke.

401
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:37,055
According to the rules, at least eight people
are needed to conquer a C-Rank dungeon.

402
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,059
Excluding Jinho and me,
this team originally had six people.

403
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,062
We have always managed like this.

404
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:47,046
He said always, which means...

405
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:49,097
They often conquer C-Rank dungeons.

406
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:54,071
They should have regulars
to make up the numbers.

407
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:56,008
Kyuhwan.

408
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,006
Block the entrance to the Boss room.

409
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:06,021
The entrance is...!

410
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:06,085
What is this?!

411
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:10,077
Did they betray us?

412
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,036
As expected.

413
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,023
They are...

414
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,086
Sometimes you just come
across such scumbags.

415
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:21,037
This work is inherently dangerous,
and accidents are par for the course.

416
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,079
But even if an accident happens,

417
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,021
it won't be made public,
hence the crime rate is high.

418
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:32,059
There are no surveillance
cameras in the dungeons.

419
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,042
If everyone is dead,
there's no evidence left.

420
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:39,076
They use the weak as bait
to lure the enemy

421
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,022
or abandon them in there.

422
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:45,014
In simple terms, it's like a gecko
dropping its tail to survive.

423
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:50,052
They plan to kill us over
a few mana crystals...

424
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:56,082
I talked too much about the contract.

425
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:59,007
No.

426
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,024
In any case,

427
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:04,033
they will kill us immediately
if we act rashly.

428
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:06,075
More importantly...

429
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,021
Jinwoo, please step back.

430
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,075
I will figure out a way.

431
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,096
We should be able to get out from there.

432
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:18,069
This must be their plan.

433
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:26,056
C-Rank Boss.

434
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,098
And E-Rank Hunter.

435
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,002
The difference in strength is too great.

436
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:39,011
Another...

437
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,007
...level?

438
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,091
I take back what I said.

439
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:46,062
Jinho, stay put.

440
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,062
I'll handle this guy.

441
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:49,016
Huh?

442
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:51,004
What did you just say?

443
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,053
I'll take it down.

444
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,098
EPISODE 6: THE REAL HUNT BEGINS
