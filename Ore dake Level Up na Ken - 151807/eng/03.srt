1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,940
<i>If...</i>

2
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,840
<i>If I had one more chance...</i>

3
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,190
<i>A hospital?</i>

4
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,480
<i>My arm's intact.</i>

5
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,560
<i>My legs, too.</i>

6
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,860
<i>I was stabbed through the chest, 
but there's no trace of it.</i>

7
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,940
Was it just... a dream?

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,630
Oh, I see you're awake.

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,480
Excuse me...

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm Woo Jinchul, manager of the 
Hunter's Association Surveillance Team.

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,300
I'm Kang Taeshik.

12
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,020
What's someone from 
Surveillance want with me?

13
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,100
For now, let's get your doctor in here.

14
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,040
I was unconscious for three days?

15
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,110
What about Joohee and Mr. Song? 
Are they okay?

16
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,950
Yes. Although...

17
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,620
Song Chiyul lost an arm, and as a result,

18
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,230
he may have to retire as a hunter.

19
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,010
And Lee Joohee's been traumatized. 
She's undergoing psychiatric care.

20
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,760
Given her condition, I'm not sure 
she'll continue as a hunter, either.

21
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,440
There were only six survivors of the double 
dungeon discovered on your expedition.

22
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,200
A hunter's job is always a dangerous one,

23
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,630
but it's rare to see such a tragic outcome.

24
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,200
And yet, somehow,

25
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,260
when the White Tiger Guild arrived on the 
scene after being alerted by the survivors,

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,700
all they found was you, Sung Jinwoo, 
collapsed on the ground.

27
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,930
There were no traces of the temple or 
the statues the survivors described.

28
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,060
But that's...

29
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,720
Unbelievable, isn't it?

30
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,930
If there had been the slightest 
inconsistency between their reports,

31
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,990
or if some of the deceased's remains 
hadn't been found on the scene,

32
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,760
it would've cast suspicion 
onto your group instead.

33
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,810
Incidentally...

34
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,060
This is just speculation on our part, but...

35
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,440
Sung Jinwoo...

36
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,450
Have you experienced a second awakening?

37
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,210
<i>A second awakening?</i>

38
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,660
<i>A hunter's power is determined upon awakening,</i>

39
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,400
<i>and it never changes from that point on.</i>

40
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,490
<i>But... on rare occasions, a hunter 
can go through a second awakening.</i>

41
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,060
<i>It lets them exceed their previous limits 
and rise to A or even S-Rank...</i>

42
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,550
<i>Maybe I could, too!</i>

43
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,770
This is a mana meter.

44
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Please place your hand over it.

45
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,530
<i>If they really ran into instakill-level 
magic beasts, like the survivors said,</i>

46
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,900
<i>then there's no way a low-level hunter 
could have survived.</i>

47
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,100
<i>And for not even a trace 
to remain of said beasts</i>

48
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,870
<i>would imply the presence of an A-Rankâ€”
maybe even S-Rank hunter.</i>

49
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,950
<i>The most likely explanation is that 
Sung Jinwoo underwent a second awakening.</i>

50
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,750
What's it say?!

51
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,240
If I've awakened again, 
what rank does it put me at now?

52
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,260
My apologies. I'm afraid we 
may have been mistaken.

53
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,610
Even E-Ranks usually manage higher than 70...

54
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,430
He's basically just a civilian.

55
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,660
<i>The dungeon has vanished 
and can't be explored again.</i>

56
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,560
<i>So how did he survive?</i>

57
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,250
Aw, man. I got my hopes up.

58
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,830
<i>And I can't help but wonder why 
they didn't ask about this thing.</i>

59
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,500
Maybe I'm the only one who can see it?

60
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,430
<i>So it's not a touch panel, then.</i>

61
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,540
<i>I remember something like this 
popping up before, too.</i>

62
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,210
Jinah?

63
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,990
You need to take better care of yourself! 
Do you know how worried I was?!

64
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,670
Sorry...

65
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,290
You always end up a mess, 
even when everyone else is fine!

66
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,320
I get worried, okay?!

67
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,290
<i>I can't believe I was prepared 
to leave her behind.</i>

68
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,290
You were out for three whole days this time!

69
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,320
What are you smiling about?

70
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,010
The next time something like this happens, 
I'm gonna quit school and get a job

71
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,120
so you don't have to be a hunter anymore!

72
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,220
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

73
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,610
But, Jinah... Can you see this?

74
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,220
See what?

75
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,790
Never mind. Sorry.

76
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,130
Listen... You know how sometimes in a game, 
it says you have unread notifications?

77
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,560
We're talking about games now?

78
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,150
How do you manage to read them, usually?

79
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,210
Should they be examining your head, too?

80
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,900
Jinah, you used to play games 
all the time, remember?

81
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,530
I mean, sure. You'd usually 
open your message box, right?

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,610
Open the message box...

83
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,440
Why bring up games all of a sudden?

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,410
Well, y'know, not a lot to do in a hospital.

85
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,980
<i>I remember this "Player" stuff 
being mentioned before...</i>

86
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,020
Well, you seem fine, at least.

87
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,920
I oughta go.

88
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,240
Sorry about the wait, Song-yi.

89
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,210
"This system is designed to assist 
the development of the Player."

90
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,250
"Failure to comply with the system 
may result in a penalty..."

91
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,940
"The rewards have been delivered"?

92
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,750
I don't have a clue what 
this is supposed to mean.

93
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,740
"Daily Quest: Strength Training."

94
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,850
Confirm.

95
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,570
Push-ups, sit-ups, squats, running...

96
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,410
"Failure to complete the daily quest 
will result in an appropriate penalty"?

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,630
What the hell? 
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

98
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,580
I'm hospitalized. Where am I gonna 
get that kind of stamina?

99
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,110
What in the world is going on?

100
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,050
Regarding that hunter, Sung Jinwoo...

101
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,060
It doesn't appear he's had 
a second awakening, Chairman Go.

102
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,720
<i>I see.</i>

103
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,110
<i>We're lucky this incident didn't result in a 
dungeon break, but something about it...</i>

104
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,010
<i>It leaves too many unanswered questions.</i>

105
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,490
Right. It's nothing like any previous case.

106
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,610
<i>Even allowing for how dungeons 
tend to be full of mysteries....</i>

107
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,100
<i>I think this'll need to be 
marked as a special case</i>

108
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,870
<i>and entered into the databank 
for further evaluation.</i>

109
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,390
Understood.

110
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,300
It's gonna be a long day.

111
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,260
I'd like you to participate in the next 
B-Rank raid as an instructor, Miss Cha.

112
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,470
As an instructor?

113
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,710
This raid is going to serve as a test 
and practical training for new recruits.

114
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,890
Can you handle it?

115
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,940
I have doubts about my ability as a mentor.

116
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,120
All you need to do is fight 
how you normally do.

117
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,460
Everyone will learn from your example.

118
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,160
That's just how talented you are.

119
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,940
The Hunters Guild is one of 
the five largest guilds in the country,

120
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,270
but on an international level, 
we're unremarkable.

121
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,600
And while individual ranks can't be increased,

122
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,360
our collective combat ability can be honed,

123
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,180
so that we'll be ready when the time comes.

124
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,020
Another gate?

125
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,940
In the middle of the damn road, too.

126
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,700
When are the hunters gonna show up?

127
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,770
I wish they'd take care of it already.

128
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,260
A-An earthquake?!

129
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,560
A... desert? What is happening?

130
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,060
Am I dreaming? I was just in the hospitalâ€”

131
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,570
Are you... kidding me?!

132
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,860
Huh?

133
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,100
Is something wrong?

134
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,960
The patient from this room...

135
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,750
How many of them are there, damn it?!

136
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,060
Two more hours of this?!

137
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,960
Any sign of him?

138
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
No. Not where I looked.

139
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,900
I think I'll check the room again.

140
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,740
Good idea.

141
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,080
I doubt he left the hospital...

142
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,000
Can't... keep running...

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,620
A penalty... quest?

144
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,990
Mr. Sung?!

145
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,730
Mr. Sung, are you all right?!

146
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,450
Yeah, I'm healing nicely.

147
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,880
I should be able to leave soon.

148
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,930
<i>That's a relief.</i>

149
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,080
<i>After all the worry you caused me, 
I'm expecting to be treated at Chagall.</i>

150
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,580
Okay, okay, sure.

151
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,210
All right, time to go.

152
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,930
You want me... for a raid?

153
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,600
<i>Yes. A D-Rank gate appeared 
in Hapjeong the other day,</i>

154
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,380
<i>and all the guilds have prior engagements.</i>

155
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,920
<i>I understand if you can't, of course.</i>

156
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,430
<i>We understand what you've 
been through, Hunter Lee.</i>

157
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,500
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,250
<i>No apologies necessary.</i>

159
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,760
<i>Oh, that said, I heard that 
Sung Jinwoo has woken up.</i>

160
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,970
He has?!

161
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,020
<i>Jinwoo... He's okay. That's wonderful!</i>

162
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,460
Look. He's running again.

163
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,110
Honestly... He's been at it every day 
since regaining consciousness.

164
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,280
Jinwoo...

165
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,250
I know hunters are supposed to heal 
faster than normal people, but...

166
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,500
He says he's trying to get back into shape.

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,180
And he doesn't listen when 
we tell him to take it easy.

168
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,850
Even though he was badly
injured just a few days ago.

169
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,460
He's a real handful.

170
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,220
<i>It's been four days since 
I regained consciousness.</i>

171
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,630
<i>I've figured out a few things.</i>

172
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>First, I'm not hallucinating these windows.</i>

173
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,400
<i>When I complete the daily quest, 
I get three types of rewards.</i>

174
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,070
Full recovery.

175
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,970
All that exhaustion is gone in a flash.

176
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,530
Next is the ability points.

177
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,970
<i>I can distribute the points 
into whatever abilities I choose.</i>

178
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,430
<i>I should probably go with strength, right?</i>

179
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,080
<i>Upgrading my abilities makes me
that much more powerful.</i>

180
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,120
<i>I can literally tell that 
I've got more strength now.</i>

181
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,050
<i>I've also got these skill 
and inventory screens.</i>

182
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,220
<i>My world's taken a real turn 
for the strange.</i>

183
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,090
It's like a game!

184
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,160
<i>And my final daily quest reward... 
the random loot box.</i>

185
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,890
<i>I wonder what it'll be today?</i>

186
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,560
A key?

187
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,410
I've only gotten useless stuff like 
pens and bandages so far...

188
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,590
An instance dungeon? What's that?

189
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,170
Based on what's happened so far, it'll be 
some kind of event to help me get stronger...

190
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,840
<i>And now a report on today's gate conditions.</i>

191
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,850
<i>New D-Rank gates have appeared at these locations.</i>

192
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,720
<i>The C-Rank gates in the Upper East and 
Midtown areas are currently being dealt with.</i>

193
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,880
<i>The B-Rank gate that appeared 
in the wharf district the other day</i>

194
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,360
<i>is scheduled to be raided within 
a few days by the Hunters Guild.</i>

195
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,380
<i>Expect traffic delays as a result.</i>

196
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,600
That was a really long line, huh?

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,360
It's supposed to be for sweets.

198
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,720
Understood. I'll head back to the office.

199
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,510
Mom!

200
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,010
Mom, wake up!

201
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,430
What happened?!

202
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,390
It's Mom... She won't respond!

203
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,350
Eternal Sleep Disease?

204
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,910
It's also known as Final Rest.

205
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,070
It's a disease that came into existence 
with the appearance of the gates.

206
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,320
It affects roughly one in every 
several ten thousand people.

207
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,010
There are theories that it's caused 
by continual exposure to mana.

208
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,950
In any case, the best that modern 
medicine can provide is life support.

209
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,290
All right, kiddo!

210
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,250
Step lively now!

211
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,430
Right!

212
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,140
Congratulations.

213
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,780
You qualify to become a hunter.

214
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,060
We're looking forward to 
seeing what you can do.

215
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,870
I did it, Jinah! Now I can 
afford Mom's treatment!

216
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,950
Isn't it dangerous, though?

217
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,950
It'll be okay. Just leave it to me.

218
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,470
What're you doing?!

219
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,480
Just sit in a corner and don't do anything!

220
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,720
Damned E-Rank, slowing us down...

221
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,900
And for the record, if you don't 
contribute, you don't get a cut!

222
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,480
I'm sorry for being so useless.

223
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,950
I'll put my ability points into strength.

224
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,920
<i>I've got my gear ready. 
I've taken care of everything.</i>

225
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,170
<i>And I'm confident that I can 
run away if I need to.</i>

226
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,650
<i>If things get dangerous, like last time, 
I'll get the hell out of there.</i>

227
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,880
No!

228
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,700
The exit's been sealed off?

229
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,810
<i>I see. So I'm in a separate dimension.</i>

230
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,670
<i>Instance dungeons aren't 
like the regular kind...</i>

231
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,780
<i>I've never been into one myself, 
but I bet they're like red gates.</i>

232
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,870
What a mess. I was thinking 
I could run, if I had to...

233
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,900
But that's out now.

234
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,400
"Teleportation stone"?

235
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,280
What's that? I guess I'm stuck here 
until I can clear the dungeon?

236
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,920
I couldn't even beat E-Rank beasts before.

237
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,470
And now I have to clear a dungeon by myself?

238
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,760
That's crazy...

239
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,310
Can I really beat a boss without any party?

240
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,570
Still, I don't have a choice!

241
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,950
What do I do? I'm suddenly 
feeling less confident.

242
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,370
Here they come! And there's three!

243
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,580
<i>I beat one...</i>

244
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,030
I've gotten stronger.

245
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,080
<i>A wolf.</i>

246
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>I can sense it...</i>

247
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,340
<i>This one's way stronger than those goblins.</i>

248
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,830
<i>My legs... won't move!</i>

249
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,060
<i>Why?!</i>

250
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,780
<i>Am I afraid?</i>

251
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,460
<i>I didn't think I was traumatized...</i>

252
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,560
Damn it!

253
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,740
<i>There's no healer with me!</i>

254
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,580
<i>If I get injured here, I'm done for!</i>
