1
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,032
Dongsuk.

2
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:11,062
Why do we make it so complicated?

3
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:13,065
We can just kill them there.

4
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,037
Are you an idiot?

5
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:18,041
If we do it there
and wake up that spider,

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,021
how will we take the mana crystal?

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,057
I don't care what his nickname is,

8
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:26,034
an E-Rank Hunter and a D-Rank Hunter
without combat experience

9
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:28,009
will never defeat that Boss.

10
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,051
We wait for that spider
to eat them and fall asleep again.

11
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,035
Then we can take the Mana Crystal out.

12
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,018
Do we blast it open again
with flash magic?

13
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,064
That'll wake up the spider again.

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,073
There's a small path above the cave,

15
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:44,077
we can go down from there.

16
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:47,003
I see.

17
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,082
You are a genius, Dongsuk.

18
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,061
But will it fall asleep?

19
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:53,091
If it doesn't,
we'll have to take it down.

20
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,095
That guy's name is Yoo Jinho, right?

21
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,081
Did you see his equipment?

22
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:00,041
His sword and shield alone
are worth hundreds of millions.

23
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,058
If we can't take the mana crystal,

24
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:04,092
we'll take his belongings instead.

25
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:08,021
Let me see which
wealthy family he's from.

26
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:10,084
At least we should attend his funeral.

27
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:12,072
By the way,

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,068
the noise we made
when sealing the road

29
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:18,014
must have infuriated that Boss a lot.

30
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:20,014
Kyuhwan,

31
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,098
do you think you can kill
that beast by yourself?

32
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:25,086
How could I possibly do that?

33
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,004
Honestly, me neither.

34
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,019
The Boss in Dungeon
cannot be underestimated.

35
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:34,099
In other words, those two...

36
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:38,054
...can't possibly leave there alive.

37
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,058
Please wait.

38
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,033
At least a B-Rank Hunter
can defeat a C-Rank Boss alone.

39
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:46,059
Or a top-tier C-Rank Hunter.

40
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:48,003
Jinwoo, you can't do it...

41
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:51,026
Let's find a way to get out!

42
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,097
Jinho is right.

43
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:57,026
Even though I've had a second
awakening and leveled up,

44
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:58,097
I am still very weak now.

45
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,077
The Venom-Fanged Kasaka
in the Instant Dungeon

46
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:04,098
should be D-Rank.

47
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,082
That Golem Boss is
probably D-Rank or lower.

48
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,007
This Boss is worlds apart
from those beasts.

49
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,037
But why?

50
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:21,004
I don't feel any pressure
that's making me tremble.

51
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:26,067
I've become strong enough
to no longer fear a C-Rank Boss.

52
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,034
My current level is 18.

53
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,059
Against a C-Rank Boss...

54
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,026
I have a chance of defeating it!

55
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,089
Hunters are called Hunters...

56
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,065
...because the real hunt begins now.

57
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:19,099
SOLO LEVELING

58
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,058
Thank you for your hard work.

59
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:36,009
Government officials, media,
and energy-related groups...

60
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,047
Having meetings with them for days
in a row is truly exhausting.

61
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:43,093
I've never been good at
beating around the bush.

62
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:50,073
I heard you have no plans coming up.

63
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:54,069
If possible, could I ask you
for a sparring match?

64
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,007
Perhaps it could change your mood.

65
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:04,002
I am already a withered veteran...

66
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:08,037
But I can't refuse when a young
person seeks my guidance.

67
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,046
Its hide is very hard.

68
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,064
Its attack is surprisingly powerful.

69
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,006
If I took one hit, I would be dead.

70
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:34,069
That kind of move...

71
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:36,044
He is definitely not an E-Rank Hunter.

72
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,008
Who is he?

73
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:41,095
Is he...

74
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,049
...a False Ranker?!

75
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,087
I've heard about them.

76
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,041
Very few Hunters can control their magic
power to deliberately get a lower rating.

77
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,007
Such Hunters are called False Rankers.

78
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,067
And they are usually...

79
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,072
...a psychopaths who take
pleasure in killing!

80
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,026
Why did I come here...?

81
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,047
Dad...

82
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,039
Damn it.

83
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,069
I can't deal any damage
to its hard hide!

84
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:17,094
My fatigue...

85
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,065
If it keeps increasing,
it will slow me down.

86
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:23,061
I need to get rid of it
before that happens.

87
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,057
Paralysis and drain.

88
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:29,003
This dagger's special abilities
are key to victory.

89
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:31,049
It'll take effect if I hit its weak spot.

90
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,007
That's the spot!

91
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,059
Acid?

92
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,046
It had this trick too.

93
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,017
Tough hide and the strong acid...

94
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,068
It's tougher to deal with than I expected.

95
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,089
If this continues,
I have no chance of winning.

96
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,081
I have to close the distance
between us.

97
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:56,014
The new skill, "Dash."

98
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:59,056
I'll use this move to get to it!

99
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,091
THE DEBUFF HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT

100
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:15,003
If one hit doesn't work,

101
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,033
I'll do it again and again!

102
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:20,048
He's so fast!

103
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,013
But can his vitality hold up?

104
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,046
What on earth is he planning?

105
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,047
Faster...

106
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:32,085
More faster...

107
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,081
Almost there...!

108
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:42,094
Jinwoo!

109
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,029
Jinwoo!

110
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:26,009
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS

111
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,028
DEBUFF: DRAIN

112
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:30,074
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS - DRAIN

113
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:32,024
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS

114
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,028
DEBUFF: DRAIN

115
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,003
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS

116
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,025
YOU HAVE DEFEATED
THE MASTER OF THE DUNGEON

117
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:52,059
Thankfully I didn't claim
the rewards for the daily quest.

118
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:55,045
Otherwise, I can't even imagine
the consequences.

119
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:59,068
Unbelievable...

120
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,023
He defeated the Boss all by himself.

121
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,009
There's no mistake...

122
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,011
He's a False Ranker!

123
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:11,061
How much is this worth?

124
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,053
Umm...

125
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,014
S-Sir.

126
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,008
Do you need me to help you
with the magic gem?

127
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:21,071
I can carry the luggage too.

128
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:25,071
Have some water, Sir.

129
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,042
T-Thanks...

130
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:29,046
Why is he suddenly calling me that?

131
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:31,072
Please take a rest, Sir!

132
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,039
I'll mine the mana crystal.

133
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:38,039
What's with this kid?

134
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,048
Huh? They are still alive.

135
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,028
TRAINING ROOM

136
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,029
Are you okay?

137
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,038
Yes.

138
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,021
Thank you for your guidance.

139
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,005
I've relaxed a lot.

140
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,042
Thank you.

141
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,038
You are amazing, President.

142
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,068
There's no sign of your
skills getting dull.

143
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:20,039
No, I'm no longer as good
as I used to be.

144
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:24,035
Jinchul, your moves have improved.

145
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:26,023
It seems you've done
a lot of training.

146
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:28,031
Training can't increase
Hunters' level,

147
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:31,073
but it can improve their skills.

148
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,024
Yeah.

149
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,049
Don't take pride in the Hunter's strength.

150
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:38,041
Having physical and mental
training is indeed important.

151
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:42,012
Especially if you're going
to a dangerous place like a dungeon.

152
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,012
After all, in such places,

153
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:49,059
you see the worst of people.

154
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:51,046
Is the Boss dead?

155
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,067
Was this spider just big and stupid?

156
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,008
What a crap.

157
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:58,064
With his equipment, defeating
a C-Rank Boss isn't impossible.

158
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:02,052
Even so, it's embarrassing
to lose to a D-Rank Hunter.

159
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:05,006
Dongsuk, what should we do?

160
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,073
What else?

161
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:08,044
Yoo Jinho.

162
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,023
I looked you up because of
your expensive equipment.

163
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,061
You are no ordinary person.

164
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:16,045
The president of Yoojin Construction,
Yoo Myunghan.

165
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,011
He's your dad, right?

166
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,003
So what?

167
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,079
I'll give you a chance.

168
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,033
Kill Sung Jinwoo.

169
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,029
Eh?

170
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:29,004
You know what we do, right?

171
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,000
We kill the useless ones

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,008
who just come to fill numbers
to take the spoils for ourselves.

173
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,042
Yoo Jinho,

174
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,068
I want you to be our accomplice.

175
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,068
If you do, I'll spare you.

176
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,001
How can I...

177
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:45,002
That young Hunter killed a C-Rank Boss
on his own with that equipment.

178
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:47,052
Any special effects
would be troublesome.

179
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,023
If you refuse,
you can die together.

180
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,023
What's wrong?

181
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,032
What's there to hesitate about?

182
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,086
No one will know
what happened here.

183
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:03,004
Are you afraid of that E-Rank trash?

184
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:20,089
Huh?

185
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,006
You...

186
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,068
Are you taking his side?

187
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:31,027
Dongsuk, what do we do now?

188
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,098
You start with the weaker one.

189
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:35,004
Have you two...

190
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:39,015
...ever killed people?

191
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:44,066
AN URGENT QUEST HAS ARRIVED.
Urgent quest?

192
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:46,004
DEFEAT THE ENEMIES 0/6
Urgent quest?

193
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:47,007
What's going on?

194
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,079
Pay attention here!

195
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,054
Take this!

196
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:00,043
Sir Jinwoo!

197
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:07,052
Heejin.

198
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,081
Long time no see.

199
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:15,009
What's going on
at the White Tiger Guild lately?

200
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,036
Nothing much.

201
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:19,003
It's the same as usual.

202
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:21,028
How about your Hunters Guild, Gina?

203
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,091
The same as usual too.

204
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:26,091
By the way,
you went to Hunter Cha's

205
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:29,041
A-Rank dungeon training, right?

206
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,075
How did it go?

207
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,054
It was awesome.

208
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:33,092
It ended in an instant.

209
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,092
Those A-Rank magic beasts
we struggled with...

210
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,039
...were instantly taken down by her.

211
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,022
She defeated enemies effortlessly.

212
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:50,006
Needless to say,
we were surprised.

213
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:53,002
Kihoon was quite shocked.

214
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:57,004
Because his goal was to
become the next Captain.

215
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,004
He's really worked hard, hasn't he?

216
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,061
What about Kim Chul?

217
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:04,066
He also wants to be
the Captain, right?

218
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:07,024
He's not a bad guy...

219
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,087
That says it all.

220
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,004
But after all,

221
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,087
we are pretty lucky,

222
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:18,046
as we are able to join large guilds
like Hunters Guild and White Tiger Guild.

223
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,088
That's true.

224
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,084
Yes.

225
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:25,034
After all, there are ominous
rumors in some places.

226
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:27,026
Ominous rumors?

227
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,093
The teams with an abnormally
high casualty rate.

228
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,000
Something like that.

229
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:38,019
Yoo Jinho, he's already dead.

230
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:41,053
How can you do that?!

231
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:46,011
How could I forget?

232
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,095
This is a place that believes
in the survival of the fittest...

233
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:54,021
A place full of violence and deceit...

234
00:14:55,025 --> 00:15:05,051
How could I...

235
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:08,018
I see.

236
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:09,062
I've become numb.

237
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,051
Careless,

238
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:13,002
arrogant,

239
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,027
and deluded.

240
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,044
Enemies...

241
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:22,086
The system is forcing me to kill people.

242
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:26,003
Does that mean
it doesn't want me to die?

243
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:30,024
This is neither coincidence nor kindness.

244
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:34,002
The system needs me.

245
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:40,063
I must be strong.

246
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,017
Sir! Thank goodness.

247
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,084
Hey, he's still alive.

248
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:50,022
I see.

249
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,056
The system is using me,

250
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:57,044
and I am using the system too.

251
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:00,086
Hey, Kyuhwan, don't hold back.

252
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,009
How could I forget?

253
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:06,082
The weak will have
everything taken from them.

254
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,007
This place is just like that.

255
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,045
You understand it very well,

256
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:13,008
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

257
00:16:13,062 --> 00:16:14,091
That means...

258
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:18,012
You are ready to face
the consequences, right?

259
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,071
What?

260
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,029
What are you saying?

261
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,038
If you guys are Hunters...

262
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:28,084
...you should be ready
to become hunted.

263
00:16:30,003 --> 00:16:32,062
Dongsuk, let me do it.

264
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,072
Buddy.

265
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:37,048
It seems like you don't quite
understand the situation.

266
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,098
Ready to be hunted?

267
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:43,052
What can a boastful
E-Rank Hunter do?

268
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,069
The Weakest Hunter of All Man—

269
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,016
What?

270
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,045
NUMBER OF ENEMIES DEFEATED: 1/6

271
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:59,044
One.

272
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:01,004
Ju-Juntae...?

273
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,000
No way.

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,092
When did he have
a weapon in his hand?!

275
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:05,096
Where did he hide it?!

276
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:08,097
Even if he was careless,
Juntae was still a D-Rank Hunter!

277
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,035
How could an E-Rank Hunter
manage to kill him?

278
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,056
I killed someone...

279
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:18,056
I killed...

280
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:21,078
I am following the system's instructions...

281
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,098
But the fact is...

282
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:26,048
...I killed someone.

283
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,094
But if I don't,
I will be the one to die.

284
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:33,041
There's no turning back now.

285
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,058
Since only the strong can survive!

286
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,083
Go to hell!

287
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,029
Die!

288
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:50,059
Huh?

289
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,013
How can an E-Rank Hunter
have such skills?!

290
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:55,039
You bastard...

291
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,031
Kyuhwan!

292
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:02,098
Y-Yes!

293
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,086
Take this!

294
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,008
NUMBER OF ENEMIES DEFEATED: 5/6

295
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:20,002
So strong.

296
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:25,017
I think he's even stronger
than he was when fighting the Boss.

297
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:28,034
H-He wiped out my team
members in an instant...

298
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:30,088
So you were hiding your ability?!

299
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,042
You defeated the Boss too, didn't you?!

300
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,034
But even if I'm also a C-Rank Hunter,

301
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,047
I'm not the same as them!

302
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,031
Enhancement!

303
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,094
Even if he is as strong
as a demon,

304
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:51,003
he must be exhausted after
fighting the Boss and five Hunters.

305
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:55,032
He relies on his speed
and the special abilities of that dagger.

306
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:59,003
But my enhanced body
is as hard as steel.

307
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,074
Your dagger...

308
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,074
...won't work on me.

309
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,091
Take this!

310
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:08,029
Captain Hwang,

311
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,059
you are very strong.

312
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,039
But let me tell you something.

313
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,038
That is...

314
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,093
...I am always leveling up.

315
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,077
W-What happened?

316
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:28,077
He knocked me to the ground?!

317
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,069
This guy...

318
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,015
...is no way an E-Rank Hunter!

319
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:35,044
W-Wait!

320
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:36,032
Don't kill me!

321
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:37,024
Please spare me!

322
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,095
Money... I'll give you money!

323
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:42,007
You can keep all the Mana Crystals
and Magic Gems here!

324
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,004
Is it not enough?

325
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:46,000
I understand.

326
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,017
I'll double the money for you.

327
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:49,012
- I'll pay...
- Three times...

328
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,084
You tried to kill me three times.

329
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,067
And you begging me
to spare your life?

330
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,047
P-Please stop!

331
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,076
Do you think you can
get away with this?!

332
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:03,047
No one will know
what happened in the dungeon.

333
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:05,013
You said it.

334
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:08,006
You bastard!

335
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,031
Do you even know
who my brother is—

336
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,024
NUMBER OF ENEMIES DEFEATED: 6/6

337
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,041
URGENT QUEST: DEFEAT THE ENEMIES

338
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,033
After the Boss dies,
the dungeon will begin to close.

339
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,091
Let's get out quickly.

340
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:35,034
Hmm...

341
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:38,092
All C-Rank Hunters have perished.

342
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,076
The survivors are...

343
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:44,056
...a D-Rank Hunter
and an E-Rank Hunter?

344
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,039
That's right.

345
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,035
Well...

346
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,056
You.

347
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,009
Y-Yes?

348
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,004
That sword in your hand

349
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,048
is the Claymore Kallion
from the Maya Company, right?

350
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:56,048
It just hit the market.

351
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,078
Y-Yeah.

352
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,099
I didn't know there'd be rewards too.

353
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:04,001
- That is from the Gredos Royal Series.
- Skill: Murderous Intent.

354
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,091
All abilities are halved?

355
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:11,008
I see. If you are using that equipment,
I can understand.

356
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,025
You defeated the Boss alone

357
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,084
and this E-Rank Hunter
hid away, right?

358
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:23,093
Thank you for your help today.

359
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:25,081
The investigation ends here.

360
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,097
S-Sir Jinwoo...

361
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:32,094
Thank you, Sir.

362
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,001
Yeah.

363
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,058
Is something wrong?

364
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,003
No.

365
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,053
I'm glad...

366
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:50,029
...I had her take an umbrella.
