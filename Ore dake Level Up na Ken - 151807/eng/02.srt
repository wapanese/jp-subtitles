1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,430
What is that thing?!

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,860
Let's get out of here!

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,840
Wait! You might get killed, too!

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,060
Then what are we supposed to do?!

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,300
Is there no other way out?!

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,910
How the hell am I supposed to know?!

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,100
Two of us are already dead!

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,410
Nobody move! If you do, it'll attack again!

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,660
Joohee! Joohee!

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,500
That was a close one.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,280
If you hadn't noticed what was happening,
we'd all be dead.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,760
Didn't you yell because you'd figured it out?

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,910
No... It just seemed dangerous...

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,360
Mr. Song, your arm!

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,320
If I grit my teeth, it's not too bad.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,020
Can you stop the bleeding, though?

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,810
I was hoping to ask Joohee, but...

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,760
she doesn't handle pressure well.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,770
That's why she only takes part in easy raids,
despite being a B-Rank healer.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,440
I've been through two or three
B-Rank dungeons myself...

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,690
And that might be an A-Rank foe... or even S.

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,160
The commandments of the Cartenon Temple
written on that tablet...

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,830
"First, revere God. Second, praise God."

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,210
"Third, prove your faith to God."

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,120
"Those who do not follow these
laws will not leave alive."

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,340
Mr. Song... The god it's talking about...

27
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,600
It's probably that thing, isn't it?

28
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,880
Over ten years ago, tunnels known as gates

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
that connected our world to
an alternate dimension appeared,

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,400
giving rise to a number of supernatural
phenomena throughout the world.

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,200
Those who awaken to special powers,
known as hunters, are a prime example.

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,300
They are tasked with defeating the beasts
that lie within the dungeons through gates,

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,780
and a hunter's power,
once active, never changes.

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,960
But at times, on the other side of a gate,

35
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,760
one finds monsters who inspire
something beyond mere terror—

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,090
something akin to absolute despair.

37
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,240
Did you watch it?

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,390
Oh, the video?

39
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,010
What were you doing?
You almost got marked as late.

40
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,130
Nothing special.

41
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,280
Jinah, your brother's a hunter, right?

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,690
Sure is.

43
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,340
Well, that said, he's an E-Rank hunter...

44
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,070
So he's always getting hurt real bad.
It seems like a lot of trouble.

45
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,480
He came home covered
in bandages the other day!

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,660
Why are you asking, anyway?

47
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,990
No real reason.

48
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,520
I bet I could do a better job...

49
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,670
That thing is too strong to fight.

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,360
Let's collect ourselves and
search for a way out of here.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,900
It won't be—

52
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,390
I'm not just gonna die in here!
It won't be—

53
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,420
I finally managed to land a contract
with a major guild!

54
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,150
I can't afford to bite it like this!

55
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,270
What are you doing?! You mustn't move!

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,150
I can pull this off!
I'm pretty confident in my speed.

57
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,800
I'll get it before it gets me!

58
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,450
Damn it!

59
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,900
I think this means it could
wipe us all out if it felt like it.

60
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,800
Easily, too. Like stepping on a bug.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,830
Then why doesn't it kill us right now?

62
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,470
It has the strength to kill us, but it hasn't.

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,560
There's something different about it compared
to most beasts, which attack on sight.

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,060
Mr. Song, what was the first
commandment again?

65
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,120
The commandments?

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,610
I think the first one was to revere God.

67
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,490
God...

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,430
This dungeon has its own rules.

69
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,950
What are you doing?!

70
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,330
If I'm right about this...

71
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,010
You need to stop—

72
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,960
From how you look, you haven't
given up on surviving this.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Everyone! Bow your heads
toward the statue, please!

74
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,390
Bow our heads?

75
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,860
What the hell are you talking about?

76
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,900
Did you figure out something?

77
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,890
I think so. As long as you keep
your head low, it won't attack.

78
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,660
"Revere God." Just like the commandment says.

79
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,160
You're sure about this?

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes... For now.

81
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,470
In that case...

82
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,390
This is gonna save us? This is all it takes?

83
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,270
Damn, that's freaky!

84
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,230
Its expression changed?

85
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,090
It's not doing anything.

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,900
Hey! Don't just get up!

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,160
Look! It's not attacking anymore!

88
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,000
Is it really over?

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,420
Are we safe now?

90
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,210
All right!

91
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,430
We're saved!

92
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,420
We can go home!

93
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,800
No... There's still...

94
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,890
I thought it was over!

95
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,650
Sung, what now?! You have
some kind of plan, right?

96
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,070
N-Not at all!

97
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,530
But it's probably a bad idea to break
the commandments they set!

98
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,630
The second was to praise God!

99
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,860
That's what we need to figure out!

100
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,880
Praise him?!

101
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,500
How, exactly?

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,360
Let me give this a try.

103
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,650
I've been studying ethnology.

104
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,870
There are a few extolments
for gods that come to mind.

105
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,220
O God, our great ruler
who brings order to the world...

106
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,180
Is it working?

107
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,300
I think it might be slowing down?

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,020
Show us the path of truth.

109
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,230
Wait. That's...

110
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,190
Thy will be done...

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,530
Those words don't apply to this god!

112
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,700
We revere and honor thee!

113
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,780
O God, our great ruler
who brings order to the world!

114
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,130
Shit!

115
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,220
Run for it!

116
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,660
It's too dangerous to bunch up!

117
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,380
Spread out!

118
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,240
Right!

119
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,250
Let's run, Joohee!

120
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,020
I can't die like this!

121
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,710
I've got family waiting for me!

122
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,150
I should be safe over here, right?

123
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,910
Hey, Park! Behind you!

124
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,580
Park!

125
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,440
Praise God... Praise God...

126
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,690
What is there to praise about that thing?!
It's basically a devil!

127
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,260
But I can't leave Joohee alone.

128
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,980
I need some kind of clue.

129
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,680
Spears... Axes...

130
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,900
Hammers... Swords... Instruments...

131
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,600
Instruments?

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,060
Everyone! Run to the statues
with instruments!

133
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,280
The instruments?

134
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,370
Is it... playing?

135
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,130
Hey! The statues with
instruments won't attack!

136
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,760
Damn it all...

137
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,590
Please, play your music! Hurry!

138
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,130
Does it not work if there's two people?

139
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,300
You stay here, Joohee!

140
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,620
Jinwoo!

141
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,110
Over there!

142
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,130
Not there!

143
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,010
No!

144
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,220
Jinwoo!

145
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,270
Not... yet...

146
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,190
Not yet!

147
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,820
I guess this is what was meant by praise?

148
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,930
Jinwoo! Are you okay?!

149
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah... Barely.

150
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,330
Jinwoo...

151
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,570
Yeah?

152
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,550
Your leg...

153
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,100
That's enough, Joohee. I'll be fine.

154
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,490
What are you saying?! I'm going to heal you!

155
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
Joohee...

156
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,610
What a nightmare.

157
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,930
It really is.

158
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,560
It's a shame about your arm.

159
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,920
But you made a careless call as our leader.

160
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,380
I guess it's just karma.

161
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,250
That's awful!

162
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,370
Kim, you were the one who—

163
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,820
Hey, we all decided together!

164
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,980
And I remember how you voted.

165
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,280
I was the one who made the final call.

166
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,870
I'm responsible for everything
that's happened here.

167
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,850
This is no time to be arguing.

168
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,530
There's still one more commandment.

169
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,330
What's going on now?!

170
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,490
An earthquake?!

171
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,750
What the hell is that?!

172
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,470
An altar.

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,740
They come up all the time in legends...

174
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,180
for offering treasure
and sacrifices to the gods.

175
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,440
The third commandment.
"Prove your faith to God."

176
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,850
Even an idiot like me knows
what the move is here.

177
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,210
We've gotta offer up a sacrifice,
ain't that right, Sung?

178
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,220
I saw a man who was bragging about his wife
before we came in here split down the middle.

179
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,000
And he wasn't the only one!

180
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,860
You said it yourself, didn't you?

181
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,210
Well, time to take responsibility, Leader.

182
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,260
Kim, that's—

183
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,220
Enough out of you, buddy!
Kim, that's—

184
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,830
Enough out of you, buddy!

185
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,070
Fine. Let me go myself.

186
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,250
This isn't Mr. Song's fault alone.

187
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,640
We took a vote to decide to come here!

188
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,340
What's happening now?

189
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,280
Sung! Is there anything else I need to do?

190
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,900
What is this? Didn't we need a sacrifice?

191
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,400
Sorry. I'd like to examine the altar,
so could you help me over to it?

192
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,900
Get me right next to it, please.

193
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,750
B-But then, won't we...

194
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,800
I don't think anything will happen.

195
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,720
Did you figure something out?

196
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,140
Not yet, no...

197
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,300
If we wait here, is anyone
likely to come rescue us?

198
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,050
The gate will have been open
for a week as of today.

199
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,440
They'll probably start moving again
before anyone comes for us.

200
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,560
It takes seven days for a gate
to open up all the way.

201
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,720
That's what's called a dungeon break.

202
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,180
When that happens, the beasts are
able to cross over to the other side.

203
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,310
The other objective of raids
is to defeat the dungeon boss

204
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,670
and shut the gate down
before that time is up.

205
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,570
Which means if we fail here...

206
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,220
That thing will be able to enter our world.

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,930
Hello!

208
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,370
Oh, Miss Sung! It's wonderful
how you visit every day.

209
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,320
Mom! I'm here again.

210
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,000
Song-yi was late to class today.

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,060
She said she'd had stuff to do,
but I'm sure she just overslept!

212
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,540
Oh, and in the national test...

213
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,450
Could you two come over here, please?

214
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,870
We probably need a flame
to light up for each one of us.

215
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,150
If anything's going to happen,
it'll be after that.

216
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,490
The door's open.

217
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,830
Can we leave?

218
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,280
Unless this is a trap, too...

219
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,780
What was that sound?!

220
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,050
Th-The statues are coming this way!

221
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,670
What do we do?!

222
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,380
Why are they coming after us?!

223
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,350
No!

224
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,430
Joohee, don't close your eyes!

225
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,100
They won't move if you're watching them!

226
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,200
It works like that old children's game.

227
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
Everyone, keep your eyes on the statues!

228
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,670
Nooo!

229
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,820
Hey!
Nooo!

230
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,860
Wait!
Hey!
Nooo!

231
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:30,870
Hey!
Nooo!

232
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,310
What's going on here, Sung?!

233
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,210
The door closed a bit,
but I think she made it out!

234
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,670
Why?

235
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,050
The blue flames have been
dying out over time.

236
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,380
One of the orange ones went out
when someone escaped.

237
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,260
The first order was to revere.
The second was to praise.

238
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,520
The third is to prove our faith...

239
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,710
It must be a trap.

240
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,890
Causing danger and fear,
and then offering a false sense of hope...

241
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,590
Maybe it's testing our faith in this god.

242
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,570
I can't... I can't do this!

243
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,550
Jeongho!

244
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,120
Hey!

245
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,080
Don't!

246
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,450
You can't move!

247
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,000
If anyone else leaves,
we'll have blind spots!

248
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,500
What is happening here, Sung?!

249
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,760
We need an explanation!

250
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,510
As long as we keep our eyes on the statues
and don't move, we'll be safe!

251
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,470
The blue flames are a timer.
When they're all gone, we'll all make it out!

252
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,610
Isn't there a chance we'll be
trapped in here once they go out, too?

253
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,680
I'll be honest, I didn't expect you,
our weakest member,

254
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,180
to pull off as much as you've managed.

255
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,760
The only reason we're alive
at all is thanks to you.

256
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,200
Kim...

257
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,930
But I've got a family waiting for me!
I can't die just yet!

258
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,320
I wanna make it home alive!

259
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,420
I can't take any more of this!

260
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,450
I'm sorry!

261
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,050
Why?

262
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,780
Not yet!

263
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
We have to survive this!

264
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,630
I've managed to make it before, somehow!

265
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,330
The two of you should go.

266
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,570
Mr. Song?

267
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,330
I think the doors will stay open
as long as one of us remains here.

268
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,330
You two still have long lives
ahead of you. You should go.

269
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,040
Joohee, look after Sung for me.

270
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,570
R-Right!

271
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,460
No... Oh, no... No...

272
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,790
My legs... gave out on me...

273
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,460
You must've over-exerted
yourself healing Sung.

274
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,640
Mr. Song. Take Joohee and go.

275
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,310
I just said I'm going to stay—

276
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,760
Then who's going to carry Joohee out?!

277
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,560
There's no time. Hurry!

278
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,220
You can't, Jinwoo!

279
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,320
In that case, it should be me—

280
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,110
I promised to take you out to eat, didn't I?

281
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,600
Use this to buy yourself dinner.

282
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,040
And when I get out of here,
I'll be along to collect the change.

283
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,070
How can you even say—

284
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm sorry. But it looks like
we really are out of time.

285
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,070
Please.

286
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,890
Good. I'm the only one who has to die.

287
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,210
If I'd known this was gonna happen,

288
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,980
I would've enrolled in a juicier
life insurance package.

289
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,560
I'll take at least one of you down with me...

290
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,990
So bring it on!

291
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,990
I've always been the weakest.

292
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,340
And I've been mocked for it,
time and time again.

293
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,300
But I've always tried as hard as I could.

294
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,010
And now...

295
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,470
This is bullshit.

296
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,330
It's bullshit! This is such bullshit!

297
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,110
I tried to be stronger...

298
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,070
but I couldn't.

299
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,490
And even then,
I gave it my all to get this far!

300
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,220
You couldn't take any more?
We all felt the same way!

301
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,990
All you were doing was
justifying your own selfishness!

302
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,500
That gratitude was purely superficial.

303
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,850
It's always the most selfish
people who benefit the most!

304
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,360
I have a family, too!
I wanted to make it home alive, too!

305
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,280
It's good that I'm the only one
who has to die?

306
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,110
How could you think that,
you stupid hypocrite?!

307
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,050
No. I don't wanna die.

308
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,350
If... If I had one more chance...
