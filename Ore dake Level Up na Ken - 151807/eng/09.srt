1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,180
These stupid things are coming right at us,
begging to be killed.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,370
Well, I love it! Let's wipe 'em all out!

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,040
I'm not sure which ones
are the real beasts.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,000
Old Man Song's a beast himself!

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,340
That takes care of this group.
You really have gotten stronger, Sung!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,130
And where did you get such a nice dagger?

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,930
Now that I think about it,
you haven't been hurt at all today, Jinwoo.

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,730
I-Is that right?

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,520
Here's hoping no one ends up needing my help.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,990
Well, I'm still counting on you.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,700
He definitely has changed.

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,120
Not just his appearance but even his aura...
He's making it look easy now.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,580
Did you start learning martial arts?

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,120
Let's keep going.

15
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,220
The path splits here.

16
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,050
The dungeon's been easier than forecast,

17
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,210
so it should be fine
to split into three groups.

18
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,530
There'd be additional risk,
but we'd be able to finish sooner, too.

19
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,940
I think that's a good idea.

20
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,860
I'll take the prisoners down
the path on the right.

21
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,360
If you find the boss chamber,
send someone to let us know.

22
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,740
I guess it's because I raised my perception
ability, but I can tell already.

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,410
The boss is down there.

24
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,770
These goblins weren't getting me
much experience, anyway.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,550
Mr. Song.

26
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,610
Let's head down the path to the left.

27
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,500
Understood.

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,550
That leaves the middle for us.

29
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,590
Right.

30
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,230
If these goblins are all
there is, we'll be fine.

31
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,340
I just hope we can finish this job safely.

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,570
I'm sure we will.

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,150
The Weakest Hunter only gets called in
for low-rank dungeons, right?

34
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,260
Except we made that same assumption
once already, and look what happened.

35
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,820
I've made up my mind.

36
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,670
When this raid's over,
I'm gonna apologize to Sung.

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
It's been bugging you, too, right?
How we ran away.

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,160
We're grown men, professional hunters...

39
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,120
Even if it was because of our families,

40
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,400
that doesn't change the fact that
we left one of our own behind.

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,100
If we wanna keep being hunters...
we need to face up to what happened.

42
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,690
You think he'll forgive us?

43
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,600
There's no chance.
But I'm still gonna apologize.

44
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,020
Come on, let's get going.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,670
What a joke! These goblins are way too easy!

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,530
Is that all of them?

47
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,250
You expected it to take longer?

48
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,240
I wanna rack up some more kills!

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,830
What if you were facing humans?

50
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,590
Could you kill them just as easily?

51
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,050
I don't really see the difference.

52
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,330
Yeah. It's all the same shit.

53
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,270
What did you want to discuss?

54
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,730
Three men... assaulted my daughter.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,470
She hung herself afterwards,

56
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,980
and my wife was hospitalized
from the psychological shock...

57
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,490
But these scum will be free in a few years,
like nothing happened at all!

58
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,490
Not only that, but they're hunters!

59
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,530
Hunters are allowed to participate
in raids while incarcerated

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,600
to reduce their sentences, right?

61
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,530
In what world is that fair?!

62
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,510
When my daughter will never get to come home!

63
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,340
And that is?

64
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,630
I have three billion here.

65
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,830
I want you... to...

66
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,460
kill them, please.

67
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,680
What happens in a dungeon
stays in the dungeon, right?

68
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,180
Please! I'm begging you!

69
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,900
Here's what I'll tell the inspectors
when I get out of here:

70
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,480
The three of you were set upon
by a pack of a hundred goblins.

71
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,200
This path really goes all over the place...

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,190
Are we even making any progress?

73
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,420
You think we got the dud route?

74
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,830
Here we go...

75
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,250
Help... me...

76
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,510
Hoping for a quick death?

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,750
I was actually asked to make you
suffer as much as possible first.

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,740
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,640
Huh. I guess the paths met back up.

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Which means the left path
was the one that led to the boss room.

81
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,500
That'll save me some trouble.

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,630
Hel—

83
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,860
Guess I'll have to alter my plans.

84
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,800
That Kang Taeshik guy visited me in
the hospital with his inspector boss.

85
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,580
I hope he doesn't remember me.

86
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,420
Mr. Song!

87
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,320
Right!

88
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,760
What is this?!

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,260
Jeongho!

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Mr. Kang...?

91
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,120
Mr. Kim?

92
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,870
Joohee, heal him.

93
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,940
Hurry and heal him!

94
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,540
R-Right!

95
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,960
Mr. Kim! Please hang on!

96
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,180
This wasn't the work of a magic beast.

97
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,140
The weapon's too sharp. And whoever used it
avoided finishing him off... multiple times.

98
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,100
Don't... bother. I'm not gonna make it.

99
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,470
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,180
You need to survive.
You have a family, don't you?

101
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,570
You...

102
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:52,030
You need to survive, no matter what!
How else can I keep blaming you?!

103
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,830
I didn't see it playing out like this.

105
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,170
I wanted to give you... a proper apology.

106
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,140
I'm real sorry, kid.

107
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,240
I mean... it...

108
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,000
Kim...

109
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,530
Wow, you're fast.

110
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,910
I had intended on taking out
the healer first...

111
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,670
But it looks like you were able
to change her fate.

112
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,030
Mr. Kang?! Did you do this?!

113
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,380
What if I did?

114
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,690
Aren't you from the Hunter's Association?!

115
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,080
You think you can get away with—

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,050
I've got the perfect little story.

117
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,560
I was gonna say that it was a swarm
of goblins, but here's my new angle:

118
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,710
The prisoners were plotting an escape,
so they killed the rest of you

119
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,150
and then tried to ambush me while
I was occupied fighting the boss...

120
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,740
But they didn't have what it takes.
And that's why I was the sole survivor.

121
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,580
What do you think? Perfect, huh?

122
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
You scum.

123
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,370
You can't stand against him. I'll go.

124
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm borrowing this, Kim.

125
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,800
I haven't raised a sword against
another person in a long time.

126
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,250
He's B-Rank, a level above me. But still...

127
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,250
Ms. Joohee, could you cast a
physical strength buff on me?

128
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,600
R-Right!

129
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,970
Assassin types tend to have weak defenses.

130
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,100
I'll aim for that.

131
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,360
A washed-up mage like you trying to rely
on strength instead is gonna backfire.

132
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,740
Right now, I'm a swordsman.

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,740
But your skills are magic-focused!
Taking up that sword won't help you!

134
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,960
You might be surprised!

135
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,080
Okay, you've got some moves.

136
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,090
Even putting aside the buff,
you really do know your stuff.

137
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,340
It was only for a moment,
but he was able to keep up.

138
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,180
If Mr. Song was a little faster...

139
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,600
Fast and accurate! I can see why
you ditched magic for the sword!

140
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,040
But that's about all you can manage.

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,150
That pain-in-the-ass healer.

142
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,360
Guess I had better deal with her after all.

143
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,490
Turning your back on an armed opponent?!

144
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,580
I guess you're no average old fart.

145
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,820
I've trained S-Rank hunters before!

146
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,080
In terms of blade technique, I won't be beat!

147
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,870
Maybe, but the powers you've
been given have their limits.

148
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,760
Did you think a mage type like you
could keep up with an assassin hunter?!

149
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,570
Mr. Song!

150
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,890
Oh, no...

151
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,360
Your healer's useless, too.

152
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,560
Game over.

153
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,830
Did that work?!

154
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,120
You took up that sword to make me
lower my guard against magic...

155
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,920
so that when I went for the kill,
you could blast me.

156
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,220
Pretty slick plan, for a senile old bastard.

157
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm finished!

158
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,390
Now die.

159
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,710
You again?

160
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,940
Who the hell are you?!

161
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,100
Sung Jinwoo, E-Rank.

162
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,950
E-Rank? That's a load of crap.

163
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,160
Sung? What was that just now?

164
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I could see a power type, even at E-Rank,
being able to block like that.

165
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,070
But the reaction time you'd
need to pull it off twice...

166
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,170
would require an assassin build.

167
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,260
Not that it really matters, anyway.
You've been hiding your skills, haven't you?

168
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,680
Your little group seems to know each other.

169
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,480
So you can't be a false ranker.
They don't let any witnesses live.

170
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,290
Which leaves only one possibility...

171
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,440
You had a second awakening.

172
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,520
You did, Sung?!

173
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,690
A second awakening?!

174
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,820
Then it must've happened
after the double dungeon!

175
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,730
A double dungeon?

176
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,090
Wait... Is he that weakling
E-Rank from before?

177
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,890
But he looks and acts like a different person.

178
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,700
And the mana meter only read 10
when we checked back then.

179
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,260
If he had a second awakening,
it must have been after.

180
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,670
So how'd he survive the double dungeon...?

181
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,740
Well, whatever happened to you, I can tell
you don't have a ton of hunting experience.

182
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,590
So it falls to me to teach you the ropes.

183
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,680
Why did you do this?

184
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
You mean killing the prisoners?

185
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,560
I was asked to by the father of their victim.

186
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,210
They drove someone to suicide
and didn't regret it at all.

187
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,150
It's a bit of social justice, that's all.

188
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,900
No. I was talking about Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

189
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,440
Why kill them?

190
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,660
Was it to silence them? Because you
could've done that without torturing them.

191
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,360
But you didn't do that. You toyed with them.

192
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,620
I don't think you did this
for the victim's sake at all.

193
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,080
That's not what you really want.

194
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,030
Sure, I can do that.

195
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,490
But you've got the wrong idea.

196
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,470
I'm a B-Rank hunter who has received
offers from a number of major guilds.

197
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,420
So why am I working for peanuts
in the Hunter's Association?

198
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,690
It's because I find people a <i>whole</i>
lot more fun to kill than beasts!

199
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,750
There's a limit to what even a
reawakened E-Rank can pull off!

200
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,620
Too slow.

201
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,990
Impressive.

202
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,160
He's so agile!

203
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,570
Nothing at all like the Sung I remember!

204
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,970
We're matched in speed!

205
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,840
We've got the same build
and similar skill levels...

206
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,490
But I have far more experience battling
high-ranked opponents than you!

207
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,480
That inexperience will be your downfall!

208
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,910
You've got grit, I'll give you that.

209
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,310
Sorry...

210
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,860
Eh?

211
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,870
But could you be a little less bloodthirsty?

212
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,040
Now you've done it.
Even the system's noticed.

213
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,970
Then again, I guess I should be grateful.

214
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,590
The system's given me another reason
to make sure you die.

215
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,250
The system?

216
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,670
What the hell is he talking about?

217
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,630
I should have the advantage here...

218
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,680
He's even faster?!

219
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,650
Poison? A special effect
from that dagger of yours?

220
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,990
I've got something special to show you, too!

221
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,030
He vanished?!

222
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,990
I should be completely undetectable.
You're a sharp bastard, all right.

223
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,440
This is the Stealth skill. It conceals
my sight, my sound, and even my smell.

224
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,740
Only a tiny fraction of assassin
hunters ever obtain this skill.

225
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,480
Of course, no one knows I can use it, either.

226
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,520
And the reason for that...

227
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,720
is that no one who's seen me use it
has ever lived to tell the tale.

228
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,230
You won't be so fast now.

229
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,850
Jinwoo—

230
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,760
Keep your hands to yourself!

231
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,150
You two are next.

232
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,070
At this rate, Sung's going to die!

233
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,290
Now, think you can dodge my next strike
with an injured leg?

234
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,240
Are you done talking now?

235
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,030
Full recovery.

236
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,000
He healed in an instant?!

237
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,340
I've never heard of a combat hunter
who could use healing magic, too.

238
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,460
What else does he have?!

239
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,550
He's impossible to predict!
This guy is dangerous!

240
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,120
That's another of my emotions, gone.

241
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,850
I don't even need to get angry
to kill filth like you.

242
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,020
Oh, I see. You've killed before, too, huh?

243
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,120
Man, I didn't know we were
in the same business!

244
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,770
I see now.

245
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,610
He must've been forced through a number
of grave decisions in a short time.

246
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,830
It wasn't just his appearance that changed.

247
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,580
When hunters awakened, their supernatural
abilities turned the world on its head.

248
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,590
Where we are is a place that only hunters
can enter. Laws aren't worth shit here.

249
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,160
Whoever's strongest comes out on top.

250
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,710
Is he tracking me from my bloodlust?

251
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,990
But that won't let him know
exactly where I'm coming from!

252
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,200
What the—

253
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,780
Wait... Are you kidding me?

254
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,560
What... the hell...

255
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,720
You asked why I killed them, right?

256
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,660
It's pointless to expect hunters, who thrive
in mortal combat, to stick to normal morals.

257
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,470
You're the same way. You and me,
we're killing machines at this point.

258
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,910
Which is why I'll die. Because I lost.

259
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,560
It's just natural selection.

260
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,460
But what the hell are you?

261
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,030
You've got assassin skills,
healing, and debuffs...

262
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,530
I've never heard of anything like it.

263
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,940
Couldn't tell you. I'd like to know, myself.

264
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:29,210
Well, you just killed me,
so your little E-Rank act is over.

265
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,280
Let's say that I'm a hunter
who gets stronger with every battle.

266
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,960
Then I'd say your shadow stretches
into some really nasty places...

267
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,340
and you'll probably get as strong
as those places are dark.

268
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,400
You'd better watch yourself, though.

269
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,880
If you gaze for long into an abyss,
the abyss... gazes also into you.

270
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,970
He's right. I'm incomparably strong
next to how I was before.

271
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,210
But for some reason...

272
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,330
the stronger I get, the more I feel
something inside of me falling apart.

273
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,550
Jinwoo!

274
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,420
Thank you so much.

275
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,230
You really did it.
We only survived because of you.

276
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,590
It's fine. You two should exit the dungeon.

277
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,730
I'll handle the rest.

278
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,020
What?! By yourself?!

279
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,610
Then again... you're right.

280
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,240
It's a shame we won't be able
to lay Kim and Kang to rest.

281
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,700
We'll be waiting outside.

282
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,630
Manager Woo!

283
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,970
I heard the report. Where are the survivors?

284
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,340
Right this way.

285
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,050
I can't believe Kang was
killing in secret all this time.

286
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,760
He had always been a little sketchy,
but as his supervisor, I was too careless.

287
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,100
This is the three of them.

288
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,280
Isn't he... the E-Rank hunter from before?

289
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,360
He looks like a whole different person.

290
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
It's good to see you again.

291
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,660
Aren't you the inspector...?

292
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,400
Woo Jinchul. I want to apologize for what
one of my men put you through.

293
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,920
But first... I'd like
to address the main issue.

294
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,380
Which one of you defeated Kang?

295
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,460
I guess I won't be able to keep
my secret any longer.

296
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,390
Which means I'm gonna have to
cancel my deal with Jinho...

297
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,350
It was me.

298
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,320
I killed Mr. Kang.

299
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,020
Pardon me, but I believe your rank was...?

300
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,540
C-Rank.

301
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,560
How were you able to beat
a B-Rank like Kang?

302
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Why, with the help of my friend here.

303
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,490
I see. Then you say you
managed with a healer's help.

304
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,170
Kang was the cream of the crop among B-Ranks.

305
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,710
By all rights, a C-Rank mage
shouldn't have stood a chance...

306
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,540
Very well.

307
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll need to write this incident up,
so if you could please come with me.

308
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,860
I can't get cocky just because
I beat Kang Taeshik.

309
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,060
I couldn't tell before,
but this guy is A-Rank.

310
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,200
As it stands, I'd be helpless against him.

311
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,360
Sorry if I overstepped my bounds there.

312
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,230
But I imagine you've got a good reason
for keeping your strength hidden.

313
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,700
Well, think of it as my way
of paying you back.

314
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,530
Three hours later,

315
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,250
the man who hired Kang Taeshik
to kill the prisoners turned himself in,

316
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,830
which confirmed that
we acted in self-defense.

317
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,880
What a day, huh?

318
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,800
Jinwoo.

319
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,950
Do you remember this?
