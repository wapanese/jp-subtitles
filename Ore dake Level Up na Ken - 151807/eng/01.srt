1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,200
Captain, we should be in this fight.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,670
You know there'd be no point.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,490
None of our weapons can do
any damage to those things.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,620
We've got no choice 
but to leave this to the hunters.

5
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,800
All of you, engage the enemy!

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,840
If they get past us, the front line 
is going to collapse!

7
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,420
I-It's no good! We're too low-ranked 
to stand a chance!

8
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,840
<i>Damn it... I'm...</i>

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,550
<i>losing consciousness...</i>

10
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,520
<i>Healing magic?</i>

11
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,500
<i>Amazing. He healed me in an instant!</i>

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,200
Look out!

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
Byung-gu, get down!

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,030
Yoonho!

15
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,870
Right!

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,690
It's the S-Ranks...

17
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,680
The S-Rank hunters are here!

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,060
You're rushing things too much, Byung-gu.

19
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,360
Sorry. I wanted to help 
as many people as I could.

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,350
Besides, I knew you two would protect me.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,420
I don't think that's the boss.

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,990
Probably just the leader of this swarm.

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,590
Byung-gu, look after the wounded.

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
I've got it covered, Yoonho!

25
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,230
Let's go, Eunseok!

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,540
Yes, sir!

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,050
Pure brute strength.

28
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,410
Guess it wasn't the leader after all.

29
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,360
Now this is getting fun.

30
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,320
It seems they made it in time.

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,270
Now then, we should get started.

32
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,100
Guildmaster Choi, whenever you're ready!

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,110
Right.

34
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,070
Commence the attack!

35
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,850
<i>Over ten years ago,</i>

36
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,840
<i>a series of gates linking our world 
to an alternate dimension appeared.</i>

37
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,010
<i>The other side of each gate teemed 
with bizarre creatures called "magic beasts",</i>

38
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,370
<i>immune to conventional weaponry.</i>

39
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,120
<i>Those who have awakened the abilities 
necessary to fight these beasts</i>

40
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,680
<i>are called hunters.</i>

41
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,860
<i>Based on the amount of magical power 
contained within their bodies,</i>

42
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:25,290
<i>they are ranked, in descending order, 
as S, A, B, C, D, or E-Rank.</i>

43
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,320
<i>However, once these powers have awakened, 
no amount of individual effort</i>

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>can ever result in greater strength.</i>

45
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,540
Good luck with today's raid.

46
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,720
Thank you.

47
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,910
Hey, Kim!

48
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,300
Been a while!

49
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,250
Hey, if it isn't Park! 
What're you doing here?

50
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,470
I thought you said you'd had enough hunting.

51
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,710
That was before my wife got 
pregnant with our second kid.

52
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,220
Makes sense. If the raid goes well, 
you'll be raking it in.

53
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,510
I'm pretty nervous, though.

54
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,570
It's been so long that I dunno 
if I'm still in good enough shape.

55
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,280
Not like I was that strong to begin with.

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,750
Hey, it's Sung!

57
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,730
What's up, Sung?

58
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,790
Nice of you to come out despite 
the chilly weather.

59
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,570
Good to be working with you guys again today.

60
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,040
Hey, Sung! You eat before coming in?

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,790
Yeah. I had a proper meal.

62
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,590
What's with him? Is he a big deal? 
Everyone's saying hello.

63
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,040
The exact opposite, actually.

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,790
He joined up after you quit, and that kid...

65
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,860
His nickname is "The Weakest 
Hunter of All Mankind."

66
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,360
Weakest? Not strongest?

67
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,300
Nope.

68
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Like, a trip through an E-Rank gate 
landed him in the hospital.

69
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,410
He might be the weakest hunter there is.

70
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,140
Out of everyone? He's that bad?

71
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,040
So as a rule, you can assume any raid he 
gets called in for will be pretty easy-going.

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,680
I get you.

73
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,070
I'd hate for him to overhear us, 
so let's leave it at that.

74
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,380
<i>Too bad I already caught it all.</i>

75
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,860
<i>Well, can't argue with the truth.</i>

76
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,400
Oh, no, Jinwoo! You're hurt again?!

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,230
Ah, Joohee... Looks like 
we'll be working together again.

78
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,890
Never mind that. What happened to your face?

79
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,830
Same thing that usually 
happens to it, really...

80
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,340
You seriously need to be more careful!

81
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,760
I heard you even ended up in the hospital.

82
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
It was an E-Rank dungeon, 
so I was the only one hurt.

83
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,670
Wasn't there a healer?

84
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,810
Everyone else was higher-ranked, so... 
they didn't think to bring a healer along.

85
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,420
Are you serious?!

86
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,580
They were only thinking of 
themselves! That's awful!

87
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,740
It's okay. It's my fault for being so weak.

88
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,330
You know how it is with me, Joohee.

89
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,210
I'm used to it.

90
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,250
Looks like we're heading in already.

91
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,250
Come on.

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,790
I'll be your humble leader 
for this raid outing.

93
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,920
The name's Song Chiyul.

94
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,970
It's a pleasure.

95
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,820
Yeah, that makes sense.

96
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,940
Mr. Song's got the most 
skills out of anyone here.

97
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,760
It's a relief to have him in charge.

98
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,500
Pleasure to be working with you, Mr. Song.

99
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,070
All right. Is everyone ready?

100
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,060
Let's head in.

101
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Hey, Sung.

102
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,890
Try and hang in there behind us, 
and don't get injured this time.

103
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,970
Right.

104
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,070
Let's give it our best.

105
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,480
<i>A knife with barely any magic power in it...</i>

106
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,090
<i>But it was all I could afford.</i>

107
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,540
<i>It's better than nothing, at least.</i>

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,040
Today, I'm gonna see this through!

109
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,660
Welcome back from your meeting, Chairman Go.

110
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,450
How'd things go with the administration?

111
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,740
The usual talking points.

112
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,650
Dungeon breaks are a problem,

113
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,030
but they still want the resources that 
can be collected from inside dungeons.

114
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Their demands make logical sense.

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,380
And we hunters make a living 
by selling those resources.

116
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,570
The stones collected from defeated beastsâ€”
these essence stones.

117
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,920
They're valuable.

118
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,350
I did it!

119
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,470
I finally got one.

120
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,590
Jinwoo!

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
Jinwoo!

122
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,710
Stay back, Joohee!

123
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,930
I'm heading to the next magic beast.

124
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,750
Joohee, look after Sung!

125
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,590
Right!

126
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,900
You're going to be okay! 
I promise I'll heal you!

127
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,530
The essence stones collected 
from high-ranked beasts

128
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,210
can be turned into powerful weapons 
and gear for fighting other beasts.

129
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,400
Mana crystals that can 
be collected from dungeons

130
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,010
have a similar application, 
but they're less potent.

131
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,950
But the government's 
interested in a different use.

132
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,400
As a new power source.

133
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,340
Safer than nuclear, more efficient 
than water, wind, or geothermal,

134
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,180
and one that doesn't pollute 
the atmosphere like fossil fuels.

135
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,630
The ideal clean energy source.

136
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,850
They're working on a way 
to generate electricity

137
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,360
using essence stones and mana crystals.

138
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,550
A rare fuel source that only 
hunters are able to collect...

139
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,830
Which is why the duty that rests on 
hunters' shoulders is such a great one.

140
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,360
All right!

141
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,770
Yes! We beat the dungeon boss!

142
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,900
That's Mr. Song for you!

143
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,790
We did it!

144
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,310
Jinwoo, you're not staying on as a hunter 
just because you're stubborn, right?

145
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,230
If you keep this up, it's only a matter of time 
until something much worse happens.

146
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,180
It's not just your midsection. 
You're hurt all over!

147
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,980
Sorry...

148
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't want an apology! 
I'm worried about you!

149
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,030
Have you all collected your loot yet?

150
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,550
As much as we could, at least.

151
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,370
There's not much in the way of 
mana crystals here, either.

152
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,130
We're not gonna earn much 
at all, at this rate.

153
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,820
<i>I guess it's over.</i>

154
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,220
<i>And all I have to show for it 
is an E-Rank essence stone.</i>

155
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,930
<i>Hardly worth almost dying for.</i>

156
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,270
Hey!

157
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,020
Take a look at this!

158
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,730
A cave?

159
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,960
Some kind of tunnel?

160
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,480
It seems to go pretty far.

161
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,840
A double dungeon, huh?

162
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,880
I'd heard rumors before, but...

163
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,860
We beat the dungeon boss, 
but there's no sign of it shutting down.

164
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,330
Yeah, I thought that was strange.

165
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
Which means...

166
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,290
Yeah, there's more loot 
to be found down here.

167
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,250
Listen up, everyone.

168
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,080
When encountering 
unexpected cases like this,

169
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,550
standard procedure is to wait 
for orders from the Hunter's Association.

170
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,620
Hang on a sec, Mr. Song...

171
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,220
Doesn't that mean that the new guys 
are gonna hog all the good stuff?

172
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,190
It's still part of a D-Rank dungeon. 
It should be fine, right?

173
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,190
He's got another kid on the way. 
And we didn't find many mana crystals.

174
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,460
It'd be okay to bend 
the rules a bit, wouldn't it?

175
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,730
Or no?

176
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,160
I understand how you feel. 
But the fact remains that it'd be a risk.

177
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,780
Let's take a vote.

178
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,080
I dunno...

179
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,090
I'm in!

180
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,420
I say no.

181
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,340
No.

182
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,680
Let's check it out.

183
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,440
Same.

184
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,190
Yeah.

185
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,750
I don't think so.

186
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,160
I say we go.

187
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,090
Likewise.

188
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,050
Sorry, but... I don't want to.

189
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,880
That makes six in favor, six against.

190
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,030
You're the only one left, Sung. 
What do you think?

191
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,970
I-I...

192
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,140
<i>Even a D-Rank dungeon is dangerous for me.</i>

193
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,990
<i>But... Now that Dad's gone missing,</i>

194
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,150
<i>I'm the only one who can 
provide for my family.</i>

195
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,070
<i>I need money for Mom's treatments... 
and to send my sister to college.</i>

196
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,530
<i>I need this money!</i>

197
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,690
Let's go.

198
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,020
Now, if you could touch the black 
crystal with one hand, please.

199
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Next, please.

200
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,580
You're a C-Rank?  
We'd love you to join our guild.

201
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,590
Here's the contract.

202
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,790
You can find the labor 
conditions detailed here...

203
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,200
Right. One B-Rank and two C-Ranks 
have agreed to sign.

204
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,110
Things are going smoothly so far, 
Guildmaster Choi.

205
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,660
That's wonderful to hear.

206
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,380
Age and gender aren't a factor. 
If they seem like an asset, make an offer.

207
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,340
Not that we're likely to find anyone 
who can compare to Cha Hae-in.

208
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,070
Someone! Catch them!

209
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,300
Out of the damn way!

210
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,260
Move! Or do you wanna get run over?!

211
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,500
E-Excuse me...

212
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,000
Here.

213
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,280
Thank you! Thank you so much!

214
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,280
That's Cha Hae-in!

215
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,340
Cha Hae-in!

216
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,470
The S-Rank hunter!

217
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,610
Oh, damn!

218
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,480
It's really her!

219
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
This is awesome!

220
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,390
I'm a huge fan!

221
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,190
E-Excuse me...

222
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,690
Can I shake your hand?

223
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,680
Look at her go!

224
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,020
That's an S-Rank hunter for you.

225
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,710
How long's it been since we entered the cave?

226
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,640
About 40 minutes.

227
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,560
The gate shouldn't close until an hour 
after the boss is beaten,

228
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,140
so we'll have 20 minutes to spare.

229
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,920
Um... I'm sorry.

230
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,500
About what?

231
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,630
It's because I voted the way I did 
that we're searching for the boss now.

232
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,960
You don't need to worry about me, so stop it.

233
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,710
Are you sure you're okay?

234
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,910
Of course...

235
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,540
I'm not!

236
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,300
Have you already forgotten?!

237
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,350
If that attack had hit just a little higher, 
you'd be dead right now, Jinwoo!

238
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,620
I was barely able to heal your arms 
and legs, too! This is insane!

239
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,190
Are you sure you didn't hit your head?! 
Because it seems like it!

240
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,690
Sorry...

241
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,160
<i>It's true that having a B-Rank healer like 
Joohee around has saved me more than once.</i>

242
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,710
Do you actually understand the problem here?

243
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,650
Yeah.

244
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,620
Well, in that case, maybe you should 
treat me to show your gratitude.

245
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,440
Or what? You don't like the thought 
of taking me out to eat?

246
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,550
Th-Th-That's not it at all!

247
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,560
We're here!

248
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,050
It's the boss chamber.

249
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,730
Rare to see an actual door on one of these.

250
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,380
It's kind of intimidating.

251
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,870
Well, I'm going in.

252
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,860
No way am I going back empty-handed now.

253
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,980
Same here. Let's do it.

254
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,550
The team moves onward together.

255
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,360
That was the call, right, Leader Song?

256
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,920
Yeah, you're right.

257
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,500
<i>To the newly awakened: I am the chairman 
of the Hunter's Association, Go Gunhee.</i>

258
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,070
<i>Among you there are bound to be those 
who choose to be hunters,</i>

259
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,460
<i>and those who decide not to.</i>

260
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,080
<i>It's been over ten years 
since the gates first appeared,</i>

261
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,030
<i>and yet there's still a great deal 
we don't know about the dungeons.</i>

262
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,430
<i>To become a hunter is to risk your life.</i>

263
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,460
<i>Even those who have grown accustomed to raids
cannot afford to let their guards down.</i>

264
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,320
<i>You must never grow arrogant, or careless.</i>

265
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,400
<i>If you want to survive, this advice 
will serve you above all else:</i>

266
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,860
<i>Please, be afraid.</i>

267
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,970
Hey, the place lit up.

268
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,350
Dig the atmosphere!

269
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,540
I've never seen a dungeon like this before.

270
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,670
What's with the statues?

271
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,680
They look so old.

272
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,460
And some have instruments.

273
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,690
This one's way bigger than the rest.

274
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,830
Damn, that's huge.

275
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,820
What it supposed to be?

276
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,400
There's something creepy about it.

277
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,500
Gotta say, I'm not seeing any beasts.

278
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,320
Good point.

279
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,150
Not a single one...

280
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,040
What is this? A magic circle?

281
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,750
Mr. Song! Something's written over here!

282
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,210
In the ancient script? Let's take a look...

283
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,590
"The Commandments of the Cartenon Temple."

284
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,260
"First, revere God."

285
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,590
"Second, praise God."

286
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,380
Jingwoo!

287
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,430
"Third, prove your faith to God."

288
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,800
That big statue... I saw its eyes move.

289
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,690
It's been watching us!

290
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,440
"Those who do not follow these laws..."

291
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,440
It can't be. You must have imagined it.

292
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,070
"...will not leave alive"?

293
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,240
Hey! The door just shut!

294
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,220
But why?!

295
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,060
Are we trapped in here now?

296
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
This is what I was worried about!

297
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,040
You guys didn't take this seriously, 
and now look!

298
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,950
We never should've come this way!

299
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm leaving!

300
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,510
You can have the treasure, 
or whatever else you find in here.

301
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,890
See ya!

302
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,800
Get away from there!

303
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,330
No!

304
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,160
Are you kidding me?

305
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,950
They moved!

306
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,130
Are we supposed to fight those things?!

307
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,200
<i>The guy who just died...</i>

308
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,370
<i>Was he D-Rank?</i>

309
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,020
<i>If nothing else, he was stronger 
than me and my E-Rank.</i>

310
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,010
<i>And he was just... in an instant...</i>

311
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,560
<i>This doesn't make sense! 
This is supposed to be a D-Rank dungeon!</i>

312
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,640
<i>There shouldn't be magic beasts 
like this down here!</i>

313
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,330
If these statues are moving... That means...

314
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,200
<i>I've stood on the precipice of death 
plenty of times before.</i>

315
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,250
<i>In my first raid ever, I got separated from 
everyone else, and ended up stranded.</i>

316
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,410
<i>I've been attacked by E-Rank beasts 
and spent weeks in a hospital afterward.</i>

317
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,890
<i>I almost starved to death 
in a labyrinth before, too.</i>

318
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,930
<i>No matter how low-ranked the dungeon was, 
I was always fighting for my life.</i>

319
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,020
<i>Most hunters are able to buy gear with the 
money they make from selling essence stones,</i>

320
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,310
<i>so they can beat even stronger beasts, 
and reap even bigger rewards.</i>

321
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,670
<i>But this cheap knife is the best I can afford.</i>

322
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,680
<i>If it breaks, I'll have to fight empty-handed.</i>

323
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,570
These shoes are done for, too.

324
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,800
<i>And so, day after day...</i>

325
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,530
<i>I've endured being mocked, 
and put up with a life-threatening job</i>

326
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,580
<i>where the risks outweigh the rewards.</i>

327
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,360
<i>But even then, in order to survive,</i>

328
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,050
<i>I've learned to keep my eyes open 
and look for opportunities.</i>

329
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,420
<i>That might be why I was able to tell...</i>

330
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,470
Everybody, get down!

331
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,820
What the hell?!

332
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Nobody mentioned this!

333
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,830
What is going on here?!

334
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,030
How should I know?!

335
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,180
You all right?

336
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,420
Yeah. How about you, Kim?

337
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm fine.

338
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,410
No more... No more!

339
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,370
<i>What is happening here?</i>

340
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,090
<i>How is this possible?</i>

341
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,050
<i>We're trapped. We're done for.</i>

342
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,510
<i>We're dead. Dead.</i>

343
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,470
<i>We're gonna die!</i>
