1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,460
This should be far enough
away from civilization,

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,130
considering I don't know
what's about to happen.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,080
A job-change quest...

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,540
That's the quest that showed up after
I passed level 40 from the last raid.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,000
I've run into two dungeons
accessible with key items before,

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,670
but the only quests I've been forced
to take on immediately

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,090
were the penalty and emergency ones.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,390
This one, however, seems to be optional,
and I've been given time to decide.

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,350
Should I assume that means it's going
to be that much more difficult?

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,650
The logical assumption is that this is an
important event that'll make me stronger

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,980
by earning skills best suited to my job...

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,890
Yes.

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,210
Oh, shoot, my daily quest...

14
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,100
I guess I can do it when I get back.

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,030
All right. Looks like
the real game starts here.

16
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,060
I wonder what's waiting for me inside?

17
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,440
Should be interesting.

18
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,830
I apologize for the delay.

19
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,840
No, you're right on time, Jinsung.

20
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,870
It's been a while, Jinho.

21
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,440
Brother...

22
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,150
The dungeon seems surprisingly normal so far.

23
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,570
I can't use potions or full recovery?

24
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,010
Or leave until the quest is finished.

25
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm gonna need to be pretty careful, then.

26
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,690
An armor-type beast?

27
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,500
That didn't work?

28
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,200
No good.

29
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,130
I've fought enemies...

30
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,480
with hard exteriors before!

31
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,670
I wasted a use of Fatal Strike...

32
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,870
and when I can't recover mana
or heal damage, too.

33
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,070
But...

34
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,970
It's not like they care, of course.

35
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,300
What is it, Jinho?

36
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,800
You've barely touched your food.

37
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh, nothing...

38
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,070
Jinsung, how are things going
with establishing the guild?

39
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,110
I've heard the S-Ranks you've been
making offers to have all declined.

40
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,930
It's true that Hunters Min Byung-gu
and Cha Hae-in turned me down,

41
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,230
but it won't be an issue.

42
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,760
I've got negotiations underway with
European and Middle Eastern hunters.

43
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,540
They're likely to sign
if we agree to their terms.

44
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,890
It'll be similar to the case
of Hunter Hwang Dongsoo.

45
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,910
You've got a point.

46
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,010
Hunters from overseas. Of course...

47
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,620
Jinho.

48
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,500
I know you've been working on
something of your own in secret.

49
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,630
Buying up the rights to all these
C-Rank raids at a high price,

50
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,140
trying to establish your credentials.

51
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,100
And that's fine, for a personal project, but...

52
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,310
Don't even think about getting in my way.

53
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,480
He doesn't know about the boss.

54
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,080
If he had any idea of the kind of power
I have on my side...!

55
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,280
I guess even I get tired
after this much combat.

56
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,380
Better catch my breathâ€”

57
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,860
The Stealth skill?!

58
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,090
I've gotta deal with beasts
that can use that, too?!

59
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,560
On top of that, there's a mage...

60
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
and one that uses light magic, at that.

61
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,180
The stealth skill and light magic...
What is going on here?

62
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,310
That armor reminded me of the Kasaka, too.
It's like I'm revisiting my past battles.

63
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,780
This quest is even tougher than I imagined!

64
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,920
The different kinds of beast
all have different weaknesses.

65
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,740
Knights require strength, assassins take
perception, archers need agility...

66
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,070
Without enough strength,
the knights won't take damage.

67
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,140
Without enough perception,
the assassins can't be detected.

68
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,200
And the real issue is the mages.

69
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,600
They probably need intellect as a counter,
but I haven't really invested in that stat.

70
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Which means I don't have much mana.

71
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,980
I need to conserve my skills...

72
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,360
but my fatigue is starting to build up.

73
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,510
I need to end this soon!

74
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,090
I see you're all here.

75
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,450
The time has finally come.

76
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,390
I'm just glad the beasts
drop stuff like this, too.

77
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,690
A High-Rank Knight's Chestplate?

78
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,990
Come to think of it, I haven't really
experimented with gear much.

79
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,760
It can turn invisible?!

80
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,930
I'm glad I don't have to stand out.

81
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,000
Looks like it doesn't restrict
my movement, either.

82
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,560
It's kind of hard to tell without being
fully restored, but my level has gone up.

83
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,560
I've got plenty of gold and items, too.

84
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,740
With my fatigue recovered,
I may as well move onto the next stage.

85
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,730
Now, then...

86
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,430
How bad is it gonna be
on the other side of this door?

87
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,700
But if I can't get out of here without
getting through, I just have to press on.

88
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,180
Something about that gust
just gave me the chills...

89
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,240
Some kind of throne room?

90
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,500
This sight, these sounds, the way it feels...

91
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,710
My entire body remembers.

92
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,360
This is pressure on the level of what
I felt during the double dungeon!

93
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,180
And all of that intensity
is coming from this guy!

94
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,230
"Knight Commander Igris the Bloodred."

95
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,750
Name's red, too...

96
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,860
He really is nothing like
the enemies I've fought so far!

97
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,810
A knight who defends an empty throne...

98
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,240
Here he comes!

99
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,800
He chops through pillars
like they're dry branches!

100
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,140
This is beyond just strong!

101
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,060
To be able to move this quickly,
in that heavy armor...

102
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,110
What a monster!

103
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,200
Still no good!

104
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,350
We're equals in terms of speed.

105
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,700
But he's much more powerful.

106
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,550
And because of that armor,
my dagger isn't doing anything.

107
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,830
Do I have any way of beating this guy?

108
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,570
He's even more dangerous than I thought.

109
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,200
Still...

110
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,660
I doubt I can win without a weapon,

111
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,000
but this is the only way I can think of
to deal any damage through that armor!

112
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,510
I guess you're being chivalrous, huh?

113
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,740
You must think this is gonna be easy.

114
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,560
Come in.

115
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,150
Chairman, you still haven't gone home?

116
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,800
I don't feel like calling it a day just yet.

117
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,850
So I've been dealing with
a bit of work that's piled up.

118
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,580
Likewise.

119
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,620
I've been clearing some
non-urgent items off my plate.

120
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,110
So it's finally happening.

121
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,080
Indeed.

122
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,360
Speak of the devil.

123
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,530
I'm here. Are you heading out soon?

124
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,290
Yes, sir.

125
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,520
I wanted to thank you before that.

126
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,010
I'm grateful you approved this operation.

127
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,760
No thanks necessary.

128
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,550
It's all because you've kept Jeju Island's
name afloat in the interviews

129
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,190
you've been doing on TV and in print.

130
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,280
That's kept it in the public's consciousness
and is swaying their opinion.

131
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,740
All I did was help tip the scales a bit.

132
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,370
You don't expect criticism
for kicking a hornet's nest?

133
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,450
I'm prepared to take the brunt of that.

134
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,430
Just be careful out there.

135
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,780
Jeju Island is dangerous business.

136
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,790
I'm fully aware, sir.

137
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,760
This expedition is about
assessing threat levels.

138
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,200
We'll prod the enemy and see how
and to what degree they respond.

139
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,010
As diligent as ever, I see.

140
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,410
The third raid on Jeju Island...

141
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,440
To me, that battle...

142
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,180
never really ended.

143
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,150
So fast!

144
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,880
Even though I blocked,
it felt like that took down 500 HP!

145
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,100
I made the right move putting armor on.

146
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,170
There's a chance taking it
full on would've killed me.

147
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,680
For him to deal this kind of damage
even without his sword...

148
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,260
He's too damn strong!

149
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,860
If I can't compete in terms of power,
then I'll boost my speed!

150
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,010
I can't catch him!

151
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,100
That passive skill boosted my defense!

152
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,030
That oughta do.

153
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,560
I...

154
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,290
haven't...

155
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,080
lost yet!

156
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,670
That dagger can't change owners like that!

157
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,420
It'll go back into my inventory,

158
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,440
and then back into my hand!

159
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,030
Too shallow!

160
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,230
Have to stab deeper!

161
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,350
I won... right?

162
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,440
That... was a close one.

163
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,360
My winning was pretty much a fluke.

164
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,880
In terms of skills, ability, and experience...

165
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,820
There was a real difference
between us on every level.

166
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,540
One screwup, and I'd probably be dead.

167
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,790
Four rewards, huh?

168
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,140
A pouch with 1,500,000 gold in it.

169
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,560
The same helmet that Igris had...
and it's an S-Rank item!

170
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,320
The key to the Demon's Castle
was S-Rank, too,

171
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,720
but I've never had gear
of that quality before.

172
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,930
It reduces physical damage by 15%,

173
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,760
along with a 20-point boost
to strength and vitality!

174
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,940
That's tasty!

175
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,400
Along with a rune stone
for the Ruler's Hand...

176
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,110
What kind of skill is that?
I guess I'll figure it out later.

177
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,740
But what about...

178
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,950
this "instant teleportation stone"?

179
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,920
It won't go into the inventory.

180
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,180
Why give me a teleportation stone now?

181
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,400
Is... Is the job-change quest...

182
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,470
not over yet?

183
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,080
"Survive as long as possible"?
"Enhancement points"?

184
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,860
And what is a "higher class"?

185
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,700
"Good luck," huh?

186
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,940
Wait, am I facing infinite
waves of enemies?!

187
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,580
If they were as strong as Igris,
I would've been overwhelmed in seconds...

188
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,480
But these guys?
I can handle them easily enough.

189
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,740
Still... There's an awful lot of them!

190
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,310
Damn it! I keep fighting, but the gates
keep puking up more!

191
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,780
I think the key to this quest
is how long you can last.

192
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,030
In that case...

193
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,570
Stealth costs 200 mana to activate,
and then one for each second of use...

194
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,370
I have 190 left.

195
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,460
I'll buy as much time as I can!

196
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,510
They saw through Stealth?!

197
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,830
This is worse than I thought!

198
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,440
I won't be able to use Stealth
or Murderous Intent anymore!

199
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,050
How long has it been?

200
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,490
Only five minutes?!

201
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,340
I can't keep going!

202
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,030
I hate to do it, but I'd better use
that teleportation stone...
