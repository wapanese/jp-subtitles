1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,940
You look like a different person, Jinwoo.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,170
When I haven't changed at all.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,510
Well, a lot has happened.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,100
And experience affects everyone differently.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,540
You're right.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,760
I think I might be too timid to be a hunter.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,710
I've tried to get over it,
but it never works out.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,400
I should really be participating in A and
B-Rank raids... or at least C-Rank.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,090
But I chose D and E-Rank ones on purpose.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,360
That's how I met you, and found myself
healing you time and time again.

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,070
At first, it was a little annoying
how often you got injured...

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,250
But you always managed to survive.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,170
I'll never forget the way that your eyes
always seemed to radiate vitality.

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,360
We promised to go out to eat somewhere, right?

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,670
You can have this back.

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,630
Wait...

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,100
I'm going to retire.

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,730
I'm moving back in with my parents.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,650
If you ever find yourself in the area,
let me know, okay?

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,150
I can show you around.

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,940
I'll invite you out again, if that happens.

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,140
Right.

23
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,420
I don't believe an E-Rank like yourself
could defeat a B-Rank like Kang Taeshik.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,670
You've already been examined
for a potential reawakening, after all.

25
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,970
But I feel I should warn you anyway...

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,430
If you want to live a long life,
be careful out there.

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,940
What do you mean?

28
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,720
After the incident where Hwang Dongsuk's
strike team was wiped out,

29
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,860
with you and the D-Rank hunter
as the only survivors...

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,240
Hwang Dongsuk's younger brother,
Hwang Dongsoo, may be targeting you both.

31
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,870
Hwang Dongsoo, the S-Rank hunter, is after me?

32
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,490
Correct. It doesn't matter
what actually happened in there.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,530
All he cares about is that Hwang Dongsuk
died, while you managed to survive.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
The law is powerless to deal with S-Ranks.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,340
They have the potential to bring forth
either miracle or calamity.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,670
In other words, one of the monsters that
even monsters fear is out for your blood.

37
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,990
If possible, I'd recommend taking
your family and leaving the country.

38
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,240
That's one more reason I need to get stronger.

39
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,810
Because if I don't...

40
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,640
I won't be able to survive.

41
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,680
Uh, Jinho? What am I looking at here?

42
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,170
What do you mean? It's obvious!

43
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,690
This is our strike team!

44
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,710
I prioritized people who are qualified to be
hunters but have reasons they can't work

45
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,240
and people who are having trouble getting by
when making my selections.

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,730
You've got injured people... and drunks.

47
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,890
That works better for us, right?

48
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,300
We need a minimum of eight people
to raid C-Rank gates, after all.

49
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,940
Hey, you've got a kid here, too.

50
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,110
As long as they've awakened,
there's no legal issue with recruiting minors.

51
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,120
Hey.

52
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,850
That's kind of rude.

53
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,310
I am a qualified hunter, y'know.

54
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,090
But you're in high school, right?

55
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,750
Do you have any raiding experience?

56
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,780
N-No.

57
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,270
What rank? E?

58
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,270
So what if I am?

59
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,760
I guess it doesn't matter.

60
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,030
You'll be waiting out here anyway.

61
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Jinho and I will be the only ones
going into the dungeon.

62
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,400
Hey... Is it seriously going
to be just the two of you?

63
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,620
And does this job really pay three million
just for waiting outside?

64
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,910
Right. Three million per raid.

65
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,460
Pretty sweet deal, considering
you don't have to fight, right?

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,050
The only stipulation
is that you can't talk about it.

67
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,530
If you publicize our deal,
the contract specifies

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,260
you'll have to pay back ten times that amount.

69
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,650
The Stealth rune stone that
I got by beating Kang Taeshik...

70
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,430
Might as well use it now.

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,320
Okay. Looks like it worked.

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm ready to go.

73
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,790
What are you wearing now?

74
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,590
A full set of buff-boosting armor
made by an Italian manufacturer!

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,250
If we're gonna hit the dungeon together, boss,

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,820
I need to be at least this ready!

77
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,550
I'm not trying to be mean here,
but take that stuff off.

78
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay...

79
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,520
Boss, can you help me get up?

80
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,820
All right. Let's get going.

81
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,320
This is kind of nerve-racking.

82
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,180
You've, uh, still got something on your head.

83
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,300
At least let me keep the helmet!

84
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,580
Fine, fine. Let's go.

85
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,350
Right!

86
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,430
They're seriously going in alone.
Is this gonna be all right?

87
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,840
We did warn them. And the contract's been
paid out already, so what's it matter?

88
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,190
A D and an E-Rank taking on
a C-Rank raid by themselves?

89
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,850
Those two greenhorns don't have
a damn clue what they're getting into.

90
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,270
Is Song-yi skipping today?

91
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,160
How long's it been?

92
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,060
About an hour. Even a normal strike team
would take at least two hours,

93
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,200
so we've got a while—

94
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,420
So they ran away. They're lucky to be alive.

95
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,750
N-No! They didn't run away!

96
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,980
The gate's starting to close!

97
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,680
Are you kidding me? They beat the boss?!

98
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,620
Where's the next gate?

99
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,640
About an hour from here.

100
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,770
Got it. Let's hurry on.

101
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,240
We're moving, everyone!
The goal is to hit three locations today.

102
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,360
That means you could potentially earn nine
million in one day. Are you coming or not?

103
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,510
These guys...

104
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,730
Who the hell are they?!

105
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,090
Boss! I'm done mining!

106
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,290
Got it!

107
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,210
I better wrap up here, too.

108
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,340
I'm heading out.

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,650
Huh? More work today?

110
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,050
Yep. Don't forget to lock up.

111
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,080
He was hiding a skill like that?

112
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,550
Boss has gotten stronger again...

113
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,260
This Stealth skill...

114
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,470
It wasn't fun to earn, but it's useful.

115
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,660
Fighting while unseen is really effective.

116
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,800
My Dash skill leveled up, too.

117
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,740
And my new skills, Advanced Dagger Wielding
and Fatal Strike...

118
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,450
They seem pretty useful!

119
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,430
Great work!

120
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,420
Once I'm finished grabbing this stuff,
we'll be done, so you can take it easy.

121
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,470
Right. Thanks.

122
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,360
I've got some handy new skills.

123
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,670
But I don't have enough mana
to use them for very long.

124
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,890
I'll need to work on my
intellect ability going forward.

125
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,930
Things are moving smoothly,
so do I head to the Demon Castle next?

126
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,470
No. Right now, I'd say I'm somewhere
between B and A-Rank.

127
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,840
Would I really be able
to take that dungeon on?

128
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,790
"The Player has reached the required level"?

129
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,350
A job-change quest?

130
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,660
Take a look at this, Manager Ahn!

131
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,630
What is it, Kichul?

132
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,760
Well, it's about the C-Rank gates...

133
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,590
One hundred and fifty million?!

134
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,080
Someone's spending 150 million
on the rights to C-Rank gates?

135
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,580
Right. There's a strike team
that's been spending

136
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,860
nearly double the market rate
on C-Rank gates...

137
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,470
And the leader is... Yoo Jinho?
Never heard of him.

138
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,770
He's the younger son of Yoojin
Construction's president.

139
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,490
Yoojin Construction?

140
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,700
This could put them in the red over time...

141
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,250
Seems excessive for a rich kid playing hunter.

142
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,460
Sung Jinwoo... E-Rank?

143
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,870
Yes, sir. Their whole lineup
seems thrown together.

144
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,690
I have no idea what the plan is.

145
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,940
Hang on. I remember seeing
this "Sung Jinwoo" name

146
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,030
connected to the double dungeon incident...

147
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,770
There's something here. I can smell it.

148
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,820
Sorry we're late!

149
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,720
Nah, it's fine.

150
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,900
You're ahead of schedule, even!

151
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,420
Collecting the mana crystals
took longer than I thought.

152
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,120
Okay, let's get going.

153
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,550
You've gotta be exhausted.
You want me to drive?

154
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,830
I've had nothing to do all day, so I'm
honestly kinda bored. Would that be okay?

155
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,910
Oh, I see.

156
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,550
What is it?
Oh, I see.

157
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,090
What is it?

158
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:13,660
But the contract says you don't need
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

159
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,800
Nothing.
But the contract says you don't need
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

160
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,260
But the contract says you don't need
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

161
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,720
You think this Sung Jinwoo
hunter has reawakened?!

162
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,530
I sure do.

163
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,010
Based on what?

164
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,270
Hunter Sung has been through three
major disasters and survived every time.

165
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,020
First, the double dungeon.

166
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,030
Second, the wiping out of
Hwang Dongsuk's strike team.

167
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,450
And third, Kang Taeshik's murder spree.

168
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,070
Every time, there was a large body count,
but every time, he was among the survivors.

169
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,140
The only explanation is that he reawakened.

170
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,620
I guess you're right...

171
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,050
So where are you headed, Manager Ahn?

172
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,510
Isn't it obvious?

173
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,500
I'm off to scout a promising rookie.

174
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,250
What is this, a picnic?

175
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,740
Mister.

176
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,400
This area's off-limits, y'know?

177
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,340
Ah, you'll have to forgive us!

178
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,110
We saw a bunch of hunters and got curious.

179
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,870
That's a gate, right?
Is it safe for you to be so close?

180
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,830
Don't treat me like a child. I'm a hunter.

181
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,040
Then are you part of this strike team?

182
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,850
Yes.

183
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,070
But...

184
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,200
Hunter Sung! He must've left his group
behind to tackle the dungeon himself!

185
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,670
If my gut's right about this, he could be
a huge find! Even bigger than that!

186
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,150
I see. Well, sorry for disturbing you.

187
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,080
You be careful, now.

188
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,190
Wait, are we leaving already, Manager?!

189
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,110
The captain's back!
Everybody get ready to head out!

190
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,050
What's the schedule looking like for tomorrow?

191
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,080
I remembered I have something
to do. Can I get the day off?

192
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
For tomorrow?

193
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,650
I had reserved some gates...
You want me to cancel them?

194
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,260
Let's not go that far.
It seems like a waste of money.

195
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,970
I can hold onto them for another two days.

196
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,180
Let's delay them for now, then.

197
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,830
You got it!

198
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,890
Sorry about the wait, everyone!
Off to the next one we go!

199
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,780
The same dream... again.

200
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,500
It's almost time.

201
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,070
Good work today!

202
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,250
I apologize if this is sudden. Hunter Sung...

203
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,530
It's nice to meet you.

204
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,710
I'm Ahn Sangmin, manager of the White
Tiger Guild's Second Administration Team.

205
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,620
Could I trouble you
for a moment of your time?

206
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm sure you already know this,

207
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,040
but the White Tiger Guild
is one of the country's best.

208
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,660
However, we're always on the lookout
for promising new talent.

209
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,080
And to get directly to the point,

210
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,070
if you'll join us, I'm willing to pay you
double what Yoojin Construction is offering.

211
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,660
If you have any additional conditions,
I'd be happy to arrange those, as well.

212
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,190
How about that?!

213
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,200
This is too good an offer for someone
who was E-Rank just a while ago!

214
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,820
He's bound to say yes!

215
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,290
How much is the White
Tiger Guild's HQ valued at?

216
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,710
Huh?

217
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,380
Well, uh, I'd say somewhere
around fifty billion...

218
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,470
And that's what you're offering me?

219
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,680
I... I don't follow.

220
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,730
Th-Thirty billion?!

221
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,690
Did you hear that?

222
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,900
That's the market value of the building
that Yoojin Construction has offered me.

223
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,540
You offered to double that, so I was thinking
a building worth fifty billion would do.

224
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,660
I've got the documentation here,
if you don't believe it.

225
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,880
I, er, I must admit,

226
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,160
an offer like that isn't something
I'd be qualified to make on my own...

227
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,090
I'd need to talk to my superiors—

228
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,700
I think we're done here, then.

229
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,480
I was too desperate.

230
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
I should've dug into his deal
with Yoojin Construction first!

231
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,080
I am curious, though.
Who did you hear about me from?

232
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,130
You haven't been snooping around, have you?

233
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,000
H-Huh?!

234
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,050
That... That was the Stealth skill!

235
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,920
A reawakened with Stealth?!

236
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,180
That'd explain the size of the offer
Yoojin Construction made!

237
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,040
I-I do apologize for looking you up
without any word.

238
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,760
But I meant no harm—

239
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,010
Don't turn around.

240
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,540
The tight dungeon market has led
to a delay in rookie training,

241
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,480
without which they can't be sent
on raids as per Guild policy.

242
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,050
I was investigating who was
buying up so many gates

243
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,990
when I came across your name, Hunter Sung.

244
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,910
Who else knows about me?

245
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,110
Just me and one of my subordinates.

246
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,850
I'd rather keep a low profile.

247
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,780
If people start hearing about me, Mr. Ahn,
you two will be the first people I suspect.

248
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,590
I'm obligated to make a formal report
to the head of my guild...

249
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,700
but I don't want to die. I'll make sure
my subordinate keeps his mouth shut, too.

250
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,220
I appreciate that.

251
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,170
I guess monopolizing the C-Rank gates
has been causing some trouble.

252
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,270
I'm sorry, but we'll need to continue
doing so for a while longer.

253
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,200
That is a shame. It puts a real
bottleneck on our developing hunters.

254
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,460
How about a deal, then?

255
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,990
A d-deal?

256
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,450
I'm willing to sell you the rights
to three of our C-Rank gates.

257
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,780
If you pass on this, you may
as well consider your guild

258
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,710
locked out of C-Ranks
for the foreseeable future.

259
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,450
He giving me the hard sell.

260
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,550
But...

261
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,180
Understood. For how much?

262
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,500
Three hundred million apiece.

263
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,260
Three... Three hundred million?!

264
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,230
The mana crystals and essence stones
are only worth 200 million on a good day!

265
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,860
Could you at least lower the price to two—

266
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,810
All right.

267
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,760
Consider it a deal.

268
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,380
Th-Then we'll be taking three off your hands...

269
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,120
Right. Three C-Rank gates,
for a total of 600 million.

270
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,500
A-All right, then.

271
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Transfer the money here by the end of the day.

272
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,250
One other thing. You can have this.

273
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,660
Close your eyes and open your mouth, please.

274
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,180
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

275
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,480
No way! The cut is gone!

276
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,730
Good evening.

277
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:21,000
If you're willing to show me all this,
can I take it as a sign that you trust me?

278
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,100
As long as you keep your mouth shut, yes.

279
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,830
M-Manager!

280
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,810
How'd it go? The scouting.

281
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,050
Well, Kichul...

282
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,360
I think he might be a bigger deal
than I had even imagined.

283
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,980
Boss, I confirmed the transfer.
The six hundred mill is really there.

284
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,650
We were about to cancel these gates...
How'd you sell them at such a crazy price?

285
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,830
And to whom?

286
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,820
Let's call it a trade secret.

287
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,620
What do you mean there are extra
C-Rank gates in our jurisdiction?!

288
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,650
Just that!

289
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,870
The three we bought were the only ones
that Yoojin Construction had purchased!

290
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,070
And the rest are all selling
for 70 million or less!

291
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,580
He tricked you!

292
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,660
Y-Yeah...

293
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Not only did I fail at scouting him,
but he scammed me, too!

294
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,300
What a nightmare!

295
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,760
I guess if you're strong enough,
you become bold enough to do anything?!

296
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,720
A message? But from who?

297
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,950
This is Sung Jinwoo.

298
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,460
With this, we're even. I'll forget
the fact that you spied on me.

299
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,360
Okay. So that's how it is.

300
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,860
That's one in his favor.

301
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
This guy sure isn't to be messed with.

302
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,520
Was that from Hunter Sung?

303
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,590
Yeah.

304
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,780
He might have raked me over the coals,
but I've got Hunter Sung's contact info.

305
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll be satisfied with that for now.

306
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,010
A job-change quest, huh?

307
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,280
Should be interesting.
