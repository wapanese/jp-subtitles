1
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,660
There we go...

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,190
Make sure you listen to your uncle.

3
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,360
Yeah.

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,240
Do you have your handkerchief? Your ticket?

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,360
A nice pair of shoes?

6
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,780
Wait, don't tell me that's everything?

7
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,040
It's fine. I made sure I packed the black ones.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,670
Make sure you don't forget your luggage on the bullet train, okay?

9
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,800
Don't zone out and miss your stop.

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,300
Yeah, I got it!

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,150
Jeez. I've been going there every year, so I'll be all right.

12
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,630
Hey, put on a hat. You'll get heat stroke.

13
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,060
It's alright! I'm fine.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,900
See you!

15
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,220
<i>The first time I met him</i>

16
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,560
<i>was when I was six.</i>

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,900
To the Forest of Firefly Lights

18
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,950
<i>On a hot summer day,</i>

19
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,260
<i>I got lost in the forest of the mountain god,</i>

20
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,990
<i>which was said to be where spirits lived.</i>

21
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,550
<i>After running around searching for an exit</i>

22
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,620
<i>I became so tired I couldn't move.</i>

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,140
<i>When I started crying from fear and loneliness,</i>

24
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,440
<i>he appeared before me.</i>

25
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,800
Hey! Shorty!

26
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,530
Why are you crying?

27
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,660
It's a person! I'm saved!

28
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,180
S-Sorry.

29
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,390
You're a human child, right?

30
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,860
If a human touches me, I'll disappear.

31
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,390
If a human...?

32
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,210
You're not a human?

33
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,170
I'm... something that lives in this forest.

34
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,590
What? Then... you're one of the spirits?

35
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,420
But... what do you mean by disappear?

36
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,440
Y-You're really not human after all...

37
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,570
No human would hit a child like that!

38
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,130
To disappear means to be obliterated.

39
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,790
That's the spell that the mountain god placed upon me.

40
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,440
If I get touched by a human,

41
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,260
that's the end.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,050
I-I'm sorry.

43
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,660
Here, shorty.

44
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,190
Grab the other end.

45
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,340
You're lost, aren't you?

46
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,460
I'll lead you out of the forest.

47
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,320
Thank you!

48
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,030
Didn't I just tell you?

49
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,080
Sorry, I just...

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,450
It's just like going on a date!

51
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,990
Not a very romantic one...

52
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,990
You... aren't afraid.

53
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,620
Of what?

54
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,670
Never mind.

55
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,400
If you go straight, you'll hit the mountain path.

56
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,420
Bye.

57
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,240
Are you always going to be here?

58
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,090
If I come back here, can we meet again?

59
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,870
This is the forest where the mountain god and spirits live.

60
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,970
Set foot within, and you'll lose your way and be lost forever.

61
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,940
You shouldn't come here.

62
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,110
That's what the villagers say, right?

63
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm Takegawa Hotaru.

64
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,110
You?

65
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,700
Anyway, I'll be back tomorrow with a thank-you present!

66
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,510
Bye!

67
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,640
It's Gin.

68
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,530
Hotaru!

69
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,320
Ah, Uncle!

70
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,010
Hotaru, you idiot!

71
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,850
If you go into the forest on your own and get hurt, what are you gonna do?

72
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,640
Uncle.

73
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,620
Huh?

74
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,100
Is it true that there are spirits living in that forest?

75
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,950
Oh, the mountain god's forest... Who knows.

76
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,780
That's what they say.

77
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,840
When I was little, I wanted to meet the spirits, so my friends and I often went into the forest.

78
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:05,350
In the end, I never met any, but I had the feeling I'd occasionally spot something from the corner of my eye.

79
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,410
On summer nights, you could hear the sounds of the river coming from the forest.

80
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:18,020
And now that I think about it, Iwa said she and her friends went and had fun at a summer festival in the forest.

81
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,830
But there's no way the villagers would've held a festival in the forest.

82
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,950
So then, whose festival could it have been?

83
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,490
It started this crazy story that they must've snuck into a festival for the spirits.

84
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Man, that takes me back!

85
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,500
We were so stupid back when we were kids.

86
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,060
<i>This is the forest where the mountain god and spirits live.</i>

87
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,530
<i>Set foot within, and you'll lose your way and be lost forever.</i>

88
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,560
You came.

89
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,380
I didn't think you'd really come back.

90
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,250
You...

91
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,570
You waited for me!

92
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,470
You just don't learn, do you?

93
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,210
I was so happy, I just...

94
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,390
Sorry.

95
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,790
It's a bit hot here.

96
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,090
Shall we go somewhere cooler?

97
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,080
What?

98
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,180
Don't worry.

99
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,090
I'll see you out of here again.

100
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,470
Gin.

101
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,730
Is that a human child?

102
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,240
Can I eat it?

103
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,950
No.

104
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,740
She's my friend.

105
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,600
Is that so?

106
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,630
Human child.

107
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,020
Please don't touch Gin's skin.

108
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,260
If you do, I'll eat you!

109
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,530
Oh! Is that a fox?

110
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,520
He's another one of the spirits.

111
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,450
He transforms to scare people, but he's all bark and no bite.

112
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,000
Amazing!

113
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,030
This is the first time I've seen a real spirit!

114
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,460
So they really do exist!

115
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,020
Amazing! Incredible! Fantastic!

116
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,020
So what did you think I was?

117
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,540
Gin, are you a No-Face or something?

118
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,280
Why do you wear a mask?

119
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,750
No particular reason.

120
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,850
Never mind me.

121
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,800
Tell me about yourself.

122
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,800
Are you curious?

123
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,810
That's why I waited for you.

124
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,700
<i>The next day and the day after that, I went back to the forest.</i>

125
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,070
<i>Those summer days, I ran and played all around the mountain.</i>

126
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,420
Over here, over here!

127
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,490
It's better over there.

128
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,340
There.

129
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,330
Thank you!

130
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,380
<i>Even though it was silly,</i>

131
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,110
<i>it was so much fun.</i>

132
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,130
Did Gin fall asleep?

133
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,310
<i>It's fine if I touch his mask, right?</i>

134
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
Ah, sorry!

135
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Ouch!

136
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,120
Attacking someone while they're asleep... You sure are a scary little lady.

137
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,500
I'm sorry, but

138
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,300
you were pretending to sleep, weren't you?

139
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,090
I looked normal, didn't I?

140
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,570
Why are you wearing that mask?

141
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,390
If I don't wear this mask,

142
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,790
I don't look like a spirit, do I?

143
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,880
You're weird.

144
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,670
Um, Gin.

145
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,280
I won't be able

146
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,960
to come here tomorrow.

147
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,880
I told you about it before, right?

148
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,520
That I'm just staying at my uncle's place for the summer?

149
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,760
So I have to go home tomorrow.

150
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,440
Will you be able to come again next year?

151
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,450
Yeah!

152
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,440
<i>This is how summer</i>

153
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,420
<i>became something I looked forward to.</i>

154
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,470
<i>Gin waited for our promised summer.</i>

155
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,820
It's cold!

156
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,240
You're weird.

157
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,520
Of course the water is cold.

158
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,790
Gin!

159
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,120
Gin!

160
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,810
It's dangerous, Gin.

161
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,090
That's a human child.

162
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,960
If she touches you, you'll disappear.

163
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Thank you.

164
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,220
I'm fine.

165
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,110
Please don't touch him, human child.

166
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,370
Yes.

167
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,730
Gin.

168
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,160
Be careful.

169
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,430
The spirits can touch him, right?

170
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,670
<i>Two summers passed. Then three. </i><i></i>

171
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,120
Hotaru!

172
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,530
Where are you?

173
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,220
Hotaru.

174
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,560
Hota—

175
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,650
What're you doing?

176
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,700
I wanted to see your startled face, but...

177
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,220
At least when I'm around,

178
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,360
can you take off your mask every once in a while?

179
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,210
That's fine,

180
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,460
but is there a reason?

181
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,560
Not really, but—

182
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,470
Watch out, Hota—

183
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,310
That was close.

184
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,490
Yeah...

185
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,970
I'm sorry, Hotaru.

186
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,800
Are you okay?

187
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,780
Thank goodness.

188
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,770
Hey, Gin.

189
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,510
No matter what, don't ever touch me, okay?

190
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,600
Okay?

191
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,170
No matter what!

192
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,000
<i>The next summer and the summer after that</i>

193
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,280
<i>I visited the forest.</i>

194
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm leaving!

195
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,510
Gin! I'm here again this year.

196
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,890
Ta-da!

197
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
I've become a fifth grader.

198
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,250
Somehow,

199
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,820
you're starting to look like a woman.

200
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,320
I <i>am</i> a woman.

201
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,360
Shall we go?

202
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,350
Yeah.

203
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,040
<i>Huh?</i>

204
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,580
<i>This is...</i>

205
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,430
Oh.

206
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,830
Huh?

207
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,260
Nothing.

208
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,700
Even though I'm in middle school now,

209
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,820
a lot of my elementary school friends are in the same classes, so it doesn't really feel like anything changed.

210
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,580
<i>Our ages are gradually getting closer.</i>

211
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,430
But rather than that...

212
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,660
<i>Somehow,</i>

213
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,610
<i>Gin ages much more slowly than humans.</i>

214
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,170
Like this?

215
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,460
Yeah, yeah. When I start running, let go, okay?

216
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,390
Here I go!

217
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,010
<i>As the years go by, my appearance changes,</i>

218
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,260
<i>but Gin is almost the same as the day we met.</i>

219
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,420
<i>Someday I'll be older than Gin, won't I?</i>

220
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,420
Oh, Hotaru.

221
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,330
I cut some watermelon. Let's eat.

222
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,890
Okay. Yay!

223
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,600
Where's Mom?

224
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,520
Out shopping with your aunt.

225
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,460
They went to buy gifts for friends in Yokohama.

226
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,410
What time are you taking the bullet train tomorrow?

227
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,520
I don't know,

228
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,260
but they said I'll still be here until the afternoon.

229
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,340
Is that so?

230
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,990
This summer's weather was good, so the watermelons are sweet.

231
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,400
If it continues like this, then winter will be freezing.

232
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,750
Is it like that?

233
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,700
It's like that.

234
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,990
Since this area's located between mountains and the ocean's far away,

235
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,910
the temperature difference between summer and winter is huge.

236
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,000
The cold of a winter that follows an especially hot summer

237
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,280
could probably freeze the mountain god himself.

238
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,780
Um, Uncle...

239
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,780
A scarf?

240
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,020
Yep!

241
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,040
Please use it in the winter, okay?

242
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,500
Bye!

243
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,900
Okay.

244
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,950
See you next year!

245
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,760
Takegawa?

246
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,750
Shouldn't you be heading to your next class soon?

247
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,070
Ah, you're right!

248
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,660
Everyone left already.

249
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,210
I'll see you later.

250
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,940
Okay! Thanks.

251
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,860
Thank you for the food.

252
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,430
What?

253
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,180
You're done?

254
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,650
Ah, you probably ate before dinner, didn't you?

255
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,400
If you snack, you'll gain weight.

256
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,020
I didn't eat anything!

257
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,890
Jeez. I'm gonna take a bath!

258
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,210
Takegawa.

259
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,350
Ta-ke-ga-wa.

260
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,490
Oh, good morning.

261
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,530
Good morning.

262
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,520
There, near your feet. It's frozen.

263
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,430
You'll slip. It's dangerous.

264
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,030
Thank you.

265
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,120
It's cold today.

266
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,810
Haven't you been a little out of it lately?

267
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,330
Actually, you've always been that way, but...

268
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,030
<i>I want to</i>

269
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,390
<i>see Gin.</i>

270
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,830
<i>I want to</i>

271
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,330
<i>touch Gin.</i>

272
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,580
Is that your new uniform?

273
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,750
Yeah.

274
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,010
Time really flies, doesn't it?

275
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,490
You're already in high school, huh.

276
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,470
Yup.

277
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,610
You don't come running at me anymore these days.

278
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,880
I learned my lesson after all those beatings.

279
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,930
I'm looking forward to it.

280
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,640
In three years, when I graduate, I plan on looking for a job here.

281
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,710
Then I can be with you more.

282
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,050
In autumn,

283
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,960
winter,

284
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,080
spring...

285
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,160
Always.

286
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,660
Right?

287
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Hotaru.

288
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,890
Let me tell you about myself.

289
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,430
I'm not a spirit.

290
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,250
But,

291
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,990
I'm no longer human.

292
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,170
It seems like I was once a human,

293
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,790
but when I was a baby,

294
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,730
I was abandoned in this forest.

295
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,800
I'd only just been abandoned, so I cried helplessly

296
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,440
as if to call back the parents who left me.

297
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,680
They say I didn't stop crying for a long time.

298
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,990
I should've died then,

299
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,760
but the mountain god appeared and cast a spell that allowed me to continue living.

300
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,310
So that I never move on.

301
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,740
I'm like a ghost.

302
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,300
Hotaru.

303
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,140
It's okay if you forget about me.

304
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,120
A body that's maintained by magic is very weak.

305
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,380
If it touches a real human body,

306
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,740
the spell will break and the body will disappear.

307
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,710
It's such a fragile thing.

308
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,680
How long can you—

309
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Something that disappears when touched...

310
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,990
It's just like snow, isn't it?

311
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,730
Gin,

312
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,190
I thought of you during winter.

313
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,090
Even during autumn

314
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,190
and spring.

315
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,350
Gin,

316
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,500
don't forget about me.

317
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,160
Don't forget.

318
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,070
Time might separate us some day.

319
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,510
But,

320
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,510
even still,

321
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,520
until then,

322
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,820
let's stay together.

323
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,530
Spirit festival?

324
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,850
No, a summer festival held by the spirits.

325
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,520
There's not much of a difference.

326
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,530
The nuance is completely different!

327
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,220
Nuance?

328
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,040
When you were little, I thought you might get scared, so I didn't invite you.

329
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,030
But tonight, can you sneak out of your house?

330
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,850
I've wanted to go with you for a long time.

331
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,920
I-I want to go!

332
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,710
Meet me at eight at our usual place.

333
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,850
But a festival filled with spirits sounds a little unnerving...

334
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,900
On top of that, it's at night.

335
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,740
Don't worry.

336
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,330
On the outside, it's not very different from a human festival.

337
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,570
It's supposed to mimic human festivals, after all.

338
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,760
And I'll protect you, Hotaru.

339
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,030
When you say things that, it makes me want to glomp you.

340
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,990
Do it.

341
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,300
Seriously.

342
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,350
Wait! Wait!

343
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,370
It's true. It's just like a human festival.

344
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,760
Are they all disguised as humans?

345
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,900
That's right. Impressive, isn't it?

346
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,520
I've heard that sometimes even humans unknowingly mix in.

347
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,890
Like Iwa and her friends, huh?

348
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,700
Who?

349
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,680
Hotaru.

350
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,050
Tie this around your wrist.

351
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,470
You'll get lost.

352
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,420
It's just like going on a date!

353
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,020
This <i>is</i> a date.

354
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,750
Shall we go?

355
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,860
Yeah.

356
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,230
Here you go.

357
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,420
Weird.

358
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,810
Ew, a couple!

359
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,210
Hey!

360
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,430
Look! That kid has a tail!

361
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,420
I-I'm sorry!

362
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,860
Wow, that was so weird!

363
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,170
Everyone went all out with their disguises, didn't they?

364
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,250
It was like a mimicking competition!

365
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,670
Is it like this every year?

366
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,340
Yeah, every time summer comes around...

367
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,440
Hotaru,

368
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,590
I can no longer wait for summer to come around.

369
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,590
When I'm away from you, even though I can't be around crowds, I want to go see you.

370
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,700
That mask...

371
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,400
Have it.

372
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:02,640
<i>He probably won't come to that place next summer.</i>

373
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,390
<i>This is definitely our last...</i>

374
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,070
Wait!

375
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,890
Watch out!

376
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,650
Are you okay?

377
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,620
Yeah. Thank you!

378
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,750
Be careful, okay?

379
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,290
Gin?

380
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,750
Was that boy a human?

381
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,220
Gin!

382
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,660
Come here, Hotaru!

383
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,110
I can finally touch you.

384
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,020
I love you.

385
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,470
Yeah.

386
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,950
I love you, too.

387
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,610
<i>Deep green.</i>

388
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,680
<i>This is the mountain god's forest.</i>

389
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,830
Hotaru. Thank you.

390
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,070
We wanted to be with Gin forever, but...

391
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,310
Gin wanted to touch a human.

392
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,720
He finally got to be hugged by a human.

393
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,890
<i>I probably won't be able to</i>

394
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,820
<i>look forward to summer for a long time.</i>

395
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,980
<i>My chest will hurt.</i>

396
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,230
<i>My tears will be overflowing.</i>

397
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,980
<i>But this warmth in my hands and these summer memories will live on in my heart.</i>

398
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,440
<i>So, let's go.</i>

399
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,500
<i>Let us go.</i>

400
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:03,380
The cicadas laugh out in song

401
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,020
to the red evening sunset

402
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,260
The way back home is long

403
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:24,410
but I promised to come here again tomorrow

404
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:40,440
The summer is in full bloom

405
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:54,580
making you look more beautiful than ever

406
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,750
I thought the tale would never end

407
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:22,550
but I realize now that something comes after

408
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:30,100
The crows too took flight

409
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:38,050
and went somewhere far, far away

410
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:54,270
The summer flies by

411
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:08,740
to hide away its treasures till next year

412
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:03,090
I'll never ever forget

413
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:10,570
those golden summer days

414
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:18,120
That summer which brought joy

415
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:25,700
to my boring everyday life

416
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:44,490
And look! Summer is here again

417
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:57,600
to help me keep my promise of that day

418
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:11,580
The summer is still in bloom

419
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:25,410
making you look more beautiful than ever
