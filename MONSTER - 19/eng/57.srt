1
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,190
Shoot me.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,830
So, are you ready?

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,030
There's no need to be nervous.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,950
Your headband is crooked.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,460
I'll fix it for you.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,240
Smile.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,450
There you go. You're so cute.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,900
Now, let's hold hands.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,860
Shall we go?

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,610
The other day, Mr. Liebert, who emigrated
from East to West Germany...

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,760
appeared before the media with his wife and children.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,750
The Lieberts showed no signs of exhaustion...

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,780
and they, along with their fraternal
twins, a son and a daughter...

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,820
smiled brightly at the cameras.

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,810
Mr. Liebert, any opinions about the West?

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,750
Well, it's difficult to say.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,560
It's just... now that I can freely express myself...

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,150
I can't find the words to describe it.

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,520
Oh, I see.

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,970
For now, the answer to that question...

21
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,160
lies in the smiles of my wife and children.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,980
It seems that your children are
fully enjoying their freedom.

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,470
Yes, it seems that way.

24
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,760
Then, would you tell us how things really are in the East?

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,750
Brother, what are you doing?

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,480
Brother?

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,990
Pick a hand.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,760
This one.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,490
You're right.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,780
This is yours, Anna.

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,770
Yay! An acorn!

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,720
Okay, let's do it again.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,090
Which hand?

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,810
This one.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,250
You're right again.

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,810
Here, this is yours.

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,850
Wow!

38
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,320
Brother, show me both of your hands.

39
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,850
Oh.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,160
So I would've been right either way.

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,560
That's right.

42
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,330
That's because all the acorns here are yours.

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,520
Hey, hey, brother! Did you see...

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,480
the city from the car on our way here?

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
It's completely different from the other side.

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,060
There were a lot of pretty stores.

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,310
Lots of different clothes and toys, too.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,950
Hey, you saw them too, right?

49
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,390
Yeah, I saw them.

50
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,890
They're all yours too, Anna.

51
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,880
Really?

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
Really.

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,730
Why are they all mine?

54
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,130
They just are.

55
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,170
I saw you on TV, Mr. Liebert.

56
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,660
Well, come in...

57
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,290
Brother, I wonder if someone's over.

58
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,280
Brother?

59
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,250
Brother?

60
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,080
Brother?

61
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,370
Brother...

62
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,410
Did you... do this?

63
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,730
All this time?

64
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,670
When Uncle Josef and Aunt Klara died...

65
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,590
When Mr. Bodecker died...

66
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,590
You did it all?

67
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,950
Today is special.

68
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,230
Did you do it?!

69
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,020
Because today...

70
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,890
a monster came.

71
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,560
You killed them all, didn't you?!

72
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
A monster came to take us away.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Put out your hands.

74
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,980
Shoot me.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,310
After you shoot, wipe the gun with a cloth...

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,000
and throw it out the window.

77
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,510
Make sure you shoot me in the head.

78
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,590
After you shoot me, run.

79
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,270
Run, so the monster won't get you.

80
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,040
It's okay.

81
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,660
Even if I die...

82
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,040
I am you...

83
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,270
and you are me.

84
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
That night...

85
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,720
On that rainy night...

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,990
someone came...

87
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,580
Nina?

88
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,120
Someone came to that mansion!

89
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,950
Nina!

90
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,830
Who?!

91
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,820
Who came?! Who?!

92
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,040
<i>A monster came.</i>

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,040
Nina!

94
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,760
Nina!

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,240
That Night

96
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,950
This is terrible...

97
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,910
How could this mansion catch fire?

98
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,790
No one was supposed to be living there.

99
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,890
They say it might've been arson.

100
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,480
That's so dangerous.

101
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,650
Dr. Tenma.

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,790
Could you please come with us?

103
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,860
General Wolf is asking to see you.

104
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,400
General... Wolf...

105
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,870
General Wolf.

106
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,650
Dr. Tenma.

107
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,650
Yes.

108
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,420
Just as I thought, you were summoned
as well, weren't you?

109
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,120
"I'm waiting at the Red Rose Mansion."

110
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,530
A letter from Johan.

111
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,530
Just getting to this hospital here in
Prague took everything I had...

112
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,980
So you also received a letter.

113
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,210
It's so ironic.

114
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,770
Now, only Johan sends letters to the man named Wolf.

115
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,790
You shouldn't talk too much.

116
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,400
I was born into a military family.

117
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,380
I was guaranteed the path of the chosen at birth.

118
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,340
But now...

119
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,300
the only one who knows me
for what I am is that monster.

120
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,070
I heard the Red Rose Mansion burned down.

121
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,190
I'm sure they're going to emerge...

122
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,600
into broad daylight...

123
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,620
The ones who had their names
taken from them, like myself...

124
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,830
Were you able to determine the cause of the fire?

125
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,760
Yes.

126
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,430
It looks like it started in the second floor hall.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Judging from how severely it burned in that area...

128
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,200
it could've been kerosene or gasoline.

129
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
kerosene?

130
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,240
So it was arson...

131
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,470
We won't know for sure until we investigate further, but...

132
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,670
there are signs that a wall in the
hallway had been torn down.

133
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,370
What does that mean?

134
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,450
Who knows.

135
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,390
E-Excuse me!

136
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,370
P-Please come with me!

137
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,450
What happened?

138
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,770
This is!

139
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,400
We saw something at the base of the rose
bushes, so we started digging, and...

140
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,830
the bones keep appearing, one after another!

141
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,600
After all these years, they'll finally see the light of day...

142
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,120
However...

143
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,600
there's no one still alive who knows their names.

144
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,360
How could this happen?

145
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,370
It burned down to the ground.

146
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,820
This mansion was our only clue to Tenma's whereabouts.

147
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,610
But now...

148
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,020
Out of my way! Let me through!

149
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,690
Out of my way!

150
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,490
What's going on?

151
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,060
P-Please contact headquarters!

152
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,250
Immediately!

153
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,090
Skeletons!

154
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,490
A massive number of human bones were...!

155
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,600
Forty-six people?

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,560
Yes, that's what I heard.

157
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,800
In 1981...

158
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,830
forty-six people suddenly disappeared in that mansion.

159
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,880
According to the little information I was able
to obtain in East Germany at the time...

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,350
a certain experiment was being
conducted at that mansion.

161
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,110
An experiment...

162
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,350
Step back, please!

163
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,020
This is only a theory, but...

164
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,430
that child was probably born there.

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,030
Brother, I'm cold.

166
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,310
I can't walk anymore.

167
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,540
I'm hungry.

168
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,050
Brother...

169
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,570
are we going to die?

170
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,620
Brother, please say my name.

171
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,510
Please say my name.

172
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,030
We don't have names.

173
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,270
Please say my name...

174
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,560
Please say my...

175
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,280
A blanket.

176
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,890
Yes, sir!

177
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,970
And something warm to drink.

178
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,450
Yes, sir!

179
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,650
"Johan. It is a wonderful name."

180
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,690
Johan...

181
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,880
Those children didn't have names.

182
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,310
Perhaps when I gave him the name Johan...

183
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,490
something inside of him awoke.

184
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,010
No...

185
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,160
There's no point in talking about the past anymore.

186
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,460
Let's talk about the future, and what will come.

187
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,600
Even though I no longer have a future...

188
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,430
It's okay, General Wolf.

189
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,800
You don't need to talk anymore.

190
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,190
Eva Heinemann is...

191
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,950
Eva Heinemann is with someone from our organization.

192
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,570
Our organization was unified by four people.

193
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,700
Professor GÃ¶derich, who was killed, and myself...

194
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,690
Right now, Eva is with the other two.

195
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,980
They're trying to use her.

196
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,570
You must not let them meet.

197
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,430
Whether I live or not...

198
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,050
I'm not able to stop them anymore.

199
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,490
They're about to go berserk.

200
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,240
Stop them.

201
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,120
Please save them, Tenma.

202
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,870
Dr. Tenma!

203
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,050
My name is Helmut...

204
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,200
Helmut Wolf.

205
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,350
However, those who knew me as Helmut...

206
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,920
are no longer in this world.

207
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,360
Please say my name.

208
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,240
That is the proof of my existence.

209
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,790
Helmut...

210
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,230
My name...

211
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,290
Helmut!

212
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,380
You are Helmut Wolf!

213
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,540
So this is what Johan saw...

214
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
A world without names...

215
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,770
General Wolf...

216
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,890
It all burned down.

217
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,270
The gates are locked, too.

218
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,250
The police must've made this place off-limits.

219
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
It's useless.

220
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,960
Mr. Lipsky.

221
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,480
I know this place is important to you because of
the book readings when you were a child...

222
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,590
But...

223
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,310
Nina...

224
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,700
This place must have been important to you, as well.

225
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,020
It might've been the trigger to recalling
your memories, and yet...

226
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
That vision...

227
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,090
A lot of people were dead...

228
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,850
and piled on top of each other in
the great hall of this mansion.

229
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,530
Yeah, since the visions you saw were real.

230
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,530
I was surprised when I saw the news.

231
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,610
They said they found the remains of forty-six
people at the Red Rose Mansion.

232
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,600
So it was just as your brother, Johan, told you.

233
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,810
My brother...

234
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,720
What did Johan see?

235
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,350
Was it something horrifying, beyond all imagination?

236
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,020
The true terror?

237
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,990
If I was...

238
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,490
If I had been there at the time...

239
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,700
would I have been the one to become the monster?

240
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,870
It might be for the best that this place burned down, Nina.

241
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,930
I thought it would be hard.

242
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,960
I thought I wouldn't be able to continue
living if I lost this place.

243
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,840
But I can't feel that way.

244
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,530
Maybe it's because this place is full of sad memories.

245
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,450
I wasn't an excellent student.

246
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,850
That's what makes me sad.

247
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,760
I couldn't meet his expectations.

248
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,190
That's what makes me sad.

249
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,280
If...

250
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
If only I'd been able to meet his expectations...

251
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,320
But reality wasn't like that.

252
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,810
I became an unwanted child.

253
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,520
What about your mom and dad, Mr. Lipsky?

254
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,380
They're alive.

255
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,020
But I've never lived with them before.

256
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,820
Nina's memories...

257
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,600
If Nina's memories do come back...

258
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,260
I hope they're happy ones.

259
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,730
Happy memories...?

260
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,870
Yes...

261
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,530
Happy memories...

262
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,480
I wonder what happy memories are...?

263
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,900
Tenma said...

264
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,040
that if you don't have any happy memories,
you can just make some.

265
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,120
Tenma said you can just make them from now on.

266
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,790
Dieter, your mouth is covered in ketchup!

267
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,680
So is yours, Nina.

268
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,310
Nina...

269
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,390
I'm creating a new puppet show right now.

270
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,690
What kind of puppet show is it?

271
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,050
No one has ever wanted to see my puppet shows.

272
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,200
But I think people will like this next one.

273
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,750
Let me see your new one!

274
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,720
I want to see! I want to see!

275
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,330
I'm a girl who lost her memories.

276
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
I have dreams that I'm being chased by a monster.

277
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,960
I have dreams that I'm chasing after a monster.

278
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,570
But I love songs.

279
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,670
And I love to dance.

280
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,120
Someday, I will have wonderful dreams.

281
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,390
Someday, those dreams will come true.

282
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,410
Someday...

283
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,140
I can't think of what should come after this...

284
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,340
I want to make this girl's story have a happy ending.

285
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,890
But...

286
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,780
I can't think of one yet.

287
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,440
I want to make it a happy ending.

288
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,650
I want to make it a happy ending.

289
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,490
Thank you.

290
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,460
The girl decided to embark on a journey.

291
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,720
She doesn't know what kind of journey it will be.

292
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,150
She doesn't know what lies ahead.

293
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,720
However...

294
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,880
the girl will stay strong and continue her journey.

295
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,040
The girl looks back and waves many times.

296
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,450
Over and over again.

297
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,950
And then, she's gone...

298
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,510
in search of a happy ending.

299
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,650
Nina!

300
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,580
Nina, you've come!

301
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,920
I've been looking for you, Mr. Lipsky.

302
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,290
You're the son of Franz Bonaparta...

303
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,270
the owner of the Red Rose Mansion, correct?

304
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

305
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

306
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

307
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

308
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,530
I Hate This Job
