1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:28,220
AND I SAW A BEAST RISING OUT OF THE SEA HAVING TEN HORNS AND SEVEN HEADS;

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:28,220
AND ON ITS HORNS WERE TEN DIADEMS, AND ON ITS HEADS WERE BLASPHEMOUS NAMES...

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:28,220
AND THE DRAGON GAVE IT HIS POWER AND HIS THRONE AND GREAT AUTHORITY...

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:28,220
THEY WORSHIPPED THE DRAGON, FOR HE HAD GIVEN AUTHORITY TO THE BEAST,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:28,220
AND THEY WORSHIPPED THE BEAST, SAYING,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:28,220
"WHO IS LIKE THE BEAST,

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:28,220
AND WHO CAN FIGHT AGAINST IT?"

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,220
REVELATIONS  13: 1-4  NRSV

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,030
That was magnificent.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.
He was as skillful as ever.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,060
The cerebral aneurysm was
in a delicate location. It's amazing that

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,660
- he was able to clip it off so quickly.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,940
That surgery was superb,
Herr Dr. Tenma.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,310
I realized once more,

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,350
what a brilliant surgeon you are,
Kenzo Tenma.

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,210
No, I owe it all to you.
Thank you all for your help.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,750
The sun's high in the sky already...

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,480
Yes. That surgery lasted
six hours straight...

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,190
You have no outpatients to see today,
so rest up.

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,570
Hm?

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,860
What about Dad?
What happened to Dad?

22
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,470
Herr Dr. Tenma

23
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,100
1986
Düsseldorf
(Germany)

24
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,450
Come on. Wake up.

25
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,790
Wake up, Dr. Tenma.

26
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,050
Kenzo Tenma

27
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,460
Our roles are reversed.

28
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,510
Eva Heinemann

29
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,230
A princess like me
should be the one waking up to a kiss.

30
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,560
Eva... You're here...

31
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,070
You forgot about our date,

32
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,610
- didn't you, Kenzo?
<i>- I'm here in Düsseldorf...</i>

33
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,670
- Huh?
<i>- Liebert, the consultant to</i>

34
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
- No, I didn't.
<i>- the East German Trade Commission,</i>

35
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,800
<i>who fled to the West
from East Germany,</i>

36
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,780
<i>appeared before the press
along with his family yesterday.</i>

37
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,450
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Liebert appeared to be
in good spirits,</i>

38
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,320
<i>along with their fraternal twins.</i>

39
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,460
<i>The family will remain in Düsseldorf
for a period of time</i>

40
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,300
<i>before moving to a home
prepared by authorities here.</i>

41
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,760
- I feel like I haven't slept a wink.
<i>- In other news...</i>

42
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,800
Hey!

43
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,570
- No, wake up!
<i>- Opera singer Rosenbauch...</i>

44
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,870
- The news is about you.
<i>- who suffered</i>

45
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,780
<i>a subarachnoid hemorrhage yesterday
and was reported in critical condition...</i>

46
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,340
<i>seems to be recovering well
after undergoing surgery.</i>

47
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,040
<i>Dr. Heinemann, Director of
Eisler Memorial Hospital,</i>

48
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,420
<i>where the surgery was performed,
just held a press conference.</i>

49
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,090
<i>Mr. Rosenbauch suffered
a subarachnoid hemorrhage</i>

50
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,330
Dr. Heinemann

51
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,490
<i>stemming from a cerebral aneurysm.</i>

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,060
<i>The surgery went as expected,
and the clipping procedure</i>

53
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,230
<i>also went very well.</i>

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,270
<i>Mr. Rosenbauch has
quite a large following.</i>

55
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,830
<i>What are his chances
of a full recovery?</i>

56
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>Yes, well, we will do our best
to assure he will sing again.</i>

57
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>Dr. Heinemann's surgical team
has successfully completed</i>

58
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,210
<i>many difficult surgeries.</i>

59
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,020
<i>With this success, they have surely
solidified their position</i>

60
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,080
<i>in our country's medical community.</i>

61
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,820
That was wonderful, Kenzo.

62
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,360
That wasn't news about me;
it was about your father.

63
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,030
That's true...

64
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,300
But that's because you did
such a perfect job last night,

65
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,340
as part of Father's team.

66
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm sure Father is grateful to you.

67
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,440
After all, you're the one
who has boosted

68
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,700
the reputation of the hospital.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,140
I'm the one who is grateful.

70
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,110
It's thanks to your father that
I am able to work here in Germany.

71
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,310
Hang in there, Kenzo.

72
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,810
If you stick with Father,
your future is guaranteed.

73
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,790
It won't be long before

74
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,760
Father becomes
Chairman of the Board.

75
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,990
Then, you'll quickly become
Chief of Surgery,

76
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,620
and in time, the Chief Director...

77
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,200
And then, I will be the Director's wife!

78
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,870
You must make me happy, now.
Hardships do not suit me.

79
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,970
You want to go out on a date?
Or...

80
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,410
Blood pressure, 128 over 64.

81
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,020
Spatula...

82
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,750
I will now scrape the pyramis.

83
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,430
As always, you did a magnificent job,
Dr. Tenma.

84
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,790
Thank you.

85
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,270
Dr. Becker

86
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,530
Although... it seems you're
not just good in surgery.

87
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,240
Huh?

88
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,580
You've reached the position of
Head of neurosurgery

89
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,910
at such a young age,

90
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,310
and you're the favorite of

91
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,350
the Hospital Director
and the Chief of Surgery.

92
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,110
What's more, you've even captured
the heart of the Director's daughter.

93
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,350
W-What are you trying to say,
Dr. Becker?

94
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,650
Sorry. I'm not saying there's
anything wrong.

95
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,390
After all, a hospital is ruled by politics.

96
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,260
You do realize that you're being used
by the Director, don't you?

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,060
The surgery you performed
on that opera singer...

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,040
he acts like he performed it himself...

99
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,130
even holding a televised
press conference.

100
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,870
Well, if he's using you, it just means
that you are that capable.

101
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,410
If you become successful,
don't forget about me, now.

102
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,910
I'll treat you to a drink next time.

103
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,640
Uh... Is there something
you want to say?

104
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,410
You're Dr. Tenma?

105
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
Yes.

106
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,050
Bring me back my husband...

107
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,420
Bring my husband back to me!

108
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,890
You! Why didn't you operate
on my husband?!

109
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,060
- Who are you?
- My husband was brought into

110
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,000
this hospital earlier!

111
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,170
He got here before that opera singer
Yet you made him wait!!

112
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,410
Huh?

113
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,740
You! They say you're the best surgeon
in this hospital! Why?

114
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,680
Why? Why?

115
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,710
<i>That day, I was...</i>

116
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,550
<i>about to start surgery
on a Turkish man</i>

117
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,680
<i>injured in a construction site accident.</i>

118
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,120
<i>Dr. Tenma...</i>

119
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,630
<i>Yes?</i>

120
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,860
<i>You shouldn't be here.
Get over to OR 1, quickly.</i>

121
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,200
<i>It's an order from the Director.
Please hurry.</i>

122
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,500
You... If you had operated on him,
he would have been saved!!

123
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,000
- You...
- Mama...

124
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,340
Bring him back to me. Bring him back!

125
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,620
...and then my friend and I
fought over that dress.

126
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,750
They had only one in that size.

127
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,950
But don't worry.
It ended up in my hands.

128
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,400
Hey, are you listening?

129
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,600
Huh?

130
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,200
Oh...

131
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,000
What in the world is
the matter with you?

132
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,100
I looked at the patient's chart.

133
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,710
The surgeon who performed
the operation on the Turkish man

134
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,110
was Dr. Becker.

135
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,680
Oh, you're still stuck on that story?

136
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,940
Clearly, it took them too long
to begin treating that patient.

137
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,950
If I had performed surgery on him
I may have been able to

138
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,350
save that Turk.

139
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,790
Don't talk about this
while we're eating.

140
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,030
But, what would she have me do?

141
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,460
I was just following orders
from the Director

142
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,660
when I performed surgery
on that opera singer.

143
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,530
It wasn't my fault.

144
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,440
Isn't that right?

145
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,270
Of course.

146
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,440
After all, people's lives
aren't created equal.

147
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,580
Oh...

148
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,290
<i>Give him back!</i>

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>Give my husband back to me!</i>

150
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,500
<i>...to me! to me!</i>

151
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,850
Is that the mansion?

152
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,810
Yes. It was reported by a neighbor.

153
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,850
How many shots?

154
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,250
Five or six.

155
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,850
Who lives here?

156
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Well, uh... It seems to be
the residence of the Liebert family

157
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,230
who recently fled here
from East Germany.

158
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,090
Wha? This is going to turn into
a big mess.

159
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,640
Charge in at the count of three!
1, 2, 3!

160
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,630
This is bad...

161
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,170
What in the world...

162
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,270
S-Someone's there!

163
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,290
<i>There appears to be one survivor.
A girl!</i>

164
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,930
<i>A man and woman are dead!
A boy is in critical condition.</i>

165
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,190
<i>I repeat.
One boy is in critical condition!</i>

166
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,870
An emergency?

167
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,110
A shot to the head?

168
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,120
Is that boy the only patient?

169
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,320
Yes. Both parents died instantly.
It seems to have been a robbery.

170
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,260
Got it. I'll be at the hospital
in five minutes.

171
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,140
<i>Oh, Father!</i>

172
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm terribly sorry, Director Heinemann,

173
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,480
for keeping your precious daughter
out so late.

174
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,350
What are you talking about, Tenma.

175
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,640
Eva is your fiancé, isn't she?
How about coming in for some tea?

176
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,020
Have you notified
your parents in Japan

177
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,360
about your wedding date?

178
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,460
Uh-yes... But my father runs
a small clinic.

179
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,630
I'm not sure whether
he'll be able to spare the time

180
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,760
to come all the way here to Germany.

181
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,470
Wouldn't it be a good opportunity
for him to enjoy

182
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,410
a leisurely overseas trip?

183
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,540
That's right. They'll be coming
at our expense, after all.

184
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,980
Thank you very much.
I am completely indebted to you, sir.

185
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,720
When you arrived here in Germany,

186
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,850
I thought you were
a high school student, Kenzo.

187
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,190
And now you're the best
among the young doctors

188
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,730
at Eisler Memorial Hospital.

189
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,030
By the way, Kenzo...
That research you're doing

190
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,930
on cerebral vascular spasms
after subarachnoid hemorrhages...

191
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,760
Yes... I'm creating a model of
a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a dog.

192
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,810
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
cancel that research.

193
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,750
What?

194
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,710
I have been asked to speak
at the next

195
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,650
European Medical Convention.

196
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,820
I want to have you
compile my manuscript.

197
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,590
Oh, but... my research
is just about completed...

198
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,630
But, I tell you,
there was quite a scene today...

199
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,560
What happened, Father?

200
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,970
A suspicious group of people
forced their way into the hospital

201
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,200
and began clamoring about
that operation on

202
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,240
the opera singer the other day.

203
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,370
They claimed we delayed treatment
of an injured Turkish man

204
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,110
who had arrived earlier
than that singer.

205
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,250
They're completely wrong about that.
That Turk was operated on first.

206
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,420
There was nothing wrong
with our procedures.

207
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,760
Isn't that right?

208
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,700
Uh, yes...

209
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,220
Those guys have the mistaken idea

210
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,700
that doctors are volunteer workers,
or something.

211
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,900
We are scholars, first and foremost.
Isn't that right?

212
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,980
In any case, I want you to
work on my manuscript.

213
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,780
I have high expectations of you,
Tenma.

214
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,510
Uh, thank you very much...

215
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,370
Damn!

216
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,090
- The patient?
- He was just wheeled in.

217
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,660
How is he?

218
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,530
Blood pressure, 72 over 50;
pulse 137.

219
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,560
The bullet went in
through his forehead...

220
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,030
Have X-rays done immediately.

221
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,230
Yes, sir!

222
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,760
Oh, Dr. Tenma!

223
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,080
Who's this girl?

224
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,270
She's that boy's twin sister.

225
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,950
Any injuries?

226
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,980
None.

227
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,550
But she seems to have sustained
serious psychological shock.

228
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,490
What is it?

229
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,790
Kill...

230
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,000
Dr. Tenma!

231
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,330
The X-rays and CT scans
of his head are ready.

232
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,170
All right. I'll be right there.

233
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,770
It entered the front of the head...

234
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,970
and stopped deep in the brain.

235
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,450
Yes...

236
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,370
This is going to be difficult.

237
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,820
Huh?

238
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,080
The bullet is touching
the left middle cerebral artery.

239
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,750
I see. Dr. Tenma is right.
This is going to be very delicate.

240
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,630
If you move the bullet even a little,

241
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,220
the artery could rupture,
causing massive bleeding.

242
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,070
I'm sorry to be late.

243
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,100
Dr. Becker!

244
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,000
You're supposed to be on duty.
How could you be so late?!

245
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,700
We'll do a full frontal craniotomy
of the frontal region,

246
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,510
remove any bone fragments
and contaminated brain matter.

247
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,750
We'll then carefully remove the bullet

248
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,580
and finally repair
the damaged blood vessel.

249
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,890
It will take some time,
but let's do our best.

250
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,930
Blood pressure 120 over 80;
pulse 92. He looks good.

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
The anesthesia has kicked in.

252
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,550
Dr. Tenma...

253
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,050
Yes?

254
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,240
You should not be here.
You are needed at once in OR 1.

255
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,380
The mayor... Mayor Roddecker
has suffered a cerebral blood clot.

256
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,960
He's being transported here
by helicopter.

257
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,600
They're scheduled to arrive
in 10 minutes.

258
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,100
Then please contact Dr. Boyer.

259
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,660
There's a possibility of
arterial occlusion.

260
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,460
If that is the case,
you will perform the operation.

261
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,740
But I was just about to
begin surgery on that boy.

262
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,740
It's an order from the Director.

263
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,590
Yes? This is Tenma...

264
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,720
<i>Oh, is this Tenma?
Take care of the Mayor, will you?</i>

265
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,260
<i>I have contacted Dr. Eisen
and Dr. Boyer, too.</i>

266
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,070
<i>That should give us added insurance.</i>

267
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,300
But, Director Heinemann,
I am about to begin another operation.

268
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,170
<i>Let Dr. Becker handle that one.</i>

269
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,580
Huh?!

270
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,140
With all due respect,
the patient I am about to operate on

271
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,740
has a bullet up against
his left middle cerebral artery

272
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,750
and it could turn into
a very complex surgery!

273
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,890
But I am confident I can do it.

274
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,810
I'll let Dr. Boyer
take care of the Mayor.

275
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,490
Only I can perform
the necessary surgery on this boy!

276
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,590
Tenma... Whatever the case,
I want you to do all you can

277
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,030
to save the Mayor.

278
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,800
The Mayor has promised this hospital
a huge increase in subsidies

279
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,070
in the next review of medical facilities.

280
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,610
<i>We can't have him die just yet.</i>

281
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,350
So I want you to do this.
I'm counting on you, Tenma.

282
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,290
Yes...

283
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,890
The Mayor has arrived on the heliport.

284
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,860
After the CT scans are done,
do an angiogram.

285
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,600
Pinpoint the site of
the thrombus occlusion.

286
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,630
Get ready now, Dr. Tenma!

287
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,210
We're counting on
your genius abilities.

288
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,880
<i>Those guys have the mistaken idea
that doctors are</i>

289
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,650
<i>volunteer workers, or something.</i>

290
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,460
<i>We are scholars first and foremost
Isn't that right? Isn't that right?</i>

291
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,760
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

292
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,700
<i>I was just following orders
from the Director</i>

293
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,760
<i>when I performed surgery
on that opera singer.</i>

294
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,630
<i>It wasn't my fault.</i>

295
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,060
<i>Of course.</i>

296
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,470
<i>After all, people's lives
aren't created equal.</i>

297
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,180
<i>Give him back to me...</i>

298
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,750
<i>If you had operated on him,
he would have been saved.</i>

299
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,280
<i>Give my husband back to me!</i>

300
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,380
<i>Give him back! Give him back!
Give him back! Give him back!</i>

301
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,650
<i>Give him back! Give him back!
Give him back!!</i>

302
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,450
What's the matter, Dr. Tenma?

303
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,110
I... I have a surgery to perform
in the other OR.

304
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,080
Huh?

305
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,540
H-Hey, Dr. Tenma!

306
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,740
It's the Director's order!

307
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,480
The Mayor is undergoing
a CT scan now.

308
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,620
Doctors, you are needed immediately
in the reading room.

309
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,090
All right.

310
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,650
Wait, Dr. Tenma!

311
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,420
Dr. Tenma!!

312
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't worry. Just hang in there!
I will save you!!

313
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,020
Kill...

314
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,450
Downfall
