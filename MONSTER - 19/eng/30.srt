1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,400
He has already gone to heaven.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,030
All that remains here is
Richard Braun's body.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
His soul will live on forever.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,830
Let us swear on his soul...

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,780
that we will continue on living... in hope.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,590
Let us turn to the Bible, Psalm 23.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,590
This is quite unbearable, isn't it?

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,300
What a depressing funeral...

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,810
Even though he was a skilled detective,

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,490
not a single person from the
police department came.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,440
While he was part of the force,
he had a drinking problem.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,730
In the end, he drank and fell to his death.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,110
That's what the police said, right?

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,360
On the day he died,

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,080
Richard had apparently promised his
daughter to see her the next day.

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,400
I...

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,800
What did I ever do for him?

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,550
Dr. Reichwein...

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,630
I just sat in my chair,

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,340
listened to his story,

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,660
and told him that he had regained his old self.

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,720
What did I ever do for him?

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,520
Dr. Tenma...

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,470
If we could find him, it's possible
that everything would be solved.

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,400
Dr. Tenma...

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,110
Don't you think it's strange, doctor?

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,200
This was no accident!

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,620
This was not a suicide either!

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,870
Mr. Richard spoke to his daughter on the
phone just a few hours before his death,

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,620
saying they'd meet the next day.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,330
Doctor,

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,300
you did everything that you could have done,

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,230
and Mr. Richard did regain his old self.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,970
Please don't blame yourself.

35
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,040
Decision

36
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,040
And then...

37
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,560
Hear me out, doctor.

38
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,400
My husband will not talk to me...

39
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,520
ever since I found out about his affair.

40
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,530
Every day, he washes the car and
then mows the lawn.

41
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,520
He won't even look me in the face!

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, that's better than his not coming home,

43
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,260
but if this continues, I think I'll go crazy!

44
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,090
Are you listening, doctor?

45
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,050
Uh... yes...

46
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,590
Please continue.

47
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,640
And so, I stormed over to his mistress's house,

48
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,760
and what do you think happened then, doctor?

49
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,150
The possibility of a homicide?

50
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,480
No way.

51
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,270
That was just an accident.

52
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,650
That night, Richard Braun went up to the the roof
of Building 12 at the University of Munich,

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,660
drank a bottle of whiskey, and then
fell off after getting drunk.

54
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,900
Did you investigate the bottle closely?

55
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course!

56
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,880
Richard's fingerprints were on it.

57
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,750
Can you show me that bottle?

58
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,880
Well, I suppose I could,

59
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,910
but it's shattered.

60
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,850
Richard...

61
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,110
Don't you think it's strange?

62
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,240
Mr. Richard spoke to his daughter on the
phone just a few hours before his death,

63
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,540
saying they'd meet the next day.

64
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,120
Yes,

65
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,020
this person came here that night.

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,270
He came alone?

67
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,170
Well, I don't remember...

68
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,160
So you remember his coming here, but you don't
remember if he came with someone else?

69
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,910
Well, I remembered him because
he ordered coffee.

70
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,150
Coffee?

71
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,650
It's unusual for a customer to come in that
late at night and not order alcohol.

72
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,750
That night,

73
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,550
was he with this young man?

74
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm not sure.

75
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,890
Please try to remember.

76
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,300
I don't know!

77
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,850
Lots of customers come in here...

78
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,370
But it's true that he bought a
bottle of whiskey to go.

79
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,190
It's right there on the receipt.

80
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,440
Was it really Richard who bought it?

81
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,690
I told you, I don't remember!

82
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,210
The receipt only has "one bottle of Racke" on it.

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,450
What did you just say?

84
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,960
One bottle of Racke.

85
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,880
Why didn't I realize it when I saw the
bottle label at the police station?

86
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,840
Huh?

87
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,820
You drank again?

88
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,720
No... Well...

89
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,890
Just a little bit.

90
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,450
What did you have to drink?

91
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,770
Whiskey!

92
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,820
I only drink whiskey.

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,900
Hmph! Stinking up the room
with the smell of Racke!

94
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,980
Racke?

95
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,320
Are you kidding me?!

96
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,920
I would never drink that domestic stuff.

97
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,200
When I drink I drink the
real stuff, Scotch Whiskey!

98
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,740
That's a given!

99
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,960
The person who bought the
whiskey was not Richard.

100
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,310
Johann...

101
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,390
Was it him, after all?

102
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,440
Huh?

103
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,860
W-Wait!

104
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,870
Hey, wait up!

105
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,690
Hey!

106
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,250
W-What?

107
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,650
Why did you try to push me off?

108
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,110
I don't know what you're talking about.

109
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,190
What are you saying? Don't play dumb!

110
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,000
Yo, Gramps.

111
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,850
You got some business with my friend?

112
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,850
Bastard!

113
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,020
Stupid old man!

114
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,990
Who...

115
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,620
Who hired you?

116
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,580
Think about your age, old man!

117
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,250
A grandpa should just look after his grandkids.

118
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,510
W-Wait, you punks!

119
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
Wait!

120
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,190
I've trained with the border patrol.

121
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,440
Why did you try to push me off?

122
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,570
I don't know what you're talking about!

123
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,570
Don't underestimate a former police surgeon.

124
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,120
I... I was hired to...

125
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,030
By whom?

126
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,620
A big man!

127
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,120
A big man?

128
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,380
A big man that I passed in the subway
passage gave me money!

129
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,710
He told me to push you off...!

130
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,060
I got it for you, Richard.

131
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,350
It's real Scotch Whiskey.

132
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,760
You wanted to drink it, right?

133
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,900
It's fine now.

134
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,900
Drink all you want now...

135
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,620
Richard,

136
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,460
leave it to me...

137
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,580
I'll definitely figure it out...

138
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,210
His...

139
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,170
Johann's...

140
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,510
real identity.

141
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,310
And then, doctor, I told my husband,

142
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,880
"Your infidelity is like a disease,"

143
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,190
and, "You're the only one who should
be getting a doctor's counseling!"

144
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,110
Doctor, are you listening to me?

145
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,780
Uh...

146
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,030
Yes, of course, Mrs. Hesse...

147
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,740
What do you think?

148
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,200
If my husband stays that way,

149
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,200
my depression will get worse.

150
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,580
Well,

151
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,710
you're not really suffering
from depression, ma'am.

152
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,580
Huh?

153
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:42,210
I'm more worried about your quiet husband, who
washes his car and mows the lawn every day.

154
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,510
You think so, too?

155
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,760
It's weird, no matter how you look at it.

156
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,720
Doctor, I'm begging you.

157
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,180
Please see him.

158
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,480
That's fine.

159
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,730
Let's see...

160
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm free the day after tomorrow at 5 PM.

161
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,860
I'll try asking my husband.

162
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,470
Please straighten out that cheating oaf!

163
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,220
Doctor, you have no more patients today.

164
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,510
Okay. That's all for today, Ms. Merez.

165
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,390
I'll leave first, then.

166
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,060
Oh, Ms. Merez...

167
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,000
Yesterday, you forgot to lock
the back door again.

168
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,940
No! Really?

169
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,500
I was about to forget today, too!

170
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,460
Oh! I did it again!

171
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,530
Thanks for your hard work.

172
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,790
Hello, is this Dr. Gillen?

173
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,460
It's Reichwein.

174
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,750
I read the newspaper...

175
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,970
Uh, that ad that you put out...

176
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,590
"Let's discuss our memories of
cheating. From Rudi."

177
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,350
Will Dr. Tenma really contact you
because of this one sentence?

178
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,160
Yes.

179
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,810
If Tenma sees that, he will
definitely contact me.

180
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,730
Well, it's a story that only
the two of us know.

181
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,860
I see.

182
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,450
Doctor, please don't do anything
rash until he appears.

183
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,240
I understand.

184
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,590
There is one thing I would like
to investigate, though.

185
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,620
What is it?

186
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,600
The prostitute named Margot Langer.

187
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,210
Richard said...

188
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,050
When Fahren, who committed suicide,
went to see that woman,

189
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,510
there was a youth with him.

190
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,570
A beautiful, blonde young man.

191
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,310
Please be careful, doctor.

192
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,560
I understand, doctor...

193
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,600
For the sake of exposing the truth, I will
be more cautious from now on,

194
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,440
for Richard's sake as well.

195
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,650
Well then, I'll contact you again.

196
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,090
Ms. Merez, you forgot to close
the window today.

197
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,220
Margot Langer?

198
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,620
I don't know her.

199
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,470
Well,

200
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,620
her current nickname should be
Sophie something or another.

201
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,440
Oh, that fat hag?

202
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,450
Mister, are you into those types of girls?

203
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,750
No, it's nothing like that.

204
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,320
You shouldn't be embarrassed at your age.

205
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,990
Two streets down, around the corner.
Second floor of the old building.

206
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,200
Thank you.

207
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,870
She's not there now, though.

208
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,870
I haven't seen her lately.

209
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,380
She probably found a better place.

210
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,290
A better... place?

211
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,750
Jeez, why are the fat ugly ones so popular?

212
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,130
I heard that a really rich guy came
to see her the other day.

213
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,510
Where did she go?

214
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,390
Hey! How about me, mister?

215
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,700
I can definitely entertain you better
than that fat hag!

216
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,260
You don't know where she went?

217
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,140
I don't know.

218
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,270
She must have gone somewhere
with that new guy.

219
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,310
New guy?

220
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,780
Yeah, I can't believe that old hag fell
in love with that big man at her age.

221
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,530
He was a big man.

222
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
A big man...?

223
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,700
He looked like he was big down there, too...

224
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
Um, doctor...

225
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,880
Could I take the rest of the day off?

226
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,340
Oh, that's right!

227
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,430
You're working until five today.

228
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,630
All I have left is an appointment with
that unfaithful husband, so go ahead.

229
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,680
You have a date, right, Ms. Merez?

230
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,560
Please, doctor!

231
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,680
Please remember the door.

232
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,410
If I show this photo to that prostitute Sophie,
who pretended to be Margot Langer,

233
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:17,370
and got her to testify that the one who
was with Fahren was this boy, Johann,

234
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,290
I'd be one step closer to the truth.

235
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,790
Yes?

236
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,400
I'm Hesse. My wife made an
appointment for me.

237
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh, I see.

238
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,460
Please come up.

239
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,930
I guess I'll try questioning that
woman again tonight.

240
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,560
Nice to meet you, Dr. Reichwein.

241
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,520
Welcome, Mr. Hesse.

242
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,310
It's nice to meet you.

243
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,650
Please, come in.

244
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,660
This is my first time at a counseling session so...

245
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,030
There's nothing to be nervous about.

246
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,070
This is a place where you can relax
and tell me anything you want.

247
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,180
What you say here is strictly confidential,

248
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,660
so please don't worry.

249
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,670
Even from my wife?

250
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,170
Of course!

251
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,590
How have you been lately?

252
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,380
Is there anything bothering you?

253
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,670
Bothering me?

254
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes...

255
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,510
My wife...

256
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,920
She found out about my affair.

257
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,100
I see.

258
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,140
Even in my own house, I don't feel at home,

259
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,230
so I mow the lawn and wash the car.

260
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,400
I do that every day.

261
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,780
And does that make you feel any better?

262
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,170
Not really...

263
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,620
I don't even talk to my wife at all.

264
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,620
There isn't an opportunity to talk
even when you want to, huh?

265
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,910
Well, I'm not sure if that's it...

266
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,000
What about her?

267
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,210
Huh?

268
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,670
What about the woman you
had an affair with?

269
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,710
Oh...

270
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,880
I killed her.

271
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,630
Huh?

272
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,130
I mean,

273
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,790
I dreamt that I'd killed her.

274
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,930
Do you often have those kinds of dream?

275
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,520
Often...?

276
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,520
Well... not lately, I haven't.

277
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,280
I was lonely.

278
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,200
And that's why you had an affair.

279
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,020
No, it was after I met him...

280
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,370
Him?

281
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,250
He's a beautiful boy...

282
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,000
with blonde hair.

283
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,050
No matter how many people I killed,

284
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,130
or even if the country was destroyed,

285
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,600
everything inside of me felt like a dream.

286
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,270
After I met him, though, things changed...

287
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,850
Everything began to seem real...

288
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,780
and I was no longer lonely.

289
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,870
Would...

290
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,830
Would you like some tea?

291
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,660
No, I'm fine, thanks.

292
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,290
I'm a bit thirsty.

293
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,550
Could you wait a moment?

294
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,220
My secretary went home, you see.

295
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,150
Apparently, she has a date.

296
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,400
She makes good tea.

297
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,980
I'm sorry I can't give you some.

298
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,620
Doctor?

299
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,990
W-What is it?

300
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,790
In a job like yours, many different
things must occur.

301
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,110
After all, you do learn about people's dreams.

302
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,720
Nothing good can result from learning about
dreams that you shouldn't know about.

303
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,680
Especially...

304
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,600
learning that I'm a murderer...

305
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,990
I-In any case,

306
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,570
if you intend to start over
as husband and wife,

307
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,610
you should talk things over.

308
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,580
<i>I hope that you didn't close
the back door, Ms. Merez.</i>

309
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,790
Y-You're...

310
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,170
Hurry and run!

311
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,580
Doctor... Tenma...

312
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,130
I've been watching over you for a while.

313
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,880
You're being targeted.

314
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,130
Run!

315
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,220
Hurry!

316
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,450
In Broad Daylight
