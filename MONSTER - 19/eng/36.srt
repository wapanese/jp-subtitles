1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Is there a change in his condition?

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,050
Well... but...

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,010
What about his blood pressure and pulse rate?

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,600
Excuse me, Dr. Tenma.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,930
What about Mayor Rodecker's operation?

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,680
I am starting the operation.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,440
Yes...

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,150
Oh yeah, what's the patient's name?

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,810
Huh?

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,400
What's this young boy's name?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,450
Um... well...

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,200
We don't know his name... do we?

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,290
You'll be fine.

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,870
Hang on.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
I'll save you.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,780
Kill... him...

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,430
Kill... him...

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,070
Kill... him...

19
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,780
Those kids...

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,820
Those twins are nowhere to be found.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,330
Did you look everywhere?

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,120
Of course I did. I looked everywhere.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
Perhaps they're playing hide-and-seek or something.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,310
"Perhaps they're playing hide-and-seek or something," eh?

25
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,360
Scaredy cat Tenma... Scaredy Cat Tenma... YAY!

26
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,360
It won't help you to hide, scaredy cat Tenma!

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,660
If you try to hide, you'll just wet your pants again!

28
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,050
Hey guys! It's getting late, just how much
longer are you guys going to play?

29
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,130
Okay!

30
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,880
See you tomorrow.

31
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,930
See ya!

32
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,890
Bye-bye.

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,350
See ya!

34
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,680
Bye-bye.

35
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,350
What about me?

36
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,360
Hey everyone... I'm right here.

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,370
Find me!

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm right here!

39
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,460
Find me!

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,510
"Scaredy Cat Tenma," eh?

41
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,840
The Monster of Chaos

42
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,480
What should we do?

43
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,360
The guy who came earlier this evening
is still in front of the house.

44
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,910
Who is he?

45
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,250
He's Richard Brown's psychiatrist, the
detective that we've previously hired.

46
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,420
I'll chase him away immediately.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,130
Karl, I can't see well.

48
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,420
What does he look like?

49
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,470
Yes, he's an old man.

50
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,640
What do you think of him?

51
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,430
He doesn't seem like a bad man...

52
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,940
and it seems like he's in a real pinch.

53
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,280
I see.

54
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,120
Thank you for seeing me, Herr Schubert

55
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,460
Let us skip the useless pleasantries.

56
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,250
It's getting late.

57
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,420
Let me hear what you have to say.

58
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,960
I don't have much time myself.

59
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,180
However, it's up to you as to how long this will take.

60
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,560
You didn't come here to ask about him, did you?

61
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,440
About Johan.

62
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,150
It seems like I am right.

63
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,450
I thought that someone like you
would come to me some day...

64
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,160
in order to solve the mystery.

65
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,160
Mystery?

66
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,170
He's just too perfect.

67
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,380
People who can see may not know it, but I can feel it...

68
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,430
Standing in front of someone who comes
off as being perfectly at peace.

69
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,140
Isn't that like he doesn't really exist?

70
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,520
He exists, I can assure you.

71
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,150
It's all here, the fragments of his past, that is.

72
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,530
I'll read it to you now,

73
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,150
you'll see that he is not an illusion.

74
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:53,250
The story begins when a young boy, who was fatally
wounded, was taken to a hospital in 1986.

75
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,680
And then, he showed up in front of you.

76
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,560
According to the dead... no, murdered, Richard,

77
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,690
Johan was controlling Farhen, the student
who pretended to be your son.

78
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:27,700
But, when your real son, Karl, showed up, he
changed his tactics and got close to him.

79
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,490
And then, he made Farhen commit suicide.

80
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,830
Why did you reunite with your son, who
was away from you for so long?

81
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,920
And in these last few years, how many
people have died around you?

82
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,680
The chauffer who served you for all those years.

83
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,600
The maid who read you books.

84
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,180
The accountant who was your bird-watching partner.

85
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,480
Every one of them died.

86
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,350
Everything happened because Johan
wanted to isolate you...

87
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,940
he wanted to get close to you.

88
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,940
I beg you, please help me.

89
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,700
Everything must be brought to daylight.

90
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,410
If you don't, that Japanese doctor, Dr. Tenma will...

91
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,670
You told me that Johan played with people
like he played with an ant line, right?

92
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
An ant line, eh...?

93
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,390
Do you know what people call me?

94
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,150
That's right, the Vampire of Bayern.

95
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,360
I took that name with such pride.

96
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,160
When I took that role to its logical conclusion, I don't
know how, but it became bigger and bigger...

97
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,450
The monster inside me, that is.

98
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,170
But what about now?

99
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,670
The nickname is imposing, but I'm so weak.

100
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,680
Come to think of it, I also wanted to play with the ant line...

101
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,300
in this manner...

102
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,190
He's going to become what I wanted to be.

103
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,320
Who can become like that monster?"

104
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,200
Who can challenge and fight that monster?

105
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,370
Is that Johan's silent power?

106
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:41,960
The only thing that can defeat this
monster, is another bigger monster.

107
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,390
Father...

108
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,400
What was that about?

109
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
It's morning already.

110
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,780
By the way, where is Johan?

111
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,120
He seems to be heading straight from the
East Hohen office to the ceremony hall.

112
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,120
More importantly, you look very tired.
Should I cancel today's ceremony?

113
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,710
No... Get me ready to go out.

114
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,800
Kill... him...

115
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,930
Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.

116
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,680
You only did your duty as a doctor.

117
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,890
It wasn't your fault.

118
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,860
Please stay alive.

119
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,150
And then... save as many people as you can.

120
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:03,780
Nina...

121
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,810
That's really a shame.

122
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,020
Are you really going to quit?

123
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,190
And you just got used to the job too.

124
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,610
Thank you for taking care of me.

125
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,110
If you are ever around these parts again, give me a call.

126
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,820
Okay. Then I'll...

127
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,080
Man, and she was a good girl too...

128
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,670
Hello? Is Lotte Frank there?

129
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,590
Lotte is not in right now.

130
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,590
Oh? Then can you tell her that I'll be taking
the 3:00 train out of Munich?

131
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,680
Okay, sure thing.

132
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,220
Oh yeah, may I have your name again?

133
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,260
It's Nina.

134
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,850
Nina Fortner.

135
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,880
He's here. His car just pulled up at the back entrance.

136
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,720
The Vampire of Bayern has finally arrived.

137
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,550
Shh... He'll hear you.

138
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,310
Did you see the guests out there?

139
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,400
Oh, yes. Not only from Bayern, but industry
representatives from Europe, Japan...

140
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,860
and lots of ambassadors and politicians...

141
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,900
It's hard to believe this is just a book donation ceremony.

142
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:13,080
Well, they do say that Mr. Schubert's every
movement affects Europe's economy.

143
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,460
He rarely appears in public, so lots of people came for this.

144
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,380
But his sudden donation of books...

145
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
it's like he's giving away his keepsakes.

146
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,050
Hey, hey. Don't even mention that.

147
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,680
He's an important piece of the European economy.

148
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,680
We need him alive for a bit longer.

149
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,140
Karl.

150
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,270
Yes?

151
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,640
Can you get me a document that I forgot?

152
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,940
Which document?

153
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,900
Don't worry about it, just go back to the estate and get it.

154
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,440
It's on top of my desk in the study.

155
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,900
But, father...

156
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,990
Johan will arrive shortly.

157
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,320
Leave everything here to him.

158
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,620
Y-Yes.

159
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,350
Everything is going smoothly.

160
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,600
Going smoothly?

161
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,820
I thought you would help us out.

162
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,940
That's why I told you Tenma was in Munich.

163
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,450
But what are you doing?

164
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,120
Did you investigate Schubert's secretary, Johan Liebert?

165
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,660
There's no doubt that he's the real serial killer.

166
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,960
Are you listening?

167
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,420
If you don't hurry up and arrest him, Tenma is going to...

168
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,300
Tenma is going to try and end this by himself!

169
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,260
Please don't worry. The investigation is going smoothly.

170
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,480
Excuse me.

171
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,810
Johan is right in front of our eyes.

172
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,650
Hurry and...

173
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,110
As expected from a criminal psychiatrist.

174
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,360
That is a good description.

175
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,320
Johan does exist, undoubtedly.

176
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,750
Johan does exist...

177
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,380
inside Tenma's head.

178
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,840
Were you able to get any new information from it?

179
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:31,760
Nope.

180
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,970
He's been saying the same thing over and over again.

181
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,430
The gun model was a Mauser SR-93.

182
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,720
The buyer was a Japanese person.

183
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,350
Should we grill him some more?

184
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,860
No, that's probably all he knows.

185
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,730
Yeah.

186
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,940
The Mauser SR-93 is a sniper rifle, right?

187
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,780
Yeah, and it's quite a good one too.

188
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,740
I wonder who his target is.

189
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,000
I am Tenma.

190
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,250
I am Tenma.

191
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,510
I just got an excellent sniper rifle.

192
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,800
I am Tenma.

193
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,260
And I...

194
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,230
I am Johan.

195
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,770
Who would I shoot with these hands?

196
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,190
I killed the hospital directors.

197
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,190
I killed numerous middle-aged couples.

198
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,360
And now... who am I going to kill?

199
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,240
I...

200
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,200
Chaos...

201
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,910
I love chaos.

202
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,310
You should have something to eat.

203
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,520
Yeah.

204
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,610
Thanks, Dieter.

205
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,240
I'm fine. Don't worry.

206
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm not going to quit this easily.

207
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,160
It may not seem like it, but when I was
a doctor for the National Border Patrol,

208
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,830
I trained my body and mind.

209
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,250
I will save your friend,

210
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,340
no matter what.

211
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,840
Don't underestimate a doctor who was an ex-cop.

212
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:48,140
Now, since you cooked me such a nice meal, I'm going to
dig in, because you can't fight on an empty stomach, right?

213
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,280
This is it!

214
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,000
Did you figure something out?

215
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,000
Schubert's book donation ceremony!

216
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,590
Is Tenma there?

217
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,090
Dieter, you wait here!

218
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,010
Don't follow me!

219
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,970
It's Schubert!

220
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,980
I want to see Hans Georg Schubert.

221
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,310
Contact him.

222
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,730
Yes, sir.

223
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,740
If I'm not mistaken, he's at the University of Munich
for a book donation ceremony today.

224
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,450
We're heading there immediately.

225
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,200
What?

226
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,700
Tenma is going after Schubert.

227
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:57,000
Now, please welcome Hans Georg Schubert, who donated his huge collection of books.

228
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,810
Where is Johan?

229
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,680
Is my secretary here?

230
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,480
Huh?

231
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,150
Oh yes, he's right over there.

232
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,200
He came, eh?

233
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,270
I was the one who saved his life.

234
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,780
I was the one who saved that monster...

235
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
Nina!

236
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,420
Lotte! Thanks for coming.

237
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm sorry. I looked all over for him,
but he doesn't seem to be here.

238
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,930
You and I just got to be good friends, too.

239
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,930
It's such a shame.

240
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,140
You guys aren't twins are you?

241
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,850
I'm right, aren't I?

242
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,390
I'm right, aren't I?!

243
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,940
What is this picture book?

244
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,860
He saw this and suddenly fainted.

245
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,030
Picture book?

246
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,400
Kill... him...

247
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:43,160
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

248
00:22:44,250 --> 00:23:00,560
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

249
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:25,640
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

250
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:34,120
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

251
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,530
A Nameless Monster
