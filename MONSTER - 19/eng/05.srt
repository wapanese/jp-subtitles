1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,500
Now, class...
Tell me what the decision

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,970
in the 1968 Stuttgart case
was based upon.

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,510
Now, now, what is this silence?
Is this a Zen temple in the Orient?

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,650
Mr. Eimer... I would like to
hear your answer.

5
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,750
Huh?!

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,450
Well... uh... That is...

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,020
Anyone! Is there anyone
who will break this silence?

8
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,210
So, the chronic latecomer is here at last.
You're 13 minutes late...

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,500
Seems your part-time pizza delivery job
was awfully busy today.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,410
I'm sorry... Professor... Kronecker...

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,950
Now, then, let me ask you a question
before you sit down.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,980
Do you have enough strength
to tell me what the basis was

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,650
for the decision in the Stuttgart case?

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,590
Huh? Uh... yes. Well...

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,000
The accused claimed that
the kidnapping was a sham

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,670
and that the victim's death
had been due to an accident.

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,800
After an investigation
of the crime scene

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,970
it was found that the victim's death
had indeed been accidental.

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,440
And so, based on the fact that the intent
to kill must be proven in a murder

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,510
I believe that a sentence
of 15 years was handed down.

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,130
Very good.
Sit down, Nina Fortner.

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,790
Yes, Professor!

23
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,180
Heidelberg,
(Germany)

24
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,760
You saved us, Nina.

25
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,770
The Girl of Heidelberg

26
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,160
If no one had been able to
give him the answer,

27
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,220
Kronecker would have probably
demanded 50-page reports.

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,530
50 pages, if we were lucky.

29
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,570
I have to treat Nina, to whom we're
greatly indebted, to something to eat.

30
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,700
You can come, can't you Nina?
Just the two of us...

31
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,200
Nina Fortner

32
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,110
I'm sorry, Peter.
I have a club meeting today.

33
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,980
See you!

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,780
She turned you down again...

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,210
Peter, how many times was that?

36
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,480
Shut up! I'd like to see if there's anyone
who can get Nina to agree to a date.

37
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,960
I-I give up!

38
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,340
Oh, no! If I'm late with my deliveries,

39
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm going to get it
from the manager again!

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm home!
Boy, am I hungry!

41
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,060
Oh, my, the neighbors
can probably hear you.

42
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,730
You're a young lady now.
It's not becoming.

43
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,430
Go and wash your hands.

44
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,070
Yes, ma'am!

45
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,310
Oh! Mom, did you
color your hair?

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,700
It looks good, doesn't it?

47
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,980
Honestly! You shouldn't be dying
your hair so bright, at your age!

48
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,780
You're wrong, Dad.
She looks lovely.

49
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,550
She's not going to
a masquerade party, after all.

50
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,480
Wouldn't it be wonderful
for Mom to be young forever?

51
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,960
Hi, Dad...

52
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,960
Oh, yes... Speaking of masquerades...

53
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,660
I saw some kids in costumes today.

54
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,640
Oh, yes...
It's the St. Hadrian Costume Parade.

55
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,100
I wish I had dressed up like that
when I was little. They were so cute!

56
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,910
Huh? Oh... you did dress up
in a costume.

57
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,580
Isn't that right, dear?

58
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,250
O-Oh... that's right.

59
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,550
Huh?

60
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,150
Let's see... It's around here...

61
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,950
Oh, here it is!
Here, look at this!

62
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,170
It's true...

63
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,490
You were so excited
and made such a fuss.

64
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,740
Isn't that right, dear?

65
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,170
Huh? Oh, that's right.

66
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,550
A costume parade?

67
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,430
Distant spring.

68
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,630
I forlornly wait for a spring
that will never come... Hannah.

69
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,430
Oh, Hannah... Will you hurry
and get over your broken heart?!

70
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,870
Huh?!

71
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,770
Let me send you
the world's most beautiful flower.

72
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,850
I was born to blanket you in flowers...

73
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,690
Wow... I wonder who sent this.

74
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,710
Aha!
I'm very impressed, Peter!

75
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,260
How have you been, Nina?

76
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,760
Yes, well, I've been very well,
thankfully, Dr. Gaitel.

77
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,490
That's good.

78
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,560
Of course, I could tell by the look
on your face when you entered

79
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,160
this counseling room
that your were doing well.

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,270
And do you no longer
have that dream?

81
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,370
Of that monster appearing
out of the darkness...

82
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,480
Yes! I've been sleeping so well,
I have no time to dream.

83
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,590
I wonder why I was plagued by
such a dream night after night.

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,960
It's common for people to become
insecure during their student years.

85
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,520
Dreams of the future become
confused with other insecurities,

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,030
and you lose sight of who you are.

87
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,530
But what you are is something
you can spend your whole life

88
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,540
trying to learn, and never discover.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,210
All you can do now is be prepared
to spend your whole life searching,

90
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,110
and do only what you can do
toward your future.

91
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,010
Yes. I will do my best.
I want to become a public prosecutor.

92
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,820
That's good. All right, I think we can
end our counseling session for today.

93
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,750
Thank you very much.

94
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,330
Nina Fortner... Such a cheerful girl...

95
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,030
But I can't help but feel
that her cheerfulness

96
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,130
is a reaction to something
she's running away from.

97
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,470
Some... vast... darkness...

98
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,080
What?

99
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,310
Don't say that.
Don't act so innocent.

100
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,650
What in the world
are you talking about?

101
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,480
"I was born to
blanket you in flowers..."

102
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,960
I never thought you had
the makings of a poet.

103
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,820
I don't know anything about that.

104
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,590
I wouldn't be able to come up with words
like those even if I stood on my head.

105
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,060
Huh? Then, who was it?

106
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,670
I've given my email address
to only my friends.

107
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,110
Who knows?

108
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,140
Damn. All I know is that
I have another rival in love!

109
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,050
Who in the world could it be?

110
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,780
This bizarre murder
that took place in Munich...

111
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,290
The perpetrator,
after shooting the parents to death,

112
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,460
strangled the two children with a rope.

113
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,430
Now, I'd like you to explain the ruling
of the judge from the court records...

114
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,610
Nina Fortner.

115
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,710
Huh?

116
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,510
Do you not understand the question?

117
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,110
N-No... uh...

118
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,120
The trial was focused on
the cold-blooded murder

119
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,380
of a whole family...

120
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,230
- Huh?
- The evidence...

121
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,950
The evidence...

122
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,630
Oh? There are times
you can't answer either, Nina?

123
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,510
Nina!

124
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,500
What's wrong, Nina?

125
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,710
Nina!?

126
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,450
Are you all right?
You want to go to the infirmary?

127
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,360
I-I'm all right.
I just felt a little ill...

128
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,220
After listening to the professor's story...
suddenly...

129
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,720
Huh? You mean that bizarre
massacre of that family?

130
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,900
Stop it!

131
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,500
Is that it?

132
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,930
I thought you were awfully brave,

133
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,410
but you're more sensitive
than I expected.

134
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,370
Did you see a horror movie
that terrified you as a child?

135
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,400
I know! I'll bet that counselor,
Dr. Gaitel, would probably say...

136
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,150
"If you look back on
why this happened,

137
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,650
you'll find it was nothing significant.

138
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,250
Now, why don't you think back
on your childhood..."

139
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,820
I don't remember...

140
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,290
Huh?

141
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,600
I don't remember anything
before the age of ten...

142
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,450
My memories...
My childhood memories...

143
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,130
Huh?!

144
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,070
KÃ¶ln,
(Germany)

145
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,470
Yes...

146
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,740
They were a very nice couple...
To think they were killed like that...

147
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,810
Huh? Children?

148
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,380
Oh, now that you mention it,
they had a son.

149
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,680
His name was Michael, I think.
They lived together about two years.

150
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,910
A boy? Was there a boy?

151
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,490
Yes, there was.

152
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,760
Wasn't his name Michael?
He was around fourteen.

153
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,900
Michael, you say?
I seem to remember him.

154
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,160
Why? Are you the police?

155
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,540
Yes. Michael Reichmann.
He was a student in my class.

156
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,430
But he didn't leave
much of an impression.

157
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,310
I'm embarrassed to say this,
but I don't remember him well.

158
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm not sure if he had any friends.
And, there are no records...

159
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,780
Everything burned
in a fire six years ago.

160
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,530
<i>There definitely was a boy
named Michael living here</i>

161
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,470
<i>in Cologne until six years ago...</i>

162
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,440
<i>And... Michael's real name...</i>

163
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,810
<i>Johan... I've used that name before...</i>

164
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,610
<i>Who... are you?</i>

165
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,190
<i>But what's the use in knowing that?
What's the use?</i>

166
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,190
<i>He is a serial-killer who is a twin...
That's all there is.</i>

167
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,860
<i>What am I doing?</i>

168
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,040
<i>A twin! What about his sister?
Where did his twin sister go?!</i>

169
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,070
"I will come for you soon..."

170
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Who is this?

171
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,670
You'll come for me soon?
What does that mean?

172
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,230
A child? Yes, there was...
about 7 or 8 years ago.

173
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,270
So Mr. and Mrs. Heinemann,
who were killed, were fostering a boy?

174
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,810
What was he like?

175
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,770
What was he like?

176
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,030
That was a long time ago.

177
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,670
And he only lived with them
about a year.

178
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,580
I don't remember
anything about him.

179
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,350
Didn't that boy have a sister?

180
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,080
It was only that boy.

181
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,580
Listen, I just want to forget about
what happened to that couple.

182
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,750
I even thought about moving away
after it happened.

183
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,370
I know about that boy.

184
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,940
Come on in. I was just about to
fix some tea.

185
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,350
Have a seat.

186
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,320
Uh... yes. Thank you.
Uh... I...

187
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,850
Have a seat.

188
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,610
Please have some tea.

189
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
Thank you very much.

190
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,790
You're a doctor, aren't you?

191
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,630
That boy told me.
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

192
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,030
He's coming for you?

193
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,210
Who?

194
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,610
I have no idea.
It was an anonymous message.

195
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,510
You look so happy.

196
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,250
You're not thinking a prince
on a white horse

197
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,050
will be coming for you, are you?

198
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,290
Are you jealous?

199
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,950
There you go,
daydreaming again, Nina.

200
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,790
"I was born to blanket you in flowers..."

201
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,560
There aren't any kids
who talk like that today.

202
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh!

203
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,840
Say, listen. Haven't you noticed
a strange boy in class recently?

204
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,440
Oh! Yes, I have!

205
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,740
The one who calmly sits in
that "legendary seat"in Room 12,

206
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,340
where you're bound to be called on
by the teacher.

207
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,050
And yet, he's never called on.

208
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,950
That's right. And do you know,
he stares at Nina all through class!

209
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
- Huh?
- He's the one!

210
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,290
What?

211
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,820
You know!

212
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,260
Your prince on the white horse!

213
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,230
That boy was extremely grateful
to you, Dr. Tenma.

214
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,140
He said you were the one
who saved him;

215
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,440
you meant more to him than a parent.

216
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,740
What name did he go by?

217
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,310
Franz... But he said
it wasn't his real name.

218
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,350
He trusted you enough
to tell you that?

219
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,630
That Franz, who had shown up
out of the blue,

220
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,390
was cared for by
Mr. and Mrs. Heinemann,

221
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,630
who lived in the flat across the hall,
for a year.

222
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:53,600
No, actually, it was 14 months
from March 1987 to April 1988.

223
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,910
Then, one day, he suddenly vanished.

224
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,550
He was very bright.
And he was well-mannered.

225
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,350
Did he used to
come to this apartment?

226
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,690
Every day. I lived alone
so I always welcomed him.

227
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,360
He sat in that seat
and spent his time studying.

228
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,930
In no time, he had mastered

229
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
the English and French
that I taught him.

230
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,380
By the time he disappeared,
he was fluent in both.

231
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,610
That 12-year-old boy...

232
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,250
Is there anything else
you remember about him?

233
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,150
He always listened closely
to my stories.

234
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,860
What stories do you think
he was most interested in?

235
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,600
Well...

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,860
War stories.

237
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,070
War?

238
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,190
During World War II,

239
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,330
I was on the crew of a U-boat.

240
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,470
His favorite story
was about the time

241
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,530
we were attacked by a destroyer
of the Allied Forces...

242
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,010
We were at a depth of 120 meters...

243
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,710
We were attacked by the enemy

244
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,190
and although we had suffered
a fatal blow, we kept going.

245
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,380
Inside that groaning ship,
we all waited in terror.

246
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,260
We returned from that living hell
38 hours later.

247
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,970
An ordinary child would probably

248
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,030
look at this as
another adventure story...

249
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,200
But that boy was different.

250
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,410
What he was
most interested in was...

251
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,600
the terror.

252
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,570
Extreme terror.

253
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,640
What is the reaction of a person
standing on the edge of death?

254
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,210
That was his only interest.

255
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
He took pleasure in terror!

256
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,000
Wh-What sort of expression

257
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,590
did he have while
listening to your stories?

258
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,570
Probably had a gleam in his eye,
and a smile on his face.

259
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,310
Probably?

260
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,900
I am blind, you see.

261
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:13,740
Yes. I know neither his real name,
nor what he looks like.

262
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,990
Earlier, you said that boy
trusted me, didn't you?

263
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,620
He never trusts anybody.

264
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,290
There's only one person
he's ever trusted... his sister.

265
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,930
I-I'm looking for that sister!!

266
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,870
He said he would go and collect her
when she turned twenty.

267
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,040
Go where?

268
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,570
To Heidelberg.

269
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,850
See you later!

270
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,240
Ride carefully on your scooter.

271
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,290
I will!

272
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,750
Bye, Dad!

273
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,990
Be careful.

274
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,030
Good bye!

275
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,500
I guess it's time...

276
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,370
But...

277
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,810
We decided, didn't we?

278
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,510
That we'd tell her on her 20th birthday
that she's not our child.

279
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,960
Hey, wait, I can't...

280
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,360
What are you saying?
You wanted to meet him.

281
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,560
We told him you'd wait for him here.

282
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,360
Don't screw up,
with your "prince on a white horse."

283
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,600
See you later!

284
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,530
Oh... Clara! Beata!

285
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,810
How could they do this
behind my back!

286
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,810
Oh, look!

287
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,950
He's here!

288
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,090
H-How do you do...
You're Nina Fortner?

289
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,530
Y-Yes...

290
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,570
Uh... I'm Otto Hubermann...

291
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,110
Oh, hello...

292
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,760
<i>Who is he...?</i>

293
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,500
<i>Who is he?</i>

294
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,030
<i>I've seen him... somewhere... before...</i>

295
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,810
<i>Who are you?</i>

296
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,630
Huh? Huh?

297
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,030
- Nina!
- Nina!

298
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,370
Nina! What's wrong?
Are you all right?

299
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,070
- Nina, wake up!
- Nina! Nina!?

300
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,540
- Nina, wake up!
- Nina!

301
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,840
- Hey, Nina!
- Hey, Nina!

302
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,100
Nina, are you all right?!

303
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,530
The Missing
