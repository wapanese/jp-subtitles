1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,030
It looks like another scorcher today.

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,260
Hey, it's summer,
yet you're all bundled up.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,570
Aren't you hot?

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,770
What's that?
That paper's three days old.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,050
They say this time a middle-aged couple
in Verden was killed.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,610
I hear the killer is a doctor...

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,850
Oh, yeah... You said you're going
to Verden, didn't you?

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,860
You know someone there?

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,230
Yeah... I don't know if I can
meet up with him or not, but...

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,590
I have to go there...

11
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,990
The Girl and the Seasoned Soldier

12
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,070
Giessen Police Station
(Germany)

13
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,550
You got your start
in the French Foreign Legion.

14
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,180
After going off on your own, you joined
the fighting in Nicaragua in 1979.

15
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,120
From 1981 to 1984 you aided
the Afghan rebel guerillas...

16
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,830
In 1987, you played a central role
in the Mossad's secret operation

17
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,100
to assassinate Islamic extremists.

18
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,340
What a brilliant fighting record,
Hugo Bernhardt...

19
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,050
Since a mercenary such as you
is sponsoring this seminar,

20
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,950
I'm sure you must have some
outstanding students graduating...

21
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,690
It might be a good idea to send
our young ones to attend your lectures

22
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,820
and have you whip them into shape.

23
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,930
Yes, well...

24
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,190
Incidentally...

25
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,900
Was this man outstanding?
I believe he showed up

26
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,710
at your training grounds
about five months ago.

27
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,970
He is brilliant with a scalpel...

28
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,080
but did he show an aptitude
with a pistol?

29
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,350
I have no wish to speak
about my students...

30
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,550
I see.

31
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,850
Five Months Ago

32
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,090
Have you ever learned
to shoot a gun?

33
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,530
No...

34
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,130
So you're self-taught...

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,570
No...

36
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,900
I've never shot a gun before...

37
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,470
Not once?

38
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,870
No... I know I'm asking
for the impossible, but...

39
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,210
I have no choice
but to ask you for help.

40
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,610
Anyway, anyone
who comes here is asked

41
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,680
to forget all he's learned about guns.

42
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,060
But...

43
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,450
I've never had anyone
who'd never shot a gun before.

44
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,000
Jump rope...

45
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,730
Regardless of your experience,
this is where everyone starts.

46
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,860
Just like that child...

47
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,970
Don't just stand there!

48
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,020
Get busy!

49
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,310
Y-Yes, sir!

50
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,860
Faster.

51
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,430
Faster!

52
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,010
Watch your balance! Your balance!

53
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,510
Faster!

54
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,220
Faster!

55
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,820
I just can't do it as well as you do...

56
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,520
Do you always keep an eye
on the trainees for the trainer?

57
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,460
Okay, okay, you needn't glare at me
that way. I'll do it.

58
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,640
I must do it.

59
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh, a brambling...

60
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,690
I wonder if it's looking for food
for its chicks.

61
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,610
Are you so exhausted that
you've lost your appetite?

62
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,000
Huh? Yes...

63
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,810
Eating is part of your training.

64
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,550
Yes, sir...

65
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,410
Is she your child... or, your grandchild?

66
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,180
No...

67
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,090
That child's mother
was shot and killed by me.

68
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,820
Right before her eyes... in Myanmar...

69
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,370
When I ran into a hut in the jungles
for shelter, they were there.

70
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,940
The mother was holding a gun

71
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,480
If I'd been a fraction
of a second slower,

72
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,990
I'd have been shot dead.

73
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,910
And that's why
I brought that child here.

74
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,000
Since she began living with me,
that child has never smiled.

75
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,300
She'll probably die hating me...

76
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,370
When you have a gun,
that sort of thing happens.

77
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,810
If you don't like it, you're better off
never picking up a gun.

78
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,060
What's that?

79
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,960
Something smells nice...
It smells like daphne blossoms...

80
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,120
Thanks...

81
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,160
That's enough.

82
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,670
Huh? Then?

83
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,270
It's time for some running.

84
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,850
Oh, I see...

85
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,880
When you're done running,
come to the low ground in the back.

86
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,150
Huh?

87
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,290
Low ground?

88
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,510
The firing range.

89
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,560
Firing range...

90
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,060
Remember, twice...

91
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,970
Whenever you shoot your gun,
pull the trigger twice.

92
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,090
By pulling the trigger twice,
you raise the probability

93
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,540
that you'll get your target.

94
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,540
If you can't do that,
consider yourself dead.

95
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,260
What is this?

96
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,630
You're always preparing meals for me,

97
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,260
so today I decided to make you
some Japanese food.

98
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,200
This is called <i>nikujaga</i>.
I hope you'll like it.

99
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,640
Those are chopsticks.
They're carved out of wood.

100
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,650
I thought they would enhance
the Japanese feel of the dish.

101
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,820
You're good...

102
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,830
You use those chopsticks well.

103
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,880
Once more!

104
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,010
Aim!

105
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,410
Do it again!

106
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,050
Aim!

107
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,130
What's wrong?

108
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,730
Oh, it's a brambling chick.
I guess it fell out of its nest.

109
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,100
Oh... no, no!

110
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,400
You have to return it to its nest!

111
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,530
That chick is going to die!

112
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,550
It's very difficult to raise it
away from its nest.

113
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,510
It's rare that you
can do it successfully.

114
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,320
Let's return it to its nest...
to its mother.

115
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,130
Three seconds!

116
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
Everything is determined
in three seconds!

117
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,540
If there's even an instant of hesitation,
the one killed will be you.

118
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,780
So...

119
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,250
How was his performance record
when he finished the course?

120
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,020
Technically, he had a perfect score,
and his physical condition also improved.

121
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,390
His concentration
was phenomenal. However...

122
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,460
However?

123
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,530
Being able to shoot a person
is another issue altogether.

124
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh?

125
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,340
Whether he's able to shoot
his first person will determine

126
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,040
whether he will or won't be able to
use his gun.

127
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,110
I see... I wonder which way he'll go...

128
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,180
Well, never mind about that.
Do you have any idea where he went?

129
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,530
I'd like you to tell me if you do know...

130
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,400
<i>Thank you for everything,
these five months...</i>

131
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,440
<i>Enclosed is the rest of my tuition.</i>

132
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,080
<i>And please help yourself
to the nikujaga.</i>

133
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,220
<i>You have my sincere thanks.</i>

134
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,000
Jeez...

135
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,420
Damn...

136
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,330
She laughed...

137
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,030
How about it? You do know where
he went, don't you?

138
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,140
I can't tell you that.

139
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,890
That's fine... You may leave.

140
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,100
This way.

141
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,490
A Past Erased
