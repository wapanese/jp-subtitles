1
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,940
Yes?

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,540
Sorry for calling on you so early.
I'm from the state police.

3
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,650
Are you Dr. Tenma?

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,120
What can I do for you?

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,280
Excuse me, but were you at home
all night?

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,160
No... I was out drinking
until it was nearly morning...

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,830
What about it?

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,860
The truth is,

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,460
Eisler Memorial Hospital's
Director Heinemann;

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,370
Chief of Surgery, Dr. Oppenheim,
and Dr. Boyer are dead.

11
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,490
In any case, no one except the police
are allowed at the scene of the crime!

12
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,040
A Murder

13
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,970
Even so, you are obstructing
the operations of the hospital.

14
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,060
The Press is not allowed

15
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,200
- inside the hospital!
- Please don't do anything

16
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,040
to excite the patients!

17
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,580
Was it an accident?
Or was it murder?

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,700
Three people died at the same time!
Of course it was murder!

19
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,910
Are you from the hospital?

20
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,610
Do you know anything
about this incident?

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,410
Out of my way!
Let me through!

22
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,350
Hey! No one is allowed in!

23
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,790
I'm Dr. Kenzo Tenma of this hospital!

24
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,180
Oh... go right ahead.
Hey! Don't push!

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,150
So, did you see anyone suspicious?

26
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,290
Wait a minute.
Now is not the time...

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,030
- Now is not the time...
- Dr. Tenma!

28
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,600
Dr. Tenma! The Director!

29
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,660
Doctor!

30
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,570
Everyone, calm down!
Are the emergencies taken care of?

31
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,260
W-Well, even at this time...

32
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,600
there's been no end
to the emergencies.

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,470
There are two patients
waiting to be operated on...

34
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,580
I understand. I'll help out!

35
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,510
Take care of the car accident victim
with the brain contusion.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,740
I'll go to the X-ray Reading Room
to look at the x-rays first.

37
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,120
What about the other case?

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,950
A patient who collapsed due to a stroke.

39
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,280
Oh, Doctor, will you help us
in our investigation?

40
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,950
Now is not the time...

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,920
I know that,
but the initial investigation is vital!

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,860
Do you know of anyone with a grudge
against the director and the others?

43
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,860
A grudge?

44
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,130
<i>You may consider your path
to becoming</i>

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,930
<i>the doctor you envisioned closed.</i>

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,170
Huh? Do you know something?

47
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh... No.

48
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,550
Dr. Tenma!

49
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,080
Trouble! Those kids...
The twin brother and sister...

50
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,290
We can't find them anywhere!

51
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,600
Is the sister's bed empty, too?

52
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,690
I looked!
But they're nowhere to be found...

53
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,040
<i>What's going on?</i>

54
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,770
<i>What in the world has happened?</i>

55
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,850
...compassionately extended
a helping hand.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,520
We will surely praise his lifetime
of achievements through eternity.

57
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,360
Farewell Dr. Heinemann.
Rest in peace. Amen.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
Father...

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,270
- Eva...
- Eva.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,970
I know it's difficult,
but pull yourself together...

61
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,010
Let me go!

62
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,380
Give back my father!
Father!

63
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,620
It's just too much, Dr. Tenma.

64
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,260
Yeah...

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Up until now, she lived an easy life
as the director's daughter...

66
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,640
Now suddenly,
she's just an ordinary person.

67
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,860
It must be a big shock...

68
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,630
How can you say that
at a time like this?

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,040
Oh, pardon me.

70
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,140
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

71
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,980
I am Detective Visbaugh

72
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,520
of the Nordhein-Westfalen
Police Department.

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
Thank you for your efforts.

74
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,720
This was such a tragic incident...

75
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,050
Yes...

76
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,380
Let me introduce you. This is...

77
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,310
German Federal Criminal Police Office [BKA]
Inspector Lunge

78
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,090
I am Inspector Lunge of the BKA.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
I've heard rumors that
you are a brilliant physician.

80
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,730
Not at all. I've still got
a long ways to go.

81
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,210
Um... Have you any idea
where the children are?

82
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,880
Never mind them.

83
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,240
We have determined what caused

84
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,780
the death of the director
and the other two.

85
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,350
We found a nitrate type poison
in their bodies.

86
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,050
Nitrates...
That means a muscular relaxant...

87
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,920
As expected of a doctor.
You are knowledgeable...

88
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,990
But how could something like that...

89
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,460
It was candy.

90
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,400
Candy?!

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,160
The same candy wrapper
was found beside each body,

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,600
and the same candy was found
in their stomachs.

93
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,610
By the way...

94
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,700
Would you have any idea
where the three of them

95
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,140
might get a hold of
something like that?

96
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,050
I don't know anything about that.
What about the search for the twins?

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,350
The BKA has
taken over the investigation.

98
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,850
Don't worry about it.

99
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,420
This incident may have started

100
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,590
when the parents of those twins
were shot and killed.

101
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,160
Their parents defected
from East Germany

102
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,100
and were killed by someone.

103
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,930
Then, the director and doctors
of the hospital

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,870
where the children were taken to
were killed.

105
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,700
There is also the possibility
that this is political terrorism.

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,640
Those children might be
holding a major clue.

107
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,210
Please.
Please find them.

108
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,910
We will do our best.

109
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,520
Then...

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,760
Before the incident, the Director
removed him from his position as Chief.

111
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,490
Furthermore, the Director's daughter
broke off her engagement to him...

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,770
But he was in a bar drinking
at the time of the incident.

113
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
He has an alibi...

114
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,700
Umm...
May I ask you something?

115
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,800
Why do you move
your hand like that?

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,870
Huh?
Oh, I'm typing.

117
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,150
What?

118
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,180
I'm inputting all the information into
the disk in my head.

119
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,850
When I press the key
to extract the information...

120
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,950
"Not at all. I still have
a long ways to go."

121
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,760
That's what Dr. Tenma bashfully said
when I called him brilliant.

122
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,600
The police? Do they suspect you
of doing something?

123
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,700
It's because there's enough evidence
for me to be a suspect.

124
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,650
Don't worry about it.

125
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,880
They were quite persistent
when they questioned me, too.

126
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,020
I'm exhausted...

127
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,880
When the dust from this thing settles,
I think I'll go back to Japan...

128
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,450
- What?
- I came to Germany to do research,

129
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,130
but due to the recent chain of events,

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,070
I feel like I've gone back to saving lives,
the true duty of a doctor.

131
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,300
Hey, don't be so depressing.

132
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,260
I'm tired...

133
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm just so tired...

134
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,180
Your progress is favorable,
Mr. Buchner.

135
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,350
Thank you, Dr. Tenma.
Do you think I can work again?

136
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,650
Yes, of course.

137
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,530
My store will go under
if I'm not there.

138
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,890
But you mustn't overdo it.

139
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,500
I'll go have a drink there
after you're released.

140
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,290
I'll be there to make sure
you don't overdo things.

141
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,860
Dr. Tenma

142
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,140
Yes?

143
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,440
I heard that you were
leaving this hospital.

144
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,800
Is that true?

145
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,280
What?

146
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,040
Please don't quit.

147
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,110
There aren't any
good doctors like you.

148
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,050
Please don't say you're quitting.

149
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,660
Please.

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,990
Mr. Buchner...

151
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,020
Dr. Tenma, the Chairman
is asking for you.

152
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,800
The board is discussing who should
succeed to the empty posts.

153
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,900
Up until now, the Director's faction
has filled the major positions...

154
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,400
There will be a considerable
purging of personnel.

155
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,540
The rumor is Dr. Eckner
is being transferred

156
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,810
to a small hospital in Bavaria.

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,310
- Is that so...
- Umm, Dr. Tenma!

158
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,380
- Huh?
- No matter what the Chairman says,

159
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,420
please don't give up!

160
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,420
We're all behind you!

161
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,960
Please don't leave this hospital!

162
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,570
Huh?

163
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,270
I'll say it again.
I am performance oriented.

164
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,640
Dr. Tenma, you are appointed to
Chief of Surgery.

165
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,780
<i>What a life...</i>

166
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,150
<i>I went against the orders
of the Director,</i>

167
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,950
<i>lost my position as Chief,</i>

168
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,820
<i>and my engagement to Eva
was dissolved.</i>

169
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,320
<i>As soon as I decide to work
as a simple doctor</i>

170
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,090
<i>without any hope of promotion...</i>

171
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,040
Wh-What a life!

172
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,490
I'm sorry for calling you out.

173
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,120
I heard you've been appointed
Chief of Surgery. That's very good.

174
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,900
Thank you...

175
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:24,630
Kenzo... At my father's funeral,
you tried to comfort me, didn't you?

176
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,540
Oh... not really...

177
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,780
It made me happy...

178
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,470
A lot of things happened between us,
but I'd like to try again.

179
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,660
Kenzo!

180
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,430
Kenzo!

181
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
Please! I was wrong!

182
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,300
I want to try again!

183
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Kenzo...

184
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,440
Kenzo!

185
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,950
9 Years Later

186
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,610
The patient hospitalized
for a spinal cord tumor...

187
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,770
His paralysis has accelerated.

188
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,720
I understand.
I'll perform the operation.

189
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,980
If you will, Chief of Surgery.

190
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,090
Make the arrangements
for the operation.

191
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,630
Yes, sir!

192
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,440
Honestly, when will this flood recede?

193
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,680
1995
KÃ¶ln,
(Germany)

194
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,470
I thought the world would change

195
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,610
when the Berlin Wall came down
six years ago,

196
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,010
but nothing good has happened.

197
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,620
Even with the unification of Europe,

198
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,210
hopeless people from all over
come flowing in.

199
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,280
Yeah. There's been an increase in
unexplainable crimes.

200
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,660
Oops...

201
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,030
Inspector, we've arrived.

202
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,590
Both victims had their throats
slit open with a knife.

203
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,040
Their identities?

204
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
The Reichmanns of Stich Drive

205
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,910
They were murdered in their home.

206
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,810
We believe that they were
hidden in a closet,

207
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,640
and their bodies floated out
because of the flood.

208
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,710
A murder of a middle-aged couple.

209
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,840
There have been four incidents
in Germany

210
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,250
over the past two years.

211
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,720
All by the same method.

212
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,980
It's probably a robber who targets
rich middle-aged couples.

213
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
No, it's too soon
to call them robberies.

214
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,760
According to the data,
for some reason,

215
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,230
all of the couples
did not have children.

216
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,160
This couple certainly
did not have any children.

217
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,070
Don't you think there are
too many similarities

218
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,940
to call them robberies?

219
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,370
But money and goods have been
taken from all of the victims' homes...

220
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,580
All of them totaling very little.

221
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,290
It would make sense
if a single perpetrator did it.

222
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,120
Are you suggesting that
there wasn't a single perpetrator?

223
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,820
Two of the homes had
extremely strong locks and alarms.

224
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,290
But the perpetrator opened them
and entered very easily.

225
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,700
Also, all the couples did not seem to
fight back when they were killed

226
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,400
and the neighbors did not hear
any noise at the time of the incidents.

227
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,600
Don't you think they were
too skillfully done

228
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,340
for it to have been done by
a single individual?

229
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,240
Do you know this man?

230
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,720
No.

231
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,550
Adolph Junkers, 32 years old.

232
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,510
He has been convicted twice
for larceny.

233
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,260
His role was to open locks...
In other words, he's a lock picker.

234
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,490
He was seen near the scene

235
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,160
of three of the murders
of middle-aged couples.

236
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,790
Then did this man do it?

237
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,930
I can't say.

238
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,800
Well, that's the extent
of your work as state police.

239
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,240
Leave the rest to the BKA.

240
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,940
Uh... yeah...

241
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,250
Oh!

242
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,520
It didn't fly after all.
I've never flown a kite before.

243
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,320
It almost went up.

244
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,150
Well, how was the girl last night?

245
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,760
How was she?
She was a nice person.

246
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,060
Hey, hey, she's the daughter
of a director, you know.

247
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,600
Don't tell me you just had dinner
and saw her home.

248
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,010
Well, there was an emergency call
during dinner,

249
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,670
so I had to come back to the hospital.

250
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,840
What's that?! You'd better rethink that
all work and no play doctrine!

251
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,380
You're going to lose a great catch
and regret it some day!

252
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,880
Hey! Are you listening,
Chief of Surgery?!

253
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,420
A kite?

254
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,750
Good morning, Chief.

255
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,420
Is that yours, Karl?

256
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,550
My grandpa gave it to me,
but it just won't fly...

257
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,200
Could it be it's unbalanced?

258
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,930
Chief, can you fly a kite?

259
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,960
I did it often during my childhood in Japan.

260
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,440
Try holding it up high, Karl.

261
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,540
Like this?

262
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,110
That's right.
Now... will it work?

263
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,050
- Heave ho!
- There!

264
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,920
- There we go!

265
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,830
It's flying!

266
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,600
I did it!

267
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,460
Oh, my...

268
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,370
If I were in his shoes,
I'd have at least five lovers.

269
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,640
Honestly...

270
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,910
That's amazing, Dr. Tenma.

271
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,810
Get well quickly
and fly it yourself, Karl.

272
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,250
Yeah!

273
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,890
Today's surgery is
a parasellar meningioma extirpation.

274
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,530
We'll proceed with
a right pterional approach.

275
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,900
Yes!

276
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,160
Watch closely. Chief Tenma
will perform the surgery himself.

277
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,800
What a splendid operation.

278
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,340
He's hardly retracted the brain at all!

279
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,040
He truly is a surgical genius.

280
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,840
You residents should treat the brain
with tender care.

281
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,810
Always keep this in mind.

282
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,840
Huh?

283
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,760
This is terrible!

284
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,880
- Look at the blood!
- Ambulance! Call an ambulance!

285
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,190
I-I didn't do it!
It's not my fault.

286
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,460
This man ran into the street suddenly!

287
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,330
This is the patient?

288
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,040
Yes.

289
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,170
How is his condition?

290
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,870
Well, I can't say...
There's nothing more we can do...

291
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,480
He's a material witness
in a certain case.

292
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,820
His testimony alone
could solve a serial murder case.

293
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,450
We can't have him die.

294
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,750
But the patient is
in a very critical condition.

295
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,450
Nothing more can be done
at our hospital...

296
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,920
There's a terrific brain surgeon
at Eisler Memorial Hospital.

297
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,090
If he came...

298
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,560
Brain surgeon...

299
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,530
You mean Dr. Tenma...

300
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,140
Thank you for coming all this way,
Dr. Tenma.

301
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,540
How is the patient's condition?

302
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,390
He is in a coma.
And one of his pupils is dilated.

303
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,750
It's been a long time, Dr. Tenma.

304
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,650
Um... I'm sorry,
but who are you?

305
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,390
It's been nine years.
Not since the Director's funeral...

306
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,900
If I'm not mistaken,
you're with the BKA.

307
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,090
Inspector Lunge.

308
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,500
Please make this operation a success
for the sake of the BKA.

309
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,870
Huh?

310
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,310
The patient has to live.
He holds the key to solving a big case.

311
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,450
I don't operate
for the sake of the police.

312
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,250
I do it for the sake of the patient.

313
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,750
That's fine...

314
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,220
Well, I have an operation to perform...

315
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,990
I hear you've become
the Chief of Surgery, Dr. Tenma.

316
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,930
You've been very successful...

317
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,870
Is there a problem?

318
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,000
No. At your age,
it's quite an accomplishment.

319
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,460
Aren't you in line
to become the next Director?

320
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,270
No, that would be
a long way off for me.

321
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,510
About the murders
at the Eisler Memorial Hospital...

322
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,940
There is very little evidence.

323
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,850
The investigation
has been extremely difficult.

324
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,780
The only clue is the poisoned candy.

325
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,390
The methodology means
it is an intelligent crime.

326
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,950
An intelligent crime means

327
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,220
the victim and the assailant
have some sort of interests at stake

328
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,290
What are you trying to tell me?

329
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:08,740
No, excuse me. In this business,
I'm constantly thinking like this.

330
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,100
In any case, rest assured.

331
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,370
All the cases I've ever handled
have been solved.

332
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,450
Every single one.

333
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,640
I hope so.

334
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,620
We will perform a craniotomy
to remove the hematoma.

335
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,160
We must hurry. There is the danger
of the brain hernia worsening.

336
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,600
No matter how you look at it,

337
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,800
only one person greatly benefited from
the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders.

338
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,070
That is you, Dr. Tenma.

339
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,580
Thank you for taking the trouble
to come here.

340
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,060
Not at all. How has
the patient been doing?

341
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,190
He's conscious,
but his right pupil remains dilated...

342
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,330
And he has some paralysis
on the left side.

343
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,900
He's started rehab already, hasn't he?
The paralysis should go away.

344
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,440
He's recovering normally.

345
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,140
Also, the police will want to see him,
but please refuse for now.

346
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,680
But, that detective, Lunge,
is so persistent...

347
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,340
Right now, the patient's recovery
is most important.

348
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,260
How are you feeling, Mr. Junkers?

349
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,330
Mr. Junkers, do you recognize me?

350
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,730
Can you see this finger?

351
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,870
How about it? Can you answer me?

352
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,610
What's that?

353
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,550
The monster... is coming...

354
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,350
What's that, Mr. Junkers?

355
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,420
The monster... is coming...

356
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,220
Coming? What's coming?

357
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,890
The monster is coming...

358
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,900
The monster... is coming...

359
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,760
The monster?!

360
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,530
Night of the Execution
