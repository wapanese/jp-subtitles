1
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,910
I've never seen you before.

2
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,490
If you want to do business,
get permission from the state.

3
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,890
Unlicensed prostitutes are a nuisance.

4
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,900
I can't make much money
if I do it legitimately.

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,290
Get out of here.

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,400
I just have to get permission
from him, don't I?

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,570
Let me meet him.

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,560
Him? What are you talking about?

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,340
I'll keep coming until you
let me meet him...

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,880
The man known as "The Baby."

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Be My Baby

12
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,100
You can't catch it with your hands.

13
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,810
You're not the goalkeeper.

14
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,550
I don't care about the rules!

15
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,350
Where did he go?

16
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,660
He?

17
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,720
Tenma, Tenma!

18
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,990
He told me to stay with you until
he found the man he was looking for.

19
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,200
Me?!

20
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,230
He wants me to look after you?!

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,460
No way!

22
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,340
I hate kids!

23
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,710
Tenma, that bastard...

24
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,000
He doesn't give me any warning
and picks up some strange kid...

25
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,480
What happened to making money
as an unlicensed doctor?

26
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,440
Get a real job.

27
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,250
Pass!

28
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,110
Nice header!

29
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,820
Why you...

30
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,690
What do you think
you're doing, you brat?!

31
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,960
Hey...

32
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,390
I told you that you can't hold the ball
with your hands. That's a yellow card.

33
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,830
Shut up! You can't get through life
being worried about that!

34
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,070
If you say things like that,
you'll get a red card.

35
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,100
Shut up!

36
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,860
Frankfurt Central Station

37
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,080
You're late... Quickly!
Give me the goods...

38
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,610
Give them to me now!

39
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,650
It's been a while, Detective Mesner.

40
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,950
D-Doctor Tenma...

41
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,020
That's right. That's what you
called me then.

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,780
It was the first time we met.

43
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,830
You hadn't even asked
what my occupation was.

44
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,800
But, right now, I'm an ex-doctor.

45
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,300
Come to think of it,
you're an ex-detective.

46
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,540
"Detective dismissed on
suspicion of narcotics use."

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,940
I was surprised when I found
this six-month-old article.

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,180
You'd better not stand up.

49
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,140
I'm pointing a gun at you
from under my coat.

50
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,390
W-What do you want...?

51
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,360
I want to know what you did
ten months ago in Heidelberg...

52
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,600
And who hired you to do that.

53
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
I-I don't know...

54
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,130
You took the lives of
the Fortners and Maurer!

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,010
I didn't do it! I was just a lookout!

56
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,610
My partner, Muller, did it.

57
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,380
Detective Muller also

58
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,420
quit the police immediately after
the incident, didn't he?

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,080
Y-Yeah...

60
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,360
It seems that he took his money
and is doing quite well...

61
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,060
And you, on the other hand,

62
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,760
used up all of your money on drugs
and ended up like this?

63
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,590
He took the request. He did the killing.

64
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,970
He got the larger portion
of the reward!

65
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,870
Someone even tried to kill me
to keep me silent...

66
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm surprised you're still alive.

67
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,740
I was saved by a certain organization.

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,650
"A certain organization?"

69
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,520
That's enough, isn't it? Forgive me.
I've already spoken too much before.

70
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,390
Before? To whom?

71
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,020
Leave me alone already!

72
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,120
I don't have the time for that now!

73
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,300
Withdrawal symptoms, huh?

74
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,500
Drug dealers probably won't
approach you while I'm sitting here.

75
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,400
W-Well...

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,970
"The Baby" saved me!

77
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,410
"The Baby"?

78
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,680
Go to the pub called Candy.
You can meet him there.

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,350
Who is "The Baby"?

80
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,550
He's a big name right-wing extremist.

81
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,020
He's an executive of
two right-wing political parties...

82
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,060
After the Wall fell,

83
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,930
The Baby went to Dresden,
on the east side,

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,690
and tried to make a town
of only pure German people.

85
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,000
But he failed and he's come back.

86
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,030
Why did that man save you?

87
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,040
The darkness.

88
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,810
When the Berlin Wall fell...

89
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,310
A great darkness was born...

90
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,750
A monster... was born...

91
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,560
A monster?

92
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,190
Go already! I told the rest to that girl!

93
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,790
That girl?

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,590
She came for revenge
and pointed a gun at me!

95
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,390
She's the daughter of
the couple we killed!

96
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,540
Anna...

97
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,240
Nina, Nina Fortner came to you?!

98
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,770
I-I was told by "The Baby"...

99
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,640
that I was to send that girl to him
if she appeared!

100
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,420
He said that she's important bait...

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,820
Important... bait?

102
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,090
You again?

103
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,930
You appear every night.

104
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,370
I'll buy you for a good price...

105
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,500
You're the one that said that
I'd get in trouble

106
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,340
if I did business without permission
from The Baby.

107
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,100
What did you say?! Why you...

108
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,180
What's with that look?

109
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,250
Is that the girl that wants to
meet The Baby?

110
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,610
Oh... yes.

111
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,960
Right this way.

112
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,460
Right this way.

113
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,280
Please wait right there.

114
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,620
Huh?

115
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,090
Please wait on that symbol.

116
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,830
Oh. No, no... Right on there.

117
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
That's right.

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,870
Do you know this song?

119
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,110
Its pleasant rhythm will
carry you away, Miss Nina Fortner.

120
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,780
<i>The Baby said...</i>

121
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,320
<i>"This country will be all right
when the second Hitler is born..."</i>

122
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,890
<i>That woman is the bait.</i>

123
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,700
Nina!

124
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,030
How do you know about me?

125
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,060
I know everything.

126
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,100
Your other name is Anna Liebert...

127
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,000
But neither is your real name.

128
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,540
Names don't really matter.

129
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,410
After all, I'm called "The Baby."

130
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,480
Come on, dance, dance!

131
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,950
I heard that you know
where my brother is.

132
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,750
Ah, Johan, huh? That's a good name.

133
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,630
You know, don't you?!

134
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,630
You went as far as to dress like that,

135
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,130
so what do you plan to do
once you do meet him?

136
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,430
I have to kill him.

137
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,370
Don't wave that
dangerous thing around.

138
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,850
It's all right.
Johan will come to meet you.

139
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,540
I lived in this area when I was a kid,
so I know all of the back alleys.

140
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,910
There's an antique dealer
further down.

141
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,420
I'm going to trade
this rug in for money.

142
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,880
What? You don't have
any money, Mr. Heckel?

143
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,690
Shut up. I'm trying to do something
to pay for your dinner... Be thankful...

144
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,160
Huh...?

145
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,270
Huh??

146
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,840
Huh?

147
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,040
Huh?

148
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,530
Whoa...

149
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,040
What's wrong?

150
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,770
This whole area's become
a Turkish district...

151
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,780
This is a fake.

152
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,990
Wha?! What are you talking about?

153
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,920
This design, this feel...

154
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,860
No matter how you look at it,
this is hand woven silk.

155
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,560
This is synthetic.

156
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,120
Well, I feel sorry for you,
so I'll take it for 100 marks.

157
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,730
Aww... That's what I hate!

158
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,870
The previous German store owner
would have given me 10,000 marks.

159
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,840
Then take it with you.

160
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,780
You're going to beg me for it
when you realize it's real.

161
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,650
This is what you would call a real one.

162
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,880
Huh?

163
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,920
It's a 100 percent silk Hereke rug.

164
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,020
Take a close look.
No corners have been cut.

165
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,490
Not even the fine patterns...

166
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,850
It's 150,000 marks.

167
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,620
I-It's probably a fake!

168
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,570
You can't even see that
this rug is real.

169
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,290
Let's go, Dieter.

170
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,740
Say, I'm hungry...

171
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,740
It's real...

172
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,180
Huh?!

173
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,920
It's a genuine high quality rug.

174
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,890
150,000 marks, he says?

175
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,290
At the right place,
it can go for 800,000 marks.

176
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,620
Say, let's get something to eat.

177
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,660
Shut up!

178
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,490
If I get that, you can eat all you want!

179
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,890
Get it? How?

180
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,390
Just leave that to me.

181
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,410
What's with that look?

182
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
Thief!

183
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,540
Whoa, you idiot.
K-Keep your voice down, you brat.

184
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,820
Hold on, what are you planning to do?

185
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,490
Sorry, but try someone else
if you want a customer.

186
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,020
That's not what I meant.

187
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,620
An Asian like you might be killed
if you waltzed in there.

188
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,970
That store's a nest of right-wingers!

189
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,100
You're Turkish, aren't you?

190
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,930
Is it all right to be
doing business here?

191
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,430
Don't be stupid!

192
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,510
I wouldn't think of doing business
in a dump like this!

193
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,310
Those guys took a friend of mine.

194
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,780
It seems like she found out
a secret of theirs...

195
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,190
A secret?

196
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,880
I don't know what it is.
But I have to save her quickly.

197
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,720
Who knows what
she's facing right now...

198
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,160
A woman I know is also in there.

199
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,560
What's she like?

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,190
Could it be the longhaired blond girl?

201
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,860
Who knows? Who knows what
hairstyle she has right now...

202
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,170
They just took her away by car.

203
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,140
Where did they go?!

204
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,340
I don't know.

205
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,770
But The Baby was with them,

206
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,180
so they probably
went to his mansion...

207
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,380
The Baby!

208
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,520
What kind of car was it?!
What color was it?!

209
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,980
Uhh... It was a red Mercedes.

210
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,950
All right... I've got to find that car
and go after it.

211
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,360
Hey! Save my friend, too!

212
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,590
Please.

213
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,160
She has a small child!

214
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,530
Please!

215
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,410
Well, well, you didn't die!

216
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,880
Right this way.

217
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,560
Before that, I'll take your gun.

218
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Go right ahead.

219
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,270
Sit wherever you like...

220
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,550
Are you the girl that
The Baby brought?

221
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,220
Let me see your face.

222
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:57,330
Oh? You're a beautiful girl.
It's as I expected of Johan's sister.

223
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,370
I am Professor Geidlitz.

224
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,220
The man in the picture
with Johan is General Wolf.

225
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,120
There are two others...

226
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,290
Together, the four of us
created this organization.

227
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,250
Would you like some fruit?

228
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,160
Let me meet my brother... Johan.

229
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,470
You'll meet him... He'll show up
once he knows that you're here.

230
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,960
He needs you.

231
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,170
You don't know where
Johan is either, do you?

232
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,770
We need him...

233
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,180
In order to lead us.

234
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,450
Do you know why Hitler
had so much power?

235
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,320
He was an intelligent businessman.

236
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,650
He knew the three essentials.

237
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,230
Control the banks,
stimulate the munitions industry,

238
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,300
and seize the military.

239
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,140
Right now, Johan is secretly
gaining power in one of those...

240
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,650
Do you think that
my reasoning is correct?

241
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,950
What do you plan to do with Johan?

242
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:27,490
However, Hitler achieved what he did
through his charisma.

243
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,020
Hitler failed
his art school examination.

244
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,290
Even in the military, he only made it
as far as corporal...

245
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,390
He became charismatic
once he passed his thirties...

246
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,730
But what about Johan?

247
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,100
He's had a monstrous charisma
since he was a child.

248
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,440
It's as if he were Jesus Christ.

249
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,650
But you mustn't forget

250
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,850
the three wise men from the east
and John the Baptist;

251
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,450
the four amazing people
who first realized Christ's talents.

252
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,460
We four have been paying attention to
Johan's talents since he was a child.

253
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,490
Isn't it wonderful?

254
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,930
What should I do?

255
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,040
We want you to stay here
for a while...

256
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,270
Until Johan comes to meet you...

257
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,400
Don't try to run away.
You've already gone too far.

258
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,240
There's no need to worry.
I wanted to come here...

259
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,450
I'll wait here for Johan!

260
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,790
That's fine...

261
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,580
Now, have some fruit...

262
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,970
It seems like you've
regained consciousness.

263
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,740
There's no need to worry.
We won't break any of your bones...

264
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,490
What were you doing around here,
Doctor Tenma?

265
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,410
H-How do you know who I am?

266
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,320
I'm asking the questions.

267
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,680
You just have to answer them.

268
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,420
What are you planning to do?

269
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,630
What do you plan to do
once you find Johan?

270
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,490
Where is Nina?

271
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,700
I said that I'm asking the questions!

272
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,400
What do you plan to do with Nina?

273
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,830
I thought I told you
not to ask questions!

274
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,020
Nina is an important guest.
Not trash like you.

275
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,350
Then... she's safe, right?

276
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,280
For now...
But she's very dangerous...

277
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,630
She has such a cute face,
but is trying to kill Johan...

278
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,320
We'll eventually have to
deal with people like that...

279
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,860
So Nina is just a tool
in order to call Johan?!

280
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,300
Who are you? What do you plan to...

281
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,540
Another question. Foreigners like you
have no right to question us!

282
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,410
The whole district is going to burn
because of your impudent attitude.

283
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,150
T-The whole district?

284
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,900
That's right... Tomorrow night,
the night sky will be beautiful...

285
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,000
I can meet Johan if I stay here...

286
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,810
Help...

287
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,280
Help...

288
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,680
W-Who are you?

289
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,480
H-Help...

290
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,710
Where are you?

291
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,630
Third floor...

292
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,830
You speak in broken German.

293
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,470
What country are you from?

294
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,640
Turkey...

295
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,670
I'm... going to be killed...

296
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,400
I've got to escape...

297
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,000
You've been confined
by the people here, haven't you?

298
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,940
Help...

299
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,510
But... I've got to stay here...

300
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,650
Please, help.

301
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,480
If I don't let everyone know soon,
my baby will die, as well...

302
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,920
Tomorrow night we'll have a party
to welcome Johan.

303
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,360
Only superior people, like us,
should survive in this world.

304
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,490
All the rest should burn.

305
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,840
I heard them talking...

306
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,840
They're going to set a fire
tomorrow night...

307
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,470
They plan on burning
the Turkish district!

308
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,720
Help!

309
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,710
Help!

310
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,490
Wolf's Confession
