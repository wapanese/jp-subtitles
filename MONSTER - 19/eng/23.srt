1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,000
Wake up!

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,080
Leave me alone.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,080
Why are you still sleeping?

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,330
Wake up!

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,790
There's no way to deal with you.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,040
Geez, this is not a hotel!

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,760
Don't touch me.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,390
Who do you think I am?

9
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,680
Hey. These belong to you.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,150
Verify the contents and sign this.

11
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,490
Eva Heinemann...

12
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,030
I don't want to see you back here.

13
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,780
You were passed out,
drunk, in that back alley.

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,370
You should be thankful you're safe.

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,250
Do you have a cigarette?

16
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,120
Huh?

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,280
I asked you if you had a cigarette.

18
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,050
The station's smoke-free.

19
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,840
Go outside and smoke.

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,880
Eva's Confession

21
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,830
Lighter...

22
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,960
Where did I put it...?

23
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,760
My bag!

24
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,500
Where's my bag?

25
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,300
That's your bag.

26
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,510
No way! I was carrying
another bag. It was bigger.

27
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,390
Someone probably stole it
while you were unconscious.

28
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,940
Why are you doing this?
I had valuable things in there!

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,190
Then why don't you fill out
the stolen possessions form?

30
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,250
I don't think it'll help, though.

31
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,060
You lost your key?

32
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,060
My bag was stolen. Let me in my room.

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,800
What's this?

34
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,590
Oh, man! They really got you.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,970
What a hassle. I'm going to
have to change the locks.

36
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,320
As I was saying yesterday, Miss
Heinemann, about your bill...

37
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,530
The amount you paid is not
enough. If you don't pay more...

38
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,860
Even my suitcase was ransacked.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
Are you listening?

40
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,070
I'm talking about the money you owe
for lodging and changing the lock.

41
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,570
I don't have any money.

42
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,620
Eh?

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,310
I'll just leave.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's really unlucky.

45
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,130
So that's why you're back.

46
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,820
You're the one who said
that I'd never see you again.

47
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,560
After seeing each other again after such a long
time, the least you could do is buy me a drink.

48
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,270
Eva, you didn't lose all your money just
because your bag was stolen, did you?

49
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,990
I've never seen a woman waste money like you.

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
No matter how much money you
have, it'll never be enough.

51
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,280
Your bag stolen or not, you still
wouldn't have any money left.

52
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,620
How much are you going to give me?

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,790
Huh?

54
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,540
I'll sleep with you.

55
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,250
I'm asking you how much money
you're going to give me.

56
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,420
Idiot.

57
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,050
There isn't a man on Earth who'd pay money
to a woman he's slept with countless times.

58
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,800
Buy me a drink.

59
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,470
Just stand out there on the street.

60
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,310
Someone who passes by might
be willing to buy you a drink.

61
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,310
Maybe it'll even be a
middle-aged alcoholic like you.

62
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,070
You definitely didn't forget it here.

63
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,490
Why don't you check the
next place you went to?

64
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,920
I don't remember anything after I went here.

65
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,930
You said there was something valuable
in the bag. If I were you, I'd give up.

66
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,430
It's not something you can
exchange for money.

67
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,580
It's not money...

68
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,180
I've been looking for you.

69
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,680
When I asked at the pub, they said that
you'd walked over in this direction.

70
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,060
Who are you?

71
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,190
You don't remember? We had so
much fun drinking last night!

72
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,860
I drank with you...?

73
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,930
Your bag. I wanted to
give it back to you.

74
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,440
I guess I'll have to introduce myself again.

75
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,660
I'm Roberto.

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,250
Well? Would you like to
get something to eat?

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,840
Your hotel room was ransacked?

78
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,510
You don't seem to be the one who did it.

79
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,470
Of course not. I didn't even open your bag.

80
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,060
The key's in here, as it should be,

81
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,430
though I have no use for it anymore.

82
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,230
I'm sorry. If I had gotten your bag to you earlier,
you wouldn't have had to leave the hotel.

83
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,230
It's not your fault.

84
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,070
I'm grateful that you got my bag back at all.

85
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,950
I'm grateful for that bag.

86
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,370
When you left the bar, you forgot your bag.

87
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,750
I'd thought that would be it, but thanks
to that bag, we're doing this.

88
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,760
There was something important in it, wasn't there?

89
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,960
I guess so.

90
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,520
This is the only possession I have in the world.

91
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,690
An album... May I have a look?

92
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,650
Go ahead.

93
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,070
That's my father.

94
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,870
What a splendid person. He was a
director at a hospital, wasn't he?

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,120
Did I talk about him last night?

96
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,220
Yes. You respected him so much.

97
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,580
He's been gone for ten years. You
were talking about him so sadly.

98
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,050
And this was your fiancé.

99
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,760
Did I even talk about him?

100
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,820
Yes.

101
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,220
His name was... Tenma!

102
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,710
You still can't forget him, can you?

103
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,190
What did I say last night?

104
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,570
You should just forget
about him. I got jealous.

105
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,910
There's nothing on this page.

106
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,910
Oh, really?

107
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,290
Something was here.

108
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,230
I can see where they were ripped out.

109
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,160
I didn't want them, so I ripped them out.

110
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,710
I see.

111
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,130
Hey...

112
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,920
Do you want to go have a drink?

113
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,880
Sounds good to me.

114
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,600
So you were with a security company.

115
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,440
Yes. Nice, in South France.

116
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,460
The man who'd hired me as a
bodyguard for years was killed...

117
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,860
That's when the company collapsed.

118
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,460
We've both been through some hard times.

119
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,160
Let's forget the past.
Now is what's important.

120
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,750
We have to enjoy the present.

121
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
This song...

122
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,510
Al Green...

123
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,680
Do you like this song too?

124
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
Yeah.

125
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,930
Let's dance.

126
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,070
What's wrong?

127
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,730
I'm not very good at dancing.

128
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,900
Put your arms around my lower back.

129
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,990
That's it.

130
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,710
I knew a man who loved this
song and couldn't dance.

131
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,130
Is this what you did with him?

132
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,320
Yes.

133
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,510
This is fun!

134
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,730
How about you? Want another?

135
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,890
No, I'm fine.

136
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,980
You're pretty weak.

137
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,240
Want to go to bed?

138
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,320
Sounds good.

139
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,650
But before that, there's
something I have to ask you.

140
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,750
What's that?

141
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,620
Where are the photos?

142
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,760
What photos?

143
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,760
Don't mess around.

144
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,020
The photos you tore out of the album...
where are you hiding them?

145
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,570
Huh?

146
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,520
I'll tell you once you give me the photos.

147
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,110
You're looking for him,
aren't you? For Tenma...

148
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,920
I know you still have those photos.

149
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,430
Y-You know where Tenma is?

150
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,430
Yes.

151
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,180
Those photos you're talking about
have that little boy in them, right?

152
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,640
His name is Johan.

153
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,930
l saw him.

154
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,050
He's become quite the handsome young man.

155
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,150
I saw him a year ago in Düsseldorf.

156
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,460
Kenzo,

157
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,870
I want to make up.

158
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,630
You...

159
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,090
must be with me.

160
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,380
Kenzo...

161
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,140
You are mine.

162
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,770
I'll take you back...

163
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,110
You're mine.

164
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,840
Düsseldorf

165
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,160
What are you doing now?

166
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,990
I've been hearing rumors.

167
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,570
It's just as those rumors say.

168
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,590
I married and divorced three times.
I've been living off my inheritance.

169
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,080
How've you been, Dr. Becker?

170
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,130
Huh, me?

171
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,220
I'm just as I've always been...

172
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,090
No future for my career.

173
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,090
Tenma is the head surgeon. They say he's
going to be the director someday.

174
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,230
It's fun, though.

175
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,440
Promotions aren't the only thing in life.

176
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,660
I say "no thanks" to a life like Tenma's,
one without any women or fun.

177
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,110
Is Kenzo - I mean, Dr. Tenma - still unmarried?

178
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,050
Yeah. I've been introducing
him to countless women,

179
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,420
but he always puts work first.

180
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,130
That's right. I've set him
up on another date.

181
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,430
She's the daughter of a state legislator.

182
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,270
She's gorgeous.

183
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,630
If she's not good enough for him,
I don't know who would be.

184
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,640
Well, why did you call me out here today, Eva?

185
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,150
You're the former director's daughter,
so you never even looked at me once.

186
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,370
I never thought you'd call me for anything.

187
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,670
I understand. Although you don't have
any money worries, you're lonely.

188
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,000
If I'm acceptable, you can
talk to me anytime.

189
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,160
Don't let him see her.

190
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,550
That state legislator's daughter...

191
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,170
Don't let Kenzo see her.

192
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,910
Don't tell me you still have
feelings for Tenma...

193
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,350
Please.

194
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,470
This time's going to be great for sure.

195
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,720
I set it all up, after all.

196
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,450
I won't know until I meet her.

197
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,190
That's it...

198
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,980
This is the clock that Mr. Junkers wanted.

199
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,410
Excuse me... About the clock on
display in the window...

200
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,280
What are you doing?

201
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,490
You're going to be late!

202
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,540
Hey!

203
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,190
What a splendid wristwatch.

204
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,730
Who are you?

205
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,470
Mine is just an accessory.

206
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,320
I can't tell time anymore.

207
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,950
I wonder why...

208
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,330
why time seems to pass by
quicker and quicker.

209
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,830
Excuse me, but who are you?

210
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,170
You must be Miss Angelica, the daughter
of the state legislator Belger.

211
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,070
Yes.

212
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,840
You're so young and beautiful.

213
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,340
No, not really...

214
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,390
Umm...

215
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,630
You think the whole world
revolves around you.

216
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,690
Huh?

217
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,640
You think there's nothing you can't have.

218
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,990
Umm...

219
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,280
What do you want to say?

220
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,380
Who are you?

221
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,880
There's a mole on my inner thigh.

222
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,390
He kisses it.

223
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,830
He always kisses it...

224
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,890
Dr. Kenzo Tenma.

225
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,380
Look! Because you had to waste your time shopping,
we were late, and she went home.

226
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,110
Oh, I see.

227
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,780
I feel badly about it.

228
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,450
Could you apologize to her for me?

229
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,870
H-Hey!

230
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,830
If you call her now, you can
make her feel better.

231
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,550
I'm going to the hospital.

232
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,850
Work again?

233
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,590
Give it a break!

234
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,140
Geez!

235
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,870
Kenzo...

236
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,610
You're mine...

237
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,510
You're all mine.

238
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,630
Mr. Junkers!

239
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,630
Please wait!

240
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,850
Mr. Junkers!

241
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,560
Kenzo...

242
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,190
What's wrong?

243
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,000
Wait, Kenzo!

244
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,000
We need to talk!

245
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,570
Mr. Junkers!

246
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,580
Kenzo!

247
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,170
Please wait up!

248
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,680
Kenzo...

249
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,040
My high heels...

250
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,220
Kenzo...

251
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,250
Kenzo?

252
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,740
I saw him,

253
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,960
one year ago in Düsseldorf.

254
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,420
That was Johan, wasn't it?

255
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,450
So she saw Johan...

256
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,830
I guess I have to kill her.
