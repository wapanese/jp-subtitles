1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,590
A gust of wind came...

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,550
The thermos fell over...

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,760
The sandwiches were all dirty...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,750
At the time, he...

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,250
just smiled sadly...

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,040
Do you want one too, lady?

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,380
Hey, Franz!

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,220
That's rude!

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,080
Thank you.

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,260
Is it good?

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,480
Start walking.

12
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,470
Get in.

13
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,210
Oh, hello?

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,580
I can't get through to Mr. Verdeman.

15
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,680
That's why I'm calling you.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,230
<i>Oh, his wife just gave birth, so he's probably</i>
<i>still at the maternity center.</i>

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,360
<i>I've heard about you, Miss Eva Heinemann.</i>

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,950
<i>Please, feel free to tell me anything you'd like.</i>

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,760
I thought I'd talk.

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
<i>About what?</i>

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,570
The testimony to prove Tenma's innocence.

22
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,960
<i>I see. We're very grateful!</i>

23
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,040
<i>So...</i>

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,430
<i>what hotel are you staying at right now?</i>

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>Got it.</i>

26
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,360
I'll head over there right now.

27
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,760
The Escape

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,750
With timing like this...

29
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,810
they'll just go around me and keep driving.

30
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,310
The car comes, right?

31
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,310
Then I fall.

32
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,400
Comes.

33
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,050
Fall.

34
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,790
Comes.

35
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,220
Fall.

36
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,340
This timing should be right.

37
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
Comes.

38
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,590
Fall.

39
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,360
<i>Hey.</i>

40
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,510
- Comes.
<i>- Hey.</i>

41
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,960
Fall.

42
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,840
Hey, I said!

43
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,660
What? I'm in the middle of something.

44
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,100
Are you really going to marry me today?

45
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,590
How many times do I have to tell you?

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
I will.

47
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,210
You really will?

48
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,560
Swear to God?

49
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,750
Yeah.

50
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,010
I'll swear to anything you want today, Helene.

51
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,170
Then kiss me, Gustav.

52
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,870
Let's continue this in the car.

53
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,500
Hey! Wait! Stop!

54
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,890
Now's not the time for this!

55
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,830
You used my drugs again?

56
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,390
That was the last of my stash!

57
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,670
Wasn't me!

58
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,110
No wonder your nose is running, bitch!

59
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,770
I'm out here practicing for my job while
you're in here snorting my stuff?!

60
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,650
What job? It's simple.

61
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,210
All you're doing is lying in the road.

62
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,320
Simple?!

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,000
Easy for you to say!

64
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,460
If I mess up even a little, I'll die!

65
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,800
You're going to die?

66
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,110
Isn't it obvious?!

67
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,530
I'd be killed instantly

68
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,910
- I don't want you to die!

69
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,440
<i>- No, that was just an example...</i>
- I don't want you to die!

70
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,000
<i>- No, that was just an example...</i>

71
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,320
Gustav's gonna die!

72
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,240
I won't die.

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,120
There are still some things I have to do.

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,840
Like what?

75
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,060
I've gotta have lots of kids with you.

76
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,570
We're going to make a whole soccer team with our kids.

77
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,440
That's so wonderful, Gustav.

78
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,370
I'll be getting a load of cash from the job I'm about to do.

79
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,440
Then we'll get married.

80
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,730
You'll make my dream come true, right, Helene?

81
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,680
Oh, Gustav!

82
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,720
I'll have them! I'll have them!

83
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,790
I'll have as many babies as you want!

84
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
I keep telling you, now is not the time for that!

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,120
No, I want to make babies!

86
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Be patient for now.

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,630
It's almost time for a "Detective Forster" rerun.

88
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,090
The car comes.

89
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,440
I jump out.

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,390
I fall down.

91
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,890
The car comes.

92
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,560
I jump out.

93
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,480
I fall down.

94
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,270
The car comes.

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,950
I jump out.

96
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,460
I fall down.

97
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,060
The car comes...

98
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,720
I'm thinking of killing someone.

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,790
Your former fiancée...

100
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,660
Eva Heinemann.

101
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,490
Don't...

102
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,010
Don't!

103
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,300
Stop!

104
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,720
It's so nice out.

105
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,470
Such nice weather, yet I'm stuck in a car like this.

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,830
With this damn serial killer, no less.

107
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,130
Man, I'm so unlucky.

108
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,880
Stop talking, Milch!

109
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,490
But you're lucky.

110
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,410
In this gloomy little prison van...

111
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,470
on your way to some dank detention facility...

112
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:12,180
you get to hear plenty of stories about the twelve
escapes of the master escapee, Gunther Milch.

113
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,520
Now then, which should I start with?

114
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,920
The one about how I escaped from
kreiner Prison is the best.

115
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,270
Shut up!

116
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,510
Come on. I'm just bored.

117
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,530
What time is it?

118
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,400
I asked you for the time.

119
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,040
It's 9:32.

120
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,440
If I were out in the free world...

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,560
it'd almost be time for a rerun
of "Detective Forster" on TV.

122
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,650
Did you ever watch that show?

123
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,880
It's really good.

124
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,500
All right, it's almost time.

125
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,020
I'm gonna take care of this little job real quick.

126
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,290
You just watch me work from here.

127
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,730
A gun...

128
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,910
Are you going to shoot it?

129
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,050
I won't.

130
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm just gonna use it to scare them.

131
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,610
I don't want our kids to have murderers for parents!

132
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,730
Don't shoot anyone!

133
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,650
I'll even stop using drugs!

134
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
I love you, Helene.

135
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,640
I've really decided!

136
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,050
Let's get married!

137
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,770
Really?

138
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,750
We're gonna live honestly from now on.

139
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,910
I won't do jobs where I have to
wave a gun around anymore.

140
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,300
Really?

141
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,320
Yeah.

142
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,600
Nothing good comes from waving around things like this.

143
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,160
Gustav!

144
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,680
Ah! This feels so great, damn it!

145
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,800
Helene!

146
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,120
What is it?

147
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,350
I love you from the bottom of my...

148
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,430
W-What was that?!

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,390
What happened?

150
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,230
I...

151
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,460
hit someone...

152
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,490
What?!

153
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,490
You... hit someone?

154
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
Sit down, Milch!

155
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,080
You... hit him?

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,120
Didn't you hear me? Sit down, Milch!

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,190
That was probably my little brother...

158
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,360
The plan... failed, Dr. Tenma...

159
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,830
I taught Gustav the timing and
acting over and over again...

160
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,030
but in the end, nobody can do it as well as me.

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,710
I asked him to pass out on the road like he was sick...

162
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,730
so he could stop the oncoming car...

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,920
He's really bad, so you should've just
avoided him and kept going...

164
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,630
And yet... and yet...

165
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,720
why did you have to go and hit him?

166
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,910
I don't really get what you're saying, but...

167
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,800
go check and see if it's someone you know or not!

168
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,960
Gustav...

169
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,210
Oh, Gustav...

170
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,060
Helene...

171
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,710
This isn't good...

172
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,130
I-Is he still breathing...

173
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,440
This is really bad...

174
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,640
E-Excuse me, but we have a doctor right here.

175
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,790
Hey, you.

176
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,650
Get out.

177
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,860
Hey!

178
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,240
Gustav's dead...

179
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,750
H-How is he?

180
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,730
Is he alive?

181
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,240
How could I have done this?

182
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,000
I've totally failed...

183
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,720
Gustav!

184
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,520
Oh, man...

185
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,830
Maybe we should tell him to cover it up in the report...

186
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,300
How can we cover up something like this?

187
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,010
I know, but...

188
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,930
The keys!

189
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,960
Give me the keys to the handcuffs!

190
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,030
The keys!

191
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,040
Give me the keys to the handcuffs!

192
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,920
Are you waiting for someone?

193
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,960
Yes.

194
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,520
Would you like anything to drink?

195
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,880
A Scotch.

196
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,620
No, wait.

197
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,760
A cup of coffee.

198
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,000
<i>In our next story....</i>

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,870
<i>A fire struck a large shopping mall in Dortmund today.</i>

200
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,330
<i>Thanks to the employees triggering the fire alarm,</i>
<i>the blaze was brought under control...</i>

201
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,010
<i>but two stores were completely lost.</i>

202
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,080
<i>- There have been no reported injuries.</i>

203
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,960
<i>- I thought I'd talk.</i>
<i>- There have been no reported injuries.</i>

204
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,690
<i>About what?</i>

205
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,790
<i>The testimony to prove Tenma's innocence.</i>

206
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,020
<i>Got it.</i>

207
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,490
<i>I'll head over there right now.</i>

208
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,480
<i>Please wait in the hotel lobby.</i>

209
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,770
What are you trying to do by setting that man free?

210
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,000
This just came in.

211
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,930
<i>At 10 o'clock this morning, in a suburb</i>
<i>of Düsseldorf, Erkrath...</i>

212
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:58,050
<i>two prisoners who were being transported to the Hilden</i>
<i>Detention Facility escaped from police custody.</i>

213
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,010
<i>No details have been reported, but....</i>

214
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,850
<i>the two fugitives who escaped were....</i>

215
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,930
<i>Gunther Milch, arrested for armored car robbery...</i>

216
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,200
<i>and the serial killer, Kenzo Tenma.</i>

217
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,630
<i>The police have been deployed...</i>

218
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,720
<i>and are now tracking down the two fugitives.</i>

219
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,920
Why?

220
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,960
Why did you escape?

221
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,810
Yes, hello?

222
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,290
Oh, Mr. Verdeman.

223
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,930
Yes, I heard the news.

224
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,020
Why did you have to escape?

225
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,890
I...

226
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,230
Just when I was about to prove your innocence...

227
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,190
Why?

228
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,270
Well, it's no use asking me about it.

229
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,820
I don't understand his motives either.

230
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,430
Yes.

231
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,400
For now, let's just head over to the police station.

232
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,210
However...

233
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,740
the truth is, there's something
that I have to take care of first.

234
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,600
I see.

235
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,740
Yes. Yes. That's true.

236
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,510
We must both deal with the current situation calmly.

237
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,930
Yes.

238
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,800
Yes, I completely agree.

239
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,360
<i>That voice...</i>

240
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,040
In any case, we have to get the details.

241
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,990
Yes.

242
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,240
<i>That voice...</i>

243
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,550
Yes, it's exactly as you said.

244
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,310
<i>- That voice...</i>

245
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,430
<i>- Yes, as much as we can. Yes.</i>
<i>- That voice...</i>

246
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,880
<i>- Yes, as much as we can. Yes.</i>

247
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,910
Roberto!

248
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,680
Here's your coffee...

249
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,390
That's not... my cigarette...

250
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,920
This smell...

251
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,340
It's that man's smell...

252
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,250
He was...

253
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,950
Roberto was just in this room!

254
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,590
Gustav!

255
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,900
Gustav's dead!

256
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,490
Helene, he's not dead yet.

257
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,970
But he can't be saved.

258
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,830
He hit his head, and he's not bleeding.

259
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,870
it's what they call a brain hemorrhage.

260
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,500
Isn't that right, Doctor?

261
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,520
I understand how you feel, but...

262
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,850
we're going to change cars at the path through
the forest up ahead, like we planned.

263
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,640
Gustav is just a burden.

264
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,160
We'll leave him in this car.

265
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,280
No!

266
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,350
keep going!

267
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,620
We don't have time to change cars.

268
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,070
You crazy?

269
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,240
The cops have seen this car.

270
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,980
They'll find us in no time!

271
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,160
If we can get him to a hospital soon...

272
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,520
there's a chance he can be saved!

273
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,400
A hospital?

274
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,470
Doctor, your quick-wittedness saved my
escape plan when it was about to fail.

275
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,150
But from now on, you're going to listen to the pro.

276
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,960
I feel sorry for him, but we'll leave Gustav at
the path through the forest up ahead and...

277
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,710
keep driving to the hospital!

278
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,270
Eisler Memorial Hospital

279
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,660
They have the best equipment
and staff in Düsseldorf there.

280
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,610
It's the hospital I worked at!

281
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,020
Hurry!

282
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,850
The main entrance to the hospital is just ahead.

283
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,960
Stop crying!

284
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,190
Once you reach the entrance...

285
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,350
tell them to give this letter to Dr. Wagner.

286
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,830
It contains a detailed description of the accident.

287
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,570
Gustav won't die?

288
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,770
He's still alive!

289
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,570
Don't give up as long as he's still alive!

290
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,870
Hurry up and go!

291
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,630
Now then...

292
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,090
if we stick around here any longer...

293
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,210
it's like we'll be asking to be found.

294
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,260
Thanks for your help.

295
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,160
What are you doing?

296
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,880
Where are you going?

297
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,170
You'd better stick with me.

298
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,680
You're a complete amateur at this.

299
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,720
The life of a woman I know is in danger.

300
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,250
I have to get to her as soon as possible.

301
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,480
A woman?

302
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,430
You mean to tell me that's why you escaped?

303
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,070
If you want women, just come with me to Tunisia.

304
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,230
You can sleep with as many of
the best women as you want.

305
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,110
Thank you.

306
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,310
Goodbye.

307
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,680
Doctor.

308
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,450
You haven't really killed anyone, have you?

309
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,160
I shot one person...

310
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,200
but he's still alive.

311
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,200
That's not killing.

312
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,280
As far as that one goes, you're completely innocent.

313
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,770
But you've got a real criminal record now.

314
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,140
You're now officially a fugitive.

315
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,880
Let's meet up in Tunisia someday, fugitive to fugitive.

316
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,830
It's a great place!

317
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

318
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

319
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

320
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

321
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,570
Room 402
