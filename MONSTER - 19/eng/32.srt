1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,040
Hi, Karl.

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,750
Hey, Lotte.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,080
Do you have some time right now?

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,090
Not really. What is it?

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:27,760
I was going to see if you'd like to get some
tea and talk about Mr. Schubert.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,640
I don't care about that anymore.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,720
But...

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,440
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,520
There's a meeting my dad needs to chair.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,610
See ya.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,150
About the upcoming dance party...

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,530
I thought that we could...

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,580
go together.

14
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,460
Sanctuary

15
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,430
We're closing up soon.

16
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,140
Okay

17
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,020
We're closing for today.

18
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,730
That girl's here again.

19
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,070
She's so pretty.

20
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,450
She probably has nothing to worry about.

21
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,080
But she...

22
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,080
It's closing time!

23
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,620
Got it!

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,540
Geez!

25
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,760
Where have I seen her before?

26
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,930
Dance party?

27
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:33,320
It's not really my taste, but my friend made me buy them.

28
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,740
I'm sorry. I can't tonight.

29
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,740
There's a state congress dinner meeting.

30
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,330
It's not just an ordinary dinner meeting either.

31
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,540
I'm sure you'll have no problem finding
a date for the dance party.

32
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,580
Bye.

33
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,460
I didn't really want to go anyways.

34
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
Are you...?

35
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,200
Huh? Are you looking up info on Margot Langer?

36
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,750
You don't need to hide it. I'm investigating her as well.

37
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,210
It's for a college report.

38
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,510
I'm a cultural anthropology major, Lotte Frank.

39
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,550
What's your name?

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,270
You're quite impressive, Ms. Nina Fortner.

41
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,310
This is about the accountant murder.

42
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,110
This is a newspaper article about
the "Voice of God" murders.

43
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,360
And this is about the murders of the middle-aged couples.

44
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,240
You're amazing.

45
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,910
I have confidence in my ability to gather information,
but you definitely beat me this time.

46
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,450
I'm looking into all the unsolved murders
in the Bayern area in the last 4 years.

47
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,750
Could you tell me everything you know about the
murder of Margot Langer, the ex-prostitute?

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,340
I've already told you all I know.

49
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:25,100
The child of Margot Langer and Hans Schubert was
joyously reunited with Mr. Schubert, the millionaire...

50
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,970
and has become his successor.

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,230
Is there a possibility that the son is involved
in the incidents surrounding Mr. Schubert?

52
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,730
No. I'm 100% sure he's not involved.

53
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,270
I see.

54
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,570
You're really into this.

55
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,820
You're in this pretty deep for just a college report.

56
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,870
W-Well, maybe.

57
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,200
This isn't for a research paper at all, is it?

58
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,880
The truth is I'm looking for someone.

59
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,960
Can I ask you a question?

60
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,630
Does a person like you even have anything to worry about?

61
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,430
Huh?

62
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Everything goes just how you want when
you're as pretty as you are, doesn't it?

63
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,930
What are you trying to say?

64
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,940
You probably have no love problems at all.

65
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,700
I'm sorry. I shouldn't bother you with my problems.

66
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
God is so unfair.

67
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,670
Do you want to hang out with me
tonight? There's a dance party.

68
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm not really used to places like this.

69
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,190
Don't talk like that. If I'm with
you, everyone will talk to us.

70
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
See look. Everyone's looking this way.

71
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,320
I'll just take your leftovers.

72
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,030
Jeez! Lotte!

73
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,530
Hi!

74
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,120
See! Here's one now.

75
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,530
Hi!

76
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm Constantine from the Supernatural Phenomenon
Research Group. Nice to meet you.

77
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,420
Oh my, a weird one has come over.

78
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,090
I can't believe a guy like him has
the balls to approach you, Nina.

79
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,380
Excuse me, Lotte.

80
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,180
Would you be my dance partner tonight?

81
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,260
Me?

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,470
What do you mean?

83
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,220
Way to go, Lotte.

84
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,100
I'll just excuse myself.

85
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,270
Wait, Nina.

86
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,770
He's not my type.

87
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,820
Not at all!

88
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,320
Let's leave together, Nina.

89
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,990
Geez!

90
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,700
I don't think we fit in here.

91
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,870
Yeah, you're right

92
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,500
What's with that?

93
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,500
Tons of guys have come up to you.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,670
You've been cold to every one of them.

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,210
I haven't been trying to.

96
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,680
But it's been so long since I've had fun.

97
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,430
All the students are gathered here and having fun.

98
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,270
It's really been a long time since I've
been around something like this.

99
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,770
Nina, are you...

100
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,020
Huh?

101
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,900
Nothing.

102
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,410
You're just very different than you look.

103
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,490
What do you mean by that?

104
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:47,670
Hey, Lotte. I begging you, dance with me.

105
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,220
He's here again! He's a persistent little bugger.

106
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,680
Just for a while. C'mon!

107
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,350
He's drunk this time, too!

108
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,310
No, let go of me!

109
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,400
Get serious!

110
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,030
I'm not asking you because I like you.

111
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,990
What's with you? You're so rude!

112
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,450
Come on! One dance.

113
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,490
No, stop!

114
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,040
I can get my money then.

115
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,250
Money? What do you mean?

116
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,340
Stop asking questions. Karl asked me.

117
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,460
He asked me to be your partner.

118
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,970
Karl asked you?

119
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,470
Just dance with me a little bit. That's all I'm asking.

120
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,770
Stop.

121
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,060
Don't say that.

122
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,060
Stop!

123
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,730
Just for one song.

124
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,620
Ouch! I'm sorry! Stop!

125
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,830
Let's go.

126
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,310
I liked him.

127
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,360
I liked Karl.

128
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,320
I helped him search for his father because I liked him.

129
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,820
I liked him.

130
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,080
But when we proved that he was Schubert's real son...

131
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,250
"I have things to do with my dad."

132
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,710
"I promised my dad that..."

133
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,380
"Dad this. Dad that."

134
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,260
It hurts.

135
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,800
I hate it!

136
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,810
I never thought being ignored would be this painful.

137
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,810
It does hurt.

138
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,310
It all hurts.

139
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,620
But it's all right.

140
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,700
It's going to be okay.

141
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,160
Bad things can't continue to happen forever.

142
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,870
We can't let them continue.

143
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,540
Right?

144
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,800
I guess this is goodbye.

145
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,970
Tell me where I can get in contact with you.

146
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,310
Sorry. I don't have a place to live yet.

147
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,610
Then call me at home. Promise?

148
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,520
Sure.

149
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,530
It was fun.

150
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,150
I hope you find who you're looking for.

151
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,210
Nina... that girl,

152
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,170
I could have sworn I've seen her somewhere before...

153
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,590
She looks just like Johan.

154
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,970
You're pretty good, Doctor.

155
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,680
Although it's probably due to the accuracy
of the gun rather than your aim.

156
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:07,110
It failed the trials for the German Army, but it will
hit within 5 cm of where you aim from 300 meters.

157
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,660
Even if you can't aim.

158
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know what you're going to shoot, but
as you get closer, the accuracy increases.

159
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,500
The only thing after that is picking a spot
where nothing will get in the way.

160
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,300
The bullets are .338 Lapua Magnums.

161
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,090
It can hold four bullets, but you won't
have time to shoot all four.

162
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,640
It's the end for you, if you can't do it in one shot.

163
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,700
You come here everyday.

164
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,540
Are you bird watching?

165
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,410
Yeah.

166
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,750
There are a lot of visitors every week on Thursday.

167
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,090
That old man and those two young ones,

168
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,340
...and you.

169
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,390
Do you like this forest?

170
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,680
Yes.

171
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Who are you?

172
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,310
Me?

173
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,070
I'm apologizing to this forest.

174
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,820
I have been for over sixty years.

175
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,220
Haven't seen him before.

176
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,070
What's with this? He just left that
food that we're so famous for.

177
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,060
Today, answer the quiz and win some wonderful prizes.

178
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,110
Our first contestant is Mr. Weindler from Frankfurt.

179
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,110
This is the prize!

180
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,780
It's an... RV!

181
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,490
Wow!

182
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,950
It's just what my family always wanted.

183
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,910
Mr. Weindler seems excited.

184
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,740
It would be great if his family could go camping with this.

185
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,170
But he needs to get ten questions right
or he doesn't leave with the RV.

186
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,000
Question number one!

187
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,890
Are you just going to go home without
touching your food again?

188
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,900
You came a week ago. I remember every customer's
face, no matter how many there are.

189
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,780
If you're not hungry, at least take the soup home.

190
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,650
It's on the house.

191
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,610
You look horrible.

192
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,030
Thank you.

193
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,020
That's the place.

194
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,530
I have to shoot him in this forest.

195
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,090
You saved me.

196
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,720
I can't believe I lost my footing after walking
in this forest for seven years.

197
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,890
I must be getting old.

198
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,850
I don't think anything is broken. I performed first aid,

199
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,850
but please have it looked at in a hospital as soon as you can.

200
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,560
Are you a doctor?

201
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,530
When I first saw you I thought you were
a hunter, but it seems that you're not.

202
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,330
What a surprise!

203
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,080
What's wrong?

204
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,460
The birds.

205
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,550
The birds are gathering here.

206
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,930
A long time ago, there was a man. The wild
birds would ride on his shoulders.

207
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,180
If he held out his hand like this
the birds would land on him.

208
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,520
When he was a child, he would always spend
time with the birds in this forest.

209
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,240
Then came the age of Hitler.

210
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,530
He belonged to the police force.

211
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,460
He truly believed that the National Socialist German Workers' Party

212
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,710
would bring prosperity to this country.

213
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,300
One day, he received some orders.

214
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,600
A vicious criminal was hiding out in this forest.

215
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,890
Since he knew the forest so well, he
was sent to chase after the criminal.

216
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,310
He was ordered to find the criminal and kill him.

217
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,440
He chased and chased the criminal through the forest.

218
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,870
When he caught him, the man he chased wasn't a criminal at all. He was just an ordinary foreigner.

219
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,370
He had no way of knowing beforehand
who this person really was.

220
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,710
And so he simply carried out his orders.

221
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,320
Ever since then, the birds have never
ridden on his shoulders ever again.

222
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,820
For over sixty years, he has been apologizing.

223
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm sorry.

224
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,370
I'm sorry!

225
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,210
But, the birds never came back.

226
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,310
What's this?

227
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,310
It's okay now.

228
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,940
Never again...

229
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,240
Never again will blood flow through this forest.

230
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,740
Isn't that right?

231
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,530
