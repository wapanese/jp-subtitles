1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,820
Hey, Anna.

2
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,630
It's getting pretty chilly, isn't it?

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,700
What's with her?

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,010
She's not too friendly today...

5
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,770
Did you just get off work, Anna?

6
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,170
Nina!

7
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,740
All the restaurants in this area are already closed.

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Let's go back to the hotel, Nina.

9
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,220
What's wrong, Nina?

10
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,890
The people who live on this street...

11
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,370
for some reason, they all know me...

12
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,770
They...

13
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,720
called me "Anna."

14
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,750
The Door to Nightmares

15
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,500
What's going on here?

16
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,240
Even though Suk, a suspected serial
killer, is hospitalized here...

17
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,880
there aren't any police officers or patrol cars around.

18
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,260
Yeah.

19
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,780
In any case, I'll go take a look.

20
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,530
No.

21
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,300
Either way, there's no point unless I go.

22
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,910
It's the same in here.

23
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,490
There's no sign of police anywhere.

24
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,200
Excuse me...

25
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,110
A patient named Suk should be registered here.

26
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,970
Jan Suk.

27
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,480
He's a detective.

28
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:49,940
A detective?

29
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,410
There were a number of casualties from
an abandoned building on Brno Street.

30
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,920
Oh, the one where a bunch of unemployed
men got into a fight?

31
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,780
Unemployed men?

32
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,650
A fight?

33
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,760
Yes.

34
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,580
We didn't understand what they said on the news, but...

35
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,300
I guess that must be their cover story.

36
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,540
So, which rooms are they in?

37
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,660
They were seriously wounded, but...

38
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,540
they were all transferred out after receiving treatment.

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Transferred?

40
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,170
To where?

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,850
No idea.

42
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,660
An ambulance came and took all six of them away.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,840
Six men attacked us, too.

44
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,140
What about Suk?

45
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,180
What about Detective Jan Suk?

46
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,180
He was shot.

47
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,650
We don't have any patients who were
admitted with gunshot wounds.

48
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,170
There's no record of an emergency patient
named Jan Suk being brought here?

49
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,950
No, there isn't.

50
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,410
Research documents and a tape
pertaining to 511 kinderheim...

51
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,650
Yeah...

52
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,700
Petrov, who was the former director of 511 kinderheim...

53
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,900
and operated an unauthorized orphanage in Prague...

54
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,420
entrusted me with them right before he died.

55
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,410
And who exactly is after them?

56
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,640
To tell you the truth, I don't actually know.

57
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,800
But the former Czechoslovakian secret
police definitely want them.

58
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,970
Where are the documents and the tape right now?

59
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,460
I don't have them on me.

60
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,940
They're being held at a certain place.

61
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,960
Because of them, Detective Suk was seriously injured...

62
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
and abducted from the hospital.

63
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,650
Those people...

64
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,710
Who knows what they'll do to Suk in order
to get their hands on what they want...

65
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,460
This is bad...

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,380
What do those things say?

67
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,930
The documents are full of research data with
technical terms along with a roster...

68
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,080
I didn't take a good look at it.

69
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,160
I only listened to the tape briefly, as well...

70
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,780
What was recorded on it?

71
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,480
The voice of a child...

72
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,480
A child?

73
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,660
He was probably interrogated after being drugged.

74
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,500
When asked for his name, he answered "Johan."

75
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,790
What's wrong, Dr. Tenma?

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,000
511 kinderheim...

77
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,760
Research documents...

78
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,450
Johan...

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,950
Where is the tape right now?

80
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,980
Would you please come with us?

81
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,600
Where is Suk?

82
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,820
Let's conduct business.

83
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,810
Where is Suk?

84
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,660
Would you please come with us?

85
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,650
I'm okay, but...

86
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,610
Dr. Tenma.

87
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,490
There's no reason for you to become
further involved in all this.

88
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,810
No.

89
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,170
I also have something I'd like to ask the
former Czechoslovakian secret police.

90
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,220
What are you trying to accomplish?

91
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,380
the problem now is whether or not
these people will actually talk.

92
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,070
I doubt you're inviting us to dinner, are you?

93
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,530
Welcome.

94
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,700
This way, please.

95
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,650
That man is...

96
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,250
Looks like he's a bigshot in the former
Czechoslovakian secret police.

97
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,260
Yeah, I looked them up at the newspaper agency.

98
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,760
He's Colonel Karel Ranke.

99
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,230
So the top man decided to come himself.

100
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,210
My deepest apologies for my subordinates
treating you so roughly.

101
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,760
Due to a miscommunication in our command structure,
we have an unexpected situation on our hands.

102
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,380
We are currently suffering from
a serious misunderstanding.

103
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,290
By you, and by society.

104
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,310
As if we're a group of killers.

105
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,020
Where is Suk?

106
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,430
He's been placed in a hospital where we have connections.

107
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,460
He has not been harmed.

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,690
That's some misunderstanding.

109
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,520
We did not kill anyone in this case.

110
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,170
What about that girl?

111
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,240
Girl?

112
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,870
Isn't that blonde girl acting on your orders?

113
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,610
We do have reports about her, but...

114
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,170
she has absolutely no ties with us.

115
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,280
We are extremely inconvenienced by her as well.

116
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,300
What we want aren't human lives.

117
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,800
A friend of mine in Germany wanted
those documents and the tape.

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,180
So we had cautiously approached
Petrov many times to negotiate.

119
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,060
And then he was targeted and killed.

120
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,560
Looks like there must've been lots of money involved.

121
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,680
Yes, this is a business.

122
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,130
I just want to talk business.

123
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,030
I would like to have the documents
and the tape in exchange for Suk.

124
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,270
I don't know where they are.

125
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,780
Let's avoid such talk.

126
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
Something like that must not be repeated...

127
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,490
If something like that existed in the world...

128
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,480
who knows what could happen...

129
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,860
Something like that must never be repeated.

130
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,690
Let us put aside that sort of talk for now as well.

131
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,740
It has nothing to do with this business negotiation.

132
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,890
Because I'm from that place...

133
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,720
Because I'm from 511 kinderheim...

134
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,620
How old are you?

135
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,090
When did you leave there?

136
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,500
Supposedly, when I was fourteen.

137
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,800
It was thirty years ago.

138
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,970
When were you put in there?

139
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,360
Who knows?

140
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,480
Probably when I was seven or eight.

141
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,570
Around 1963, correct?

142
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,850
I don't know.

143
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,350
Do you know this child?

144
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,880
He's my nephew.

145
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
In the early 60s...

146
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,670
I was officially stationed in Berlin as an intelligence
officer for the Czechoslovakian embassy.

147
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,450
I had a younger sister.

148
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,690
She married a German.

149
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,920
But she and her husband tried to defect by crossing
the Berlin Wall and they were shot to death.

150
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,580
And only that boy was left.

151
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,730
I signed them.

152
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,710
On paper, that place provided a wonderful environment.

153
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,820
An ideal, educational environment
where children with a past...

154
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,650
would be nurtured into the elites who would
shoulder the communism of the future.

155
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,910
I signed the papers that allowed that child
to be placed in 511 kinderheim...

156
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,570
I don't know.

157
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,240
I don't have any memories.

158
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,940
Anything that happened there...

159
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,410
or from before I went there...

160
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,560
I don't remember anything at all.

161
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,780
I don't even know my real name...

162
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,910
You're...

163
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,780
You're trying to change something so horrible into money.

164
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:26,010
You're even trying to sell documents containing
experimental data on your own nephew!

165
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,290
It appears we've gone off topic.

166
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,500
I would like you to think of this
as a beneficial business deal.

167
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,280
I understand.

168
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,590
You guys are free to go for today.

169
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
I hope for a positive answer.

170
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,480
Take them back with the utmost care.

171
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,630
What are you going to do?

172
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,650
Right now, the most important thing is to rescue Suk.

173
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,850
If you agree to his demands...

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,660
I believe he will release Suk.

175
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,160
Mr. Grimmer...

176
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,240
Cocoa...

177
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,690
I remember...

178
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,050
I remember!

179
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,580
Mr. Grimmer!

180
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,950
The cocoa he had once a week!

181
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,560
He looked forward to the weekly cocoa ration!

182
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,330
When I had a fever and was lying in the infirmary...

183
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,090
he brought me some cocoa.

184
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,700
His own cocoa...

185
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,150
Even though he loved it so much!

186
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,480
It was delicious...

187
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,560
I never had such delicious cocoa before...

188
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,290
So I wanted to do something to repay him.

189
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,120
Then he said...

190
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,640
He said to remember him.

191
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,010
Back then, it was popular among us.

192
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,570
We talked about ourselves to our friends.

193
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,160
We didn't really understand it...

194
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,890
but our memories were fading...

195
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,900
with the strange classes we attended every single day.

196
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,400
We were even in danger of forgetting our own names...

197
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,080
That's why...

198
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,640
we had our friends remember who we were!

199
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,450
He loved cocoa!

200
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,610
He loved to draw pictures!

201
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,610
And he loved insects!

202
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,660
But he didn't like to collect insects because
he had to kill them, and he didn't like that.

203
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,140
The most fun he had was when he went
into the forest with his parents.

204
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,840
He caught lots of butterflies.

205
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,890
But he released all the butterflies from
the bug cage on the way home.

206
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,180
His dream was to become an entomologist!

207
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,930
His...

208
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,650
His name was...

209
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,840
Adolf Reinhart!

210
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,890
That's my nephew.

211
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,380
<i>Welcome back.</i>

212
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,130
<i>Don't hide things from him.</i>

213
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,170
<i>People....</i>

214
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,460
<i>can become anything.</i>

215
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,340
<i>Cheers!</i>

216
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,350
<i>Hey, welcome back.</i>

217
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,620
<i>Hey, welcome back.</i>

218
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>Hey, welcome back.</i>

219
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,350
What's wrong, Nina?

220
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,060
I...

221
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,570
I know this place...

222
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,570
The road leading to this place...

223
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,560
This scenery...

224
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,590
This storefront signboard...

225
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,940
I know it all...

226
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,170
Did you live here?

227
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,890
I don't know.

228
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,900
Just...

229
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,440
Just?

230
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm scared...

231
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,670
You know this door, too?

232
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,170
I don't know...

233
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,020
But...

234
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,420
I'm scared, so...

235
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,220
These stairs...

236
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,410
I know them, too...

237
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,780
Mr. Grimmer.

238
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,530
I thought things over last night.

239
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,760
There's something I'd like you to hear.

240
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,650
Dr. Tenma.

241
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,180
Neither those documents nor the tape
have anything to do with you.

242
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,870
No, I'm also...

243
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,180
Doesn't seem like we have time to talk.

244
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,920
Looks like they can't wait for more negotiating.

245
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,240
The former Czechoslovakian secret police have
bothered to come all the way but here.

246
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,760
Were you able to think things over?

247
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,340
Yeah.

248
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,660
I have no intention of giving you either
the tape or the research documents.

249
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,260
You don't care what happens to Detective Suk?

250
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,780
If anything were to happen to Suk...

251
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,770
the tape and research documents would be lost forever.

252
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,470
Let's not start this kind of meaningless negotiation.

253
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,790
However...

254
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,770
I can let you listen to the tape.

255
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,900
On one condition.

256
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,150
You have to forget your business deal with
your German friend who's trying to buy it.

257
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,490
If you want to listen to it because of a personal interest...

258
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,290
then I'm willing to let you listen to the tape.

259
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,480
No...

260
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,640
You <i>should</i> listen to it...

261
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,660
for the sake of the nephew you
placed in 511 kinderheim.

262
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,640
You should listen to the voice of the boy named
Johan who was recorded on the tape.

263
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,900
Is that your deal?

264
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,530
I'm not making any deals.

265
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,020
Please stop this already!

266
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,620
We don't have time for this!

267
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,610
Even as we speak...

268
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,530
someone might be killed because of that tape.

269
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,290
How many people involved with your
Czechoslovakian secret police...

270
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,520
do you think have been killed?

271
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,010
Who do you think killed them?

272
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,330
It was the person who wants that tape the most.

273
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,250
The owner of the voice that was recorded on that tape...

274
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,380
Johan!

275
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,160
Dr. Tenma...

276
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,570
I have no idea what you're talking about.

277
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,860
Don't play dumb!

278
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,530
You must've learned what that tape
is from your German friend!

279
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,420
What did he tell you to get?!

280
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,050
"The true identity of the monster..."

281
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,680
That was all he said.

282
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,350
I didn't want to get you people involved...

283
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,080
But I'll tell you everything...

284
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,690
before more people are killed.

285
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,780
It happened ten years ago...

286
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,570
I see.

287
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,690
So Johan was tracing his own roots...

288
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,990
and came to Prague.

289
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,890
I don't know...

290
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,010
He may be trying to erase everything, instead.

291
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,860
Just what did you people do fifteen years ago?!

292
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,050
There was a family living near Cedok
Bridge in the Michalska district.

293
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,980
One day, they were taken away by the secret police.

294
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,180
After taking him away from the building
with the three frogs on its signboard...

295
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,690
what did you guys do to Johan?

296
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,210
These stairs...

297
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,230
<i>Big brother...</i>

298
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,810
What's wrong, Nina?

299
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,130
As if being dragged down these stairs...

300
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,800
he was taken away...

301
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,180
Who was?

302
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,130
My big brother...

303
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,370
It's true that at the time, I was in a position
to receive all the information.

304
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,360
But these three frogs...

305
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,370
And a family being taken away...

306
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,080
I have absolutely no recollection of that.

307
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,340
Don't pretend you don't know!

308
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,900
Of course, there was information that didn't reach me.

309
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,960
Like the things that man did.

310
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,260
I didn't know which division of the
secret police he belonged to...

311
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,730
nor did I know whose command he was under.

312
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:28,060
For some reason, he could detain anyone
freely without reporting to his superiors...

313
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,810
I wonder what he was doing?

314
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,920
Even though he was just a lieutenant...

315
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,050
he was given a luxurious mansion as his workplace.

316
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,270
Yes...

317
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,070
He was known as the "Man of the Red Rose Mansion."

318
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,810
You're saying that man was involved?

319
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,290
He was a quiet man with an extremely elegant demeanor.

320
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,420
He didn't wear a uniform...

321
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,300
and liked tea and cake.

322
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
What was his name?!

323
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,360
Franz Bonaparta.

324
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,850
Franz... Bonaparta...

325
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,810
However, I don't know if that was his real name or not...

326
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,880
since he also had a pen name.

327
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,370
A pen name?

328
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,890
He was also the author of a picture book.

329
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,650
Are you scared of this door, too?

330
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,370
I...

331
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,210
I...

332
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,900
was reading a picture book in here, and...

333
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,630
Someone opened the door...

334
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,580
and came home...

335
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,380
A picture book?

336
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,540
Yes.

337
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,040
It was a very peculiar picture book.

338
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,350
The title was "The Monster Without
A Name," or something like that.

339
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,290
There's nothing here, Nina.

340
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,790
What is this... memory...?

341
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,240
I should have been reading a picture book in here, but...

342
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,770
the one who opened the door and came in...

343
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,250
was me.

344
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,530
I'm welcoming myself back home?

345
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,770
Welcome back.

346
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:43,330
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

347
00:22:44,420 --> 00:23:00,730
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

348
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,810
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

349
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:34,290
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

350
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,530
The Scariest Thing
