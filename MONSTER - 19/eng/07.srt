1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,090
Please tell me! Who are you?
And I'm not Anna!

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,570
I'm Nina!

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,330
No, when you were brought into
my hospital, your name was Anna.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,270
And your brother's name was Johan.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,310
My brother...

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,920
Johan...

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,220
Anna...

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,730
Johan...

9
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,980
House of Tragedy

10
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,790
Mr. Fortner!!

11
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,390
Mr. Maurer!!

12
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,330
Mr. Maurer! Mr. Maurer!

13
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,470
Mr. Fortner! It's Tenma!

14
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,070
Anna... I mean,
I've brought Nina home safely!

15
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,380
Mr. Maurer!

16
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,210
<i>I'll call the police from here.</i>

17
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,020
<i>It doesn't look like
the police ever came...</i>

18
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,600
<i>It can't be...</i>

19
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,980
Live...

20
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,040
Please... Come back to life...

21
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,970
You must come back to life!!

22
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,560
Please...

23
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,030
I'm begging you...

24
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,300
Please...

25
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,540
Mr. Maurer...
Your favorite cigarettes...

26
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,100
Mr. Maurer!!

27
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,970
That day...

28
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,070
I killed him...

29
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,570
I... killed... him...

30
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,950
Kill me...

31
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,060
I killed him... I killed him...

32
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,500
- Nina.
- But that day, I killed my brother!!

33
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,390
I... I brought him back to life...

34
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,400
The phone line has been cut...

35
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,240
We've got to get
away from here quickly.

36
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,200
He'll come to take you away.

37
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,420
Is everything all right?

38
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,790
Huh?!

39
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,260
We're the police.
We received a call.

40
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,170
If you don't mind,
we'll have a look around inside.

41
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,000
What in the world?

42
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,170
This is terrible.

43
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,470
Are you two all right? Any injuries?

44
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,120
Thank heavens.
We'll have help soon.

45
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,890
They'll take care of the scene.

46
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,850
We'll hear your stories
down at headquarters.

47
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,890
Is she the victims' daughter?

48
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,000
Poor thing...

49
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,810
I see... So that means
you didn't see who did it?

50
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,480
To think something like that could
happen in such a peaceful town...

51
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,180
Where are you from? China?

52
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,220
No. I'm Japanese.
My name is Tenma.

53
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,620
Oh, you're Japanese...

54
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,560
What a terrible experience for you
in such a faraway land...

55
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,770
Steady... You're all right now...

56
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
Uh... Where are we headed?

57
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,150
The Police Department.

58
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,420
But the Heidelberg Police Department
is in the middle of town.

59
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,590
We're from Mannheim Precinct
in the next town.

60
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,290
<i>I wonder why they're taking us
to the next precinct...</i>

61
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,270
We'll be there in about 15 minutes.

62
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,040
Uh... I see...

63
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,380
<i>He said they got a call...
They came because they got a call...</i>

64
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,610
<i>Who could have called them?</i>

65
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,380
<i>The phone line was dead...</i>

66
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,520
<i>This car came without sirens blaring...</i>

67
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,530
<i>Would the police whisk away
the people who discovered the bodies</i>

68
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,330
<i>without first securing the scene?</i>

69
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,560
<i>Still, those police IDs
looked authentic...</i>

70
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,050
<i>Blood!</i>

71
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,010
<i>No way...</i>

72
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,850
<i>It couldn't be that these men...</i>

73
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,060
U-Um...

74
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,780
A-A roadblock?

75
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,090
<i>Thank goodness...</i>

76
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,350
We're searching for
a hit-and-run driver,

77
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,390
so we'd appreciate your help.

78
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,820
U-Um...

79
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,860
Huh?!

80
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,490
Well, if it isn't Detective Mesner
and Detective Muller.

81
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,130
Yes... See you're doing your job...

82
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,620
Are you on your way
back to headquarters?

83
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,300
Wow, you've got a new car.

84
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,660
<i>- What's going on?
</i>- How nice!

85
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,170
It'll be a junk heap in no time.

86
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,600
That's 'cause you don't take care of it.

87
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,880
Uh, excuse me!

88
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,110
Uh...

89
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,670
This girl says she doesn't feel well.
Can we go out and get some air?

90
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,350
Oh...

91
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,910
Oh, go ahead.

92
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,350
Did those two do something?

93
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,230
No, nothing like that.

94
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,860
<i>What's going on?
Are they really detectives?</i>

95
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,540
<i>But what about that blood?
Whose call did they receive?</i>

96
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,200
<i>They didn't even turn on their siren...</i>

97
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,250
<i>What should we do? What?</i>

98
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,980
Is everything all right, Dr. Tenma?

99
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,560
How?

100
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,990
How did you know?

101
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,390
I gave you my name,
but I didn't tell you that I was a doctor!

102
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,360
How did you know that?!

103
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,920
There was a grocery story nearby.
I even found some clothes.

104
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,120
There's bread, sausage and cheese.

105
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,660
I even had them pour
some coffee into this thermos...

106
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,210
You may not have any appetite,
but you've got to eat.

107
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,180
Anyway, you'd better change
your clothes. You're freezing.

108
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,980
There were lots of dead people...

109
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,480
My brother and I walked among them,
just the two of us.

110
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,950
It was like... we were the only people
left in the world.

111
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,150
Where was that?
Can't you remember?

112
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,460
We crossed the border...
A man and and his wife cheered us up.

113
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,190
They were so kind to us...

114
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,940
Then my brother said that
he had a good plan.

115
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,770
Not long after that...

116
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,110
The man and his wife died...

117
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,710
I don't know why,

118
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,420
but everyone who's ever
been nice to us... all die...

119
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,390
But one day, I discovered
the reason why... That rainy day...

120
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,060
You're talking about
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert, aren't you?

121
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:15,010
My brother shot them...
My brother killed them...

122
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,850
He's killed them all up till now...

123
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,260
That's why I took the gun...
I aimed it at my brother...

124
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,460
That's when he said...

125
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,400
He laughed as he said,

126
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,500
"After you shoot me,
throw the gun outside...

127
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,340
Be sure you shoot me in the head."

128
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,110
I shot him like he said...
I aimed for his head...

129
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,580
Why did you save him?

130
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,590
If you hadn't saved him,

131
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,260
my mom and dad
wouldn't have been killed.

132
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,700
Why did you save him?

133
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,180
Don't move from this place.
I'll go to the police...

134
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,450
But if the detectives last night
were the real thing, that means that

135
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,860
someone in the police department
is on Johan's side...

136
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,120
But we can't just stay here like this...

137
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,300
Now, listen, Nina...

138
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,030
Johan is trying to take you away.

139
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
I want you to hide
if someone comes looking.

140
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,240
You have to eat,
drink some hot coffee,

141
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,150
then sleep for a while...
That's how people go on living.

142
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,690
You're alive...
You must think about the future.

143
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,790
Your future...

144
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,160
Don't you have any leads?

145
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,960
Heidelberg Police Department

146
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,330
Is there any connection to the string

147
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,430
of killings of middle-age couples
throughout Germany?

148
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,430
As I said, we are putting all of
our resources into this case,

149
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,740
but I am not free to
disclose any details.

150
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,880
We have found that
Mr. and Mrs. Fortner have a daughter.

151
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,740
Where is she?

152
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,810
That is under investigation as well.

153
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,380
Why was that newspaper reporter,
Maurer, with them?

154
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,150
Who was that Japanese guy
who is said to have been with him?

155
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,450
Japanese? He sounds suspicious!

156
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,820
Was that murder at Heidelberg Castle,

157
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,130
that occurred at nearly the same time,
the work of the same killer?!

158
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,030
<i>Heidelberg Castle...?!</i>

159
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,070
So he was killed, as well?

160
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,170
Just a minute...

161
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,770
Anyway, we will keep you
abreast of the happenings!

162
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,710
Excuse me... Please let me through.

163
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,640
There's not enough for an article!!

164
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,850
U-Um...

165
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:17,090
Oh! I appreciate the help offered
by the Mannheim police,

166
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,100
Detectives Mesner and Muller.

167
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,990
Just give us our orders.
We'll do all we can to help.

168
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,300
How are the investigations
coming along?

169
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,010
We can talk about it inside...

170
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,580
<i>They're real...</i>

171
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,090
<i>Those guys are really
with the police...</i>

172
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,250
<i>What should I do?!</i>

173
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,090
The Heidelberg Post!

174
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,730
What? I can't hear you!
The editing room is in chaos!

175
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,870
- Huh?
- At any rate,

176
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,670
- Who are you?
- we have to find that Japanese guy

177
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,400
who was with Maurer!
He knows something!

178
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,770
Please quiet down! I'm on the phone!

179
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,550
Hello?!

180
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,550
I will bring an important witness
to your office at 5:00.

181
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,210
You must not let the police know.

182
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,350
Is that true?!
This isn't a hoax, is it?!

183
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,420
Hello!

184
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,390
<i>If I can't trust the police,
there's only the paper...</i>

185
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,490
<i>that can... keep Nina safe...</i>

186
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,040
Mr. Maurer...

187
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
You shouldn't be in here
without permission.

188
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,740
Besides, you're here from
the federal police to investigate

189
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,080
the killings of the middle-age couples,
aren't you?

190
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,380
We only have files on
the killing at the castle here...

191
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,420
Inspector Lunge.

192
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,020
Sorry... Something was bothering me.

193
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,420
The case you're looking at and
this one happened at the same time.

194
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,690
It couldn't be the same perpetrator.

195
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,990
I see.

196
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,230
This guy... It looks like there are signs
that his hands had been tied.

197
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,340
Did you find rope or anything nearby?

198
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,410
No... It had been removed
by the time the victim was found.

199
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,310
I... see...

200
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,860
<i>There are four possible routes
of escape from the scene...</i>

201
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,560
<i>He had to consider whether
he'd be hidden from sight,</i>

202
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,130
<i>how crowded the area was
where he'd come out,</i>

203
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,370
<i>and the locations of the lights.</i>

204
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,090
Found it...

205
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
Nina, it's me... It's Tenma.

206
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,710
Nina! You needn't hide anymore.

207
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,210
Nina!

208
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,920
Don't tell me...

209
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,780
Nina! Nina!

210
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,450
Where are you? Nina!! Nina!!

211
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,770
Nina... Was she taken away?

212
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,100
I shouldn't have left her alone.

213
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,930
<i>Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.</i>

214
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,170
<i>You just did what you
had to do as a doctor...</i>

215
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,460
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

216
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,510
<i>Please eat the sandwiches
and get some rest.</i>

217
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,290
<i>I want you to survive,
and save as many people as you can.</i>

218
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,660
<i>Nina Fortner.</i>

219
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,370
<i>Nina... What do you intend to do?</i>

220
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,740
<i>Do you intend to try to
kill him again?!</i>

221
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:16,520
<i>I brought him back to life...
That monster... I...</i>

222
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,260
<i>I brought him back to life...</i>

223
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,450
Pursued
