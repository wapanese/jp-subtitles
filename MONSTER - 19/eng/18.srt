1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,880
Let's not take a side trip here!
Let's just hurry and go!

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,170
Geez. My life sucks.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,990
I'm hungry, and I have no money.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,180
If only I had that rug...

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,310
Dammit!

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,480
Huh?

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,940
What's this?

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,110
Th-This is...

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,540
"Help me! The monster inside
me is about to explode."

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,460
Johan has...

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,050
two personalities!

12
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,950
Five Sugars

13
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,920
So you're saying that when
you got to the warehouse,

14
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,260
the Asian and the arsonist
had already fought,

15
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,890
and when the Asian man saw
you, he fled from the scene.

16
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that right, Ms. Anna Liebert?

17
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,630
Yes.

18
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:51,900
The suspect is an extremist, and he turned
himself in while mentioning something
about "a flame for a race's festival."

19
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,980
Your background checks out,
so we're done for today.

20
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,720
So I can go home now?

21
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,820
Yes.

22
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,260
One more thing. Didn't people
call that man Dr. Tenma?

23
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,570
Do you know anything about him?

24
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,600
No, I don't.

25
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,730
What do you think?

26
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,280
Wearing those clothes? It makes
me think she's a hooker...

27
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,860
Not her.

28
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,290
I meant Dr. Tenma.

29
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
That's what the people from the Turkish
quarter called that Asian man!

30
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,570
When we told them that he was a
murder suspect, though,

31
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,720
they all clammed up and
said they didn't know him.

32
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,520
I came to back you up.

33
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,610
Mr. Rosso.

34
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,780
You're safe, Anna. I was worried!

35
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,660
You just disappeared all of a sudden.

36
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,910
You changed clothes?

37
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,090
These clothes suit you much better.

38
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,420
Those clothes didn't fit you at all.

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,920
You must be hungry. Eat up!

40
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,190
Aren't you going to eat, Mr. Rosso?

41
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,770
I ate before I came.

42
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,980
I'll be happy with just some coffee.

43
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,930
Come on, eat!

44
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
I will. Thanks for the food.

45
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,880
What is it?

46
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,850
You always put in five spoonfuls of sugar.

47
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,010
Of course! Unsweetened
coffee isn't good at all.

48
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,020
You finally laughed.

49
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,980
Huh?

50
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,320
You finally laughed.

51
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,370
You had such a gloomy face for
coming in for a job interview.

52
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Is it so strange to use so much sugar?

53
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,110
What was it...? Anna...

54
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,830
Anna Liebert.

55
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,890
Umm...

56
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,390
Of course I'll hire you.

57
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,640
Naturally, if I have a beautiful girl like you working
for me, my restaurant will be a huge success.

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,600
However...

59
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,810
However...?

60
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,850
You should smile more.

61
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,850
You're wasting your beauty.

62
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,350
Thank you. I'll work my hardest!

63
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,950
You don't have to strain yourself.

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,950
It's just a countryside Italian restaurant.
You'll see how busy it gets.

65
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,300
Come here, Anna.

66
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,590
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll put the food out here.

68
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,260
You take it to the customers.

69
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,520
The dirty dishes go on the
right side of the counter.

70
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,120
The wine's over here, and the
glasses are on this shelf.

71
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,310
I'll also put the wine on top of the counter.

72
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,120
The tickets with the orders will be here.

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
The wine is on top of the counter..

74
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,950
The glasses are here...

75
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,280
This is the water.

76
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,630
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,370
Good afternoon!

78
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,450
Welcome.

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,120
Welcome.

80
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm hungry...

81
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,650
Nice to meet you. I'm Anna.

82
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,890
"Nice to meet you"?
Don't tell me you're a waitress here!

83
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,650
What do you mean by that?

84
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,860
There's no doubt about it... Anna
is a waitress for this restaurant.

85
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,940
I'm looking forward to serving here.

86
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,860
Is this for real?

87
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,320
Anna, I'll have some carbonara.

88
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,530
Anna, I'll have a Bolognese.

89
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,780
Anna, can you come here and get me some water?

90
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,160
I'll be there in a second.

91
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,330
We have carbonara and a Bolognese.

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,920
Got it.

93
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,290
Thanks for waiting.

94
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,500
Thank you.

95
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,160
One vongole, one rigatoni!!

96
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,470
Coming.

97
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,900
Where did you catch a cute one like her?

98
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,400
"Catch"? Don't bad-mouth people.

99
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,010
Anna, I'll take you to a nicer place
than this. Are you free tonight?

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,250
I won't let you off easy if you
touch my serving girl!

101
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,740
That crybaby Rosso is using
some pretty tough words.

102
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,380
That guy cried when he was watching a movie at my house.

103
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,490
Shut up...

104
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,300
Another squid ink risotto.

105
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,240
They're playing "Summertime."

106
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,750
Huh?

107
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,480
They're playing "Summertime" at
the Masterpiece Theater. Look.

108
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,910
It must be great. Frankfurt has a
lot of movie theaters.

109
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,730
It was on TV before.

110
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,250
I cried so much.

111
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,540
Have you seen it?

112
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,130
No.

113
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,210
I see.

114
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,630
This movie is set in Venice.

115
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,480
Venice is a port city in Italy. It's
been called the water capital.

116
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,450
Wow!

117
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,190
It was originally built on a lagoon,

118
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,980
so a canal ran throughout the city.

119
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,460
I'd like to show you Venice some time.

120
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,950
Have you been there?

121
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,480
Yes.

122
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,200
On top of that, the music in
the movie is pretty good.

123
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,210
You've probably heard the
main theme for the movie.

124
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,710
What kind of song was it?

125
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,050
Let's see...

126
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,460
If we hurry, we could see it.
We could still get in.

127
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,150
Yes...

128
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,430
But...

129
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,730
I see. If we go now, it'll be
late by the time we get out.

130
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,690
Yeah.

131
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,150
I'm back.

132
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,890
Welcome back.

133
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,170
Ahh. I'll do it.

134
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,390
Don't worry about it.

135
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,260
I'm sorry for leaving every afternoon.

136
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,350
It's okay. I'm free this time of day anyway.

137
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,480
I don't mean to pry, but...

138
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,510
Where do you go every day?

139
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,520
You don't have to answer. It's your business
where you go when you're not working.

140
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,790
I have marksmanship training.

141
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,910
Marksmanship?

142
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,170
Yes, from a man named Wenkel.

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,630
Oh, you go to Wenkel's place.

144
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,170
He's a good guy.

145
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,230
Have you ever fired a gun before, Mr. Rosso?

146
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,110
Guns are terrible.

147
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,060
Just seeing one makes me tremble all over.

148
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,410
Here you go. Enjoy.

149
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,830
Thank you.

150
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,240
I wonder how it is this time.

151
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,980
Why don't you try it, then?

152
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,220
What can you taste in it?

153
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,760
Garlic, olive oil, and parsley.

154
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,640
The flavors of everything else you put
in there disappeared, didn't they?

155
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,550
Yes.

156
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,650
Then it's not a real pasta dish.

157
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,470
This is hard.

158
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,990
Everything is training.

159
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,290
Mr. Rosso, the bath is free.

160
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,710
Good night.

161
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,350
I couldn't believe that there was such
a movie when I was young...

162
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,530
Mr. Rosso, you always cry
when you watch movies.

163
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:01,000
When I was young, even if I wanted to see
them, I never had time to watch movies.

164
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,960
I should have eaten a lot of good things then,

165
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,260
but I can't remember the taste
of anything from that time.

166
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,430
I didn't even know the taste of sugar.

167
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,670
The taste of sugar?

168
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,010
You know about me, don't you?

169
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,070
After you left here, I did a little
background check on you.

170
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,240
Nina Fortner.

171
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,830
Her parents were murdered. Current
whereabouts unknown.

172
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,540
What did you want from me?

173
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,070
Did you want a job, or did you want
me to tell you something?

174
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
I wanted you to tell me something.

175
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,820
How did you know about me?

176
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,030
There was a law professor at
the university where I studied.

177
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:18,320
The Ristorante Nino Case, The Sacco Milano
Case, The Sabatini Bombing...

178
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,710
You were an important reference for three murder
cases where the modus operandi were different.

179
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,960
They all resulted in a ruling of no prosecution
due to the lack of evidence.

180
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,840
That professor had an interesting theory, though.

181
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,280
He said that you were,

182
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,920
without a doubt, a professional assassin.

183
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,070
On top of that, you were top-class.

184
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,050
How many people do you think I killed?

185
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,790
The truth is that I don't remember myself.

186
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,940
When I was a kid, before I knew it,
I was a member of the organization.

187
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,250
Theft, blackmail, anything you could think of...

188
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,180
In the end, I became an assassin.

189
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,450
I was able to eat well, thanks to the rewards.

190
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,780
I never asked why.

191
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,030
It was my job.

192
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,800
That day was the same.

193
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,430
Just as usual.

194
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,450
It was at a cafÃ© in broad daylight.

195
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,290
I was lining up my shot on someone, not knowing
or caring what number target he was.

196
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,540
That person was drinking coffee.

197
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,130
He was beginning to add sugar to it.

198
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,140
One spoonful.

199
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,300
Two spoonfuls.

200
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,180
Three spoonfuls.

201
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,310
Four spoonfuls.

202
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,900
When he added the fifth spoonful of sugar, the taste
of the coffee I drink all the time spread in my mouth.

203
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,990
That someone began to drink it happily.

204
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,280
That's when I put down my gun.

205
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,530
That was it. That's what made me stop killing people.

206
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,530
Why didn't you ask me how to kill
people for these last six months?

207
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,440
I...

208
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,160
I thought that I shouldn't get you involved.

209
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,800
Do you have to go?

210
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,110
Goodbye.

211
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,620
Thank you, Mr. Rosso.

212
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,850
Killing people is easy...

213
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,500
if you can forget the taste of sugar.

214
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,460
