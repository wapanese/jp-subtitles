1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,320
What's this?

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,830
It's okay now.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,120
Never again...

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,790
Never again will blood flow through this forest.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,170
Isn't that right?

6
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,990
A Child's View

7
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,640
<i>"The falling deaths of children...
Is it suicide or murder?!"</i>

8
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,730
<i>"Was it just dangerous child's play?
Or is this the next victim!!"</i>

9
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,110
<i>"A fifth victim... Entry Restrictions to
Building Rooftops to be Reinforced!!"</i>

10
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,030
Ralph Ludwich Memorial Hospital

11
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,490
You don't remember anything?

12
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,610
What happened on the roof back then?

13
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,870
What did you do? Could you tell
me anything you remember?

14
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,710
Spit it out, Martin!

15
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,960
If you hadn't hit the first floor awning and landed
in the bushes, you might be dead right now.

16
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,550
Tell the doctor like a good boy,

17
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,680
so that stupid things like this won't keep on happening.

18
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,470
Calm down, ma'am.

19
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,430
But... If he died, I... I...

20
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,810
Listen to me, ma'am.

21
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,520
I've come to counsel the boy here.

22
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,990
I know... I know, but Doctor...

23
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,860
Let's talk outside, okay?

24
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,380
Dieter, be a good boy and stay there.

25
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,380
Don't wander into the rooms.

26
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,340
Is he your grandchild?

27
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,390
No, I'm just watching over him.

28
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,510
H-Hey there.

29
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,890
Hey.

30
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,410
I'm Dieter.

31
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,700
I'm Martin.

32
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,000
Does it hurt?

33
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,000
Does what hurt?

34
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,290
Your injuries... Your bandaged injuries?

35
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,090
Were you scared when you fell from the roof?

36
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,050
Stop! What are you doing?

37
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,100
There are some shoes in that bag. Get them for me.

38
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,060
What are you doing? You should rest.

39
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,570
Get my shoes.

40
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,110
Where are you going to go?

41
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,070
They'll get mad at you.

42
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,830
So what?

43
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,710
I'm not scared of them getting mad at me at all.

44
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,590
Just like he said...

45
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,590
"If you make it back, go outside."

46
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,760
"The world will change."

47
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,850
It's not that the world changed. I'm the one who changed.

48
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,240
Because I've been chosen.

49
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,460
It's so boring.

50
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,760
I can't believe the world is so boring.

51
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:05,970
Watch out!

52
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,200
You should come too.

53
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,990
There's nothing to be afraid of.

54
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,060
What'd you do that for?

55
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,690
Look at him, he's scared.

56
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,320
Stop it.

57
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,610
I told you to look at him!

58
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:01,990
"Save me."

59
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,620
"I don't want to die! Save me!"
Is that what you're thinking?

60
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,250
Fine, I'll spare your life.

61
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,730
I'll answer your question from before.

62
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,900
Huh?

63
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,070
You asked me if I was scared when I fell from the roof, didn't you?

64
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:40,940
Yeah.

65
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,450
I couldn't be afraid, since I was just playing around.

66
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,910
Playing? People have died!

67
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,250
It was so much fun. It was just play.

68
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,050
The two of us stood on an abandoned building.

69
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,470
We'd close our eyes and walk towards
each other, one step at a time.

70
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,060
It was a duel.

71
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,560
Whether you fell or whatever happened,
if you could survive, you'd win.

72
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,980
Why would you do that?

73
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,150
It's like making a wager with fate.

74
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,110
The one who survives was chosen.

75
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
You might not understand what I'm saying.

76
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,370
The person who survives can play again.

77
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,910
Play? What do you mean?

78
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,420
The world is boring.

79
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,300
This is fun. Only the ones chosen
by fate can keep on playing.

80
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,640
Don't you get it?

81
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,390
I thought you were one of us.

82
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,140
Come. I'll show you.

83
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,900
If you don't understand after you
see it, you truly are a moron.

84
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,530
Hey, you aren't thinking of going up to the roof, are you?

85
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,330
The chosen...

86
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,830
The superior people will survive.

87
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,830
Just like "that person."

88
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,540
Who's "that person?"

89
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,040
The person who taught me this game.

90
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,340
Who is he?

91
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,670
He's our friend.

92
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,590
The friend of us superior children.

93
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
Hurry up!

94
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,310
No, thanks.

95
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,970
C'mon. You're coming with me.

96
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,180
Let go of me.

97
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,350
You should be able to understand. So just come on!

98
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,350
Stop!

99
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,570
Who beat you up?

100
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,360
Your parents?

101
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,620
Are you going to be on their side?

102
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,200
Even though they did that to you, do you still
intend to be buried in this stupid world?

103
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,710
Come. Take a look for yourself.

104
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,050
How is the view from here?

105
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,300
How does it feel?

106
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,890
Stand up. What are you afraid of?

107
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,020
Stand up, close your eyes, and try walking.

108
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,360
Stand up!

109
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,570
I understand it...

110
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,280
I understand everything you've been saying.

111
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,410
I thought the world was pitch black.

112
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,620
I thought the future was pitch black.

113
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,040
What's your favorite food?

114
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,260
I just ate some delicious sausage, but
if I died, I'd never get to eat it again.

115
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,090
Scaredy cat!

116
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,470
I like soccer.

117
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,850
But if I died, I wouldn't kick a ball ever again.

118
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,230
Weakling.

119
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,350
I like Dr. Reichwine.

120
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,270
His secretary, Ms. Mereth, is kind.

121
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,820
If I died, I'd never see them again.

122
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,400
There will always be things to be scared of.

123
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,070
That's why he said to become an adult.

124
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,540
Tomorrow is a good day.

125
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,580
That's what Tenma taught me.

126
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,290
If I died, I'd never see Tenma again.

127
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,310
I'm scared!

128
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,330
Don't panic.

129
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,620
Carefully, bend your knees.

130
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,790
I can't be like him...

131
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,090
I can't be like Johan.

132
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,210
Johan.

133
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,260
Johan is playing even better games.

134
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,050
Johan said that he's going to be killed soon.

135
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,980
He said he's going to be shot by a Japanese man real soon.

136
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,590
I closed my eyes and walked on the edge of the roof.

137
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,220
It's true. I walked up there.

138
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,510
I wasn't scared at all.

139
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,600
When I opened my eyes, Joachim, who should
have been right in front of me, was gone!

140
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,520
I saw it. I saw the instant when someone
dies with my own eyes.

141
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,480
People really die.

142
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,280
Please have some tea.

143
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:57,990
Thank you.

144
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,530
I can't believe this kid. It's like he doesn't
even know what he's doing.

145
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,080
I'm glad he's alive, but when I think of
how Joachim's parents must feel...

146
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,290
Please talk some sense into him.

147
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,170
It seems like he'd listen to whatever you say.

148
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,930
She annoys me like that every day.

149
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,220
She doesn't let me out of the house.

150
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,930
TV and comics are off-limits for me, too.

151
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,850
That sounds pretty boring.

152
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,770
I'll come bring you something.

153
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,480
Really?

154
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,280
If you can't have comics, then how about a picture book?

155
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,780
A picture book? That sounds boring, too.

156
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,210
This great game you told me about... have you played it yet?

157
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,290
You said you might be shot soon, didn't you?

158
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm so excited.

159
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,670
When?

160
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,760
When is that Japanese person going to shoot you?

161
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,800
Tell me, Johan.

162
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,520
Herman Hesse's <i>Der Steppenwolf</i>, first edition.

163
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,230
And this...

164
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,610
Hoffman's <i>Nachtstucke</i>, first edition.

165
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,700
You have an entire collection of Goethe's poems.

166
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,660
It's a book collection big enough to make even me,

167
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:34,330
the head librarian at Munich University's
Fredrich Emannuel Library, dizzy.

168
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,290
I made it this far in life with self-study.
I didn't go to college.

169
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,720
I thought that I'd just read books
to learn, and this is the result.

170
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,180
To have such a large collection of
books donated to my library, I..

171
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,720
I don't have enough words to thank you with.

172
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,690
My eyesight is getting worse, so soon
I won't be able to read them at all.

173
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,530
I think they'd do more good in the hands of students
rather than being allowed to sleep here in this room.

174
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,490
Yes, many of the books are valuable, but they
should be accessible to normal people too.

175
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,330
I've already set aside a place for them.

176
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,590
There will be a ceremony, so if
you could please speak at it...

177
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,170
What about security?

178
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,260
Ever since Mr. Schubert has taken control of his
companies, I've been worried about his safety.

179
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,060
Please make sure that the invited guests
are checked out thoroughly.

180
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,850
Isn't that right, Johan?

181
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,890
Yes.

182
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,900
Karl and Johan, who suggested that
I donate these books, will go.

183
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm the Head Librarian, Gerhmann.

184
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,160
Nice to meet you.

185
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,490
Good to meet you, too.

186
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,540
Munich University Library

187
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,090
This will be the room where we are going to
put the books that Mr. Schubert is donating.

188
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,840
Regular visitors are not able to come back this far.

189
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,390
You probably have never been here either, have you?

190
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,640
The temperature and humidity are at optimum levels for storage

191
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,600
and, of course, this place is safe from fire or theft.

192
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,230
What a collection of great books!

193
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,940
This is truly a treasure of humanity.
Don't you think so, Johan?

194
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,860
A treasure of humanity, huh?

195
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,540
And we'll hold the donation ceremony in this center hall.

196
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,960
Just as your butler said, the security will be very tight.

197
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
I'd like Mr. Schubert to feel at ease.

198
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,050
Yeah.

199
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,050
I'm sure Dad will love it.

200
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,970
Isn't that right, Johan?

201
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,410
What's wrong Johan?

202
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,460
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

203
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,180
Are you looking for something?

204
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,690
Yes, I'm looking for a nice picture book for a friend.

205
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,230
A friend?

206
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,150
Yes, a friend.

207
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,990
Let's see. How about this one?

208
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,290
Isn't that a nice picture?

209
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,330
Yes, it is.

210
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,170
But it's a little too adult for him.

211
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,670
So your friend isn't a grown-up?

212
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,800
How about this one then?

213
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,010
Oh, no!

214
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,850
Thank you.

215
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,280
I'm a bit clumsy, so I'm always like this.

216
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,910
Ah, this is it.

217
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,170
This is the book I was going to suggest to you.

218
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,260
Do you like that one?

219
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,390
Oh, it has nice pictures. I wonder whose book that is.

220
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,310
Let me take a look.

221
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,020
Emil Scherbe...

222
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
The publisher is Moravia...

223
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,060
That publisher is located in Prague.

224
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,980
There are a lot of good picture book
artists in the Czech Republic.

225
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,490
But I've never heard of Scherbe.

226
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,030
He must not be very famous.

227
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,750
What's wrong?

228
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,370
Someone!

229
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,700
Someone come now!

230
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,730
This summer is so hot!

231
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,850
It's vicious!

232
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:41,320
"Announcing Mr. Hans Georg Schubert's Book
Collection Donation Ceremony and Speech."

233
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,140
This is the place.

234
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,370
From here, I'll kill him.

235
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:43,490
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

236
00:22:44,580 --> 00:23:00,890
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

237
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:25,970
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

238
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:34,450
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

239
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,490
At the Edge of Darkness
