1
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,450
The extremists are going to start a fire in that town!

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,530
That Turkish woman was killed.

3
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,660
We will soon arrive at the place Johan told us about.

4
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,250
I don't know what will happen. I'll assume
you know how to use that gun.

5
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,880
Take me to Frankfurt... to Calvin Street.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,130
Aren't you going to go kill Johan?

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll do that later. Now hurry!

8
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:53,600
General Wolf will be disappointed... After he
commissioned you to eliminate Johan...

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,140
Commissioned?

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,810
I won't take orders from anyone.

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,520
I'll kill Johan of my own free will.

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,690
Now go to Calvin Street!

13
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,880
Reunion

14
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,310
I've received word that the preparations for
starting the fire have been completed.

15
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,730
Good work.

16
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,230
Make sure to mark this rebirth of our master
race with a spectacular display.

17
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,280
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,570
Well, what should we do with them?

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,950
There are people like them even in the master race.

20
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,330
This one's a thief, and the kid was trying
to tell the Turks about our plans.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,130
They're both scum.

22
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,750
We must purify them.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,380
That's just how I feel.

24
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,590
This place is going to burn anyway,
so they can burn along with it.

25
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,180
Come on, don't cry...

26
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,600
Mama will be home.

27
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,190
Ayse.

28
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,510
Ay-

29
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,530
So you're alive.

30
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,610
Why are you here?

31
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,950
Dieter told me where it was.

32
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,120
Dieter?

33
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,010
So you're the Tenma he was talking about, huh?

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Has Dieter come here?

35
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,870
No.

36
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,560
He's not here?

37
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,050
More importantly, where's Ayse?

38
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,050
This is Ayse's son.

39
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,510
I have to give him back to his mother.

40
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,070
Huh?

41
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,140
Don't tell me...

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,730
I don't believe it!

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,650
What's going to happen to this baby?

44
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,190
What's going to happen to him if he
loses his mother at an age like this?

45
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,070
From now on, no more people will be sacrificed.

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,180
Let me see this town's representatives.

47
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,840
What do you think?

48
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,340
They're going to start a fire, huh?

49
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,270
So what? All year round, there are rumors
about the extremists' plans for a fire.

50
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,150
This Japanese guy... His life is in danger, but he just
shows up at our place. Seems pretty suspicious to me.

51
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,570
You people! Ayse died for this!

52
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,900
She was killed because she was going to warn us!

53
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,740
I wonder if that's really true.

54
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,820
Ayse is a prostitute, just like you.

55
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,790
She was doing business in an area with a lot of
Germans and disappeared. That happens a lot.

56
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,210
It's a disgrace to all Turks.

57
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,110
Yeah, who knows who that kid's father is?

58
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,550
That's what it takes to survive here. You all know this.

59
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,740
If you want to survive, listen to what I'm saying.

60
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,560
I've had enough! Do what you want!

61
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,590
I hope you all burn!

62
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,830
Wait a second there...

63
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,900
You want us to form a group of vigilantes?

64
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,570
Let's try doing what he says.

65
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,700
Dennis!

66
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,810
Are you going to listen to what this
suspicious Japanese guy is saying?

67
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,930
He is suspicious,

68
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,430
but there are some Japanese
people you should believe...

69
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,330
like General Nogi.

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,440
General Nogi...?

71
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,000
Haven't you heard of him?

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:01,560
He was a Japanese man who saved the Turkish Navy when it was in the Pacific.

73
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,830
Gather all the men in the town.

74
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,560
It looks delicious.

75
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,820
We're having a special dinner tonight too, it seems.

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,900
Hold up. You shouldn't eat so quickly.

77
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,080
If you do, our dinner will end before show time.

78
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,000
The main dish should come at the climax of the show.

79
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,230
We can enjoy it while drinking the Chateau
Latour '76 I've been saving for this evening.

80
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,780
We will tickle our taste buds with my
favorite, raw halibut with caviar...

81
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,740
And eventually...

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,610
Look!

83
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,850
The first fire has appeared.

84
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,420
That's still just an appetizer, though.

85
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,590
When is the main dish?

86
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,800
Didn't I tell you not to rush?

87
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,970
You have to save the taste and enjoy the show...

88
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,220
Hmm?

89
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,100
Where is the main dish?

90
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,890
If that fire is an appetizer,

91
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,140
where will the fire that you call the "main dish" start?

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,440
Fire!

93
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,150
Bring water!

94
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,020
It won't be enough for a fire like that!

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,030
Don't have everyone go.

96
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,820
People with free hands, come with me.

97
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,820
As I thought, the fire was started upwind.

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,700
That means that this area is
in danger, too. Let's split up!

99
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,490
Oh, another wonderful guest has arrived.

100
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,790
Don't move!

101
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,880
I will shoot.

102
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,710
Put that dangerous thing away.

103
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,470
Enjoy yourself.

104
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,970
It's a pity, but your appetizers are being put out.

105
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,720
Well, they are only appetizers, after all.

106
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,940
This was your favorite food, right?

107
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,720
Too bad.

108
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,780
Why don't you just enjoy yourself?

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,960
This is a party to call your brother, Johan.

110
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,660
Johan wouldn't want this.

111
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,580
How do you know that?

112
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,580
I saw it.

113
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,370
I went to the place he mentioned in his message.

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,210
He didn't want this.

115
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,210
What did you see?

116
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,800
He...

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,310
He didn't wish for anything!

118
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,930
I-I get it.

119
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,770
Relax... Calm down.

120
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,320
You killed Ayse.

121
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,020
I won't let you do any more horrible things!

122
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,830
Where is the "main dish"?

123
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,190
Where are you going to start the fire?

124
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,700
Damn it! They started fires in places that
are difficult for fire trucks to access.

125
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,790
Carry the injured. I'll be there in a second.

126
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,040
Tenma.

127
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,500
Did you find Dieter?

128
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,680
Someone said they saw a boy like
him at the park during the day.

129
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,840
Dieter...

130
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,690
Are you sure you don't want us to follow her?

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,650
Yes. Let's continue with dinner.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,620
She certainly is Johan's little sister.

133
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Huh?

134
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,410
Her eyes... I could see that she really was going to kill me.

135
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,630
Because of that, I was just about to tell her the
truth about where the main dish will be.

136
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,130
Shall I bring you the rest of your dinner?

137
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,180
No. I need some new underwear first.

138
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,990
Huh?

139
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,020
She is a frightening girl.

140
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,190
Hold on! I'll put out the flames.

141
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,130
You're quite the trooper, little boy.

142
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,880
You're safe now.

143
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,340
I don't know who you are, but thanks.

144
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,640
How did you end up like this?

145
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,340
That is...

146
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,810
It's this kid's fault.

147
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,230
We were almost done for!

148
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,030
Well, I'm off.

149
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,660
They aren't going to stop at
just this simple little plan.

150
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,200
I used to live here when I was a
kid, so I know this place well.

151
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,470
If I were to start a fire, I wouldn't do it here.

152
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,700
This was just a decoy.

153
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,720
It seems that we managed to put out
three fires that were upwind.

154
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,270
We owe you our thanks, Mr. Tenma. Right, everyone?

155
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,190
Yeah, thanks to you, we avoided a catastrophe.

156
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,770
First, we have to treat the injured.

157
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,020
I won't let there be any more sacrifices.

158
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,150
I just won't!

159
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,530
What do you mean a decoy?

160
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,200
The direction of the wind will change.

161
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,830
Right about now, the wind stops, and then, all of the
sudden, the breeze from the river starts to blow.

162
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,710
The wind has stopped.

163
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,800
Well now... it's finally time for the main dish.

164
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,280
All right. It shouldn't give you any problems now.

165
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,960
Thank you, Doctor. Let's have a drink.

166
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,130
What are you saying? You should rest if you're injured.

167
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,540
Don't be so strict.

168
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,340
That's right. Thanks to you, we stopped
the fires before they got out of hand.

169
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,720
The extremists must have been frustrated
since their fires were put out.

170
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,180
They should never have underestimated us Turks.

171
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,350
Is there any other place where the wounded are staying?

172
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,150
A mosque by the river.

173
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,280
Hey, Dr. Tenma. Take a break already. Have a drink!

174
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,490
I have to treat the wounded first.

175
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,530
If all the fires so far have just been a distraction, then,

176
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,310
where are they going to set the next fire?

177
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,580
Leave me alone!

178
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,170
I don't care what happens to this place.

179
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,000
I have something to attend to.

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,590
Wait!

181
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,590
I'm begging you! Tell me!

182
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,050
Where would you set the fire?

183
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,840
I told you!

184
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,160
The river breeze will begin to blow.

185
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,270
If they set fire to the factories by the
river, no one could stop them.

186
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,170
There are some chemicals left there.

187
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,410
It's finally time...

188
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,150
It's time for the main dish.

189
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,450
Fill me up with satisfaction!

190
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,080
It's all going as planned.

191
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,460
The party for the master race begins now.

192
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,940
Little boy... Why did you follow me?

193
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,070
We have to put out that fire.

194
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,950
I promised Tenma.

195
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,410
Tenma...

196
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,750
This is the warehouse, right here.

197
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,670
Good. Maybe they haven't noticed this place.

198
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,040
Are these all chemicals?

199
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,470
If all of these chemicals catch fire, the
entire city is doomed.

200
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,730
All right, I'll guard this area.

201
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,850
I absolutely won't let them start a fire here.

202
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,730
Are you okay?

203
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,190
I slipped.

204
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,560
What is this?

205
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,950
It's gasoline.

206
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,500
Someone's... here.

207
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,670
Don't worry. I can walk by myself.

208
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,810
Let me take a look at you at the shelter.

209
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,970
Thanks. I got a sprain when I was
carrying some important tools.

210
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,290
As long as I have this rug, I don't need this town!

211
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,730
800,000 marks... No, 1,000,000 marks!

212
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,610
Heckel!

213
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,280
What happened to Dieter?

214
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,620
Well, that is...

215
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm asking you where Dieter went!

216
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,500
If you're looking for him, why don't you
try looking around the riverside factory?

217
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,880
Factory?

218
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,540
The river breeze will start to blow soon.

219
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,850
If the chemicals there were ignited,
this town would be done for.

220
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,300
See? This wind!

221
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,100
Tell everyone in the shelter to get away from the river!

222
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,100
Hurry!

223
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,690
Let's go, Heckel!

224
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,570
Who's there?

225
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,630
Don't move!

226
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,930
It's you. So you're Johan's sister.

227
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,670
Throw away the lighter!

228
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,980
If I use this lighter, the gasoline will
make this place go up in flames.

229
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,480
I'll shoot you in the head before you can do that.

230
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,180
If I cut your cranial nerves, I can
stop you from moving!

231
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,940
Will you be able to hit them?

232
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,860
I had six months of training.

233
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,740
I have a 100% chance of hitting them from this range.

234
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,530
Your threats won't work on me.

235
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,910
This is the party for the master race...

236
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,430
a party to call Johan!

237
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,160
Johan doesn't want that!

238
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,630
It is true that Johan came to Frankfurt,

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,510
but he killed one of your leaders
and his men, and then he left.

240
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,910
He left a message afterwards.

241
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,810
Message?

242
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,310
He's not the type of person you think he is.

243
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,650
He's something more complicated than that.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
What are you trying to say?

245
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,400
He's something more frightening than that.

246
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,570
He's suffering in an abyss of sadness.

247
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,750
I don't know about this... I don't like
messing with this organization...

248
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,140
Where is the warehouse?

249
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,500
Hey, hey. I've done enough.

250
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,840
I'll take my leave right now.

251
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,510
What are you saying?

252
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,720
Are you just going to let Dieter die?

253
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,930
Where's the warehouse?!

254
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,280
I'll tell. I'll tell already!

255
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,770
You said your friend is named Tenma, right?

256
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,940
I also know someone called Tenma.

257
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,150
Really? Is he a brave person?

258
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,780
Yes, but he told me never to hold a gun.

259
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,780
He thought that you shouldn't kill.

260
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,790
You mustn't ever kill.

261
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,910
No matter how evil they are?

262
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,000
That's right. Never do what I'm about to do.

263
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,420
Close your eyes! Don't look!

264
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,420
Don't shoot!

265
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,030
Tenma!

266
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,340
Heckel, put out the fire!

267
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,070
The rug! Hurry up!

268
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,580
Stop, idiot!

269
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,470
My million...

270
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,970
Nina...

271
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,350
Tenma.

272
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,730
Crap! It's the cops!

273
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,940
Run! Leave this man to me.

274
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,940
There's a boat in the river.

275
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,780
Hurry up and get out of here, Tenma!

276
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,080
My main dish... has gotten cold.

277
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,510
Thank you for your cooperation.

278
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,070
Could you give me the details at the station?

279
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,700
Just a second. I'll be right back.

280
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,310
Hey, you!

281
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,560
Tenma!

282
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,660
Nina!

283
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,080
Nina, promise me something.

284
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,170
Don't shoot.

285
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,170
You must never shoot anyone!

286
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,170
I saw it... I saw Johan's message.

287
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,250
I saw it, too. I'm going there.

288
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,420
That day, ten years ago, when I shot Johan...

289
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,920
I finally understand why he
told me to aim at his head.

290
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,220
Johan... isn't one person.

291
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,520
There are two Johans!

292
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,660
So... Dr. Tenma...

293
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,290
It wasn't your fault.

294
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:25,300
I have to... I have to aim at
Johan's head once again.

295
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,310
Hey, why are we stopping here?
Let's hurry up and go!

296
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,530
Geez. My life sucks.

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,280
I'm hungry, and I have no money.

298
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,570
If only I had that rug...

299
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,370
Huh? What's this?

300
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,630
This is...

301
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,100
"Help me! The monster inside
me is about to explode."

302
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,150
Johan has...

303
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,650
two personalities!

304
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,530
Five Sugars
