1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,680
You look well.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,100
I am.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,900
How's work?

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,440
Is it going well?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,670
Yes.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,940
That's good to hear.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,950
Is Rosemary doing well?

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,450
She is.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,830
She has lots of friends.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,330
I see. That's great.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,750
That's great.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,310
So she's getting used to school.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,250
Excuse me.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,420
I'm sorry, but I have to be going now.

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,660
I've brought a picture of Rosemary.

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,060
Can I see her?

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,770
How about it? We'll meet right here.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,530
I've stopped drinking, and I'm getting my
life straightened out to how it was before.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,160
No, this might be the first time in
my life that I've been this stable.

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,620
I understand the importance of
the things I've lost.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,130
I'll let her decide whether or
not she'll see you.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,220
Oh. Well, sure...

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,930
Then, if you'll excuse me...

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,090
Okay.

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,340
Yes?

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,180
More coffee, please.

27
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,990
Proof

28
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,990
Doctor, what do you think of this man?

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,910
Hey now, Richard.

30
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,660
Yes?

31
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,420
What exactly do you think
you came here for?

32
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,790
You came here to receive my counseling.

33
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,540
I told you, I'm not a fortune teller.

34
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,260
It's the years of experience
with clients, right?

35
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,800
So who is this boy?

36
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,640
He's the one who discovered the body.

37
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,560
He was the first to find Fahren's body.

38
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,670
He's just a friend.

39
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,310
Hey, Richard.

40
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,780
You shouldn't be such a workaholic. You need
to relax some of the time too, you know.

41
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,700
I am relaxed.

42
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,200
That's good then.

43
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,910
Actually, Doctor...

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,330
What?

45
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,620
I might be able to see my daughter!

46
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,830
Oh, you must be excited!

47
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,830
Yes.

48
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,000
However...

49
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,090
even if you see her,
you can't take back what you've lost.

50
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,930
You should keep that in mind.

51
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,760
No matter what happens, do not drink!

52
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,930
Got it?!

53
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,810
Don't worry.

54
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,060
So are you going back to work?

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,870
Yes.

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,900
Well, soon you'll have to tackle the case that got you
fired from the police. Are you ready for that?

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,280
Yes, of course I am.

58
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,040
He was 16 and a serial murderer.

59
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,710
I shot and killed him...

60
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,420
while I was on duty and drunk.

61
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,290
That's good.

62
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,130
You can't run away from that.

63
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,880
You cannot erase the truth.

64
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,250
But what's important is...

65
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,750
Moving forward from there, right?

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,930
Good.

67
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,850
You're a good student.

68
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,690
Do I get 100%?

69
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,830
Don't be ridiculous. I don't hand
out 100%s so easily.

70
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,130
People who get 100%s are boring, anyway.

71
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,700
No way!

72
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,160
Karl Neuman.

73
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,500
A management studies major in the business
department at Munich University...

74
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,590
Just like Fahren, he claimed to be
the son of Mr. Schubert.

75
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,350
I cannot yet determine whether
this is true or not,

76
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,640
but this young man definitely has
something to do with the case.

77
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,270
Hello?

78
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,730
Richard, I'm done with the cleaning,
so I'd like to excuse myself.

79
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,490
Thanks for all of your hard work.

80
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,570
It's no problem at all!

81
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,490
I can't believe a man living by himself
keeps his place so clean.

82
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,370
It was pretty horrible before, though.

83
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,790
There's a new picture of your
daughter now, isn't there?

84
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,240
Yes, soon I'll be able to see her.

85
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,850
That's great! She'll be so happy.

86
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,220
Do you think so?

87
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,470
Of course! There's not a girl in the world who
wouldn't be happy to see her parents.

88
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,150
Munich University
Friedrich Emmanuel Hall

89
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,650
That's good.

90
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,440
So have you finished your report?

91
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,660
Karl Neuman.

92
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,240
Why haven't you told Mr. Schubert
that you're his son?

93
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,790
Are you a swindler... or are
you the real thing?

94
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,090
If you really are his son,

95
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,760
a parent would like to see
his child any time he could.

96
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,690
I'm sorry. She said she didn't
want to see you.

97
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,140
I guess that will have to do.

98
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,930
I'm sorry. I don't have much time either.

99
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,560
Oh, I see.

100
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,080
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

101
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,690
Bye.

102
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,900
Okay.

103
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,180
Yes?

104
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,050
What would you like?

105
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,440
Whiskey.

106
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,690
All right.

107
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,080
Here you go.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,610
Huh?

109
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,940
Excuse me...

110
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,150
I'm going to see Dad.

111
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,350
Not now.

112
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,400
If you want to see him,
go when you're grown up.

113
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,990
But you mustn't want anything from him.

114
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,860
You must not hate him if
he treats you coldly,

115
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,700
because I don't hate him.

116
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,120
Take this.

117
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,410
Your father gave you this when you were born.

118
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,950
"With no one to admire it,
the Lares daffodil bloomed."

119
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,020
"With no one to admire them,
the Pierias trees rustled."

120
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,860
"Ah, you follow in the tracks of those of the
same blood before you, nameless ones."

121
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,430
Wonderful.

122
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,400
Neuman, you've become wonderful at reading.

123
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,140
Thank you very much.

124
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,410
I'm very impressed that you've become so
good at reading Latin in such a short time.

125
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,250
The truth is that I've been taking lessons.

126
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,670
He must be an excellent teacher.

127
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,630
Who is it?

128
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,860
Johann... Johann Liebert.

129
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,330
So it was Johann? He's perfect.

130
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,290
Yes.

131
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,600
Not just in Latin...

132
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,440
In law and business. No, he's complete
in many forms of study.

133
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,070
He's even been blessed with a handsome face.

134
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,910
Um, Mr. Schubert.

135
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,040
If a young man like him... if a young man like him
were your real son, what would you think?

136
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,510
He smiled.

137
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,210
He actually smiled.

138
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,780
It seems that you'd be the perfect son,
according to him.

139
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,150
To be honest, I was jealous.

140
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,950
Even though it's obvious that you're
better than me.

141
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,530
After doing that, I kind of felt
disgusted with myself.

142
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,080
Why don't you tell him?

143
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,950
Huh?

144
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,130
Why don't you tell him that
you're his real son?

145
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,420
Stop that!

146
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,840
I've told you that I don't have
any intention of doing that.

147
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,640
Even if I did tell him, he wouldn't believe me.

148
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,480
He'd just think that I was a
hyena after his fortune.

149
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,190
I absolutely don't want that.

150
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,610
He doesn't know my mother lived and died.

151
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,440
He doesn't know how I've felt.

152
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,660
I don't want him to think of me that
way without knowing those things.

153
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,910
That's exactly why you should tell him.

154
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,750
Make him understand everything.

155
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,090
He won't believe anything.

156
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,280
There's got to be something that
will make him believe you...

157
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,680
Something that will make him
know you're his real son...

158
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,810
No, there isn't.

159
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,350
Remember. There has to be something.

160
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,130
I told you, there isn't anything! I
have no intention of telling him.

161
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,500
Then why are you learning Latin from me?

162
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,410
Because you want him to be proud of you?

163
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,910
Because you want him to like you?

164
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,920
I think I'm going to quit.

165
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,380
My job, reading to him...

166
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,510
I'm going to quit.

167
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,810
Thanks for your concern.

168
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,060
It's okay now.

169
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,190
Johann.

170
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,230
I'll tell this just to you.

171
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,400
The truth is that I do have
proof that I'm his son.

172
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,160
What is it?

173
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,090
But I don't have any intention of showing
it to him and claiming to be his son.

174
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,380
My foster parents are coming
to see me next week.

175
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,670
I've made up my mind.

176
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,210
When they come, I'm going to...

177
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,510
I see.

178
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:26,020
So you won't go back on your decision... Maybe
you should leave that evidence with me.

179
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,690
You look well. I'm relieved.

180
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,190
Isn't that right, Mom?

181
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,720
Yes. I was worried about how
you were eating.

182
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,240
I've been eating out so much, I'm
worried that I'm getting fat.

183
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,700
Mom's cooking will make you fat, too.

184
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,230
Because it's so good.

185
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,730
How's school going?
Have you made any friends?

186
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,730
Yes, great friends that
I can ask anything of.

187
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,460
I see. That's great.

188
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,240
I can tell by looking at your face
that everything is going well.

189
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,110
I'm so thankful that you've allowed
me to come and study here.

190
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,100
What is it now?

191
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,020
I've had so many foster parents up until
now, and you've truly treated me well.

192
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,190
It's because you're such a wonderful child.

193
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,960
That's right, Karl.

194
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,240
Thank you, Mr. Lindner.

195
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,670
Could you stop calling me Mr. Lindner?

196
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,800
Have you accepted our proposal
to be our real adopted child?

197
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,930
We've waited all this time that you've been in college,

198
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,790
but we were thinking that you've had
enough time to make your decision.

199
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,930
We believe in you.

200
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,190
Can you believe in us?

201
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,810
Of course.

202
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,280
Your real parents might be
alive somewhere.

203
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,910
We might never be able to
replace them, but...

204
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,770
That's not true at all.

205
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,750
You are my true parents.

206
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,010
Honey.

207
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,090
This calls for a toast.

208
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,490
We'll order some special, expensive wine.

209
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,430
Okay.

210
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,890
Excuse me. Could we see the wine menu?

211
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,000
Today is a special day!

212
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,910
Hello?

213
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,450
Is that you, Neuman? It's me.

214
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,250
Mr. Schubert?

215
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,130
I've heard that you're going
to quit your job.

216
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,110
Yes.

217
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,220
It's a shame.

218
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,300
Forgive me.

219
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,140
You've worked so hard to
become good at Latin.

220
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,270
Thank you.

221
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,190
It really is a shame. It saddens me.

222
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,780
If you wouldn't mind,
could you read to me one last time?

223
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,490
Yes, I'd be happy to do so.

224
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,790
Is Chapter Three from
"From Aeolis to Lemnos" okay?

225
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,420
Yes, that would be great.

226
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,460
"That deep sea of mystery..."

227
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,880
"Wasn't it wishing for the death of Phoebus?"

228
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,930
"Doesn't Cerberus have anything else to look forward
to other than the death of our sons and daughters?"

229
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,060
"Now, 'Go forth,' says Zeus. 'Go forth. Go forth."'

230
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,070
"Dance at the temple of the gods."

231
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,660
"Gods of Juno, who live in the earth,
the sea, and the heavens."

232
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,630
"From the summit of the Parthenon, steal
the forbidden apple of Campania."

233
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,470
"Bring it all here. Seek out... my heart."

234
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,600
"My heart..."

235
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,420
Mr. Schubert.

236
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,340
That phone call...

237
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,180
That was splendid.

238
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,180
That was the most heartfelt reading
I've ever heard.

239
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,640
Why did you hide this from me?

240
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,440
That...

241
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,610
It's the same rabbit foot that I gave
to your mother, Margot.

242
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,820
It was a lucky charm to bring you good
fortune when you were born.

243
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,700
This is yours, Karl.

244
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm sorry I've caused you such pain.

245
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,690
Father!

246
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,700
My son.

247
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,730
It's thanks to him.

248
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,530
He told me.

249
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,860
He's going to be working for
me as a secretary.

250
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,590
A young man I can trust...

251
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,550
Just One Case
