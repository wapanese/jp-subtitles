1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,990
Nice
(South France)

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,100
Barbara, how would you like a Moscow Mule?

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,860
Thank you, Michael.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,990
Fritz, I've brought you some juice

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,570
Fritz, say thank you to your dad.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,300
Thanks, Mister.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,580
Fritz!

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,960
It can't be helped.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,540
He'll gradually warm up to me,

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,450
just like how I'll have to get
used to this new art business.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,820
It's all just so sudden for me...

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,020
Being able to live in this wonderful mansion,

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,620
having such a kind husband
to make me delicious cocktails...

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,940
Hey, do you feel anything?

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:54,650
Huh?

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,500
From the neighbor's house.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,010
It feels like we were being watched from
the second-floor window over there.

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,700
You know that there's no one living there.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,010
I know, but...

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,540
To tell the truth, I heard from Mrs. d'Autrey...

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,720
About what?

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,110
The neighbors, the husband and wife,
were killed twenty years ago.

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,730
Ever since then, ghosts appear in that house.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,590
What's wrong, Michael?

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,740
Don't tell me you believe that crazy story!

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,820
N-No way!

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,110
Are you going out?

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,740
Yes.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,070
I'll get the car.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,580
Don't worry about it.

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,090
I want us to go out, just as
a family, every once in a while.

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,640
We don't need a bodyguard.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,560
I see. That way, Fritz will
warm up to you faster.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,130
Yep. That's what I'm aiming for.

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,870
Good luck, Mr. Dad.

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,970
Shall we go?

37
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,360
Happy Holidays

38
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,730
What are the results of your investigation, Detective?

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll start with Dr. Tenma.

40
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,330
The police are after him because he's a suspect
for the murder of a married couple,

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
but there hasn't been any trace of him.

42
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,650
When he was called back by the
police, this is what Tenma said:

43
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,340
A boy whose life he saved ten years ago
killed three people and escaped.

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,520
The victims included the director
of Eisler Memorial Hospital.

45
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,270
The boy's name was Johan.

46
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,960
The boy appeared in front of him as an adult

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,070
and committed another murder right before his eyes.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,300
Next, I'll tell you about Nina Fortner.

49
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,820
She is the daughter of the murdered couple.

50
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,530
Her whereabouts are currently unknown.

51
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,950
This is Mr. Messner.

52
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,520
He made it all the way to Frankfurt, as ordered.

53
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,880
Where is he now?

54
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,620
He's dead.

55
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,420
He was recklessly stabbed two months ago.

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,550
He was involved in a drug deal that went bad.

57
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,100
Back when I was in the force,
Messner was my partner.

58
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,310
I see.

59
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,860
He was dismissed on drug charges.

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,310
The man who saved him after
that incident was "The Baby."

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,860
He was an influential man in an extremist group.

62
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,050
What happened?

63
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,160
There was an incident in Frankfurt where
fire was set to the Turkish quarters.

64
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,830
The rumor is that the man behind it was "The Baby."

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,060
They say that a certain Asian
man put out the flames.

66
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,710
The name of that man was Tenma.

67
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,180
Could it be that... it was our Dr. Tenma?

68
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,580
It is said that the arson that
"The Baby" was involved with

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,560
was a ceremony to welcome a certain man whom they
were trying to make their organization's leader.

70
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,690
A certain man?

71
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,590
What was the name of the boy that Dr. Tenma saved?

72
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,990
Johan.

73
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:54,230
The name of the man whom "The Baby" was
trying to get as their leader... was Johan.

74
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,050
So that's where you're going to move.

75
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,070
Roberto... My life is just like that pawn.

76
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,440
What's wrong? Is something on your mind?

77
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,240
Until I got that one phone call, everything
in my life was a failure.

78
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,520
My partner Messner and I had gotten our
hands dirty selling confiscated drugs.

79
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,710
The person on the phone knew everything.

80
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,130
If I wanted him to keep quiet, I
had to kill that married couple.

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,010
The Fortners in Heidelberg...

82
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,390
We'd be safe if we killed them.

83
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,020
There was another person in the house that night.
He was a newspaper reporter or something.

84
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,900
Messner and I killed all three of them.

85
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,030
After that, we received a lot of money.

86
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,120
I was picked up by a syndicate
after I quit the force.

87
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,370
I was immediately placed in a good position.

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,720
The money I made was easily laundered.

89
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,730
Then you met your wife and washed
your hands clean of that business.

90
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,330
I wonder why I was able to
leave the syndicate that easily.

91
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,600
Who was on the phone that one time?

92
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:17,810
When we received all that money,
who was controlling my life?

93
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,230
Roberto, I'm grateful to you.

94
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,820
You've always protected me.

95
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,060
Then could you take back that last move?

96
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,740
Huh?

97
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,540
I can't do that!

98
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,120
You're strict!

99
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,810
I'll be back, dear.

100
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,040
Right. Take care.

101
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,550
Buy me toys!

102
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,180
Say goodbye to your dad.

103
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,060
It's useless. He's only thinking
about toys right now.

104
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,930
I'll be back, Dad.

105
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,690
Goodbye!

106
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,950
Roberto, has the detective called?

107
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,870
He should be here by now.

108
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,510
Roberto.

109
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
Roberto, the detective's been hurt!

110
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,550
Come quick!

111
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,600
Roberto!

112
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,390
Who are you?

113
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm the daughter of the couple
you killed, Nina Fortner.

114
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,150
Did you kill him?

115
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,610
Roberto!

116
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,410
The one who killed him was
your bodyguard, Roberto!

117
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,910
Roberto did it?

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,340
I saw it from the house next door.

119
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,450
That can't be. Roberto is my
friend. I can trust him.

120
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,250
You... you've come to get your revenge on me!

121
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,090
Roberto... Roberto!

122
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm taking this bag.

123
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,300
If you want to stay here, go ahead.

124
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,940
A person like you has no one to trust.

125
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,120
What's wrong, Mr. Mueller?

126
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,210
Mr. Mueller?

127
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,150
Start the car.

128
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,250
Hurry!

129
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,480
You've been watching me from that
house for quite a while now.

130
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,900
What do you want from me?

131
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,730
I hate you from the bottom of my heart.

132
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,070
I hate you enough to kill you!

133
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,080
I... I was blackmailed.

134
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,090
If I didn't kill your parents, they would
have found out that I was selling drugs.

135
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,210
Messner and I didn't have a choice.

136
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,130
We had no choice!

137
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,090
You didn't have a choice?

138
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,640
You didn't... <i> have a choice</i>?

139
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,640
Stop!

140
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,100
Stop the car!

141
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,780
They were wonderful people.

142
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,460
Truly wonderful...

143
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,660
My mother and father loved
me with all their hearts.

144
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,420
W-Wait!

145
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,340
I wasn't even their real daughter!

146
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:44,640
But Mom and Dad truly... truly...

147
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,280
Stop! Please, don't!

148
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,310
Despite all of that, they were
killed by scum like you!

149
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,490
Barbara...

150
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,630
Fritz...

151
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,510
Barbara... Fritz...

152
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,760
What? What are you saying?

153
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,830
What's wrong with you?

154
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,560
This is what it feels like...

155
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,780
to be killed...

156
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,990
Fritz... He called me "Dad" for the first time.

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,910
I don't want to lose it.

158
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,250
I've found something I don't want to lose.

159
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,790
Barbara... Fritz...

160
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,430
Düsseldorf... Every day at 8:30 at that café.

161
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,960
I was ordered there every day after
I joined the organization.

162
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,600
I was ordered to look very
clean-cut, just like a salaryman.

163
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,150
Every day, a mother and her child would pass by.

164
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,820
That was my only contact with everyday life.

165
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,490
H-Hi there. Good morning.

166
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,570
Good morning.

167
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,330
What did you hire that detective for?

168
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,540
To find you, Tenma, and my partner
from when I was a police officer...

169
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,170
but Messner is dead.

170
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,470
I heard he was killed.

171
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,550
I was having a more detailed search done.

172
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,390
I got a call from the detective last night.

173
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,380
I have something unusual for you.

174
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,490
Something unusual?

175
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,030
Yes.

176
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:07,390
Messner was a heavy junkie who was in no condition
to get involved with some syndicate.

177
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,240
The killer wasn't from the Frankfurt syndicate.

178
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,540
He's from Düsseldorf.

179
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,660
Düsseldorf?

180
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,910
I'll give you the details when I see you.

181
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,120
Here it is.

182
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,290
It's scribbled on a piece of scrap paper.

183
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,750
"Messner's case."

184
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,130
"The perpetrator."

185
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,380
"Who is Roberto?"

186
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,010
Do you know what this means?

187
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,930
Hello.

188
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,070
I want the bag back.

189
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,400
R-Roberto!

190
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,860
Your wife and Fritz are relaxing right next to me.

191
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,860
Wh-What did you say?

192
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,950
Let my wife go!

193
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,780
You should come back soon... to your "Happy Home."

194
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,300
Your gun.

195
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,220
Could you lend me your gun?

196
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,600
You can only use it at close range,
and it only has four bullets.

197
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,730
It's good enough.

198
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,190
I was a police officer.

199
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,230
Be careful.

200
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,740
You want me to be careful so that I'll go
confess to the police after this, right?

201
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,480
That's right. You'd better not die.

202
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,450
I'll cover you from the house next door.

203
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
Dad!

204
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,640
Fritz?

205
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,140
Look, Dad! It's a fishing rod.

206
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,190
That kid! He's not going to rest until
he gets you to take him fishing.

207
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,820
Barbara.

208
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,400
Where's Roberto?

209
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,950
Oh, yeah.

210
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,650
Some of his friends from the security company
are here. It looks like something happened.

211
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,660
Friends?

212
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,290
Don't worry.

213
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,500
There wasn't any damage.

214
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
Roberto, Michael is back.

215
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,760
Don't worry. There's just one broken window.

216
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,270
It must have been some
kids in the neighborhood.

217
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,800
There's nothing to worry about.

218
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,860
Wh-Where's the body...?

219
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,420
The body of the detective that was here...

220
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,420
There never was anything here.

221
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,870
Roberto... Who are you?

222
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,700
The madam and Fritz will be here.

223
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,540
Now don't cause a fuss.

224
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,770
Here.

225
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,960
Good.

226
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,510
In truth, nothing happened.

227
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,510
Today was a peaceful day,

228
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,390
and it will be from now on.

229
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,310
Nina!

230
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,900
Nina!

231
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,690
Nina...

232
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,820
She was a beautiful girl.

233
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,200
What did you do with Nina?

234
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,580
We're treating her with courtesy.

235
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,040
She's quite special to a certain someone.

236
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,330
A certain someone?

237
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,170
That boy's name was Johan.

238
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,010
Johan, Johan, Johan! What's with this Johan?

239
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,760
Who are you people?

240
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,600
We want you to live happily with
the madam and Fritz.

241
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,930
Let's just leave it at that.

242
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,980
Just like that.

243
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,940
Thank you for your patronage.

244
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,900
I'll be leaving now.

245
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,570
What are you going to do to Nina?

246
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,820
Are you going to kill her?

247
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,490
Live happily.

248
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,210
Dad, when are you going to take me fishing?

249
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,000
Hmm...?

250
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,090
Tomorrow, if it's sunny.

251
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,510
Hooray!

252
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,100
I don't see ghosts anymore.

253
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,490
You have nice eyes. You and
Johan look very much alike.

254
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,280
When can I see Johan?

255
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,450
I came peacefully because you
said you'd let me meet Johan.

256
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,870
He wants to see you, too.

257
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,000
Where is he?

258
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,030
He lives happily in Munich.

259
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,210
Munich...?

260
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,970
You have really nice eyes.

261
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,040
Such a shame...

262
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,180
Well, take care of the rest.

263
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,860
Dr. Tenma?

264
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,770
Why...?

265
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,650
Why did you come here?

266
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,130
I told you. I used to be a police officer.

267
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,760
We'll be at your house soon.

268
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,530
I promised Fritz I'd take
him fishing tomorrow.

269
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,270
I see.

270
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,280
I hope it'll be sunny.

271
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,960
It'll definitely be sunny.

272
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,580
Lunge's Trap
