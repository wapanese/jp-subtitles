1
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,060
So you're... Roberto?

2
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,570
I have no name.

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,200
That's pretty bad... when a police officer...

4
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,830
can't even figure out the name...

5
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,540
of the man who's going to kill him.

6
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,690
A Nameless Man

7
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,260
It's a tragedy.

8
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,970
He was such a nice man.

9
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,720
He gave his life fighting for us.

10
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Mr. Grimmer.

11
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,570
Dr. Tenma, where are you going?

12
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,280
I can't just stay here.

13
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,990
You're going to find Inspector Lunge, aren't you?

14
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,790
I'm coming, too.

15
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,040
I have a gun.

16
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,210
The letter...

17
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,670
The letter that Inspector Lunge gave to Mr. Grimmer...

18
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,180
Inspector Lunge found it at the Red Rose Mansion.

19
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,390
"I've been watching you for quite some time."

20
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,770
"I've watched you so that I can take all of you in."

21
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,690
"But instead, you devoured me."

22
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,690
"How do I look to you as I am about to fall?"

23
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,200
"The thing you gave me as 1 was about to fall,"

24
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,040
"you left me a treasure."

25
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,870
"Those twins who seem to have eternal life."

26
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,590
"The greatest sin someone can
commit is to steal their name."

27
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,930
"I'll give them back. I'll give you back your names."

28
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,600
"Your name is Anna."

29
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,770
"Now I am only sad."

30
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,150
"Sad."

31
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,270
"Sad."

32
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,770
"Sad."

33
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,570
"Sad."

34
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,290
You wrote this, didn't you?

35
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,540
I fell in love with the twin's mother.

36
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,760
My way of thinking completely changed.

37
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,260
And then, I killed...

38
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,180
all the people who knew about her,

39
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,010
all the people who knew about the twins,

40
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,310
and all the people who knew about the experiment.

41
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,480
That is it.

42
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,650
Answer me.

43
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,730
Who are you?

44
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,820
That wound will be fatal if left untreated.

45
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,780
If you want me to help you, answer me.

46
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,780
Where is Johan?

47
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,500
Why are you willing to go so far for him?

48
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,040
What kind of relationship do you have with Johan?

49
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,250
How far you've fallen, Inspector Lunge.

50
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,430
A top-agent from the BKA is here, in this backwater town,

51
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,270
all alone, on a sightseeing trip without his badge.

52
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,270
You got caught too deep in a parliament scandal and lost your job.

53
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,320
You only live to chase down Tenma.

54
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,570
That's right. You've done your homework.

55
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,790
Your wife is living with another man.

56
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,290
She seemed pretty happy.

57
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,130
Your grandson thinks of him as his grandfather.

58
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:39,180
He has started talking. He calls that man "Grandpa."

59
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,050
Shut up.

60
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,060
I want to see him.

61
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,560
Shut up.

62
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,770
He's growing up to be an adorable little boy.

63
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,020
Shut up.

64
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,230
I want to see him.

65
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,030
Shut up!

66
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,240
How low you've fallen!

67
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,790
The old Inspector Lunge was never like this.

68
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,530
Who am I?

69
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,410
What kind of relationship do I have with Johan?

70
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I have no name, no country, and no memories.

71
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,290
The farthest back I can remember is leaving
the orphanage and starting my job.

72
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,970
One day, Johan appeared.

73
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,890
He brought back one of my memories.

74
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,480
Just one of them.

75
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,980
What was his real name?

76
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,650
He didn't know himself.

77
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,860
His own name?

78
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,490
Yeah.

79
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,990
He was at an orphanage.

80
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,250
He told me that everyone forgot everything there.

81
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,660
The only thing they could remember
was the name of their friends.

82
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,710
Despite not being able to remember their own names
they remembered the name of their friends?

83
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:47,220
Yes. His friend liked drawing and bugs, but he hated killing them, so he always let them out of their cages.

84
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,230
His name was Adolf Reinhardt.

85
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,860
He loved the cocoa they got once a week.

86
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,240
Johan came close to me and offered me a cup...

87
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,000
I remembered that I loved...

88
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,670
the hot cocoa we got once a week at the orphanage.

89
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,020
If only the rain would wash everything clean.

90
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,060
Fear, hatred, sadness...

91
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,530
But, the truth is that it does exactly the opposite.

92
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,240
It makes things swell up even larger.

93
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,530
It was raining like this...

94
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,490
on that day as well.

95
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:02,800
The other day, Mr. Liebert, who fled from East Germany
to West Germany, appeared before the media.

96
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,470
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert, with their twin son and daughter,

97
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,680
showed the world their bright expression
with no signs of fatigue.

98
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,730
Are you a refugee as well?

99
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,440
Yes. I came from Czechoslovakia.

100
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,440
You know our children?

101
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,900
Let me see them.

102
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,610
Just for a second.

103
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,410
Even if they're sleeping.

104
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,850
A tragedy happened that night.

105
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,810
Survivor confirmed. One girl.

106
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,150
One man and one woman dead.

107
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,110
The boy is in critical condition, but he has a pulse.

108
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,110
How's his condition?

109
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,740
Blood pressure, 72/50.

110
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,030
Pulse, 137.

111
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,990
The bullet came from the front...

112
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,330
Kill...

113
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,670
I didn't know what happened.

114
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,800
I did know.

115
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,010
I knew and I ran.

116
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,360
My brain just shut off and I ran.

117
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,740
I tried to draw a picture...

118
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,950
A picture of the ideal twins.

119
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,530
Those kids surrounded with love.

120
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,410
But no matter how many times I tried, I couldn't draw it.

121
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,380
It's because I knew...

122
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,750
I knew that it could never exist.

123
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,680
The Bergbach Hotel, where Inspector Lunge's at, is just ahead, right?

124
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,890
Yeah.

125
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,520
Let's go.

126
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,230
Be careful. We don't know where they are.

127
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,520
I...

128
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,730
I created a monster.

129
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,990
And I brought that monster back to life.

130
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,870
I can't kill you this way.

131
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,240
I don't have any strength in my right arm.

132
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,870
Dr. Tenma shot me there in a library in Munich.

133
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,830
It would have been easy to kill him there.

134
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,880
But I couldn't kill him.

135
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,590
He had to survive.

136
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,050
He is to remain until the end and be all alone.

137
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,010
He will die alone in desolation...

138
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,600
without a name.

139
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,310
That is in Johan's calculations.

140
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,900
Dr. Tenma will be allowed to see the world that Johan saw.

141
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,570
I want to see that world as well.

142
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,030
I want to see it.

143
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,290
Inspector Lunge, you will not see it.

144
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,620
You will die.

145
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,880
This too, is accounted for in Johan's calculations.

146
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,570
Calculations?!

147
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,950
Those calculations...

148
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,830
don't add up in the computer in my head.

149
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,040
Answer me! Where is Johan?!

150
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,920
How horrible! It looks like a battlefield.

151
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,550
Johan is not here.

152
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,380
How do you know?

153
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,050
He's watching from somewhere.

154
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,350
Like he's watching a line of ants.

155
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,520
Anyways, let's take a look inside.

156
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,400
Tenma was headed here.

157
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,690
Is anyone... Is anyone here?

158
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,990
I'll take a look on the 2nd floor.

159
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,370
A kid.

160
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Don't move any closer!

161
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't worry.

162
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,710
Were friends. We've come to help.

163
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,390
See? Im unarmed.

164
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,970
Right? Nothing to worry about.

165
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,430
The girl from the picture.

166
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,480
What do you mean?

167
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,770
There are a lot of pictures.

168
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,190
You look just like the girl in them.

169
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,910
A lot of pictures?

170
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,620
She was with a boy who has the same face.

171
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,160
Pictures of twins.

172
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,880
Where did you see those pictures?!

173
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,880
Where?!

174
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,590
O-On the south hill...

175
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,350
The vampire's house.

176
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,570
Does anyone know?

177
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,740
Do they know what happened to my boy?

178
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,080
Where did Wim go?

179
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,410
Everyone's... dead.

180
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,420
The devil...

181
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,050
The devil has come to this town!

182
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,140
It looks like no one's here.

183
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,910
Do you think Johan was recently standing there...

184
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,830
just doing that?

185
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,750
They tried to draw you two so many times,

186
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,250
but none of the paintings are finished.

187
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,880
You're smiling gently in all the pictures.

188
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,430
Did Franz Bonaparta draw these?

189
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,720
What was Johan doing when he was looking at these?

190
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,470
I'm home.

191
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,930
Welcome home.

192
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,480
I'm home.

193
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,100
Welcome home.

194
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm home.

195
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,900
Welcome home.

196
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm home.

197
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,200
Welcome home.

198
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:49,910
Nina.

199
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,990
I...

200
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,450
saw something scary.

201
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,130
Something really, really scary.

202
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,050
A lot of people were dying...

203
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,220
at the Red Rose Mansion.

204
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,140
Everyone was drinking some wine...

205
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,220
And then... And then...

206
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,440
They were in pain! They fell over right in front of me!

207
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,370
Where's Mother?

208
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,260
I'm sorry.

209
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,390
Why am I apologizing?

210
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,890
Back then.

211
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,400
The two of you have to live!

212
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,740
The two of you have to live!

213
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,660
Why are you crying?

214
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,250
Why are you crying?

215
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,880
Stop crying!

216
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Stop crying!

217
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,470
Stop crying!

218
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,890
Stop crying!

219
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,480
Nina!

220
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,360
Nina?

221
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,660
He was crying.

222
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,240
Nina.

223
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,210
In this room.

224
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,750
Just a second ago, in this room,

225
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,340
alone...

226
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,840
crying just like that day.

227
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,510
That rainy night,

228
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,970
I had to shoot him.

229
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,950
If only I had forgiven him, this would never have happened.

230
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,910
So many people wouldn't have died.

231
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,040
I might be too late,

232
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,840
but I must act now.

233
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,310
Where is Johan now?

234
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,190
He came down to town...

235
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,740
to end it all.

236
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:43,220
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

237
00:22:44,310 --> 00:23:00,620
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

238
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:25,700
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

239
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:34,180
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

240
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,450
Scenery for a Doomsday
