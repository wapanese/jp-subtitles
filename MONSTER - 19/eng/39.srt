1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:09,470
The victims of the Friedrich Emmanuel Library
fire include five dead and thirty-four injured.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,770
The official search continues for
those who are not accounted for.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,060
I've taken interviews from those who were rescued, so please continue watching.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,690
G-Geez, I didn't know what was
going on, there was a sea of fire.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,070
When I couldn't breath because of the smoke,

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,280
I thought I was done for.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,910
There was someone who saved us.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,370
It was an Asian man.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,540
Is that man all right?

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,710
He shot the hinges off the door with
his gun and opened it for us.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,750
If it wasn't for him,

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,710
a lot more people would have died.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,470
The authorities say that this fire was started with gasoline.

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,720
The police have announced that they will use all their
resources to find the culprit as soon as possible.

15
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,960
The Hell In His Eyes

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,210
Everything burned to ashes.

17
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,970
It might be the wisdom of humanity, but when
it's all burned, the books mean nothing.

18
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,100
Did you find any fingerprints on the sniper rifle you recovered?

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,810
It was burned in the fire, so I don't know if we can lift good prints off of it.

20
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,070
The gun's type is definitely the same as the
one we thought that Dr. Tenma bought,

21
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,570
a Mauser SR93.

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,450
But with everything burned like it is,

23
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,620
it's hard to find any traces of the culprit.

24
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,200
There are no crime scenes without clues.

25
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,290
Huh?

26
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,080
A cuff link was left here.

27
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,830
Take it to CSI.

28
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,120
Uh, sure.

29
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,340
Someone was there.

30
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,590
There isn't a person who can leave
this place without leaving a trace.

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,340
If someone can do that,

32
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,010
that person is not human.

33
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,430
If by chance, someone was able to do that,

34
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,520
then what?

35
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,390
Then he's a demon.

36
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,480
There's no such thing in this world.

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,150
Therefore, there's no criminal that we can't arrest.

38
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,280
Were you able to get an interview with Mr. Schubert?

39
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,240
Yes, he's in a hospital room.

40
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,750
He wasn't burned very badly,

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,620
but because of his age, they're refusing interviews.

42
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,290
Let's go.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,130
Huh?

44
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,920
I can't let you do that.

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,340
I cannot approve of you meeting with him.

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,090
He's conscious, isn't he?

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,510
It will only take a moment.

48
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,760
Mr. Schubert is in a state of total shock.

49
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,100
He needs to rest for a while.

50
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,890
Who is he?

51
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,150
He's Mr. Schubert's son.

52
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,570
I'm sorry that your father went through so much trouble.

53
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,200
I am Lunge of the German BKA.

54
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:22,990
Um,

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,620
I asked the policeman here before, but...

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,450
I have someone I want you to find.

57
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,130
Who is this?

58
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,670
He's the man who tried to assassinate your father.

59
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,670
Huh?

60
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,550
Do you really not know him?

61
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,140
No, I don't.

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,930
But if it was him...

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,180
Him?

64
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,310
That's right. That's what I was trying to say.

65
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,850
Find him please.

66
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,020
Find Johan Liebert.

67
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,310
Johan...

68
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,520
Liebert.

69
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,030
Johan should have been at the ceremony with my dad.

70
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,240
But no matter where I search, I can't find where he went.

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,990
Johan...

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,410
Johan Liebert.

73
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,660
I understand.

74
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,710
I'll start the search for him as soon as possible.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,300
This is the room that Johan Liebert was renting.

76
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,010
He left about two weeks ago.

77
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,450
His name wasn't in the law school's registry.

78
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,790
He wasn't a real student.

79
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,830
Have you contacted his parents in Offenbach?

80
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,880
They are gone as well.

81
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,710
They didn't know many of the neighbors.

82
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,300
Should we take fingerprints from this room?

83
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,510
Nothing's going to show up.

84
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,300
Huh?

85
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,850
No data available.

86
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,020
This is the first time...

87
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,770
The first time I've seen a room with so
few traces of a person living in it.

88
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,320
Yeah...

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,320
I am Johan.

90
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,490
I am Johan Liebert.

91
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,830
Who am I?

92
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,250
I was here.

93
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,170
But I don't exist.

94
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,510
A demon?

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,060
I'm so glad you weren't hurt badly, Nina.

96
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,230
I'm sorry to make you worry, Lotte.

97
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,570
That's right. I was really worried.

98
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,570
People were being rescued one after
another, and I didn't see you.

99
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,490
I wondered what happened to you.

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,670
You did well getting out of there
by yourself with those injuries.

101
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,040
You even surprised the firefighters.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,670
I made it because someone saved me.

103
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,420
Someone saved you?

104
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,130
You were the last one to come out of the fire.

105
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,180
A Japanese man.

106
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,390
Is there a Japanese doctor at any of the hospitals here?

107
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,690
There are many Japanese people.

108
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,110
But they are all businessmen.

109
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,570
That can't be.

110
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,650
Huh?

111
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,700
Because he pulled me out from underneath a heavy curtain.

112
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,290
Nina!

113
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,920
Nina!

114
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,710
Nina!

115
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,800
That man was definitely...

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
there.

117
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,350
Just before the fire started,

118
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,650
you faced all the people seated at the ceremony
and told them to evacuate, right?

119
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,530
Why did you do that?

120
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,360
You knew something.

121
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
Am I wrong,

122
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,780
Mr. Schubert?

123
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,370
Can you end it there?

124
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,160
Do you know this man?

125
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,630
If I hold it this close, can you see it?

126
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,880
This is the man who tried to assassinate you.

127
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,010
Many people said that he was at the library.

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,510
According to the testimonies of the eyewitnesses,

129
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,140
he was trying to rescue everyone.

130
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,270
That's enough.

131
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,400
End it already.

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,070
If he remembers anything, have
him contact us immediately.

133
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,780
One more thing.

134
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,790
Do you know where your secretary, Johan Liebert, went?

135
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,770
Please, get out!

136
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,690
He was totally out of it.

137
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,820
I guess it's expected that seeing something so horrible
at that age would do that to a person.

138
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,570
That's the end of the financial emperor,
the man they called the "Vampire of Bayern."

139
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,910
No.

140
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,740
Huh?

141
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,040
Those were the eyes of a man who was fully conscious.

142
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,330
Oh?

143
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,500
Let's talk to some other witnesses.

144
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,500
Do you have a list of the victims?

145
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,040
Yes.

146
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,550
But what did you mean by that?

147
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,720
Testimonies that a demon like Tenma was rescuing people.

148
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,760
Is this another one of his personalities?

149
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,480
Nina.

150
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,230
Nina Fortner.

151
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,570
What about that name?

152
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,760
Nina Fortner was released this morning.

153
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,730
The address we had in the police statement was falsified.

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,730
What about the hospital records?

155
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Sure. I'll go look it up for you.

156
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,280
Nina Fortner.

157
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,740
The name of the daughter of the couple murdered in Heidelberg.

158
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,200
Whereabouts currently unknown.

159
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,580
Thank you for telling me such a horrible story.

160
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,340
The story I heard from Tenma matches
up completely with what you told me.

161
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,670
Tenma?

162
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,260
That's right.

163
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:27,890
He showed up when I was working on a series of cases.

164
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,770
On that day,

165
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,940
I thought that Tenma was going to go through
with his assassination plot at that library,

166
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,230
and I ran after him.

167
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,530
By the way, that large fire...

168
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,280
We don't know if Tenma or Johan were there.

169
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,120
Got it, Nina?

170
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Stop chasing Johan.

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
He's not an opponent that you can safely pursue.

172
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,710
I know the police aren't of much help.

173
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,670
You have to fight him slowly and carefully.

174
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,970
Someday the truth will be proven.

175
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,220
Don't worry.

176
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,350
You must be tired.

177
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,600
You should stay here and rest for a while.

178
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,640
He was there.

179
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,690
Eh?

180
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,020
He was there at the library back then.

181
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,570
Tenma was there.

182
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,460
You should eat something.

183
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,170
Thank you,

184
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,420
Dieter.

185
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,050
The bread is Kaiser Semmel.

186
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,260
Roast ham and gouda cheese.

187
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,560
It's Tenma's favorite.

188
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
Thank you.

189
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,440
It's good.

190
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,770
Really?

191
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,780
Yup!

192
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,900
When you eat good things, it makes you feel good.

193
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,910
Tenma always said that.

194
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,910
I want to see him.

195
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,170
I want to see Tenma.

196
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,550
Yeah.

197
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,640
The weather's so nice.

198
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,810
You're right!

199
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,560
When you get better, would you like to travel?

200
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,770
How about Asia?

201
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,070
It'd be a good change of pace.

202
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,450
Please take it easy.

203
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,620
You've fought enough, Dad.

204
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,870
Bridge...

205
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,040
Huh?

206
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,710
Three...

207
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,460
What is it?

208
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,090
What do you want to say?

209
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,220
Three...

210
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,930
frogs...

211
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,880
Huh?

212
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,390
His eyes...

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,600
Eyes?

214
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,600
I could see hell in his eyes.

215
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,440
Hell was inside the eyes of a living human being.

216
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,530
Karl.

217
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,820
Yes?

218
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,820
I have something I want you to tell a certain man.

219
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,450
Y-Yes.

220
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,700
That man is waiting in Dresden.

221
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,250
Dresden?

222
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,420
What do you want me to tell him?

223
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:45,840
Okay.

224
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,510
All I need to do is go to Dresden and tell him this?

225
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,800
Do I need to go soon?

226
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,560
I got it.

227
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I'll go as soon as possible.

228
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,770
Karl.

229
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,900
Your mom...

230
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,650
She must have hated me.

231
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,990
No.

232
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,240
She didn't hate you at all.

233
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,240
Karl,

234
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,290
when you return from Dresden,

235
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,040
will you stay with me?

236
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:26,790
Yes.

237
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,970
I'm scared.

238
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,220
Scared?

239
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,510
Of what?

240
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,800
I don't really know.

241
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,890
But I'm very scared.

242
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,600
Remember.

243
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,020
Don't rush.

244
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,560
Just go slow.

245
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,310
A town out of a fairy tale.

246
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,810
A town in a fairy tale?

247
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,820
Where is it?

248
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,070
What did you feel when you looked at this picture book?

249
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,990
Tell me whatever you can. Just off the top of your head.

250
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,550
Dr. Gillen.

251
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
No, just a little more.

252
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Stop!

253
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,930
Three...

254
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,180
Three frogs.

255
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,680
Three...

256
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,850
frogs?

257
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,060
What do you mean?

258
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,150
A picture.

259
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,900
A picture?

260
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,690
There was a picture in this book that
caused Johan to fall unconscious?

261
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,990
There's no picture of three frogs anywhere in that book.

262
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,410
Where did you see them?

263
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,420
That's enough.

264
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,420
Let's end it here for today.

265
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,420
Yes.

266
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,360
It was a mistake to ask that BKA man, Inspector Lunge.

267
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,480
Yes,

268
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,320
I think it's a good idea to change our plans.

269
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,280
The next time we try to bring any proof to the police,

270
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,370
we need to bring it directly to his superiors.

271
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,910
And that's only after we've taken the
time to thoroughly gather the data.

272
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,960
How much time do you mean when you say that?

273
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,630
We don't have very much information on Johan.

274
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,510
There are too many unknown parts.

275
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,510
I think that Mr. Schubert, who employed him
as his secretary, must have some information,

276
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,430
but he's still refusing visitors.

277
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,890
What about his son, Karl?

278
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,110
It seems that he left about two days ago,
and he hasn't been reachable since.

279
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,900
This is by no means certain, but...

280
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,700
A witness testified that an Asian man
was there trying to help people.

281
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,660
But if Tenma's fingerprints are found on the sniper
rifle recovered at the scene of the crime,

282
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,620
we can't help him no matter how much proof we have.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,500
How long do we have to wait?

284
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,630
We're out of time.

285
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,710
By the time the truth is known,
by the time the police do anything...

286
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,720
it'll be too late.

287
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,130
Tenma will be...

288
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,220
Nina.

289
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,980
S-Sorry.

290
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,270
Nina,

291
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,980
I understand exactly how you feel.

292
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,650
I also lost a precious friend, Richard, in this whole case.

293
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,450
He had a bright future ahead of him.

294
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,700
But Johan took that future away from him.

295
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,830
I won't ever back down.

296
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,290
Ever.

297
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,670
So, let's eat.

298
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,510
Three frogs.

299
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,140
A town out of a fairy tale.

300
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,900
I know.

301
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,220
Dieter...

302
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,220
I'm coming, too.

303
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,690
What are you saying?

304
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,060
You can't come.

305
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,360
You're staying here.

306
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,820
Tell Dr. Reichwein, "Thank you for taking care of me."

307
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,150
Bye.

308
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,290
Dieter!

309
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,290
I want to see him.

310
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,170
I want to see Tenma!

311
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,210
Dresden
(Sachsen)

312
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,030
The third day and nothing...

313
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,570
He said wait in front of the station.

314
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,030
But its useless...

315
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,080
Father, it seems like I'll never see
the man you told me about.

316
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,010
Karl.

317
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,350
You're Karl, aren't you?

318
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,350
You...

319
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,900
The man who tried to assassinate your father...

320
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,770
Or that's what the police told you.

321
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,570
Yes.

322
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,030
I've been watching you for three
days from on top of a building.

323
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,910
It looks like the police aren't following you.

324
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,410
Can you let me hear the message?

325
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,250
Hang on.

326
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,710
Keep on your feet.

327
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,830
Go!

328
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,710
Get out of here!

329
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,960
The police are coming.

330
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,420
B-But...

331
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,090
Dresden...

332
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,380
wait in front of the station.

333
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
My son, Karl, will give you a message.

334
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,190
Hurry, give me the message.

335
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,060
Here.

336
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,320
Cedok Bridge.

337
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,190
Three frogs?

338
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,570
And then my father said this...

339
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,490
"If the monster you're chasing is a twin..."

340
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,710
Their mother is alive and is living in Prague.

341
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:42,970
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

342
00:22:44,060 --> 00:23:00,370
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

343
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:25,450
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

344
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,930
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

345
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,450
Grimmer
