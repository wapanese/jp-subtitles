1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,980
Petra, open up.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,320
Petra!

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,580
Today's the day I'm going to
take you in for a check up!

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,260
I keep telling you that it's
pointless to come here!

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,690
Who do you think
I'm coming here for?!

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,760
Nobody called you!

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,060
You stubborn, narrow-minded woman!

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,730
You're one to talk, you quack doctor!

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,170
I've never been to a doctor
since I was born, but I'm still healthy.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,670
Now go away!

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,770
You stubborn...

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,770
Doctor!
Bad news...!

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,380
Dr. Schumann!

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,080
What's wrong?

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,750
Fink, the drunkard was hit
by a car on the highway!

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,860
So is he still conscious?

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,690
The man who brought him in
is treating him!

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,930
Huh?

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,930
It seems that some man who happened
to be passing by is examining him.

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,260
What?

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,570
What is the meaning of this?

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,070
You were visiting homes,
so that man...

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,580
You let him treat him?

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,480
Sorry. I tried to stop him,

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,380
but he said that he needed to
apply first aid

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,420
because there was a chance that
the patient would choke...

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,420
Who is he?!

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,850
Who knows?
He left without saying his name.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,030
Oh... he wrote something
on the medical chart...

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,730
"The patient has no money."

31
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,900
"He kept repeating not to
take him to a doctor."

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,070
"Please take this money
as his doctor's fee"?

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,910
Damn!

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,170
Who does he think he is?

35
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,850
Doctor, where are you going?

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,750
What does he look like?!

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,780
He was an Asian man with a boy...

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,390
Umm, what about Fink's treatment?

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,630
Just keep him in bed!

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,260
B-But... the man only
applied first aid...

41
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,600
That was not first aid...

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,640
Huh?

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,670
His treatment was complete.

44
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,820
Petra and Schumann

45
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,840
Say, Dieter...

46
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,370
It's really a problem if you follow me.

47
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,630
I can't stay in one place.

48
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,680
You can't go to school.
You can't make any friends.

49
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,410
I have a friend.

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,950
Who?

51
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,120
Tenma.

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,250
Listen, Dieter.

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,390
Was it you?

54
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,720
You're the one who
came to my clinic

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,130
and did unnecessary things,
aren't you?

56
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,430
Huh?

57
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,060
Don't underestimate me!

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,170
I know that Fink is a broke alcoholic.

59
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,030
I had no intention of
charging him for treatment.

60
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh... well...

61
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,600
You're probably some elite
from a first-rate hospital

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
trying to show some compassion
while on vacation.

63
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,810
You're probably full of yourself.

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,390
- Hey.
- Welcome.

65
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,680
- Let's go, Dieter!
- Are you busy?

66
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,690
- Yeah.
- Hey!

67
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
Listen to what I have to say!

68
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,660
I'm very sorry.

69
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,060
We're in a hurry...

70
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,500
Fink got into a hit-and-run.

71
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,460
Fink, the drunkard?

72
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,600
Yeah.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,460
We're looking for witnesses.

74
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,000
Ah... That's a tough task.

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,710
Hey, Dr. Schumann.

76
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,010
How is Fink's condition?

77
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,950
His life's not in danger. I'm more
worried about his alcoholism.

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,690
And you are?

79
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,050
Well, I'm...

80
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,660
Dr. Chan.

81
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,620
An underclassman from college.

82
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,400
He's visiting this village
during his vacation.

83
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,060
Dr. Chan? Have we met somewhere?

84
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,400
He treated Fink for me
while I was visiting homes...

85
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,440
That aside, where do you think I was?

86
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,210
At Petra's house...
your mother, Heinz.

87
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,420
Mom?

88
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,120
Tell her to come to the clinic.

89
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,950
We may need to treat her
as soon as possible.

90
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,590
That's impossible.

91
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,650
That stubborn woman
won't listen to anyone.

92
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,090
Don't act as if it's not your problem.

93
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,120
It's all right. Mom won't die that easily.

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,170
Wha...?!

95
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,760
Besides, she raised me this far.
I don't think she has any regrets.

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,040
What?!

97
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,140
Hey, wait!

98
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,700
Petra's life has just begun!

99
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,020
Why did you lie?

100
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,920
That was for saving Fink.

101
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,730
He would have died if it wasn't
for your swift treatment.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,660
Thank you very much.

103
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,330
You turned so pale
when you saw the police...

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,800
You...

105
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,490
Oh well,

106
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,700
at least it's obvious that you're not
an elite doctor from a first-rate hospital.

107
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,740
Thank you very much.
I don't know how to repay you.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,450
Repay me, huh?

109
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,940
Then help me out a bit.

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,420
Huh?

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,610
Owowow...

112
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,590
Your splint is misaligned.

113
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,860
This may hurt a bit,
but please be patient.

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,660
Ow...

115
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,130
Now it should be all right.

116
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,070
You can probably take it off
after two more weeks.

117
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,910
Doctor, I made some good cider.

118
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,870
Want a drink?

119
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,040
What are you talking about?
You're hurt.

120
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,080
I'll drink with you all night
once you've healed.

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,950
Progress is good. Five days
and you can go back to the fields.

122
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,960
Aren't you glad, Schone?

123
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,130
Doctor, take some potatoes.
This year's crop is good.

124
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,430
Next time, I'll come with a truck
and take a whole mountain of them.

125
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,570
Thank you.
My specialty is internal medicine.

126
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,110
I do what I can outside my specialty...

127
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,350
But things don't go very well
when I'm by myself.

128
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,870
This is wonderful.

129
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,550
Yeah. There's nothing here,
but it's a peaceful village.

130
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,520
No, I didn't mean that...

131
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,650
You're loved by the people here...

132
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,290
And you really love them too...

133
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,560
Love, huh?
I lost feelings like that a long time ago.

134
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm just doing my job.

135
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,140
Now, come with me
to just one more house.

136
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,080
This one is difficult.

137
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,880
You really are persistent, aren't you?!

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,980
Yeah! I'll keep coming back!

139
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,880
It'll be the same no matter
how many times you come!

140
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,980
Just leave!

141
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,120
You quack doctor!

142
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,300
See?

143
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,460
She's the mother
of that police officer earlier...

144
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,560
She fell sick while farming.

145
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,870
I tried to get her to my clinic,
but on the way there

146
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,170
she said that she's fine
and went back home.

147
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,670
That's worrisome.

148
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,610
Yeah...

149
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,080
Shall I try to reason with her?

150
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,410
It'll probably be the same.

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,010
Are you still loitering there?!

152
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,590
I can loiter wherever I want!

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,320
Calm down. She'll never come out
if you yell like that.

154
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm going to get you out. I'm not going
to lose my reason for living!

155
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,530
Huh?!

156
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,230
N-No, I just meant that I wouldn't
have anyone to fight with anymore.

157
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,510
A-Also, I wouldn't be able to eat
her goulash anymore...

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,080
Mister, your face is red.

159
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,940
What did you say?! You brat!

160
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,710
Open up, Mrs. Petra.

161
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,560
What's this? A different doctor now?

162
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,890
It's useless to talk to
that stubborn woman.

163
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,290
Why do you hate doctors?

164
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,830
Why? Well, humph!

165
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,020
They fiddle around
with peoples' bodies

166
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,800
and think that they're gods
or something!

167
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,610
God, huh? Sometimes I think that
it would be great if we were.

168
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,540
We try our best, but no matter what,
we make mistakes.

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,250
I wish that I could heal people
perfectly like God.

170
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm always trembling inside
whenever I see my patients.

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,960
Please. At least let me see your face.

172
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,720
This smell... You're making goulash,
aren't you?

173
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,820
Who are you? Do you like goulash?

174
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,920
Yes. But it seems that Dr. Schumann
especially loves your goulash.

175
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,160
That's news to me. He always eats it
without a word whenever I make it...

176
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,360
He's self-conscious.

177
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,930
This looks really delicious!

178
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,070
Jeez...
My shoulders are stiff,

179
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,630
but it looks like
I have to prepare dinner...

180
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,280
Stiff shoulders?

181
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,740
Mrs. Petra, can you put
your chin to your chest?

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,240
Of course I can.

183
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,090
See? Owowow...

184
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,590
Excuse me...

185
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,450
<i>Four fingers fit...</i>

186
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,760
What's that? Some kind of prayer?

187
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,890
No... nothing...

188
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,200
How is she?

189
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,630
It's probably...
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

190
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,310
What?!

191
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,140
Petra!

192
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,400
Here's the fax of the arrest warrant
for the murder suspect.

193
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,580
Make copies of it.

194
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,510
Is your mom okay?

195
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,150
I heard that she collapsed
three days ago.

196
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,150
She's all right. She wouldn't die
even if you killed her.

197
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,720
It's been 72 hours
since the first stroke...

198
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,290
We can make it.
We've got to operate immediately!

199
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,500
I don't know if a helicopter
can make it if we call for one.

200
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,500
Can you do it?

201
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,870
- Huh?
- Please,

202
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,540
perform the operation
if you can... If not... I...

203
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,380
It'll be my fault again for
losing another person I love.

204
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,470
You're sure that it's Kenzo Tenma?!

205
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,870
- Yes.
- All right.

206
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,640
He might not have gone far!

207
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,840
Set up a barrier along the highway!

208
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,550
It'll be great if we catch him, Heinz.

209
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,020
Y-Yes!

210
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,780
Everyone, emergency deployment!

211
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,360
I did it! I can get a promotion
if things go well...

212
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,590
Hey, Heinz, you have a call!

213
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,100
Yes! This is Heinz...
Oh, hello, Nurse...

214
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,370
Mom collapsed again?!

215
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,340
If only I had forced her to
get a check up at a national hospital

216
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,780
after the first stroke...

217
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,250
You're the only one
I can count on, Dr. Tenma!

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,960
It's as I thought. It's an aneurysm
of the middle cerebral artery.

219
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,120
Damn it!
We don't have a surgical microscope

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,490
or a craniotome here...

221
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,030
I can try open surgery as long as
I have an aneurysm clip.

222
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,190
But it's too difficult even for you.

223
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,270
We've got to try.

224
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,110
She may not live the next time
the cranial aneurysm ruptures...

225
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,480
It's my fault that
this happened again...

226
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,810
What's wrong, Dr. Schumann?

227
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,620
You single-handedly took care of
the patients of this village.

228
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,780
It's not like you.

229
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,350
I don't know what happened
in the past, but...

230
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,160
We have to try our best
for the patient before us...

231
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,400
That is all we can do as doctors.

232
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,930
Yeah...

233
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,870
Hey, boy, is Dr. Schumann inside?

234
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes, he's operating.

235
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,770
Operating on my mom?

236
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,080
They're operating at this clinic
rather than taking her

237
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,210
to a hospital in town?

238
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
It's all right, Tenma is here.

239
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,450
Tenma, you say?!

240
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,880
How's her blood pressure and pulse?

241
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,320
Blood pressure 126/84.

242
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,490
Pulse 88.

243
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,190
Amazing... He opened her head
so fast with just a wire saw.

244
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,530
He doesn't even have a craniotome.

245
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,370
What are you doing?!

246
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,240
As you can see, we are
operating on your mother!

247
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,840
What are you doing with that gun?!

248
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,510
Raise your hands, Tenma!

249
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,220
Tenma!

250
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,280
We're in the middle of an operation!
Are you trying to kill your mother?!

251
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,120
He's trying to kill her!

252
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,960
Tenma is a murder suspect
that's been on the run!

253
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,290
What?!

254
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,790
He killed a man in Heidelberg.
He's even suspected of

255
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,920
the serial killing of
middle-aged couples.

256
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,240
I never thought that I'd find him here.

257
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,300
Leave it to Mom.
She saw an opportunity for me.

258
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Now, raise your hands.

259
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,680
If you don't, I'll shoot!

260
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,930
Get out of here!

261
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,510
This is a sterile operating room!

262
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,410
You're bringing in germs!

263
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,820
Your mother could die
from meningitis if you spread it!

264
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,220
Then quickly stop the operation!

265
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,190
Do you really want your mom to die?

266
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,890
Your mother has
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

267
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,260
She first collapsed three days ago.

268
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,960
If we don't deal with it now
it'll be too late.

269
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,730
Now, get out!

270
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,840
You think you've got a hostage?!

271
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,480
You're planning to use my mom
as a hostage and run away from here!

272
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,910
Aneurysm clip and forceps...

273
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,810
Aneurysm clip and forceps!

274
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,420
Yes.

275
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,190
That's my mom!

276
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,420
I won't let anyone touch her!

277
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,230
That's right. Petra is your mother.

278
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,330
But what have you done for her
in the past five years?

279
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,730
Have you visited her even once
since you left the town?

280
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,630
What have you ever done
for your mother

281
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,700
after she raised you this far?

282
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,930
Listen, people who are dear to us
will pass away some day.

283
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,740
Do you remember the taste of
your mother's goulash?

284
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,850
Even now, Petra makes portions
for you out of habit.

285
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I eat what's left over. It's delicious!
That taste is superb!

286
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,830
Dr. Tenma is desperately fighting
to save your mom.

287
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,960
If you want to eat that goulash again...

288
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,560
Get out!

289
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,370
See? Tenma is here, so it's all right.

290
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,110
Blood pressure 140/86. Pulse 82.

291
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,140
Vital signs are stable.

292
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,710
Pionier, you should get some rest.

293
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,680
But Doctor...

294
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,350
I'm all right. Get some rest.

295
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,190
Yes, then...

296
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,660
Good work.

297
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,290
Dr. Tenma, you get some rest, too.

298
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,460
I'm all right, too.

299
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,160
You performed a difficult operation
that lasted three hours.

300
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,340
I want to stay alert and watch her...

301
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,710
So that you can propose to Mrs. Petra
when she gets better.

302
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,870
What do you mean by "propose"?

303
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,080
You weren't sleeping?

304
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,450
I can't sleep.
Not until I take him away!

305
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,190
Besides that, what do you mean?

306
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,220
You're not going to propose
to my mom, are you?

307
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,700
Don't be foolish! Don't be foolish...

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,100
I'm... not someone who can
propose to anyone...

309
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,100
When I was
at the university hospital...

310
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,270
I never cared about talking
to my patients.

311
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,680
I only thought of how I could
raise my position in the hospital...

312
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,250
I got into the director's faction
and wrote papers for the director.

313
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,690
Finally...

314
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,420
I even married the director's daughter.

315
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,320
I pushed forward along
the path of success even after that.

316
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,720
I never paid any attention to my wife.

317
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,500
Yes. If I was a real doctor,

318
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,230
I would have noticed
when I had seen her face.

319
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,770
For a long time,
my wife had symptoms

320
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,430
which mimicked the common cold.

321
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,110
I would have noticed
if I were watching closely...

322
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,780
It was liver failure...

323
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,280
When she took her last breath...

324
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,020
<i>You finally... paid attention to me...</i>

325
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,960
I have no right to love anyone.

326
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,360
That's not true.

327
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,340
You've been paying attention.

328
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,040
You've been paying attention
to the people of this town.

329
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,770
Petra was saved because
you were paying attention.

330
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,120
Do you still plan on taking
this man away?

331
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,100
He's the man who struggled
to save your mother.

332
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,260
Do you still think he's a murderer?

333
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,810
Heinz!

334
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,440
This is Heinz. Get me the chief.

335
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,740
Chief, I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

336
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,670
Cancel the barrier.

337
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,590
The man I saw wasn't Tenma.
He was Dr. Chan.

338
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,360
I made the mistake
because he was Asian...

339
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,490
I'm very sorry.

340
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,570
The doctor of the national hospital
was sure surprised.

341
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,070
He probably never thought that

342
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,600
he would see such amazing treatment
from a clinic in the countryside.

343
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,040
Doctor!

344
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,640
Are you going to let
that young doctor go?

345
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,050
I was going to make him
something to eat, but he went off.

346
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,490
Tenma!

347
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,530
Don't go, this village is safe.

348
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,890
There's no need to run away!

349
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,730
Dr. Schumann.

350
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,930
Dieter, you like it here, don't you?

351
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,470
I see.
This village may be good for Dieter.

352
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,640
Not only for Dieter. This village
can protect you from the police.

353
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,980
Take care of the people here with me.

354
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,490
This village needs you.

355
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,960
But I have to go.

356
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,330
Why?!

357
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,300
Please take care of Dieter.

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,060
Tenma, I'm going with you!

359
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,100
If you stay here,
you can save the lives

360
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,600
of countless people in this area!

361
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,830
Let's do this together!

362
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,340
Save countless lives...

363
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,280
I... have to kill a man.

364
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,520
What?

365
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,560
Tenma!

366
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,360
What do you mean, Tenma?!

367
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,590
There's no way you can do
such a thing!

368
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,260
You try so desperately to save
peoples' lives!

369
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,420
He's going...

370
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,060
Tenma's going no matter
what you say...

371
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,340
Go, Dieter.

372
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,880
Huh?

373
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,240
Tenma won't lose his way
if you're with him.

374
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,910
Watch Tenma carefully.

375
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,570
Left Behind
