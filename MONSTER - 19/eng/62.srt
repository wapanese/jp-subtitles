1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,440
Jahreszeit Hotel
(Frankfurt)

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,930
The Red Rose Mansion experiments are still going on.

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,560
The devil has an apprentice.

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,100
The man with the glasses.

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,280
The survivor of the Red Rose Mansion.

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,990
Peter Capek.

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,210
He's trying to manipulate the devil.

8
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,070
Follow that car.

9
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,450
He's running away!

10
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,470
A Pleasant Dinner Table

11
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,040
Where...

12
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,370
Where am I?

13
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,880
So, you're awake.

14
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,640
How do you feel?

15
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,100
I... um...

16
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,730
You're lucky. You got away with only a sprained ankle.

17
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,350
From my inspection, it seems that you
didn't hit your head that hard.

18
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,610
Although I'm not an expert like you.

19
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,150
You know about me?

20
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,110
Dr. Tenma, a genius among brain surgeons.

21
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,860
I saw you in the paper.

22
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,160
Who are you?

23
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm a dentist who practices around here.

24
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,620
Milan Kolasch.

25
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,830
I was passing through the area
when you were hit by that car.

26
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,790
It was a hit and run.

27
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,840
You should rest.

28
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,800
But I've caused you so much trouble.

29
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,430
It'd be even more trouble for me if you left on
those legs and drew the cops around here.

30
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,810
Around here?

31
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,100
This is a Turkish neighborhood around Frankfurt.

32
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,810
Turkish?

33
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,820
Or rather it was a Turkish neighborhood.

34
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,320
They're tearing it down for redevelopment.

35
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,040
The Turkish people that were here have
all pretty much moved to other places.

36
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,580
In the past, they worked together to fight off a bunch
of extremists who tried to set this whole place on fire.

37
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,840
So the Bahir cafe is gone, too?

38
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,760
Yeah, it's gone.

39
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,800
Did you know this neighborhood?

40
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,800
Yes, I did.

41
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,350
If you're awake, let's go eat over there.

42
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,060
Food tastes better with company.

43
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,560
Today were having Vietnamese food.

44
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,320
Minh made it.

45
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,570
Pho Ga and Cha Gio Tom.

46
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,950
Minh's cooking is excellent.

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,330
Please, eat up!

48
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,540
It's good.

49
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,380
I love pork, but it's forbidden in the Turkish diet.

50
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,090
We don't get to eat Czech food very often.

51
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,220
That's because Milan's not very good at cooking.

52
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,510
Sorry about that.

53
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,430
We all take turns making our own native food.

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,020
It's pretty luxurious to enjoy food from different
countries every day, don't you think?

55
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,150
What's Japanese food like?

56
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,150
You're Japanese, aren't you Dr. Tenma?

57
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,440
Japanese food?

58
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,070
Yeah. Please make some for us.

59
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,450
I'm looking forward to it.

60
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,790
We use pork in Katsudon and Sushi... Some
people might not be able to eat raw fish.

61
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,210
I wonder if oyakodon would be okay...

62
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,540
Oyakodon?

63
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,920
Yes, you put soy sauce and egg on top of rice with chicken in it.

64
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,260
Why is it called oyakodon?

65
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,600
Note: Oyako means parent and child.

66
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,800
The chicken is the parent and the egg is the child.

67
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,600
That's why it's called oyakodon?

68
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,100
I can't believe the sense in Japanese food.

69
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,730
With chicken and egg, they have the parent and child!

70
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,530
What's wrong, Tenma?

71
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,030
Nothing.

72
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,450
You don't like the food?

73
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,990
No. Its delicious.

74
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,290
Food this good...

75
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
A meal this fun...

76
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,290
It's really been a long time since I've experienced this.

77
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,680
Good night, Tenma.

78
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,850
Good night.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,820
How long will it take...

80
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,360
I don't have time to waste.

81
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,960
Peter Capek.

82
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,010
A gun.

83
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,640
A report on Peter Capek's activities.

84
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,310
Do you think that's strange?

85
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,730
Back then, the police weren't organized
enough to capture you.

86
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,480
The police were there waiting for me.

87
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,370
I'm going to kill Peter Capek.

88
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,960
That one's no good.

89
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,630
How strange.

90
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,800
I used to be able to make ones that could fly really well.

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,340
Milan is good at making paper airplanes.

92
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,760
They fly all the way to the roofs over there.

93
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,970
Really?

94
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,140
Milan always says that...

95
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,480
He always promises us...

96
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,650
We'll go farther than just those roofs over there.

97
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,320
We'll go to Turkey, Vietnam, and the Czech Republic.

98
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,530
We'll see everyone's home country.

99
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,320
Right?

100
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,070
Yeah!

101
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,700
Yeah.

102
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,290
Here we go.

103
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh, another bad one.

104
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,670
Why won't it fly?

105
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,710
That's strange.

106
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,170
I'm going to kill Peter Capek.

107
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,890
Why? Why are you going to do something like that, Milan?

108
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,430
That man...

109
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,980
The man called Peter Capek is the devil.

110
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:44,450
In 1989, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia
fell, he escaped to this country.

111
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,450
Capek lived here in Frankfurt and he
held classes as a German teacher.

112
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,370
He was a secluded man.

113
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,750
But ever since then, the children began to change.

114
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,970
The children who had his class began
to commit suicide, one after another.

115
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,390
And they started to exhibit extremely violent behavior.

116
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,140
And then one day, there was a violent incident that you
could even call "a massacre among fellow children."

117
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,820
I went to interview the boy who was said
to be the ringleader of that incident,

118
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,070
at the facility he was being kept at.

119
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,650
He said to me...

120
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,660
"I want to go back to the seminar."

121
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,660
The seminar?

122
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,500
That night, he committed suicide in the facility.

123
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,170
He was my son.

124
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,840
Capek disappeared from town after the commotion.

125
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,680
The next time he appeared, he was
like a totally different man.

126
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,680
He ran the underworld in Frankfurt,

127
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,180
and was aligned with the extremists.

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,480
And then he began purging this town
of Turks and other foreigners.

129
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,650
I don't know what he's trying to do here, but...

130
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,200
their violence had reached its peak.

131
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,330
In 1996, they tried to burn down the Turkish neighborhood.

132
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,960
You know about that, don't you?

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,130
Yeah, I heard it in the news.

134
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,380
The people here assembled their own
vigilante force to fight against them.

135
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:38,940
In just three days, five of the leaders
of that group mysteriously died.

136
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,690
Those five who died...

137
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:50,410
were Suleiman's son, Tung's father, Minh's husband,
Mustafa's son, and Shemel's father.

138
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,410
They didn't die.

139
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,160
They were murdered...

140
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,000
by Peter Capek.

141
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,420
I don't know why you're after Capek,

142
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,920
but I'll tell you this.

143
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,840
The one who's going to kill Capek...

144
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,430
is me.

145
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,340
Just you wait. This next one looks
like it's going to be a good one.

146
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,590
It's impossible.

147
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,340
No, I'm going to do my best.

148
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,340
Even if you do your best, if it's impossible,
it's still impossible.

149
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,890
We know.

150
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,850
Turks and Vietnamese people can't all travel together.

151
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,400
Even if we can't all travel together, I enjoy
living with Milan and Tung like this.

152
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,020
Yeah!

153
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm done.

154
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,860
This time it will fly.

155
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,370
Here it goes.

156
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,660
See.

157
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,160
Hey!

158
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,750
You did it! It's flying!

159
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,120
Amazing, amazing.

160
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,960
I don't think it can make it to the roofs on the other side like Milan's can.

161
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,300
But it is flying.

162
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,460
Aren't you glad I didn't give up?

163
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,510
Yeah.

164
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,510
You can't give up!

165
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,910
Where's my gun?

166
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,330
Where did you put the gun that I keep in the drawer?

167
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,670
My chance to shoot Capek has come.

168
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,590
I'm going.

169
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,010
Give me my gun.

170
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,550
I can't let you do that.

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,930
I can't give you your gun.

172
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,810
This is the gun that was in your coat.

173
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,480
I want the gun that I did my training
with, the one that I'm used to.

174
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,820
Do you want to give it to me?

175
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,410
You have a family now.

176
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,330
You mustn't do this.

177
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,290
I've been following Capek for a long time now.

178
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,830
I've never had a chance to shoot
Capek like the one I have today.

179
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,340
I'm begging you. Don't do this, Milan.

180
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,840
I told you. Don't get in my way.

181
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,600
Even if you take your revenge, the people
who are dead will not come back.

182
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,680
You have to focus on the future.

183
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,310
You have no right to say that to me.

184
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,850
Milan.

185
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,610
You and I are the same, Dr. Tenma.

186
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,650
I've done my research on you.

187
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,120
If what you claim is true, then what we're trying to do is the same.

188
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,620
He wasn't always like that.

189
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,130
The man I knew wasn't such a demon.

190
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,130
Peter Capek and I were childhood
friends from the same town.

191
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,640
I asked him to come to this country.

192
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,390
What do you think is across the border?

193
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,140
You can't cross the border.

194
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,270
I know I can't.

195
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,860
But you,know...

196
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,280
there are wonderful places across the border.

197
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,700
There's a city that is lit up all night long.

198
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,120
Really, Peter? Who told you that?

199
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,950
Old Mr. Gregor.

200
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,250
He's an alcoholic.

201
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,090
There are things that make people like
Mr. Gregor worthless across the border.

202
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,340
Things that make people worthless?

203
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,090
I'd like to see that.

204
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,050
Who'd ever want to see something like that?

205
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,300
There we go!

206
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,430
It's riding on the wind!

207
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,850
You're so good at that Milan.

208
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,060
It's still going!

209
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,480
Amazing! I bet it can cross the border!

210
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,310
Go see the world for us.

211
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,360
We lived in a town near the Austrian-Czechoslovakian border.

212
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,120
I was the son of a craftsman and he was
the son of a government official.

213
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,830
But we hit it off for some reason.

214
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:33,880
In 1989, when the communist government fell, I was the one who helped him flee the country.

215
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,970
I'm the one who summoned that demon to this country.

216
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,690
1969
Prague

217
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,360
I was worried about you during last year's Soviet invasion.

218
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,070
They did drag off a lot of my friends.

219
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,370
I'm safe and I'm right here.

220
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,280
How about you?

221
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,950
Me?

222
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,290
I've been making enough to keep eating as a novice dentist.

223
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,580
So you're a dentist?

224
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,750
You were always good with your hands.

225
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,050
I wish I had your skill at making it big in the world.

226
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,100
Maybe it's because of those skills that I can hold my current social status after the invasion.

227
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,270
I've enjoyed many things after "The Prague Spring."

228
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,810
I've even gone to the West.

229
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,270
You talked about that a lot when we were kids.

230
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,320
What's on the other side?

231
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,940
Did you find an answer?

232
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,320
I did.

233
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,320
So?

234
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,280
There's nothing.

235
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,330
Both here and on the other side.

236
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,330
This country is mistaken.

237
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,830
But the other country isn't right either.

238
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,920
I see.

239
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,290
You said I'm good at always having
a good social status, but...

240
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,340
the truth is I owe my abilities to one man.

241
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh?

242
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,850
He's such a wonderful man that if you'd meet him,
you wouldn't care about your social status.

243
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,100
Just when I thought there was nothing
of worth in this country or the next,

244
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,570
he showed me a light I had not yet known.

245
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,360
He will bring forth something entirely new into this world.

246
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,070
What will he bring?

247
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,830
What will he bring?  How should I put it?

248
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,420
You might consider it terrifying.

249
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:42,050
Now that I think of it, he might have been starting to crack back then.

250
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,800
Give me back my gun.

251
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,190
Here's your gun.

252
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,980
You mustn't, Milan.

253
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,020
You mustn't do something like that.

254
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,980
You can't stop me.

255
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm going to kill him.

256
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,740
You have a family that you're living with now.

257
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,280
He's the one who killed their relatives.

258
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,210
Because I brought him to this country, they were killed...

259
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,920
along with my son...

260
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:28,180
During the arson incident, and even now, there was
a person that the Turkish people talked about.

261
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,140
A man who gave his all to treat the injured.

262
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,100
A certain Japanese man who risked
his life to put the fires out.

263
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,400
That was you, wasn't it, Dr. Tenma?

264
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,150
I believe in you.

265
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,650
I understand very well what you're trying to do.

266
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,990
We're the same.

267
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,660
I'm going. It's time.

268
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,420
If I let him get away, I might not have another chance.

269
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,460
Milan!

270
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,420
Thank you for trying to stop me.

271
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,720
If I was in your place,

272
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,140
I wouldn't be able to stop you.

273
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,250
Huh?

274
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:40,630
What?

275
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,180
It's delicious!

276
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,100
Yeah, this is really good.

277
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,930
This Japanese Oyakodon is fantastic.

278
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,190
Yeah!

279
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,900
Is your ankle okay?

280
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,770
Let me help you, Dr. Tenma.

281
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,400
I'll have your serving ready in just a bit, Mrs. Minh.

282
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,660
Milan sure is late. I think he'll be home soon though.

283
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,410
- It tastes better right after it's made, so I'll make some for Milan later.

284
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,160
- Next in the news.
- It tastes better right after it's made, so I'll make some for Milan later.

285
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:18,830
- Really? Please do then.

286
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,100
- Today at about 11 A.M., at the Roedelheim
Convention Center in Frankfurt,
- Really? Please do then.

287
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,380
- Today at about 11 A.M., at the Roedelheim
Convention Center in Frankfurt,

288
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,380
a man with a gun opened fire.

289
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,260
However, the policemen securing the convention grounds

290
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,220
shot and killed the man.

291
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,470
Although there were no other fatalities in the incident,

292
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,390
because there were so many important people in the
financial world at the convention at the same time,

293
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,850
there was a major concern among the attendees.

294
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,560
Furthermore, the attacker's identity
and purpose remain unknown.

295
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
Here is some amateur footage of some of the attack.

296
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,070
Everybody loves it.

297
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,080
I can't wait until Milan gets home.

298
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,130
Here is some amateur footage of some of the attack.

299
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,390
That man...

300
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,270
He's from the Red Rose Mansion...

301
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,650
You mustn't hide anything from him.

302
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:42,990
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

303
00:22:44,080 --> 00:23:00,390
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

304
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:25,470
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

305
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:33,950
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

306
