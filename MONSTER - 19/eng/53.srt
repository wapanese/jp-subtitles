Düsseldorf Federation ・ Holding Cells

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,640
Please ask Helene and Gustav for me.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,160
Ask them to record "Detective Forster."

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,030
Huh?

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,950
They show reruns Tuesday mornings at ten.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,160
You've never seen it?

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,160
It's a great show!

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,030
Listen here, Milch.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,430
This is no laughing matter.

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,460
Do you know how much trouble you caused the boss...

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,320
because you messed up and got caught?

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,140
Even for an idiot like you...

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,260
he was kind enough to send someone
like myself as your attorney.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,300
So show him some appreciation.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,480
He only sent you to keep an eye on me, to
make sure I didn't spill anything, right?

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,360
That's correct.

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,050
Listen, Milch.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,750
You do know what would happen
if you told the truth, don't you

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,840
Don't worry.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,770
I don't sell out my people.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,770
Well, whatever.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,250
Just follow my scenario and confess, got it?

23
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,440
By the way...

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,920
I hope you already have the schedule
for my next job figured out.

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,560
The next one?

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,320
When do you think that will be?

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,390
Think about it!

28
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,780
You're the one who should think about it.

29
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,950
Who do you think I am?

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,240
I am Gunther Milch, the Escape King.

31
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,710
I don't have time to waste on this nonsense.

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,430
Listen.

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,480
If you confess like I told you, you'll
get out in about five years.

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,270
Make sure you tell them for me.

35
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,170
I told you.

36
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,010
Tell Helene and Gustav to record
"Detective Forster" for me.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,020
Oh, but they're not really reliable...

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,710
Maybe I should try that again while I'm still at this station.

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,330
Try what?

40
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,470
Determination

41
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,240
You sure he's not faking it again?

42
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,460
I don't know...

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,390
But there was blood in his vomit...

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,910
and his body feels so cold so...

45
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,150
Hey, don't throw up here?

46
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,810
Doctor!

47
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh, you're just in time!

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,810
keep an eye on this place for a bit.

49
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,360
Just now, some new kids they brought
in went nuts on the third floor...

50
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,650
and I heard that some people were injured.

51
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,400
B-But this one looks like he's about to die...

52
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,150
You again, Milch?

53
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,430
Just put him on the bed in the back.

54
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,570
I'll take a look at him later.

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,430
T-Take me to a hospital!

56
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,830
I'll be right back, so just wait!

57
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,070
Man, they keep bringing them in one after another today.

58
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,570
Give me a break!

59
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,020
I don't want to be next to a serial killer!

60
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,090
W-Why does it have to be here?

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,720
Stop complaining!

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,840
I've got him on an I.V. drip because he
collapsed after not eating anything.

63
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,090
I feel worse lying next to a guy like him.

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,630
Just shut up and lie down!

65
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,020
Doctor, you said people were injured.

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,630
Do you know how many?

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,550
Who knows?

68
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,240
I won't know unless I go there.

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,960
Damn it!

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,770
I'll make those kids pay!

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,000
About what you said the other day...

72
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,000
I want your help.

73
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,910
I want to escape.

74
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm thinking of killing someone.

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,610
Your former fiancée...

76
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,280
Eva Heinemann.

77
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,010
What do you think?

78
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,840
Don't you think that's a great idea?

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,030
After all, she knows too much.

80
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,750
On that rainy day at the building under construction...

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,110
she heard three gunshots...

82
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,720
and saw it.

83
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,280
Saw him.

84
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,280
We don't need people like that.

85
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,770
We don't, do we?

86
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,420
Don't...

87
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't!

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,810
Stop it!

89
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,210
She...

90
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,410
Eva would never testify about that!

91
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,830
She only wants me to be imprisoned for life!

92
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,890
All she thinks about is making
me regret leaving her forever!

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
She'll only testify to things that'll hurt me

94
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,090
So...

95
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,890
So...!

96
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:20,080
That's why I asked if it was a great idea.

97
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,000
If she were to disappear...

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,910
you might not be sent to prison.

99
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,130
Her death would be beneficial to both of us you know.

100
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,040
Will you tell the police?

101
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,360
Will they believe a story like this?

102
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,090
Will you tell your attorney, Mr. Verdeman?

103
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,130
He might be one of my allies, you know.

104
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,040
We'll make sure you're found innocent.

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,470
"We" being the excellent lawyers, that is.

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,400
Once you're free and you step outside...

107
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,210
you'll he able to have a nice drink.

108
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,040
After all, by then, that spoiled,
loud-mouthed, drunken bitch...

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,140
...will be gone from this world.

110
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,740
I want to escape.

111
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,280
You've got to be kidding me!

112
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
Stuck next to a murderer like this!

113
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,210
Hey, Milch!

114
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,350
keep your mouth shut!

115
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,950
Why don't you just stay silent to your heart's content!

116
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,550
Milch!

117
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,790
I'm just going to confess and get transferred
to prison in the next five days!

118
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,310
Then it'll be goodbye to murderers like you!

119
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,600
What are you shouting about?

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,510
Milch!

121
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,290
You're pretty energetic.

122
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,040
Come on!

123
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,910
So you were faking it after all!

124
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,050
Oh, that felt good!

125
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,040
I'll just have to endure for five more days!

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,560
Then I won't be associated with killers like you!

127
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,410
Enough already

128
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Hey, shut up!

129
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,080
In five days, huh?

130
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,080
So, on that rainy night...

131
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,620
you heard three gunshots in a building
that was under construction...

132
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,780
and saw a young, blonde man coming down the stairs.

133
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,610
Is that correct?

134
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,130
That's right.

135
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,870
How about it?

136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Do you still plan on tackling this case
while denying Johan's existence?

137
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,110
No...

138
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,040
Miss Eva Heinemann.

139
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,380
May I have you present this important testimony in court?

140
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,960
No.

141
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,270
Düsseldorf Federal Police Station

142
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,480
What does Dr. Tenma want this late at night?

143
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,960
What does he mean, he has something
important he wants to tell us?

144
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,480
W-Well...

145
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,720
he just asked to see the investigators.

146
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,010
What did you want to talk about, Dr. Tenma?

147
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,940
In Düsseldorf... Eisler Memorial Hospital...

148
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,670
Director Heinemann...

149
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,160
Surgical Director Oppenheim...

150
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,640
Dr. Boyer...

151
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,910
and my patient, Adolf Junkers...

152
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,240
I...

153
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,560
did it.

154
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,990
I...

155
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,090
killed them all.

156
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,640
A gust of wind came...

157
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
The thermos fell over...

158
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,090
The sandwiches were all dirty...

159
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,490
At the time, he...

160
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
just sadly smiled...

161
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,850
<i>According to an announcement made by the police...</i>

162
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,640
<i>early on the morning of the fourth...</i>

163
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,600
<i>the suspect Kenzo Tenma, who had consistently</i>
<i>denied involvement in a string of murders...</i>

164
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,480
<i>completely reversed his position and confessed to</i>
<i>the murders of Eisler Memorial Hospital's director....</i>

165
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,940
<i>and two physicians in Düsseldorf....</i>

166
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,010
<i>as well as the murder of Adolf Junkers.</i>

167
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,720
<i>He has made a full confession.</i>

168
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,010
T-That can't be!

169
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,920
<i>This just came in.</i>

170
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,860
<i>According to an announcement made by the police...</i>

171
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,860
He confessed? That's impossible!

172
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,000
<i>early on the morning of the fourth...</i>

173
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,460
<i>the suspect, Kenzo Tenma, who had consistently</i>
<i>denied involvement in a string of murder cases....</i>

174
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,820
<i>has confessed to all of the charges against him.</i>

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
Don't mess with me!

176
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,240
What the hell did you guys do to Dr. Tenma?

177
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,310
What kind of torture did you put him through
to squeeze that false confession out of him?

178
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,280
Could you please let go?

179
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,430
Shut up!

180
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,360
Just let me see Tenma!

181
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm going to talk to him myself and have him tell me what
kind of treatment he received during his questioning!

182
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,600
It's useless, Dr. Reichwein.

183
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,660
He even refused an interview with
me, and I'm his attorney.

184
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,410
It would seem that his confession was indeed voluntary.

185
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,330
That can't be!

186
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,730
I've looked into it.

187
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,810
I know the investigator myself.

188
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,830
He's not a man who's capable of torture.

189
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,710
It seems Tenma simply confessed.

190
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
It went surprisingly smoothly, I heard...

191
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,320
Mr. Verdeman!

192
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,870
Don't tell me you also believe his confession is real!

193
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,810
I can't tell what his intent is unless I interview him.

194
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,830
I believe in him.

195
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,710
Dr. Tenma is innocent!

196
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,220
I believe in him!

197
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
Yes, Verdeman speaking.

198
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,600
Oh, Mr. Baul.

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,350
<i>I'm terribly sorry for not being there at a time</i>
<i>like this, but I had to attend to an emergency.</i>

200
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,170
It's okay.

201
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,440
<i>So, how was it?</i>

202
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,080
<i>Did Dr. Tenma....</i>

203
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,370
Yes, he refused my interview.

204
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,810
Oh, dear.

205
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,570
Just as we were trying really hard to prove his innocence...

206
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,550
and have them drop the false charges...

207
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,590
he makes a full confession.

208
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,590
<i>Your father, on the other hand,</i>
<i>was quite an admirable person.</i>

209
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,720
No matter how grueling the interrogation...

210
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,610
he never faltered one step...

211
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,900
and continued to plead his innocence.

212
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,940
<i>His innocence...</i>

213
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,980
Now then...

214
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,160
what shall we do, Mr. Verdeman?

215
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,040
<i>Mr. Verdeman?</i>

216
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,280
<i>That woman...</i>

217
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,160
<i>What was her name again?</i>

218
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,460
<i>That important witness who can prove Tenma's innocence.</i>

219
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,890
Oh, Eva Heinemann.

220
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,360
<i>Where is she right now?</i>

221
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,880
At a hotel in the city.

222
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,120
I would certainly like to meet her in person.

223
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,770
No.

224
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,360
She's a difficult woman.

225
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,650
For now, I'll try meeting with her myself.

226
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,660
My father was admirable?

227
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,110
Please open the door, Miss Eva Heinemann.

228
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,850
I know you're in there.

229
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,590
The maids complained that they couldn't make the bed...

230
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,080
because you were in here drinking all day.

231
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,640
Miss Heinemann.

232
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,610
I fully understand that you hate Dr. Tenma.

233
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,330
If your relationship with Dr. Tenma had continued
even after you lost your father, the Director...

234
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,160
your life would have been nice and easy.

235
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,370
But Dr. Tenma left you.

236
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,020
It's true that Dr. Tenma ruined your life.

237
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,540
My father...

238
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,800
My father was... imprisoned as a suspected spy.

239
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,370
For the longest time...

240
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,460
I was shunned, as the son of a spy.

241
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,810
I also had my life ruined by my father.

242
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,060
But I didn't give up.

243
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,180
Why do you think that is?

244
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,840
Why do you think I was able to keep fighting?

245
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,040
Because I believed in him...

246
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,570
My father was innocent.

247
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,860
My father was innocent.

248
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,280
My father was innocent!

249
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,270
Innocent.

250
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,030
Innocent!

251
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,250
The people I believe in must be innocent!

252
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,120
Now, let's get Tenma's false charges dismissed!

253
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,510
Tenma has to be innocent!

254
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,400
Just like my father...

255
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,740
My father had to have been innocent!

256
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,360
My partner's and my contact information is written here.

257
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,440
Please give us a call when you're ready to testify.

258
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,030
What did you say?

259
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,750
They're sending him to prison tomorrow?

260
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,960
It's only been a few days.

261
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,490
<i>Apparently, it's because Tenma's</i>
<i>confession went so smoothly.</i>

262
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,910
Can't we do anything, Mr. Verdeman?

263
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,310
<i>The police are also trying to convince</i>
<i>Tenma to meet with us, but...</i>

264
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,410
<i>By the way, how is Miss Eva Heinemann?</i>

265
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,740
She went out.

266
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,520
She's probably getting drunk at some bar again.

267
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,430
Düsseldorf.

268
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,910
Everything looks so familiar.

269
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,850
I hate this town!

270
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,440
Oh, you're here?

271
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,240
I've been sitting here for five minutes.

272
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,280
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,630
This is a really interesting paper, so I was copying it down.

274
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
D-Do you want to go somewhere else?

275
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,550
I know!

276
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,230
Let's go out for lunch!

277
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,610
Where do you want to go?

278
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,690
Italian?

279
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,360
Or how about French?

280
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,590
Why don't you keep writing?

281
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,750
Why don't you stay there and keep writing?

282
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,400
Eva!

283
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,180
Eva!

284
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,920
Oh, really?

285
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,900
Oh, I'm so, glad for you.

286
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,330
See? Isn't it delicious?

287
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:39,920
Yeah!

288
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,920
What's this?

289
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,840
What do you mean?

290
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,960
If we put rocks down like this, the blanket
won't blow away in the wind.

291
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,880
I wasn't talking, about that.

292
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,630
I'm asking why you're spreading it out here.

293
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,770
It's nice having lunch in a place like this once in a while.

294
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,930
The weather's nice, too.

295
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,420
Lunch? Who?

296
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,400
Us, of course.

297
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,060
I made some sandwiches.

298
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,930
I hope you like them.

299
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,040
There are bugs.

300
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,700
It'll be fine.

301
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,460
This is so stupid!

302
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,480
They're all dirty now...

303
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,480
They're ruined.

304
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,030
Do you want one too, lady?

305
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,200
Hey, Franz!

306
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,230
That's rude!

307
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,730
Thank you.

308
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,400
Is it good?

309
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,490
Start walking.

310
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,000
Get in.

311
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,210
Oh, hello?

312
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,520
I can't get through to Mr. Verdeman.

313
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,750
That's why I'm calling you.

314
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,230
<i>Oh, his wife just gave birth, so he's probably</i>
<i>still at the maternity center.</i>

315
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,440
<i>I've heard about you, Miss Eva Heinemann.</i>

316
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,090
<i>Please, feel free to tell me anything you'd like.</i>

317
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,840
I thought I'd talk.

318
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,240
<i>About what?</i>

319
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,600
The testimony to prove Tenma's innocence.

320
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,960
<i>I see. We're very grateful!</i>

321
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,080
<i>So...</i>

322
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,750
<i>what hotel are you staying at right now?</i>

323
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,880
<i>Got it.</i>

324
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,060
I'll head over there right now.

325
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

326
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

327
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

328
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

329
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,450
The Escape
