1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,440
She saw Johan?

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,690
I guess I should kill her.

3
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,370
I guess I wasn't supposed to see him.

4
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,120
That beautiful young man I
saw that night, one year ago...

5
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,420
Those who see Johan must die. Is that it?

6
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,930
I heard three shots. I got scared and ran off.

7
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,140
I thought that Dr. Tenma had been shot,

8
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,810
but the next day's newspaper said that a man named
Junkers had been shot three times and had died.

9
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,780
It was his doing, wasn't it?

10
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,200
I wonder if you should shoot me.

11
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,540
If you shoot me, you can't get them.

12
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,710
You can't get the photos
of Johan as a child.

13
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,250
What do you think will
happen if you shoot me?

14
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,380
The photos will automatically be handed over
to men from the confederate police agency.

15
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,760
If you want the photos,
tell me where Tenma is.

16
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,400
What's so funny?

17
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,510
Your legs are shaking.

18
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,580
You're showing quite a bit of guts, but
in reality, you can barely stand.

19
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,990
You're a fascinating woman.

20
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,230
I'll tell you.

21
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,670
What is Tenma doing?

22
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,930
Of course, he's a doctor,

23
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,970
though he's an underground one.

24
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,970
Where is he?

25
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,010
There is a man who clawed his way
up to Number 2 in the syndicate.

26
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,070
The boss there attacked the man, and
he got away with just a few injuries.

27
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,860
Tenma is helping that man.

28
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,910
They're in a mansion near Füssen.

29
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,090
Of Men and Dining

30
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,850
Why are you just standing there?

31
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,910
It's going to be lunch time soon.

32
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,880
What are you trying to do?

33
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,410
"What"...?

34
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,170
Hmm, because the weather is so nice,

35
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,150
I thought we'd have lunch outside today.

36
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,140
Lunch outside?

37
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,150
Dieter, bring the plates.

38
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,640
Okay.

39
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,020
Your wounds are healing nicely.
You should get some sun.

40
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,110
Dr. Tenma, you really saved my life.

41
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,410
Your surgery was perfect, even in that
run-down hospital in that podunk.

42
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,830
The wound on your head was just a graze,
and your leg only had a piercing wound.

43
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,800
Your anterior tibial artery was fine.
You were lucky.

44
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,010
So I was lucky?

45
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,890
Hey, look what I cooked up.

46
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,390
It smells great.

47
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,440
How is it? It's good, isn't it?

48
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,280
Despite what you might guess, Heckel's
cooking is pretty good.

49
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,570
What do you mean,
"Despite what you might guess"?

50
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,880
This is young duck cooked in a Marengo
style, but the sauce is what makes it.

51
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,190
It's only made at the three-star
restaurant "Le Petit Besson."

52
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,330
Your explanations are always so long.

53
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,290
You don't know anything, kid.

54
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,620
I think it would be even better
with some soy sauce.

55
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,050
What's with you and soy sauce? Do you
have a problem with my flavoring?

56
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,390
A dining table.

57
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,570
So this is what a dining table is.

58
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,810
I did whatever it took to get money.

59
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
I'd do anything to get more money.

60
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,320
I threw away my parents; I made
my siblings into my enemies...

61
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,620
My wife and children were murdered.

62
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,160
But all I wanted was to have
a dining table like this.

63
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,590
Money can drive people mad.

64
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,550
Have you ever heard about this before?

65
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,400
Five years ago, there was a  "bank" created in Germany that monopolized all the black market funds.

66
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,780
Their work was spectacular.

67
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,690
If money made from illegal activities was
passed through the "bank," the money
would become clean and legit.

68
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,080
You're talking about money laundering, right?

69
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,870
That's right.

70
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,210
Just like a real bank, they ran a business
and allowed people to borrow money.

71
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
That organization became larger
and larger in the blink of an eye.

72
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,510
They made millions in just five years.

73
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:28,220
However... this year, the top man who ran the
organization disappeared all of a sudden.

74
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,730
What do you think happened?

75
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,850
Chaos.

76
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
Chaos beyond comprehension.

77
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,430
The people that were left started
fighting over the money.

78
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,910
Most of them died, and that
organization was destroyed.

79
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,750
If only they'd all sat around a
table and eaten together...

80
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,450
So where did he go?

81
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,390
Huh?

82
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,510
That top man who disappeared all of a sudden...

83
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,390
He must have been killed, right?

84
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,960
No, he's alive somewhere.

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,970
He might be a student somewhere.

86
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,440
A student?

87
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,490
Yeah.

88
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,210
You'd be surprised.

89
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,070
The rumor is that the man... no,

90
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:32,580
the kid that created the organization five years
ago was only fifteen years old at the time.

91
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,960
Fifteen?

92
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,760
Don't make me laugh.

93
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,300
What could a kid like that do?

94
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,220
But he did it.

95
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,220
It's as if he was experimenting in
an adult's game of money,

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,440
like a child playing with a line of ants.

97
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,860
Where? Where was it? This underground bank...

98
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,260
The organization was based in Düsseldorf,

99
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,290
but the top man gave orders from different
places as he moved from city to city.

100
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,530
Where did the last order before
he disappeared come from?

101
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,970
I don't know the details, but I've heard that the men
who had their eyes on the money left for Munich.

102
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,010
Munich...

103
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,010
What's wrong, Doctor? You look pale.

104
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,810
Hey, let's invite the man at the
bottom of the hill for lunch.

105
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,850
Y-Yeah. That's right.

106
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,250
I'm sorry, but his job is to be my bodyguard.

107
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,070
The world already thinks that you're dead.

108
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,390
Do you think anyone's still going
to try to get you?

109
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,370
Are you going to continue living a lifestyle that
requires that you're constantly guarded?

110
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,970
He's worked for me for so long...

111
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,120
Boy, go call Helmut.

112
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,770
So his name is Helmut.

113
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,860
Yeah. Tell him that his duty as
my bodyguard is over.

114
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,110
He's my last friend.

115
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,370
Tell him to come to this table so we can
discuss what will happen from now on.

116
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,160
Okay!

117
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,860
Mr. Helmut! Lunch!

118
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,810
Everyone's waiting for you!

119
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,370
Tenma's up at the mansion.

120
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,660
You want to kill him, don't you?

121
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,460
What is it?

122
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,090
Something's happened to Helmut, my bodyguard.

123
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,970
What?

124
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,930
He's probably already dead.

125
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,810
Is it the people who're after you?

126
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,310
l don't know,

127
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,710
but someone is headed for this mansion.

128
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,030
Mr. Helmut!

129
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,460
Tell him...

130
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,160
to run away.

131
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,900
Tell him to run away now.

132
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,140
Hurry!

133
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,480
Old lady!

134
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,800
Hurry up and run.

135
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,840
But your leg...

136
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,290
Don't worry about it. Go!

137
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,510
Where did the shot come from?

138
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,310
Did you get him?

139
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,140
I don't know. More importantly,
you need to get out of here!

140
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,200
No way! If you stay here, they'll get you!

141
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,650
Don't worry about me. Go!

142
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,940
I told you, I can't. You have to
hide in the thicket.

143
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,830
What? That woman...

144
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,160
She didn't intend to kill him.

145
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,170
Are you okay, old lady?

146
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,390
I'm okay, but that guy's probably
at the mansion by now.

147
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,640
No, you can't make it to the mansion
without passing through this route.

148
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,310
What do you mean?

149
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,140
I've been all over this hill. All the other paths
are like cliffs, and you can't go through.

150
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,380
So if we stand guard here, he won't be
able to make it any further up the hill?

151
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,280
Who is "he"?

152
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,820
Roberto.

153
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,870
He's after Tenma.

154
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,330
Tenma?

155
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,620
Who are you? Are you a friend of Tenma's?

156
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,880
What's so funny?

157
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,630
Let me warn you... I'm not an old lady.

158
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,880
Now hurry.

159
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,220
Go tell Tenma to get out of here.

160
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,470
But old lady... err, I mean, miss...

161
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,020
I told you, I'm fine.

162
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,380
But you're bleeding pretty badly.

163
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,880
Tenma probably heard the gunshot
from before and is coming to help.

164
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,570
Don't you understand that Roberto
is going to <i>kill </i> Tenma?

165
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,120
That's just what he wants.

166
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,870
But if we run, you'll lose more
blood and die, old lady.

167
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,130
I told you that I'm not old!

168
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,590
How do you know Tenma?

169
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,760
I'm his friend.

170
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,880
How about you, ol... miss?

171
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,890
You're his friend, aren't you?

172
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,890
You have to be, since you're
willing to get shot to help him.

173
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,520
You love him, don't you?

174
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,860
Are you his lover?

175
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,280
Keep watch over there!

176
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,410
Do you like Tenma?

177
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,350
Yeah.

178
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,410
I love him.

179
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,640
What do you like about him?

180
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,540
What do <i>you </i> like about him?

181
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:50,050
Roberto! If you're thinking of shooting
me from the bushes, you should stop!

182
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,640
I told you...

183
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,440
The photos of Johan that you want will go
to the confederate police agency if I die.

184
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,870
If you want those photos,
get the hell out of here!

185
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,660
It looks like you've found his weakness.

186
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,820
It's a lie.

187
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,910
He might not fall for it.

188
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,160
Are you okay, miss?

189
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,380
Of course I'm not okay.

190
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,630
Run and save yourself.

191
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,300
I couldn't do that. Tenma will be here soon.

192
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,760
He won't come.

193
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,900
He will! Tenma will come!

194
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,480
He would never come save me.

195
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,350
He wouldn't...

196
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,650
Dieter!

197
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,320
Dieter! Where are you?

198
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,490
Tenma, I'm over here!

199
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,830
I'm coming!

200
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,160
Just wait there!

201
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,700
Don't come any closer!

202
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,290
If you come any closer, he'll get you!

203
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,920
He's after your life!

204
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,010
Th-That voice! It can't be...

205
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,640
This old lady knows you!

206
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,180
She's been shot and is bleeding badly!

207
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,100
Eva!

208
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,600
I don't want you to die!

209
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,180
My dream is to hand you
over to the police alive,

210
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,420
so you can rot in a cell in shame,

211
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,070
while you regret ever throwing me away!

212
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,430
Don't talk.

213
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,630
Dieter! Can you hear me, Dieter?

214
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,540
Can you tell where the bad man is?

215
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,140
l don't know!

216
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,550
I can't tell where he's shooting from!

217
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,760
Don't come closer...

218
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,390
I don't want you to die...

219
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,600
Hold on, old lady!

220
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,610
He won't come for me.

221
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,780
He'd never save me.

222
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,990
There's no way he'd come for me.

223
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,970
Lady...

224
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,250
There's no way he'd come for me...

225
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,200
Ten-ma...

226
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,580
What are you doing?

227
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,450
Lunch.

228
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,290
Your injury is healing nicely,

229
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,450
so you're healthy enough to eat
out in this nice weather.

230
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,920
You're lucky.

231
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,550
Lucky?

232
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,760
The man who shot you was a professional assassin.

233
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,430
He was totally calm when he tried
to break into this cottage.

234
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,320
There was only one way to get in, and considering
how many security systems and armed men I had,

235
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,710
it was obvious he didn't stand a
chance in an all-out fight.

236
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,320
So he used you.

237
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,820
He used me...

238
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:50,750
He predicted that no one except a lone woman
aimlessly stopping by to visit could ever get in here.

239
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,500
And then you betrayed him.

240
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,920
That's when his plan fell apart...

241
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,800
so he left.

242
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,260
He left?

243
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,560
That's right. He wasn't in the woods.

244
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,230
This is young duck cooked in a Marengo style.

245
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,150
Since I just made the recipe up from what I tasted,
I don't know if it will be good or not.

246
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,790
The other thing that makes you lucky is...

247
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,330
that Dr. Tenma treated your wounds.

248
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,540
Where is Tenma?

249
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,880
He's gone.

250
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,750
Where to?

251
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,550
He had some interest in Munich.

252
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,220
Munich?

253
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,850
Now, let's have some lunch.

254
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:52,810
It seems that you, just like I did for a long time, have
forgotten what it was like to have a meal like this.

255
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,510
Thursday's Boy
