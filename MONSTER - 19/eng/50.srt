1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,390
Ahh... if you're looking for that mansion...

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,380
just keep going up this hill.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,100
I see. Thank you.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,360
You're welcome.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,120
Roses...

6
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,650
This almost seems like Sleeping Beauty's castle.

7
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,070
<i>My name is Anna... Anna Liebert.</i>

8
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,280
<i>Good luck, Mr. Detective.</i>

9
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,070
<i>If something were to happen to you....</i>

10
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,050
<i>When I think of that...</i>

11
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,650
<i>I...</i>

12
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,100
<i>I feel the same way your mother did, so...</i>

13
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,410
Anna...

14
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,380
Were you dreaming...

15
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,510
Detective Suk?

16
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,390
Yeah...

17
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,290
You're...

18
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,280
Lunge.

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,510
An inspector from the German BKA.

20
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,720
BKA?

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,230
Yeah.

22
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,780
You don't have to sit up.

23
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,810
I didn't come here to arrest you or anything.

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,330
This is a pretty nice hospital room.

25
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,930
The old Czechoslovakian secret police...

26
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,730
I traced all the hospitals they were connected to...

27
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,640
and finally ended up here.

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,070
To think you're receiving such treatment...

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,750
from the old Czechoslovakian secret police...

30
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,250
You must be important to them.

31
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,060
No, I'm just...

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,950
I already know what happened.

33
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,470
I know about Inspector Zeman's connection
to the secret police and his brutal death.

34
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,770
Prague's police chief and two officers
were poisoned to death.

35
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,050
The two agents who were sent to tail you...

36
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,260
were found shot to death.

37
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:42,150
And you're the chief suspect in all the
incidents that have taken place.

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,170
Considering all the evidence stacked against you...

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,770
you're the culprit.

40
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,010
I'm not!

41
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,240
I didn't do anything!

42
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,720
Then could it be Grimmer, the tall, thin man...

43
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,710
who was talking with Inspector Zeman
the day before he was killed?

44
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,050
It's not Mr. Grimmer, either!

45
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,730
He wouldn't do something like that.

46
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,560
In that case, who is the killer?

47
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,820
You know, don't you?

48
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,620
You know who the killer is right?

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,470
W-What are you talking about?

50
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,590
If I knew, I wouldn't be in this state.

51
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,100
Deceived by so many people...

52
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,110
set up to take the fall...

53
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,990
even being on the run from the police...

54
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,950
I've had enough of this!

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,590
I don't want to be betrayed anymore!

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,830
You're a detective, aren't you?

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,960
If you're a detective...

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,030
then you have to calmly dissect the situation.

59
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,950
Even if it's painful...

60
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,960
you must calmly uncover the truth.

61
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,250
If you don't want to be betrayed anymore...

62
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,970
then start doubting the person
you want to doubt the least.

63
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,780
Who gave you permission to see him?

64
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,490
I want to see your boss.

65
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,280
Tell him I want to speak with him about the Rose Mansion.

66
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
He'll want to meet with me.

67
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,890
The Rose Mansion

68
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,270
Inspector Lunge from the German BKA.

69
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,410
I'm familiar with your background and personal history.

70
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,750
I've also heard rumors about you since the old regime...

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
Colonel Ranke.

72
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,880
And now you're practically the head of
the old Czechoslovakian secret police.

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,370
it must be quite difficult to control such
a large organization these days.

74
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,810
Thank you for your concern.

75
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm envious that you're able to take
such an extended vacation.

76
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,690
Two years ago, the secretary for Senator Borzmann,
the German Democratic Party candidate...

77
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,080
committed suicide due to your thorough investigation.

78
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,850
You've got to be a little smarter in what you do.

79
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,850
You're the fool here.

80
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,710
As long as you seemed legitimate on the surface...

81
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,930
you could have secretly run this country...

82
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,810
and acted as the president from the shadows.

83
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,680
But now, the frightened citizens see you as you really are.

84
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,360
I see.

85
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,510
You're a smart one.

86
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,320
So, what does a smart man like you want from me?

87
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,470
Well, as you know, I'm not simply on
this extended vacation for leisure...

88
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,810
I've been searching...

89
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,560
for the existence of true terror.

90
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,560
There's a possibility that the illusion you created...

91
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,370
may have given birth to the devil itself.

92
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,860
So this is about the Red Rose Mansion?

93
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,050
I had to investigate quite a bit
before I found the mansion...

94
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,620
because the author has so many pen names.

95
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,090
"The Monster Without a Name."

96
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
By Emil Scherbe.

97
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,630
Address, an office in an old building in Prague.

98
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Right now, another company is leasing the place.

99
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,670
Klaus Poppe's address was listed as
an old farmhouse outside the city.

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
It was demolished.

101
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,290
Jakov Vyrobek's was just a rented office, too.

102
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,170
And...

103
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,820
did you find him?

104
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,660
Franz Bonaparta?

105
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,330
What is that mansion?

106
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,610
And who is Franz Bonaparta?

107
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,650
Every search I run on him comes up with nothing.

108
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,840
That means he must be under your protection.

109
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,850
An old Czechoslovakian secret police officer.

110
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,910
What do you want?

111
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,310
I want to know what you know.

112
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,290
I don't know anything.

113
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,130
Just that...

114
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,090
Just that...?

115
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,550
I've been consciously trying to forget...

116
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,280
that the mansion ever existed.

117
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
That's why I never did anything about it...

118
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,470
and it's still there, untouched.

119
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,590
In that mansion...

120
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,580
all the political prisoners and researchers
held there vanished one day.

121
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,050
That's the story.

122
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,380
What is that wall for?

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
Wall?

124
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,210
I was inside the mansion a few days ago.

125
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,640
There was no sign that anyone else
had recently been in there.

126
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,710
It was completely abandoned.

127
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,460
But...

128
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,020
the north wall on the second floor...

129
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,260
was built rather hastily, as if to hide something.

130
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,780
May I break down that wall?

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,880
What are you afraid of, Colonel Ranke?

132
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,410
You may die.

133
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,370
If we come any closer...

134
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,900
we may come face to face with true terror!

135
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,320
Franz Bonaparta...?

136
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,470
That's a nostalgic name.

137
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,560
You want cream and sugar in your coffee?

138
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,800
No, black is fine.

139
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,290
What is it?

140
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,830
Nothing...

141
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,440
It's just surprising to have a fan of
Franz Bonaparta come here...

142
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,160
I got your address from Moravia Publishing...

143
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,650
Mr. Sovak, you were Bonaparta's editor
when he was still writing, right?

144
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,290
Yeah.

145
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:24,280
But I was only his editor when he was
going by the pen name Klaus Poppe.

146
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,570
Would you mind telling me what he was like?

147
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,750
Franz Bonaparta?

148
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,450
He used to have his work-related
meetings here in this house.

149
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,200
Yes...

150
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,580
he used to sit in that chair, just like that.

151
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,610
He would often play with my daughter in the yard.

152
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,530
Back then, my daughter said something rather strange...

153
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,350
"That man is scary."

154
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,050
My daughter was still little at the time, so she
probably doesn't remember anything now.

155
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,580
Was he working with the government back then?

156
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,970
Probably.

157
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,290
I associated with him assuming that he was.

158
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,200
However, his mannerisms, his way of speaking...

159
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,560
the clothes he wore, were all unlike other
government VIPs under the old regime.

160
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,750
And he had a gentleness and elegance about him...

161
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,390
Bonaparta had a master's in psychology
and was a practicing psychologist.

162
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,830
He was also a medical doctor.

163
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,850
His specialty was brain surgery.

164
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,840
I... I see...

165
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,470
The last time I saw him was... let's see...

166
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,550
I think it was the summer of '81 or '82.

167
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,610
Yes, he just suddenly showed up at my house one day...

168
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,000
with a new story...

169
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,610
He looked somewhat refreshed.

170
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,050
A new story...

171
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,050
What kind of story was it?

172
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,220
A story about a monster falling in love.

173
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,600
But it was like a combination of "Beauty
and the Beast" and "Sleeping Beauty."

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,520
I rejected it.

175
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,450
Then, in the doorway just before he left...

176
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,540
he turned around and said, "How about this one?"

177
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,310
"The Door That Must Never Be Opened."

178
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,360
And I asked him...

179
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,590
"So, on the other side of the door do you find paradise..."

180
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,730
"or a monster biding its time?"

181
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,800
And he said...

182
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,350
"Since the door must never be opened, there's no story..."

183
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,240
He laughed, and left.

184
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,830
That was the last time I saw him.

185
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,570
So, did you learn anything about Bonaparta?

186
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,280
No, not really...

187
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,880
Mr. Grimmer, why are you here?

188
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,330
I was just thinking what a fine day it is.

189
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,350
Yeah.

190
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,000
I knew it!

191
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,840
Ah, is this the police?

192
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,520
This is Sovak, I live on Svejk Court.

193
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,050
The guy that just visited me...

194
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,920
Apparently...

195
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,470
I think he's wanted for a series of murders in Germany.

196
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,630
Yeah, he's Japanese... a brain surgeon named Dr. Tenma.

197
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,400
Ethanol...

198
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,480
This room reeks of antiseptics.

199
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,130
Dead...

200
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,770
How many...

201
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,250
How many people died here?

202
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,280
Ten...

203
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,780
Twenty...

204
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,840
No, more than that...

205
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,260
That woman...

206
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,280
The woman from the sketchbook.

207
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,150
Is she the mother of the twins?

208
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,830
If we don't hurry, the older kids will take the soccer field.

209
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,520
Hurry up, Milos!

210
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,840
Y-Yeah.

211
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,240
Go! Counterattack!

212
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,450
Crap! Fall back!

213
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,100
The goal is wide open!

214
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,040
No... he's gonna score!

215
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,830
Hey, Milos!

216
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,270
Are you okay, Milos?!

217
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Hang in there, Milos.

218
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,210
Nice defense, Milos!

219
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,360
Nice clear!

220
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,500
You saved a goal!

221
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,560
From the way he's laughing...

222
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,470
he should be all right now...

223
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,950
Right, Dr. Tenma?

224
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,060
Yeah.

225
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,320
Mr. Grimmer...

226
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,410
aren't you going to see Milos and the other boys?

227
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,610
I understand now why I'm bad at soccer.

228
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,840
It's about teamwork.

229
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,380
What's going to happen to Detective Jan Suk now?

230
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,790
He's the prime suspect in this case.

231
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,550
It's the same thing as being socially blacklisted.

232
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,870
Even if he turns himself in...

233
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,090
how can we prove his innocence?

234
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,390
How can we show that the blonde
girl left the crime scene?

235
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,250
Suk must be in the same predicament you're in.

236
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,620
However, there is one thing...

237
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,190
Goodbye, Dr. Tenma.

238
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,660
Huh?

239
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,590
Regarding this case...

240
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,700
there's only one person who knows all the details.

241
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,980
It's me.

242
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,800
What do you think?

243
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,270
If I hand this over to the police...

244
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,310
This is?!

245
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,460
A letter from the serial killer.

246
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,680
Details that only the killer would know...

247
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,910
would make a convincing confession, don't you think?

248
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,340
But if you send this to the police, you'll be...

249
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,760
Grimmer returned to Germany before you even knew it.

250
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,520
Even though the police will try to catch him, Grimmer
is capable of staying out of their reach.

251
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,520
Because he used to be an elite spy.

252
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,830
But you'll be a suspect for the rest of your
life, and will always be on the run...

253
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,940
That's fine.

254
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,850
Because the man named Grimmer
never existed in the first place.

255
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,000
Someone gave him that name out of convenience.

256
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,490
Even if Grimmer is a suspect for the rest of his life...

257
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,690
it'd be fine.

258
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,130
Something like that...

259
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,240
Dr. Tenma, what do you think of the decision I made?

260
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,200
Ahh... never mind.

261
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,240
Forget it.

262
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,750
You're heading to the Rose Mansion now, right?

263
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,490
Y-Yeah.

264
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,180
You may finally be getting close to your goal, huh?

265
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,000
I... I don't know...

266
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,010
Even if I tell you not to be reckless,
it won't change anything, will it?

267
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,810
Just...

268
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,410
don't die.

269
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,670
Mr. Grimmer...

270
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,410
The promise we made when we
crossed the Czech border...

271
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,760
That if we met again, we'd have another picnic.

272
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,670
Fishing for rainbow trout, surrounded
by beautiful scenery...

273
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,870
having good wine with good cheese...

274
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,890
We'll do that again!

275
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,920
I'll always be living in fear of that sound from here on out.

276
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,760
Give it back!

277
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,770
Ouch! It hurts!

278
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,630
It hurts!

279
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,280
What happened?

280
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,520
Let me take a look at it.

281
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,560
Ouch!

282
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,840
It's just a scratch.

283
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,690
I'll put some antiseptic on it.

284
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,260
O-Ouch!

285
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,770
You're a boy, bear with it.

286
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,950
There.

287
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,930
You're a strong kid.

288
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,340
kenzo Tenma, I presume?

289
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,850
We're the police.

290
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,690
We'd like you to come with us...

291
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

292
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

293
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

294
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

295
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,490
The Monster's Love Letter
