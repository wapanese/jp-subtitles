1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,950
Blood pressure, 120 over 80;
pulse, 92.

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,250
I will now remove the bullet.

3
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,690
I have removed the bullet.

4
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,440
The removal is complete.

5
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,980
It's a little early to be relieved;

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,480
we must still reinforce the walls
of the damaged blood vessel.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,250
Huh? Uh-huh...

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,040
Get the proline ready.

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,220
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,200
Downfall

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,020
Blood pressure, 128 over 72;
pulse, 88.

12
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,130
Seems the anesthesia is still working.

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,970
Do your best...

14
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,270
Do your best to survive...

15
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,750
Oh... Dr. Boyer...

16
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,050
Looks like yours went well.

17
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,320
Yes. The surgery did...

18
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,410
The mayor died.

19
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,250
I-Is that so?
That's a shame...

20
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,990
Humph! You act as though
it's none of your concern.

21
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,370
Huh?!

22
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,170
You're the very one
who abandoned our team

23
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,730
just before surgery.

24
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,270
Oh... but, that child
was brought in before the mayor...

25
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,370
What does it matter, who was first?

26
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,470
The problem is, because you selfishly
pulled out of our team,

27
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,750
we were forced to try to fill
the vacuum you created!

28
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,220
B-But... Listen to me! I...

29
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,310
You upset the teamwork.

30
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,820
By order of the Director,

31
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,230
I instructed you
to perform the surgery...

32
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,460
on the mayor.

33
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,860
But you... You ignored me!

34
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,300
B-but, Chief, at that time...

35
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,400
The success of a surgery
depends upon trust

36
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,300
among the entire staff.

37
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,870
But you made a grand stand play!

38
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,880
I have already reported this
to the Director.

39
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,940
He greatly regrets this incident,

40
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,610
which has lowered
the prestige of this hospital.

41
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,690
Prepare yourself!

42
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,900
Uh, sir...

43
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,260
Please wait a minute!!

44
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,330
Dr. Tenma...

45
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,160
At present, that child's blood pressure
is 114 over 82; pulse, 84.

46
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,340
His vitals are very stable.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,950
I see...
That's good...

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,850
Um... That operation...
It was wonderful.

49
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,550
<i>Mayor Roddecker, who collapsed
while on holiday,</i>

50
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,830
<i>has passed away at the hospital.</i>

51
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,390
<i>Upon hearing this unexpected news,</i>

52
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,100
<i>people have been arriving
at the Mayor's office</i>

53
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,160
<i>with bouquets of flowers,</i>

54
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,170
<i>many reminiscing on
the life of the Mayor.</i>

55
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,940
<i>A press conference has just been held
at Eisler Memorial Hospital</i>

56
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,100
<i>where the Mayor was taken.</i>

57
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,850
<i>The cause of
Mayor Roddecker's death</i>

58
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,940
<i>was due to a cerebral infarction
stemming from</i>

59
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,710
<i>a severe emphraxis
of the inner carotid artery.</i>

60
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,590
We did everything we could for him,
but it caused severe brain swelling,

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,790
which resulted in
this unfortunate outcome.

62
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,990
<i>As for naming a successor,
a city official explained that</i>

63
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,900
<i>concrete steps will be taken</i>

64
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,300
<i>- as soon as possible.
</i>- I've got to get some sleep.

65
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,360
<i>In the case of the murder of
Mr. and Mrs. Liebert late last night...</i>

66
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,830
<i>Judging from the signs of
a search in the rooms,</i>

67
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,240
<i>police believe
this may have been a robbery...</i>

68
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,220
<i>or perhaps the act of
a political terrorist</i>

69
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,580
<i>against this couple
who had fled here from their country.</i>

70
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,780
<i>A two-pronged investigation
is under way.</i>

71
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,420
<i>Of this couple's twin children, the son,</i>

72
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,930
<i>who received a gunshot wound
to the head</i>

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,990
<i>underwent successful surgery, but...</i>

74
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>has still to regain consciousness.
He is listed in critical condition.</i>

75
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,070
<i>Now, for the weather...</i>

76
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,300
<i>The whole country is</i>

77
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,340
<i>- in for clear weather...
</i>- That boy...

78
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,060
I wonder what will happen to him.

79
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,140
I'm just like him...

80
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,950
Mr. Reinhardt in ICU
is complaining that

81
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,810
she just can't sleep...

82
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,940
Can't we give her something
to help her sleep?

83
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,750
Dr. Tenma, are you listening to me?

84
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,860
Huh?

85
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,560
O-Oh... in that case,
give her one Halcyon tablet.

86
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,430
That man! He's been unfocused
all day long.

87
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,940
Yo!

88
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,970
Dr. Becker!

89
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,440
Seems you've had a trying time.

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,950
Has the Director
handed down his judgment?

91
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,820
Huh?

92
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,860
I warned you, didn't I?

93
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,090
I told you the hospital
is ruled by politics.

94
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,830
If you played your cards right,

95
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,530
your future would have been
smooth sailing.

96
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,230
Well... I guess this means you and I
are in the same boat now.

97
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,740
Now, don't be so depressed.

98
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,780
You'll get a chance
to redeem your reputation.

99
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Let's go have some drinks.
It'll cheer you up.

100
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,260
Uh, excuse me!

101
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,620
I still need to get a statement
from the girl twin...

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,360
I can't discuss that with you now,
Detective!

103
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,400
Huh?!

104
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,490
That girl is gone from her room!

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,660
What?!

106
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,070
That girl is always
slipping out of her room

107
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,910
and wandering through the hospital!

108
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,210
Huh?!

109
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,820
...me...

110
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,480
Kill...

111
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,130
Kill me...

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
And so...

113
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,970
Eisler Memorial Hospital has
proven to be

114
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,770
the nation's leading medical facility.

115
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,540
That is first and foremost,

116
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,210
the result of our being blessed with

117
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,050
such excellent personnel
such as you all.

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
I am sincerely grateful.

119
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,520
Yesterday...

120
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,030
unfortunately, the Mayor died
here in this hospital.

121
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,460
But, as always,
we had done our utmost to save him.

122
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,200
The public's evaluation of this hospital
has not changed one bit.

123
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,110
Let's have a round of applause
for Dr. Boyer and Dr. Eisen,

124
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,470
who strived to the end
to save the Mayor's life.

125
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,790
I looked at your paper.

126
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,360
I hope you will continue to
work on your research.

127
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,040
Director Heinemann!

128
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Uh... I must apologize
for my actions...

129
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,250
Now, now... What's done is done.
Director?!

130
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,420
You did what you thought you should.
Let's leave it at that.

131
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,890
Director...

132
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,930
And now...

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,630
let's have a word from
the Head of Neurosurgery!

134
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,800
Pardon me... I'm being called up.

135
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,730
It's not you.

136
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,540
Huh?

137
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,970
Here's the newly appointed...

138
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,240
Dr. Boyer, please...
Please come this way.

139
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,210
Sir, what is the meaning of this?

140
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,750
If you wish to remain at this hospital,
you may do so,

141
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,310
but you'd better give up the idea of
rising any further as a doctor.

142
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,190
That would be impossible for
someone with a flawed character

143
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,230
such as yours.

144
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,260
I'll recognize your skill as a surgeon,
but that is all.

145
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,230
You should also give up any ideas of

146
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,170
presenting any papers
at future conferences.

147
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,370
B-But, sir... Please listen to me.

148
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,410
Even if you wish to move
to another hospital,

149
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,740
I have no intention of
writing you a recommendation.

150
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,850
This means it's no use for you
to have any ambition.

151
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,580
You may consider your path
to becoming

152
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,180
the doctor you envisioned closed.

153
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,520
Surgery requires teamwork.

154
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,100
Only with the help of each
and every one of you

155
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,760
can a life be saved.

156
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,250
Eva...

157
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,860
Eva, won't you talk to your father
for me?

158
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,950
I haven't done anything wrong!

159
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,890
I just operated on
an emergency case

160
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,490
in the order in which
he was brought in!

161
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,370
That's... your engagement ring.

162
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,040
You're such a fool...

163
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,450
Huh?

164
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,630
Eva!!

165
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,460
Why, Dr. Norden,
don't you look elegant?

166
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,530
As do you! You're more beautiful
than ever tonight, Eva.

167
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,630
What a laugh, isn't it?

168
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,900
After coming across
Director Heinemann's paper,

169
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,410
I came here to Germany,
and he made me what I am today...

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,940
Now that I think about it,

171
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,710
I suppose that paper
that I was so impressed by

172
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,680
was probably written for him
by someone somewhere...

173
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,290
I knew that he was using me...

174
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,950
but I believed,
when I reached a certain position,

175
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,050
I would be able to work on research
of my choice to my heart's content.

176
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,760
<i>We are scholars, first and foremost.
Isn't that right?</i>

177
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,530
That's not right! Saving people's lives
is what's most important to a doctor!!

178
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,510
<i>After all, people's lives
aren't created equal.</i>

179
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,550
You're wrong!

180
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,240
There is no distinction
between people's lives!

181
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,510
I am not wrong!

182
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,950
You say there's a flaw
in my character?

183
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,190
What about you?!

184
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,820
You call yourself a doctor;
but you're just money hungry!

185
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,520
That bastard... That bastard...

186
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,890
He's better off dead!

187
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,000
I have you to thank...

188
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,740
You opened my eyes, as a doctor...

189
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,940
You must do your best to live.

190
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,370
I threw everything away
in order to operate on you...

191
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,520
That's how far I went
in order to bring you back to life.

192
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,610
You know your name, don't you?

193
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,650
Your name is Anna Liebert,
isn't that right?

194
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,530
I told you, didn't I, Detective?
It's too soon.

195
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,190
Can't anything be done, Doctor?

196
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,970
After all, she saw her parents
shot to death before her very eyes.

197
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,130
She has no physical wounds,

198
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,040
but extreme trauma seems to have
brought on amnesia.

199
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,700
Could you please refrain from

200
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,580
trying to get a statement from her
for a while?

201
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,410
This is a difficult case, you see...

202
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,520
The victim was
an East German diplomat.

203
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,020
If we don't solve this quickly,
the BKA will come.

204
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,790
Those guys always come

205
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,920
and steal the thunder from
us state police!

206
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,160
I haven't got the time to take it slow.

207
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,470
Oh... What if we do this?
We let her see her brother.

208
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,930
She'll be relieved to see him
and her memory might return.

209
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,340
I cannot agree on such a gamble-
one suggested by an amateur, at that!

210
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,540
Besides, Dr. Tenma
will probably not permit it.

211
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,680
Tenma?

212
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,680
He's the doctor
in charge of her brother Johan.

213
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,280
Tsk... What the heck
am I supposed to do?!

214
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,590
Well, Dr. Tenma...

215
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,600
You seem to be in a daze.
You look awfully tired.

216
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,800
I've been so busy
with emergency surgeries.

217
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,900
They've been working you
to the bone...

218
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,570
ever since you were
demoted from Chief.

219
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,540
I don't mind.
It actually makes me feel better.

220
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,400
Hey, now... Are you all right?

221
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm sorry, I've just been paged.

222
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,360
You're so tired,
but you still have work to do?

223
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,120
The more diligent you are,
the worse it'll be for you!

224
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,820
Look at this, Director Heinemann...

225
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,100
See all the gifts
and letters of encouragement.

226
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,700
There are mountains of them
in his sister's room, too.

227
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,500
After losing their parents
these two only have each other.

228
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,580
The mass media keeps reporting on
their heartbreaking plight,

229
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,810
and this is the result.

230
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,110
As far as this hospital is concerned,
they're nothing but an inconvenience;

231
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,950
what with no sign of anyone paying
their medical expenses.

232
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,040
Now, now...

233
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,680
So their story is a pitiful one-
that's just fine.

234
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,760
Huh?

235
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,520
That means this hospital is
garnering attention.

236
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,330
For that reason alone,
these kids are valuable...

237
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,060
Don't you see?

238
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,790
Uh, yes...

239
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,930
Why don't we do this?

240
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,930
We'll give the media
a photo of the siblings together.

241
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,370
Yes, the media keeps asking
for something like that.

242
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,270
Do it. It'll be a picture
of the orphaned siblings

243
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,380
trying their best to live
within the warmhearted care

244
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,940
of our hospital's staff.

245
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,810
But the boy's doctor says
it is still too early

246
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,330
to allow them to see each other.

247
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,150
Who's on his case?

248
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,920
It's Dr. Tenma.

249
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,600
Dismiss him.

250
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,300
What?

251
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,830
There is no need to give that man
a position that gets so much attention.

252
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,340
Take Dr. Tenma off the case.

253
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,510
Yes, sir!

254
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,580
This is a heartwarming gift
from the citizens.

255
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,040
Why don't you have one?

256
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,750
Thank you.

257
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,830
How do you feel, Mrs. Hankel?

258
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,630
Thanks to you, I feel quite well.

259
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,230
Your stitches will be removed soon,

260
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,570
so it won't be long
until you're released.

261
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll be able to go home?

262
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,340
Yes, but as I said, you must rest.

263
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,310
Of course, I will.

264
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,810
Give Mrs. Hankel regular doses

265
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,370
of an anticonvulsant
and a hypotensive.

266
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,990
Wake up, Anna!

267
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,790
W-What are you doing?

268
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,290
Dr. Tenma!

269
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,600
They let her see her brother.
Then she gave a loud scream and...

270
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,930
Why did you bring them together?!

271
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,210
Dr. Tenma...

272
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,480
Take her back to her room, quickly!

273
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,720
Yes, sir!

274
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,340
Dr. Boyer, what is the meaning of this?
Why the camera?

275
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,920
Oh... We're going to give the media

276
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,690
a picture of the emotional meeting
of the two children.

277
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,690
Who allowed you to do such a thing?
I am the boy's doctor.

278
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,760
You have been dismissed
as Johan's doctor.

279
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,000
Wha?!

280
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,030
As of today, he is my patient.

281
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,640
I decided that it would be fine
to let them see each other.

282
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,210
Those children...

283
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,310
Don't make those children fodder
for the media!

284
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,910
We did it by order of the Director.

285
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,050
I think it would be best for you
not to fight it.

286
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm the one who saved this boy!

287
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,520
I have a duty to protect him
until he is completely healed!

288
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,850
If that's the case,
take a look at the boy's reaction!

289
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,940
As soon as he saw his sister,
he extended his hand and cried tears.

290
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,810
He regained consciousness
and showed a normal reaction.

291
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,980
That means the surgery
was a great success.

292
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,840
Good job. Your work is done now.

293
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,020
Get back to where you belong.

294
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,630
Damn it...
Don't make me laugh!

295
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,110
Who cares what the Director says?

296
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,230
Who cares what the Chief says?

297
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,880
They're all money and power hungry!

298
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,050
Damn them!

299
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,760
I... I am not wrong...

300
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm home, Father...

301
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,310
Father? Are you in your room?

302
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,700
Chief?
Are you still in a meeting at this hour?

303
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,640
Father, are you asleep?

304
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,010
I'm coming in.

305
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,650
That bastard... He's better off dead...

306
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,490
A Murder
