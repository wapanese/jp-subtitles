1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,970
Oh, Corinna.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,850
Why was your letter so short?

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,610
Just like Eupolis who practiced, practiced,
and practiced astrology,

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,450
my heart is troubled by you.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,620
Idas's gold faded, and Galonus the carpenter...

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,650
That's enough.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,620
There's no need for you to read any further.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,000
What's wrong?

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,630
That's enough.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,700
Go home.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,260
I'm sorry. Did I do anything to upset you?

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:50,810
People who can't pronounce Latin correctly
have no right to read a book to me.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,940
I'll try harder in the future.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,230
I'm telling you to leave.

16
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,930
Thursday's Boy

17
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,890
Munich University
Friedrich Emmanuel School

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,490
You really got scolded
harshly at the mansion.

19
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,330
Cheer up.

20
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,100
Business management major, Karl Neuman.

21
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,110
How do you know about me?
What's your name?

22
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,090
I'm Lotte Frank,
a cultural anthropology major.

23
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,720
Are you also reading
books to him as a part-time job?

24
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,850
No, I just take care of the place.

25
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,060
Only male students read to him.

26
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,060
You're the person who
reads to him on Tuesdays.

27
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,860
On other days, he has other students come and
read to him since his eyesight has worsened.

28
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,780
What do you think of him?

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,160
That mysterious millionaire,
Hans George Schubert.

30
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,910
I... I don't know.

31
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,370
I just thought that the wage he was paying for the
part-time job was pretty good, so I jumped at it.

32
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,790
Have you heard the numerous
rumors about him?

33
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:48,130
They say there's a phone line in the mansion where he can
manipulate the German stock market any way he wishes.

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,430
They call him the Howard Hughes of Bayern.

35
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,100
He has no family and no acquaintances, but his
fortune just keeps growing and growing.

36
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,770
What do you think he
does with all that money?

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,100
I don't know.

38
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,400
There's an even bigger mystery than that!

39
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,740
He is also called the Vampire of Bayern.

40
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,110
Vampire?!

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,870
When the clock strikes two in the morning, he gets
in a car that looks like a Hearse and goes to town.

42
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,000
It looks just like a scene
from a gothic horror movie.

43
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,380
He was probably just going out for a stroll.

44
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,630
I'm going to confirm for myself whether
or not it was just an ordinary stroll.

45
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,880
Confirm for yourself? What are you saying?

46
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,360
It's for my research paper.

47
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,060
"Mental Activity of Medieval and Current
Day Financial Figures in Bayern."

48
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,870
He's a great sample for sure.

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,980
So you investigated me in the same manner.

50
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,860
I only looked up your name and major.

51
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,650
You shouldn't worry about his yelling at you.

52
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,660
He says cruel things to all the students.

53
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm used to getting yelled at and beaten up.

54
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,860
Used to...?

55
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,420
A lot happened with my foster parents.

56
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,710
You aren't from one of the
local high schools, are you?

57
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,260
So you <i>did </i> investigate me.

58
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,220
I see. You don't have any parents.

59
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,690
The truth is I was hoping to meet my real
mother in Munich, so I transferred here.

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,020
So your mother is in Munich?

61
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,610
Have you seen her?

62
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,190
No. I don't care anymore.

63
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,120
Huh? Why?

64
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,030
You're finally close to her.

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,870
You probably know her name, right?

66
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,780
Yeah.

67
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,160
What is it?

68
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,160
I told you, it doesn't matter anymore.

69
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,790
Tell me!

70
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm interested now.
I'll figure it out eventually anyway.

71
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,880
Margot...

72
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,110
Margot Langer.

73
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,440
If you know that much,
it shouldn't be hard to find her.

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,100
Go see her. She'll be happy.

75
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,890
I told you, it doesn't matter.

76
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,630
Margot Langer... Margot Langer...

77
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,070
No way!

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,800
The galloping of the chestnut-colored horse was like
lightning striking the ground and large waves crashing.

79
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,330
I can't take it.

80
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,880
I only love beautiful things.

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,420
I can't listen to that anymore.

82
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,260
Why didn't you tell me?

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,350
I looked up your mother.

84
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,430
What can I say?

85
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,270
It's okay. Just drop it.

86
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,840
Karl, isn't there anything
I can do to help you?

87
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,170
Thanks, but don't worry about me.

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,740
Karl...

89
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,210
Lotte, you said that you wanted to see
what Hans Schubert does at night.

90
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,630
Can I come with you?

91
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,380
Of course. If you come with me,
I'll feel a lot better.

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,640
It's true!

93
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,370
This is my first big scoop.

94
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,390
Really?

95
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:33,150
It's perfectly clear that one of the men who founded
this school in 1502, Bishop Gropius, wrote this.

96
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,400
The most important part is this line here.

97
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,880
"In the second-to-last larger year,

98
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,910
the Thursday Boy will come to this land,

99
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,970
and the books shall be engulfed in flames,

100
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,870
and the whole world will
be wrapped in sorrow."

101
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,390
So what does that mean?

102
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,880
Will you ever get it?

103
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,260
This... "In the second-to-last larger year"...

104
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,640
It's 1996! So it's this year.

105
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,930
Why?

106
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,310
The "larger year" means leap years.

107
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,140
The only leap years left in this
century are this year and 2000.

108
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,650
"The Thursday Boy will come to this land,
and the books shall be engulfed in flame."

109
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,940
"The books of this land in flames"
means that this school will burn.

110
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,030
Then who is this "Thursday Boy"?

111
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,240
Thursday is "Donnerstag."
The origin of that is "Donner."

112
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,830
In other words, "thunder."
It must be the lightning god!

113
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,670
What a whopper!

114
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,940
This is no time to be laughing.

115
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,670
This will be the hit story of the next issue.

116
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,010
We won't have a problem writing this,
but who's going to believe it?

117
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,390
Who'd believe that a god of destruction
would come to this school?

118
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,030
Screw the "Vampire of Bayern"!

119
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,700
Is this the truth behind
the mysterious night out?

120
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,130
What a let down!

121
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,640
Shh! Here he comes.

122
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,790
How ridiculous.

123
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,170
I'm going home.

124
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,650
Take care.

125
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,460
Huh?

126
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,170
I'm going to go take a look.

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,670
Go where?

128
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,770
Let's give up already.

129
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,730
This isn't the place for a girl.

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,150
Go home.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,110
"I only love beautiful things."

132
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,360
I want to know.

133
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,700
I want to know how low a man he really is.

134
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,850
It's open.

135
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,550
If you're looking for a girl,
this is the wrong place.

136
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,430
I retired a long time ago.

137
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,100
Who are you?

138
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,730
You should introduce yourself first
before you ask someone's name.

139
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,690
I'm Margot Langer.

140
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,380
You look like college students.

141
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,540
Yes. We work part time for Mr. Hans Schubert.

142
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,870
What do you want with me?

143
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,460
Why does Hans Schubert come here?

144
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,550
"He comes for pleasure."

145
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:48,510
That's what I'd like to say, but it seems that his
thing down there doesn't work anymore.

146
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,280
He comes to give me money.

147
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,060
Huh?

148
00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:01,530
Naturally. When I came to him and told him
who I was, he cried and apologized to me.

149
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,030
He left me with a child and threw
me away like trash.

150
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,040
Karl, don't tell me... that you're
Hans Schubert's child?!

151
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,930
But...

152
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,620
You're lying.

153
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,880
You're not Margot Langer.

154
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,170
That's right. It was in the paper
a year ago. "Former..."

155
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,760
"Former Prostitute Margot Langer
Murdered -- Killer Unknown."

156
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,480
His mother is already dead.

157
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:39,610
You're using the name of Margot Langer
to swindle Hans Schubert out of money.

158
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,240
He knows it, too.

159
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,740
He gives me money, even though he knows
I'm not the real Margot Langer.

160
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,350
He knows that giving all his money away
won't bring the real Margot Langer back.

161
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,250
It's his way of paying for his sins.

162
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,210
With money! Money! Money!

163
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,550
A man who has lived only for money can't
think of anything other than money.

164
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,770
It might sound a bit arrogant, but
people aren't all that different.

165
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:24,220
There's a method where introducing yourself
as his son gets you a piece of that dying
man's ridiculously large fortune.

166
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,230
What are you trying to say?

167
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,860
I might be a liar, but...

168
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,490
you know what I'm talking about.

169
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,200
There's another one.

170
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Another boy who calls himself his son.

171
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,550
He came here with the same story.

172
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,420
No way.

173
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,130
You don't mean...

174
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,640
It can't be. He's lying.

175
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,930
I don't know who's telling a lie.

176
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,020
You both look like imposters to me.

177
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,060
Who is he?

178
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,440
He's the same as you.

179
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,780
You take turns reading to him
on different days, don't you?

180
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,700
That boy is also one of them.

181
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,580
He is the "Thursday Boy."

182
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,910
Why didn't you tell her that
you were the real one?

183
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,870
I've been sent to live with
many foster parents.

184
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,540
There were good ones and bad ones,

185
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,550
but the ones I have now
really take care of me.

186
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,780
I feel that I could never thank them enough.

187
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,140
But I've always felt that I
needed to meet my real parents.

188
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,020
I wanted to know how low
my real father was...

189
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,030
so that I could love my
current parents with all my heart.

190
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,150
That was it.

191
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,370
Have you ever seen the "Thursday Boy"?

192
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,450
I have Thursdays off, so...

193
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,290
Once I went to get something
I had left behind, though.

194
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,750
Did you see him?

195
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,010
What did he look like?

196
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,510
He was blonde and had a handsome face...

197
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,680
Monday

198
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,060
Who is he?

199
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,150
Who is the "Thursday Boy"?

200
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,360
There's a boy here pretending to be me.

201
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,990
Got it? Listen to what Momma
has to say to you.

202
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,210
Take this money and get on the fifth train line.

203
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,960
Get off at the eighth station. A lady
named Marta will be there.

204
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,210
What about you?

205
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,090
I told you that I can't go with you.

206
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,090
Are the police chasing you?

207
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,650
I want to be with you.

208
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,400
If you stay with me, you'll be put
into an orphanage.

209
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,850
If you stay here, people will call
you the son of a whore.

210
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,640
So hurry.

211
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,810
My father is Hans George Schubert.

212
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,240
Who did you hear that from?

213
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,740
Mrs. Bella from across the street said so.

214
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,820
He's rich, isn't he?

215
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,290
She said that I was abandoned by my father.

216
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,090
You weren't abandoned.

217
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,550
Then I'll go see him.

218
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,840
You can't now.

219
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,130
Then when?

220
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,890
When you grow up.

221
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,350
If you want to see him, see him then.

222
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,180
But you mustn't want anything from him.

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,480
You must not hate him if
he treats you coldly.

224
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,060
Why?

225
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,020
Because I don't hate him.

226
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,580
Take this.

227
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,710
Your father gave you this
when you were born.

228
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,190
Karl!

229
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,010
I figured it out!

230
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,640
I figured out who the "Thursday Boy" is.

231
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,350
His name is Edmund Fahren.

232
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,730
He's a philosophical literature major.

233
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,460
He reads books to Mr. Schubert
as a part-time job on Thursdays.

234
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,730
Edmund Fahren.

235
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,070
This is it.

236
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,970
The lecture just ended for this classroom.

237
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,120
Excuse me.

238
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,080
We'd like to see Edmund Fahren.

239
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,330
Is Edmund here?

240
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,050
Edmund? He didn't come today.

241
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,510
That's what they say.

242
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,470
Really...

243
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,600
It's too bad.

244
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,060
But it's only a matter of time.

245
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,890
We'll catch that imposter.

246
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,820
You're the one who should
inherit Schubert's fortune.

247
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,440
That's not true.

248
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,280
Huh?

249
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,310
I don't care about the inheritance.

250
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,200
But...

251
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,870
I don't care how much money
he cons out of him.

252
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,310
I just...

253
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,550
You just...

254
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:43,960
I just can't forgive Edmund Fahren for
calling himself my mother's son.

255
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,510
Tuesday

256
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,140
The petals of your silk flower
petals flutter in the wind,

257
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,540
and a mocking bird sang in my heart.

258
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,070
You haven't said anything today,
Mr. Schubert.

259
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,080
Why didn't you quit after I
yelled at you so much?

260
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,590
Was the money that good?

261
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,580
That's not it...

262
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,420
No, it's not that.

263
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,340
Can you talk about anything but money?

264
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,680
Just as you said.

265
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,850
Where are your parents?

266
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,100
I have foster parents.

267
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,650
I see.

268
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,020
Forgive me for asking, but do you
want to meet your real parents?

269
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,130
The truth is...

270
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,210
It seems the boy who appeared
this time is the real thing.

271
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,920
He doesn't want money.

272
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,460
He?

273
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,920
Sorry. I was talking to myself.

274
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,970
You can go home.

275
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,930
I forgot to mention...

276
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,940
Your Latin's gotten better.

277
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,150
Thank you.

278
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,400
Wednesday

279
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,940
It seems like Edmund Fahren
is absent again today.

280
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,940
He must have caught a cold.

281
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,460
Either way, tomorrow is Thursday.

282
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,420
He'll show up for his job
with Mr. Schubert.

283
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,930
I see. He'll show his true
colors in front of Mr. Schubert.

284
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,680
We'll get him... We'll get him good!

285
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,800
Thursday

286
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,190
He hasn't shown up. It's been an hour!

287
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,820
If he caught a cold,
he might be staying home.

288
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,820
Hey, do you want to give
him a surprise visit?

289
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,950
You went so far as to look
up his address already?

290
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,540
204, 204, 204.

291
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,670
This is it.

292
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,050
Well, go on.

293
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,370
Friday

294
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,630
How horrible.

295
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,140
Everyone's talking about Edmund Fahren.

296
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,430
They can't believe he committed suicide.

297
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,100
His last testament is in the
school paper, right?

298
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,480
"I can't pretend any longer."

299
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,110
He's talking about...

300
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,120
Yeah, after pretending to be Schubert's son and becoming
close to him, he was consumed by pangs of guilt.

301
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,200
If he was going to be troubled so much that he would
kill himself, he shouldn't have done it in the first place.

302
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,210
Lotte.

303
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,040
Yesterday was quite a ruckus, wasn't it?

304
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:00,380
Yes, it was. We were questioned
by the police all day.

305
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,260
My reading was called off today.

306
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,180
Mr. Schubert was very troubled by the news.

307
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,770
Karl, I'll introduce you.

308
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,890
This is the Friday reader.

309
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,230
Nice to meet you.

310
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,130
Hi. I'm Karl Neuman,
a business management major.

311
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,780
I'm a law major, Johan Liebert.

312
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,590
The Secret Woods
