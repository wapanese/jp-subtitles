1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,910
Well, well... you've found
some wonderful property.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,480
It's a convenient twenty-minute drive
from the center of Berlin;

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,990
Former
(East Berlin)

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,290
in a well-located
and nice neighborhood.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,390
It's rare to find this sort of property
on the former East side.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,630
Umm...

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,860
Wasn't this the residence
of Mr. Liebert,

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,960
the consultant to the former
East German Trade Commission?

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,470
Huh?

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,110
What? You just came
to investigate Mr. Liebert?

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,840
Is that all?! You're not a customer?

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,950
Sorry... There was something
I just had to find out.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,750
I wouldn't know anything about
an official who died ten years ago!

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,930
The Lieberts adopted twins
while they were here.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,060
I told you, I don't know anything...

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,060
What about the landlord?

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,730
Can you introduce me to him?

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,530
Listen... most of the land in
the former East side is the property

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,700
of Jewish capitalists who escaped
from the Nazi regime.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,670
The eastern government was paying
foreign countries and capitalists

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,910
from the west side
and borrowing land.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,350
The landlord for this property
is overseas...

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,120
Besides, my company is
a west-side real estate company

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,050
that prospered after
the destruction of the Wall.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,750
I don't know anything about the past.

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,060
Now, get out.
I'm going to lock the gate...

27
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,960
Isn't there anyone who knows
about ten years ago...

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,060
someone who
remembers Mr. Liebert?

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,800
As I told you, this is a residential area
for ex-government officials.

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,470
Most fled after the Wall came down.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,270
Especially from the officials from
the Ministry of the Interior...

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,210
Oh! Come to think of it...

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,820
An ex-official of the former East German
Department of Commerce

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,380
lives ten houses away from here...

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,660
Yes, Mr. Liebert. He didn't have to
take such a risk, only to die.

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,290
If only he had waited
just a little longer,

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,390
until East Germany collapsed...

38
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,590
It makes you wonder why
he went to a free country...

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,370
Just to be killed of all things...

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,140
Did Mr. Liebert have twins?

41
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,970
Twins?

42
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,580
Oh, I remember!

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,150
Those twins that Mr. Liebert adopted
from the orphanage!

44
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,390
Orphanage?!

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,850
They were such cute kids...

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,150
Mr. Liebert always wanted children.

47
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,090
W-Where is that orphanage?!

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,960
Umm... I think it was...

49
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,290
Hmm... 511?

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,330
Yes, that's right,
I think it was 511 Kinderheim...

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,970
511... Kinderheim?

52
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,790
511 Kinderheim

53
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,050
The site of this orphanage will soon
be turned into a supermarket.

54
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm relieved that this creepy building
is finally going to be destroyed.

55
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,270
Excuse me, do you know anyone
from this orphanage?

56
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,040
Someone from here?

57
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,840
There isn't anyone.

58
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,940
I don't want to talk about it.

59
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,310
It's so creepy.

60
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,580
B-But...

61
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,690
If you really want to find out,
there's Hartmann over on 47th St.,

62
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,790
who worked at the old
Ministry of Health and Welfare.

63
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,150
Hey there... Do you know someone
named Hartmann who lives around here?

64
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,390
What's wrong?

65
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,030
You're injured... Let me take a look.

66
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,090
It's all right. Don't be afraid.
Let me take a look.

67
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,500
You've injured a healing wound...

68
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,140
It's festering.

69
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,040
Suck it up!

70
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,970
This will sting a little,
but this will help you get better.

71
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,810
All right, that's good...

72
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,160
Don't trip!

73
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,050
You'll get hurt again!

74
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,100
Hartmann...

75
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,290
I became the foster parent to all those
kids after the fall of East Germany.

76
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,850
Foster parent?

77
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,560
Yes, I took care of them until they
were adopted or went off on their own.

78
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,070
The president of
an accessories company

79
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,800
adopted the kid in the middle.

80
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,170
The kid to the left
is in the military right now.

81
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,600
I'm even taking care of one right now.

82
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,640
It must be hard work.

83
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,850
I wouldn't call it work.

84
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,250
I worked for many years,
dealing with orphans,

85
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,260
as the district official for
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

86
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,290
I opposed the way that the government
was treating them at the time.

87
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,490
After the fall of socialism, I wanted to
help the children in my own way.

88
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm poor and things
haven't gone my way...

89
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,440
but, still, it's much better than
the orphanages that they were in.

90
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,970
511 Kinderheim was
a special orphanage

91
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,610
that was run by both
the Ministry of Health and Welfare

92
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,170
and the Ministry of the Interior.

93
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,050
Well, all orphanages in East Germany
were more or less like that,

94
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,280
but special orphanages
were the worst of them all...

95
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,030
It wasn't just an institution
for children with nowhere to go...

96
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,890
It was a gathering for
the children of criminals,

97
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,960
captured political offenders,
and the children of those

98
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,870
suspected of being rebels and spies.

99
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,480
That's why it was expected that
they would be discriminated against

100
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,110
and treated inhumanely...

101
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,410
The children there couldn't do
anything about their situation...

102
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,250
It was a clash between socialism
and totalitarianism...

103
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,730
The government told the public that
the orphans would be reeducated

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,460
and turned into model socialists.

105
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,430
But in reality,
they were treated like criminals.

106
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,730
The directors and instructors
were horrible...

107
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,970
The worst ones would confiscate
packages sent to the children

108
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,200
and sell them.

109
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,010
Who were the real criminals?

110
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,310
Fear and violence ruled
the special orphanages.

111
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,750
No person would grow up
normal there.

112
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,590
Then that incident happened...

113
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,720
Incident?
What happened at that orphanage?

114
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,530
You said that you wanted to
ask me about the twins, didn't you?

115
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,500
Do you know something about them?!

116
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,640
I don't know much about the sister
because she was left at an orphanage

117
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,700
in a different district.

118
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,780
But I do know about
the brother, Johan.

119
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,250
Johan! Yes, I want to
know about Johan!

120
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,720
It was... It was top secret.

121
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,090
The East German government
placed a strict gag order on it.

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,990
Well, it was a long time ago...

123
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,270
I think it's all right to talk about it...

124
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,940
What is this incident?!

125
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,810
What did... What did Johan do?

126
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,510
A revolt...

127
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm home...

128
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,090
Dieter, we have a guest.

129
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,660
Come and greet him.

130
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,100
Oh!

131
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,730
Dieter, what's with your attitude?

132
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,800
Aren't you going to greet him?

133
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,670
I-It's okay. We already met
in front of the house.

134
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,540
Right?

135
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,050
Oh... I'd like to hear the rest.

136
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,580
No...

137
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,340
Not in front of the child.

138
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,480
Oh... you're right.

139
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,210
It's already late so we should
meet another day.

140
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,860
Dieter!

141
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,120
Would you care to
have dinner with us?

142
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,970
S-Sure.

143
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,400
Mr. Tenma, you say that
you're a freelance journalist.

144
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,580
Does that mean that you're going to
write an article about the things

145
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,610
that you've investigated?

146
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,780
Y-Yes, that's right.

147
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,950
Then, this is one thing
I want you to emphasize...

148
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,420
The development of a child

149
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,790
all depends on the adult
that raises him.

150
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,490
We must lead children
in the right direction.

151
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,770
That's when children can
have pleasant dreams.

152
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,470
Dreams, huh-?

153
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,870
Dieter, what dreams do you have?

154
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,550
A soccer ball...

155
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,910
Huh...?

156
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,780
I want a soccer ball!

157
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,980
I see...

158
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,190
Thank you for dinner.

159
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,190
I'd like to continue where we left off
another time.

160
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,150
Sorry we couldn't
finish our conversation.

161
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,260
I'll come again.

162
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,830
Perhaps I can come tomorrow.

163
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,710
Dieter...

164
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,610
Umm... Excuse me.

165
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,320
Can I come in?

166
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,010
Mr. Hartmann!

167
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,390
It's Tenma.

168
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,500
Mr. Hartmann!

169
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,730
Mr. Hartmann! Mr. Hartmann!

170
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,330
What happened, Mr. Hartmann!

171
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,810
Mr. Hartmann...

172
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,240
M-Mr. Tenma...

173
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,850
Dieter!

174
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,910
What happened?

175
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,010
He fell.

176
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,080
He was standing on the chair and...

177
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,550
Oh, Dieter.

178
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,820
Ow... ow, it hurts...

179
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,260
Where does it hurt, Dieter?

180
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,920
It hurts...

181
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,150
Mr. Hartmann, call an ambulance!

182
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,390
O-Okay.

183
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,290
Dieter, let me take a look.

184
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,300
What are all these scars?!

185
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,710
Is this it?

186
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,530
Does it hurt here?

187
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,870
Two ribs are broken...

188
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,570
And his clavicle is dislocated.

189
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,450
How did he get this injury
from falling off a chair?

190
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,890
The ambulance will be here soon,
so it's all right.

191
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,520
O-Okay...

192
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,220
But what are all these injuries?

193
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,990
I told you that it's all right...

194
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,150
So you can leave.

195
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,530
But...

196
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,470
The way you touch those injuries...

197
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,530
It's as if you're a doctor...

198
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,230
Oh... well...

199
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,810
Tenma...

200
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,270
I thought I heard
that name somewhere.

201
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,970
You're a doctor, aren't you?

202
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,410
You're the one wanted for murder...

203
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,650
This injury...

204
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,550
Where are all these injuries
on his body from?

205
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,660
Nevermind that... Shouldn't you
be running away, Mr. Tenma?

206
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,260
I called the police
along with the ambulance...

207
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,770
Mr. Hartmann! I'm asking you
how Dieter got all these injuries!

208
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,270
It shouldn't matter
to someone like you,

209
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,770
who's wanted for murder.

210
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,800
It's just as I expected from a fugitive.
You're very short-tempered.

211
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,640
You did it, didn't you?!

212
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,390
Did it? Did what?

213
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,620
You were abusing Dieter.

214
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,090
Abusing?

215
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,960
Don't say such ill willed things
about me.

216
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,550
Right, Dieter?

217
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,390
What do you plan to do?

218
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,730
I'm going to take him to the hospital.

219
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,000
First murder, and now kidnapping?

220
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't move!

221
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,910
You'll be caught even if you do that.

222
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,720
It's all right, Dieter! I'm going to
get you to a hospital!

223
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,780
I'm afraid of the hospital...

224
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,150
There's nothing to be afraid of!

225
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,320
The doctors will get you better.

226
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,890
Mr. Hartmann always
makes me better...

227
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,710
You're covered in injuries...
You've never been to a hospital?!

228
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm afraid... Right now,
the world is full of bad things.

229
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,990
That's why I have to be strong!

230
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,860
Strong...

231
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,760
Did Mr. Hartmann tell you that?

232
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,630
The world is dark...

233
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,790
The future is dark...

234
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,870
That's not true!

235
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,340
It's a big lie that the world is dark!

236
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,440
Really?!

237
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,780
Yes, it's true.

238
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,640
Oh, I forgot.

239
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,180
Here... A soccer ball.

240
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,450
Wow!

241
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,440
Tomorrow will be... a good day.

242
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,390
Sorry for coming at this hour.

243
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,030
It's all right... But we're crowded with
emergency cases at the moment.

244
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,400
It might take a while
until we can see him.

245
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,120
Could you do something about that?

246
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,440
- There was a very big accident.
- The bus driver died instantly.

247
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,040
We need to ask the truck driver about
the circumstances of the accident.

248
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,740
He broke both his legs,
but he can still talk, can't he?

249
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,070
We have to treat him first.

250
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,420
Question him later.

251
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,380
- Then, we'll be waiting here.
- U-Umm...

252
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,380
I'll be back in two hours.

253
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,720
Huh?

254
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,890
Please take care of that boy.

255
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:18,920
Also, please don't let anyone
leave with him other than myself.

256
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,930
U-Umm...

257
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,230
Is the accident site cleaned up?

258
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,240
No, it's still backed up...

259
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,370
Now then...

260
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,940
What should I do now?

261
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,580
First, what to do with Dieter?

262
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,820
Even if I go to the police...

263
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,950
I can't go with him.

264
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,050
<i>I don't know much about
Johan's sister because</i>

265
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,790
<i>she was left at an orphanage
in a different district.</i>

266
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,290
A different orphanage...

267
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,860
That's it.

268
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,100
There's a child that you
want me to take in?

269
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,110
So, who are you? Why are you
coming here at this hour?

270
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,050
I know it's an unreasonable request,
but this kid...

271
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
I know that the kid is being abused.
But if I don't know who you are...

272
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,690
Umm... Well...

273
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,990
I can't take in a child from
someone so suspicious.

274
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,700
U-Umm... could this be the orphanage
that took care of Anna Liebert?

275
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,570
Anna Liebert?

276
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,040
You know Anna Liebert?

277
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,250
S-So Anna was here?

278
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,840
Yes. How nostalgic...

279
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,780
How is Anna doing? Is she well?

280
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,710
Y-Yes.

281
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,650
Right now, she's going
to Heidelberg University...

282
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,660
I see. She's doing well!

283
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,590
Anna was a nice girl...

284
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,060
I knew she was adopted by
Mr. Liebert of the Trade Commission

285
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,000
along with her twin brother.

286
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,440
Umm...

287
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,600
What was his name?

288
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,970
Johan.

289
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,870
Yes, Johan, Johan.

290
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,870
They were very close,
but I felt sorry for them

291
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,910
when they were placed
in separate orphanages.

292
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,450
Those two were really alone
before they came here.

293
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,890
When they were taken into custody
near the border of Czechoslovakia,

294
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,550
they were holding hands
as they walked.

295
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,290
They both were shivering in the cold.

296
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,130
At first, Mr. Liebert only
wanted to adopt Johan.

297
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,470
But Johan wouldn't go
without his sister...

298
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,370
Thankfully, Anna got to be happy.

299
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,670
I heard that the conditions
of the orphanages

300
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,610
of the east side were horrible.

301
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,780
We're not like 511 Kinderheim.

302
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,920
Huh?

303
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,790
Inge, the bathroom isn't that way.

304
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,470
Okay? See?

305
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,100
Mommy...

306
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,610
It's all right. It's all right...
There's nothing to be afraid of.

307
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,370
Now... you can go to the bathroom
by yourself, can't you?

308
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,880
Those kids really did not know
a parent's love.

309
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,920
You only need love in order to
develop as a person.

310
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,170
As you say, the orphanages of
the east side were quite horrible.

311
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,230
Even this place was once referred to
as Orphanage 47.

312
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,910
But we did what we could
so we wouldn't be controlled

313
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,010
by the government,
even just a little

314
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,050
in order to avoid becoming
like 511 Kinderheim.

315
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,980
It was a special orphanage
run by both

316
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,520
the Ministry of Health and Welfare
and the Ministry of the Interior.

317
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,830
Do you know what that means?

318
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,230
No...

319
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,100
The real state of affairs
was being managed by

320
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,460
the Ministry of the Interior.

321
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,340
That place was... East Germany's
experimental laboratory...

322
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,490
A Little Experiment
