1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,130
Here, here!

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,050
Wait!

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,770
Double Ranger Kick!

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,880
Hey! That's not fair...

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,430
You should fall down if you get kicked.

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,860
The evil emperor who plots world conquest...

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,140
cannot be defeated that easily!

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,000
You know that at the end of those TV
shows the bad guys always lose.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,710
Is your world conquest coming along smoothly?

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,130
Johan...

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,920
He won't go down, no matter what!

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,590
But you know, the hard part comes
after you conquer the world.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,470
What kind of world do you plan to build?

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,430
I don't know anything about that.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,800
I guess I'll leave it messed up.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,940
What?

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,190
It sounds more fun if you're
just going to mess it all up.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm quitting the Rainbow Rangers
and joining the Evil Organization.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,700
Shall we all head back?

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,250
Okay.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,700
Let's head back now.
Don't forget anything.

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,160
Okay!

23
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,230
Just One Case

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,750
It's gotten warmer lately.

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,210
You're right.

26
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,920
How's Rosemary?

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,470
She didn't catch a cold this
winter, did she?

28
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,930
Yes, she did. She was running around
with her friends outside.

29
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,390
She always did get a bad
fever every winter.

30
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,560
Yes, it was around this time...

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,230
We took her to the doctor in
the middle of the night.

32
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,780
You carry around an album of her pictures?

33
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,110
Yeah...

34
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,030
She must have grown so much.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,530
Since she's still growing, I wonder if her face has
changed in the little while that I've not seen her.

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,870
But I have confidence that,

37
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,250
no matter how old Rosemary gets,

38
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,250
I'll be able to recognize her instantly.

39
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,340
Oh, yes.

40
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,590
When the time comes,
please show this to her.

41
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,510
It contains copies of the report
and newspaper clippings...

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,760
from when I shot the young boy, the
perpetrator of the serial killing.

43
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,190
I'm not telling you to explain
things clearly to her.

44
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,240
It's a fact that I killed a person.

45
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,740
I'm not trying to defend myself.

46
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,620
I just want her to know the truth.

47
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,620
I understand.

48
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,920
I wonder... when I can see her again.

49
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,140
I'll ask her again...

50
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,770
whether or not she wants to see her father.

51
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,270
R-Really?

52
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,680
I'll be waiting for your call.

53
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,440
I'm home every night by nine o'clock.

54
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,600
Richard...

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,770
You've really returned to how you used to be.

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,070
What?

57
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,360
Those youthful eyes that you had when
you were a rookie detective...

58
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes, much like the time when we first met.

59
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,870
Is that so?

60
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,920
So how about it?

61
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,560
Offenbach
Hesse

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,380
There are benefits if you sign up now.

63
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,800
The thing is, we're already signed up
with another insurance company.

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,370
I'm begging you here, Mr. Liebert.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,220
The insurance we have now is enough.

66
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,640
We don't have the extra money to
pay for more insurance.

67
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,010
We got our insurance right when
we moved here four years ago.

68
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,180
Four years ago?

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,650
Where did you live before coming here?

70
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,800
In Brunt치l, near Mannheim.

71
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,990
Brunt치l? That's a nice area.

72
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,160
Were you born there?

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,830
Yes, we lived there up until we moved here.

74
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,410
By the way, ma'am, do you have any kids?

75
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,030
Yes. My son is currently at the
University of Munich.

76
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,500
Oh? He's a college student?

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,800
If that's the case,

78
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,220
then I have the perfect policy for
a young man like him.

79
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,930
Please listen to what I'm offering.

80
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,600
Is this your son?

81
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,930
He looks like he was a cute one.

82
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,140
What is his name?

83
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,690
Johan.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
Would you like some tea?

85
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,310
Oh no, please don't bother.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,890
Ever since he went to the
University of Munich,

87
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,530
we've only gotten a call from
him once in a while.

88
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,570
Boys are like that.

89
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,470
Sad, huh?

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,510
I went there, Dr. Reichwein.

91
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,970
Yes, to Johan's family.

92
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,760
Well, it was a family just like any other,

93
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
with absolutely nothing out of the ordinary.

94
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
So what do you think, Richard?

95
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,940
Well, from my analysis as an ex-detective,

96
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,030
the more ordinary something seems,
the more suspect it is.

97
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,230
I see.

98
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,030
In any case, I'll continue investigating
Johan's surroundings.

99
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,990
Something...

100
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,620
There's got to be something.

101
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,830
At the gymnasium that Johan
attended, he had a reputation...

102
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,590
of being a good student with
good grades and conduct.

103
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,950
But I have confidence that...

104
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,670
no matter how old Rosemary gets,

105
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,210
I'll be able to recognize her instantly.

106
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,480
<i>I can't imagine how that baby's face
can become Johan's adult face.</i>

107
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,840
Brunt치l City Hall

108
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,530
This is the birth certificate.

109
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,530
Thank you.

110
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,700
<i>Johan Wilhelm Liebert.</i>

111
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,290
<i>Born on February 9th, 1976.</i>

112
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,540
<i>He was indeed born in this city.</i>

113
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,500
<i>There's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary...</i>

114
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,010
Mr. Hertz!

115
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,540
How many times do I have to tell you?

116
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,250
There's no smoking in the City Hall!

117
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,040
Don't be like that... Go get me an ashtray.

118
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,170
No way!

119
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,590
You remember that there was a
fire here four years ago, right?

120
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,190
All the paperwork was destroyed.
It was a big mess.

121
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,660
Did you guys redo all the
paperwork back then?

122
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,190
Y-Yes...

123
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,030
The paperwork was redone according
to individual request,

124
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,780
but since this is such a small city, most
of the paperwork was restored.

125
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,780
Ah, thanks for coming, Dr. Gillen.

126
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,210
It's been a while, Dr. Reichwein.

127
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,930
Dr. Tenma went to you and told you he
was looking for a man named Johan?

128
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
Yes.

129
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,230
There was no basis for his story.

130
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,360
But if this person was indeed the
friend who led the serial killer...

131
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,040
Peter Jurgens, whom I was researching, astray,

132
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,740
then it would be a breakthrough for all the cases.

133
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm counting on you, Dr. Gillen.

134
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,040
Yes, I'll get permission to see
Jurgens as soon as possible.

135
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,380
Depending on how he reacts to this photo,

136
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,380
we might be able to prove
Dr. Tenma's innocence.

137
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,310
He died?

138
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,390
Yes.

139
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,270
The real Johan, who was born in
Brunt치l, died when he was two.

140
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,740
So you're saying that the Liebert couple
used the fire as an opportunity...

141
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,990
to reissue documents that said
that he was still alive?

142
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,030
Probably.

143
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,250
Then the person who's called
Johan Liebert is...

144
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,170
Who the hell is he?

145
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,300
In any case,

146
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,970
as I told you before, I gave
Johan's photo to Dr. Gillen.

147
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,720
Hopefully an answer will come out of that.

148
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,980
How about some food?

149
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,230
Sorry, but I have to get back.

150
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,300
What? You've been running around all
day and you still have work to do?

151
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,020
No, that's not it.

152
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,330
It's just that I may get a phone call.

153
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,530
I may be able to see my daughter.

154
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,910
Oh?

155
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,780
I'll be fine.

156
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,200
The important thing is to move forward, right?

157
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,270
Excellent, you've made a full recovery.

158
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes! Hello?

159
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,600
Dad? It's me...

160
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,900
Rosemary...

161
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,650
Yes, I'm fine.

162
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,610
Yes...

163
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,030
Meet?

164
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,370
We can meet... anytime you want.

165
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,120
Mr. Richard?

166
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,500
It's Johan.

167
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,800
It's about this young boy, Jurgens.

168
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,720
Do you recognize him?

169
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,460
Might you have met him before?

170
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,650
I don't know him.

171
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,530
You mentioned that your friend, Johan,

172
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,640
never met you personally,
but only wrote you letters.

173
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,810
Johan knew you pretty well, though.

174
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,390
Could I borrow a pen?

175
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,500
What?

176
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,360
Sorry, but I'm not allowed to
hand you anything.

177
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,710
A pen, please.

178
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
The park.

179
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,230
What?

180
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,110
At the park,

181
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,570
the day after I killed somebody...

182
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,450
"Let's stop this."

183
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,450
"Let's stop right here."

184
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,450
I thought that as I went to the park.

185
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,290
He had a lot of children with him.

186
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,420
Could you wait a minute?

187
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
I forgot to start the tape.

188
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,550
Can you start from the beginning again?

189
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,130
"You should come, too."

190
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,170
Huh?

191
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,630
"You should come, too."

192
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,800
"You should come, too."

193
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,970
"You should come, too."

194
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,180
"You should come, too."

195
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,480
"You should..."

196
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,990
W-What is it?

197
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,700
We met at Mr. Schubert's, right?

198
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,960
I'm Johan Liebert.

199
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,380
I called you many times,

200
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,710
but you never picked up.

201
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,910
That's why I came to see you.

202
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,050
Hello?

203
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,720
Dr. Gillen?

204
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,890
How did it go when you showed
the photo to Jurgens?

205
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,820
He died?

206
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,860
Yes, he just died in the hospital.

207
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,570
Due to the police questioning, I
can't leave the hospital either.

208
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,160
Because of my negligence,
I gave him a pen, and...

209
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,250
an important witness has...

210
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,790
However, Dr. Reichwein,

211
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,110
his suicide was no doubt a
reaction to Johan's picture.

212
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,260
As soon as the questioning ends,

213
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,130
I'll head over there.

214
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,380
Understood.

215
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,340
I'll contact Richard right away.

216
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,470
Richard...

217
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,540
A research paper for your university?

218
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,650
Yeah.

219
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm researching the UN Convention
of 1989 on the Rights of the Child.

220
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,410
Would you like a drink, Mr. Richard?

221
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,710
No thanks, I'm fine.

222
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,330
I see that you've stopped drinking.

223
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,340
That's right...

224
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,160
It's because you were drunk when
you executed that young boy.

225
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,430
Am I mistaken?

226
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,930
N-No...

227
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,980
Although I was drunk at the time,
I did something inexcusable.

228
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,340
That's what I'd like to ask you about...

229
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,440
The young boy you killed,

230
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,900
Stephan Joss, seventeen years old...

231
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,650
What crime did he commit?

232
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,280
A young boy, eh?

233
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,910
That seventeen-year-old "young boy"
committed such horrible crimes...

234
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,290
Nine rape-homicides and two homicides!

235
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,830
And that's why you executed him.

236
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,800
It wasn't an execution!

237
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,290
Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:17,510
Incidentally, you know that under Article 40 of
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,

239
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,510
a child is "innocent until proven guilty," right?

240
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,010
Yes, I do know that.

241
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,850
I was once with the Juvenile Division, too.

242
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,750
I see.

243
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,810
Then you know that under Article 37, a person
under eighteen cannot be executed...

244
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,940
or sentenced to life in prison for
crimes that they've committed.

245
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,450
Most of the Convention consists of basic rights
that are granted to all in this country,

246
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,760
be it a child or an adult.

247
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,450
My shooting him was not an execution.

248
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,960
It was a mistake caused by alcohol.

249
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,290
I know I did something inexcusable.

250
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,460
And I'm now being sanctioned by society...

251
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,590
Okay, okay, please wait a minute.

252
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,250
I wanted to meet you for my paper.

253
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,720
If I've offended you, I apologize.

254
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,690
Why don't we take a walk to change the mood?

255
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,230
I'd like this whiskey, please.

256
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,190
After all, the winds at night are chilly.

257
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,320
Ah, Dr. Gillen?

258
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,070
I still can't get a hold of Richard.

259
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,660
He told me he might be able to
meet his daughter, but...

260
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,010
I don't think he's out meeting
her this late at night.

261
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,630
In any case, please tell him to be
careful when you reach him.

262
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,350
I'm heading over there now.

263
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,510
Do you know Stephan Joss's record?

264
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,060
If I remember correctly, when he was young,
he was in an East Berlin orphanage.

265
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,520
You need to know more about him.

266
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,270
Huh?

267
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,370
It's important if you want to know
where he's coming from.

268
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,860
The orphanage he was in...

269
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,150
It was a horrible place.

270
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,240
He was truly a nice boy.

271
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,370
But no one knows what kinds of horrible things
happened to him at that orphanage...

272
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,910
or just how badly his spirit was destroyed.

273
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,330
Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 6,

274
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,880
the right to life, and guaranteed
survival and development.

275
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,130
Article 8, the right to preserve one's identity.

276
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,300
Article 19, protection from child abuse.

277
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,180
No, those things were not provided
for them in that hellish place...

278
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,020
at 511 Kinderheim.

279
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,400
Will you be able to meet your daughter?

280
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,440
H-How...?

281
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,440
How did you know about that?

282
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,550
Was that your daughter on the
phone back at your place?

283
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,830
Will you be able to meet her?

284
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,450
Tomorrow?

285
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,630
What is it?

286
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,210
What's your purpose?

287
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,800
To write a paper for my university.

288
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,870
Not that!

289
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,710
Your purpose for being with Schubert now!

290
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,470
Who...

291
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,520
Who are you?

292
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,200
You said you shot the boy
because you were drunk, right?

293
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,120
Before that, answer my question!

294
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,290
It's true that on that day, you were seen drinking
in a bar after shooting that young boy.

295
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,960
But something's amiss.

296
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:45,810
According to my research, there wasn't a single person
who saw you drinking before you shot that young boy.

297
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,850
Could it be possible that you weren't drunk
when you shot that young boy?

298
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,730
Wha...

299
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,980
You were sober.

300
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,400
You were calm.

301
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,360
You calmly pulled the trigger because
you wanted to execute him.

302
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,910
Am I mistaken?

303
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,990
You're wrong!

304
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,540
Why are you trying to forget?

305
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,120
Or are you just lying?

306
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,500
Are you just lying to others...

307
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,670
or just to yourself?

308
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,630
Did you confirm that young boy's crimes?

309
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,460
Did you have the right to execute him?

310
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,030
Do you think that just by pretending,
your sins would go away?

311
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,900
What a heavy sin.

312
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:50,480
How can one who has committed such a sin... meet his
daughter as though he's made a complete comeback?

313
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,500
How about it?

314
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,260
Will you have a drink?

315
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,010
Gillen?

316
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,560
Is that you, Dr. Gillen?

317
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,020
This is the police.

318
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,150
Your patient, Richard Braun, is dead.

319
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,530
Decision
