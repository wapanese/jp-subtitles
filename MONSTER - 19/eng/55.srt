1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,900
Eva Heinemann?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,930
Yeah, she was here.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,930
Even though she's fallen so far, her
personality hasn't changed at all.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,520
Actually, she might have gotten worse.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,910
Did she mention where she was staying?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,880
Yeah, she said she didn't have much cash on her...

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,570
so she was going back to her hotel to get some.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,690
I wonder how long she'll continue to think
she's a wealthy man's daughter.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,980
Which hotel?

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,810
She said it was the Hotel Staiger.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,920
I wonder if she'll really pay her tab...

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,270
staying at a third-rate hotel like that and all.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,980
Wait...

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,290
You...

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,730
Aren't you that man she was engaged to?

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,110
H-He was...

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,070
Hello, is this the police?

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,410
I... I just saw that serial killer who was...

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,120
Hey!

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,270
Have you seen my coat?

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,960
I hung it up on the coat hanger by the entrance.

22
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,470
Room 402

23
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,480
Hello?

24
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,240
There should be an Eva...

25
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,480
a woman named Eva Heinemann staying at your hotel.

26
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,120
<i>Yes, I'll connect you to her room.</i>

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,680
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

28
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay.

29
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,510
Hurry...

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Hurry!

31
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,520
<i>I'm thinking of killing someone.</i>

32
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,540
<i>Your former fianc√©e...</i>

33
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,770
<i>Eva Heinemann.</i>

34
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,360
Hurry!

35
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,780
<i>I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.</i>

36
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,210
<i>I rang her room, but she doesn't seem to be answering.</i>

37
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,080
What's her room number?

38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,880
Well I...

39
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,240
I want to send her a fax...

40
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,290
so could you please tell me her room number?

41
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,350
Please, tell me!

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,320
<i>She's staying in room 402.</i>

43
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,810
<i>Our fax number here is...</i>

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,540
402...

45
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,750
It's no use.

46
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Mr. Baul can't be reached at his
office or on his cell phone.

47
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,130
No matter how long you wait your
partner probably won't come.

48
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,490
His excuse will probably go something like this...

49
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,600
He'll probably say he became Tenma's attorney
in order to prove his innocence...

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,310
but he made a complete confession.
On top of that, he even escaped.

51
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,980
He couldn't possibly defend a client like that.

52
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,540
He'll probably step down from being Tenma's attorney.

53
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,120
Are you going to step down as well, Mr. Verdeman?

54
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,820
I have no intention of doing that.

55
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,460
But it's true that Tenma did escape.

56
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,330
Before he escaped...

57
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,920
I wish he would've trusted me, his attorney.

58
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,440
Do you trust Tenma, then?

59
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,410
Do you believe what happened in Munich?

60
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,960
Do you believe everything that Tenma has told me?

61
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,610
You...

62
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,160
Are you sure you believe everything?

63
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,880
When I heard the news that Tenma escaped...

64
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,690
it reminded me of that time.

65
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,760
The time he disappeared in Munich...

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,200
and tried to kill Johan.

67
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,930
Something is about to happen again.

68
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,960
That's why Tenma escaped.

69
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,330
Please believe in him.

70
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,540
Like you believed in your father's
innocence and became a lawyer.

71
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,080
The phone's been ringing off the hook!

72
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,760
The media's in an uproar about whether
Verdeman, the brilliant lawyer...

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,070
will continue to defend Tenma.

74
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,050
Just tell everyone that I don't have any comments.

75
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,460
B-But that won't keep the media away.

76
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,550
Then just tell them that we'll hold a press conference...

77
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,040
after we've re-examined all the facts and evidence.

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,110
Until then, don't let anyone into the office.

79
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,550
Oh, but there's already a guest here...

80
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,170
What did you say?

81
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,780
You let someone in?

82
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,220
I'm not seeing anyone today!

83
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,430
Y-Yes, I told him that but...

84
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,530
he forced his way in and said he'd wait.

85
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,530
Just who is it, anyway?

86
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,200
Oh, yes...

87
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,030
It's someone from the BKA...

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
The BKA?

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,120
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

90
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
What a wonderful song.

91
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,850
If I remember correctly, it was the theme song
of the radio station your father managed.

92
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,200
W-Who are you?

93
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,200
My name is Lunge.

94
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,740
406...

95
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,420
405...

96
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,260
404...

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Room 402.

98
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,350
That's the room.

99
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,440
Guten Tag.

100
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,760
G-Guten Tag.

101
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,880
Excuse me...

102
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,040
What happened to the guest staying in this room?

103
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,040
I came to see the guest who was staying in this room.

104
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,450
Huh?

105
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,920
I thought they had checked out already.

106
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,550
See?

107
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,790
There's no one here anymore.

108
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,820
Eva!

109
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,820
Inspector Lunge.

110
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,410
While I was investigating Tenma's
affidavit protocols and such...

111
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,720
I thoroughly examined your reports.

112
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,840
Your very detailed reports, that is.

113
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,050
I've heard stories of the legal circle's
golden boy, as well...

114
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,050
Mr. Verdeman.

115
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,800
You must've come here after receiving
news of Tenma's escape.

116
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,520
Unfortunately...

117
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,370
I don't have any information to offer you.

118
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,890
Escape, huh...

119
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,200
Actually I've been on an extended vacation lately.

120
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Perhaps this extended vacation...

121
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,080
is also like an escape.

122
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,090
Umm, I'm sorry, but I don't have time to socialize, so...

123
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,110
However, perhaps it's a habit from
my long years on the job...

124
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,920
but I just can't travel aimlessly around
the world without any cares.

125
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,530
So I came up with a theme for the trip.

126
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,130
The theme of this trip is this picture book.

127
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm really sorry.

128
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,650
I really don't have any time.

129
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,050
I'll have to ask you to leave.

130
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,280
No, let's talk for a little longer...

131
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,680
I already told you that I don't have
anything to tell you about Tenma.

132
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,680
I didn't come here regarding Tenma's case.

133
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,690
After all...

134
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,930
I only heard the news about Tenma's
escape on my way here.

135
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,990
Then why did you come here?

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,670
Like I said, because of this book.

137
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,280
I've become extremely curious about
this picture book's author.

138
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,630
However, this author had many pen names.

139
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,970
Of them, only the name klaus Poppe was German.

140
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,050
So while I was investigating it out of curiosity...

141
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,720
the name of a certain individual
acquainted with Poppe came up.

142
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
A certain individual?

143
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,020
Your father.

144
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,920
A program named "Fairy Tales of the World"
aired on your father's radio station, correct?

145
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,130
According to the records, in August of '66...

146
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,050
Poppe's "Where Am I?" aired.

147
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,310
I've also looked through your father's trial records.

148
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,150
It was the greatest post-war case involving suspected
spies and shook all of West Germany.

149
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,660
So what?

150
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,170
Your father had visited Czechoslovakia many times.

151
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,490
Since it was simply to meet with a picture book author...

152
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,690
the prosecution didn't mention any of this.

153
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,920
What are you trying to say?

154
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,730
Well, I just thought that your father...

155
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,470
may have been an old friend of this picture book author.

156
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,860
My father had many acquaintances through his work.

157
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,430
There were countless numbers of people
he met with to discuss their shows.

158
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,310
Then you're saying they weren't all that close?

159
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,020
However, when I investigated...

160
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,330
klaus Poppe would usually hold other meetings
at his editorial company-owned house...

161
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,800
or at an old farmhouse in the Czech countryside
that Poppe used as a resort.

162
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,750
However, meetings between him and your
father were held at a particular mansion.

163
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,260
A particular mansion?

164
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,700
It was called the Red Rose Mansion.

165
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,750
The mansion was never used under
the name of klaus Poppe.

166
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,220
Whenever he used this mansion, he called himself...

167
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,900
Franz Bonaparta.

168
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,560
He was a man who held an extremely powerful position.

169
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,200
In the Czechoslovakian secret police, that is.

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,310
What...

171
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,920
What are you trying to say?

172
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,370
Son of a spy!

173
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,640
Son of a traitor!

174
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,320
Son of a coward!

175
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,030
Go prove his innocence if you're pissed off!

176
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,810
If the father's dirty, so is the son!

177
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:06,780
Son of a spy!

178
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,310
All I want is to learn about the person
named Franz Bonaparta.

179
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,310
I don't know anyone by that name!

180
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,070
Your father met with the picture book author,
Klaus Poppe, at a particular mansion, correct?

181
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,100
In Czechoslovakia, in '66?

182
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,330
A picture book author and a radio station manager.

183
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,080
That's all they were!

184
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
While he called himself klaus Poppe...

185
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,090
the Red Rose Mansion was never used.

186
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,560
What are you trying to say?

187
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,640
If he held a meeting with your father
at the Red Rose Mansion...

188
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,790
that means he wasn't meeting him as klaus Poppe...

189
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,480
but as Franz Bonaparta.

190
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,710
Someone from the Czechoslovakian secret police.
with an extremely powerful position.

191
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,700
That means nothing!

192
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,670
I have no interest in whether
your father was a spy or not.

193
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,690
My father wasn't a spy!

194
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,670
Your father must have known who
Franz Bonaparta really was.

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,670
Irrelevant!

196
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:17,240
Perhaps your father was aware of what was
going on at the Red Rose Mansion?

197
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,210
No!

198
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,340
My father is innocent! He's wrong!

199
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,200
He's wrong!

200
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,390
If you wish to talk, please contact me.

201
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,820
Like I said many times before...

202
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,290
I have no interest in whether
your father was a spy or not.

203
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,570
I just want to know about the person
named Franz Bonaparta.

204
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,330
Father was...

205
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,240
My father was...

206
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,960
Mr. Verdeman, your wife is on the phone...

207
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,080
Is something wrong?

208
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
No...

209
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,910
Umm... your wife is calling from the maternity center...

210
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,350
Hello?

211
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,530
I see.

212
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,870
You're finally being discharged?

213
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,750
That's great.

214
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,570
Okay, I'll come pick you up right now.

215
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,400
Tenma!

216
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,150
Start the car!

217
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,200
C-Calm down.

218
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,320
Listen to what I...

219
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,740
Hurry up and start the car!

220
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,200
Hurry!

221
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,360
Let's talk this out.

222
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,550
First, let's calm down.

223
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,510
Let me hear what you have to say, Tenma.

224
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,480
Where is Eva?!

225
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,090
Where is Eva Heinemann?!

226
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,550
W-What are you talking about?

227
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,550
What happened to Eva Heinemann?

228
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,430
Don't play dumb!

229
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,580
I know what you guys are trying to do!

230
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,080
"You guys"?

231
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,110
Don't stop the car!

232
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,130
Face forward and keep driving!

233
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,470
I know you guys want to kill Eva!

234
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,910
kill Eva?

235
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,350
What do you mean by "you guys"?

236
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,380
Don't play dumb with me!

237
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,110
You and that man Baul are working together!

238
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,920
Baul?

239
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,920
He's the man I shot at the University of Munich library!

240
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,190
I won't let there be any more victims!

241
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,150
Answer me!

242
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,040
Where did you take Eva?!

243
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,640
Everything started when I saved Johan's life.

244
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,570
Many lives have been taken since then...

245
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,170
Countless numbers...

246
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,850
I've had enough!

247
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,520
There have been too many victims!

248
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,030
Don't stop the car!

249
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,220
Is this true?

250
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,230
I'm telling you to keep driving!

251
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,130
Is what you said true?

252
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,090
Is it true?! Can I believe you?!

253
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,520
My father...

254
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,590
was suspected of being a spy.

255
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,890
Later, it was established that he was falsely charged, but...

256
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,270
he really was a spy.

257
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,030
I believed in my father's innocence...

258
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,860
chose to become a lawyer, and studied hard.

259
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,710
But I learned about it while I was still a student.

260
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,670
The absolute proof that my father was a spy.

261
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,180
Since then...

262
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,550
Ever since then, I couldn't trust anyone.

263
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,550
Who's the "brilliant lawyer who gets all his clients off"?

264
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,770
"The legal circle's golden boy," my ass

265
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,050
This is so funny!

266
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,960
Crabbing a guy who doesn't believe in anyone!

267
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,870
Because I...

268
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,980
really am the son of a spy.

269
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,430
When I found the notebook...

270
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,490
When I found the notes he'd taken in the 60's...

271
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,790
Everything that was written in there...

272
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,640
Every time I turned a page...

273
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,480
I saw everything I'd done out of belief
in my father shatter before me.

274
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,490
Without a doubt, my father was a spy.

275
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,050
Indecipherable codes enumerated there...

276
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,420
Numerous records of communication with
the Czechoslovakian secret police...

277
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,530
The mysterious people my father
had come into contact with...

278
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,970
Like Franz Bonaparta...

279
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,830
Did he also mention the Red Rose Mansion in there?!

280
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,460
How do you know about that?

281
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,860
I see now...

282
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,570
That man named Baul probably approached
you because he wanted those notes.

283
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,580
Where are they now?

284
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,690
At my house.

285
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,020
How terrible...

286
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,550
There's no doubt about it.

287
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,450
He was after your father's notes.

288
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,170
It's a letter addressed to you.

289
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,650
He probably predicted that you'd come here.

290
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,450
"Help me, Kenzo."

291
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,460
"Please hurry and come to the Red Rose Mansion."

292
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,730
Does that mean that Eva's safe?

293
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,570
No...

294
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,380
It isn't her handwriting.

295
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,360
He's playing around...

296
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,910
He's toying with me!

297
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,360
It's safe.

298
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,950
It's in the pile of old records.

299
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,350
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

300
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,440
This is the notebook.

301
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,240
Please take it with you.

302
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,280
But...

303
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,490
if it falls into the wrong hands, your father will be...

304
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,970
I don't need it anymore.

305
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,560
Fr√ºhling Maternity and Gynecology Clinic

306
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,530
Can I believe in you?

307
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,020
Everything you told me...

308
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,770
What you're trying to do...

309
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,440
I can't do anything for you right now, but...

310
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,470
can I believe in you, Dr. Tenma?

311
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,930
You shouldn't trust people...

312
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,670
who wave things like this around too much...

313
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,430
I want to believe...

314
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

315
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

316
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

317
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

318
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,530
The Never-ending Journey
