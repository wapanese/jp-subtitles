1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,590
My answer will be the same,
no matter how many times you come!

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,660
Mr. Boltzmann would never have
relations with a prostitute!

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,820
Nor did he murder one.
He's not involved!

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,360
Please leave. I'll have to take action
if you're persistent.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,070
Take action? Are you going to
sue for defamation?

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,400
No... You're his secretary.
You wouldn't do that.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,570
It would be bad if
Mr. Boltzmann's name

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,980
came up in this case,
wouldn't it?

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,550
Is that a threat?

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,990
Not at all.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,950
I just want to know the truth.

12
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,180
He's pretty tough.

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,600
Left Behind

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,750
It's what I'd expect of a big politician's
number one secretary.

15
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,940
No, I just need to pressure him
a little more.

16
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,980
But do you think that
a big-shot like Boltzmann

17
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,390
would lay his hands on that prostitute?

18
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,020
That victim was no ordinary prostitute.

19
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,520
The names of countless politicians
and businessmen

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,290
were traced back to her.

21
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,330
But there's only one person
who saw her at the hotel

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,890
that Boltzmann was staying at.

23
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,300
We can't be sure that there is
a relationship between the two

24
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,770
based on such
questionable information...

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,370
Has her client list been deciphered?

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,980
Well... The code is enumerated
in the floppy, so we haven't really...

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,910
I'll do it. Give me the floppy.

28
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,080
Oh... but Inspector, aren't you
busy with other cases?

29
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,660
It doesn't matter. Give it to me.

30
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,560
Umm...

31
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,390
I wanted to ask you earlier, but...

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,170
What is it?

33
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,760
When... do you sleep?

34
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,470
What does that have to do
with the case?

35
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,110
Huh?

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,710
It's an irrational question.

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,780
When are you going to
talk to him about that?

38
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,780
It doesn't matter when we tell him.

39
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,180
He never listens to us.

40
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,910
But you should do it
as soon as possible.

41
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,050
Hold on, you're talking too loud.

42
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,350
He's in his room.

43
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,430
Oh my, how unusual.

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,180
German Federal Criminal Police Office [BKA]

45
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,840
Lunge!

46
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,140
It seems that you're still investigating
Councilman Boltzmann's link

47
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,340
with the prostitute murder.

48
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,210
Is there a problem with that?

49
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,210
Yes, there's a big problem!

50
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm being pressured by officials
from the Ministry of the Interior!

51
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,950
Take care of it like
you usually do, Chief.

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,690
No. I can't back you up in this case.

53
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,790
Do something about it.

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
H-Hey, Lunge!

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,730
What'll happen if this investigation
was a mistake?!

56
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,400
You've had a wonderful career
until now.

57
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,340
There's no need to be
eager for success now.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,900
Or is it something else?

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,740
Are you doing this...
in the name of justice?!

60
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,540
Eagerness for success... justice...
I have no interest in either.

61
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,120
A woman was killed.
I'm only interested in the culprit.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,530
Lunge!

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,470
Umm, Inspector Lunge,
you have a visitor.

64
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,740
I did it.

65
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,770
Huh?

66
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,010
I deciphered the client list.

67
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,970
I can convert all the names.

68
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,350
O-Oh... Umm...
That woman is here again...

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
That woman...
Eva Heinemann...

70
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,310
Oh! Y-You can't come in here...

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,960
When will Tenma be arrested!

72
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,060
It seems like you've been
drinking quite a bit.

73
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,760
How could I not be drinking?!

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,330
I've already solved Dr. Tenma's case.

75
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,370
He says that it is all the work
of a man called Johan,

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,840
but Johan is one of his personalities.

77
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,980
If you think about it that way,
everything about

78
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,450
that seemingly illogical case
is explained logically.

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,180
All that's left is for the police
to capture him.

80
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,260
Does that mean that your job is over
once you've got a warrant?

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,960
There are a lot of things I'd like
to talk to him about in person.

82
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,160
Dr. Tenma...
he's a very interesting person.

83
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,740
But... the cases I need to tend to
are piling up on my desk.

84
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,140
Excuse me.

85
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,610
You sure are persistent!

86
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,620
I keep telling you, that night
Mr. Boltzmann had an alibi...

87
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,820
An alibi? Of course.
That was the work of a pro.

88
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,850
Then what? Are you trying to say that

89
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,360
Mr. Boltzmann hired
a professional hit man?

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,590
How stupid!

91
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,200
I've deciphered the client list
of the woman who was killed.

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,170
The councilman's name was listed...

93
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,040
Even if his name was listed...
What would his motive be for murder?

94
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,410
Well... come to think if it,
that's about it.

95
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,380
I don't have time for this! Leave!

96
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,920
It really wasn't
satisfactory proof, was it?

97
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Do you know of a publishing company
called Shellhourne?

98
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,330
They're a publishing company
that stays in business

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,230
by frequently publishing tell-all books
about famous people.

100
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,200
That company plays dirty.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,530
They hire deceitful women
to form relationships

102
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,240
with famous people and have them
write about their arrangements...

103
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,150
You should be careful...

104
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,430
It was like a checkmate!

105
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,100
That secretary couldn't even respond.

106
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm really surprised...

107
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,240
He never rests his mind or body
for an instant...

108
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,510
He really is superhuman.

109
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,540
Superhuman, huh?
He really might not be human.

110
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,690
Oh!

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,520
Ah, I see! It's checkmate
if I move there.

112
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,830
Hey, don't interrupt our game...
Oh!

113
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,930
Don't waste your minds
on silly games.

114
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,960
The publishing company's president

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,270
simply confessed after
I startled him a little.

116
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,910
Get the report.

117
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,940
- Y-Yes!
- Y-Yes!

118
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,940
WHAT... do you think this is?

119
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,950
It's that prostitute's notebook.

120
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,520
Her secret meetings
with a certain man

121
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,020
are written here in detail...

122
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,810
I don't know the man's name.

123
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,650
Aside from the fact that
his initial is "B"...

124
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,990
Also, Shellhourne Publishing

125
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,160
had a contract with the woman
to publish her life story.

126
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh... yes, have you ever
been in contact

127
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,470
with a man named Yanker?

128
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,040
He's a professional hitman...

129
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,510
Leave...

130
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,440
Leave already!

131
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,150
We're leaving...

132
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,230
Father, you didn't notice that
I was pregnant, did you?

133
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,840
Are you going to the father
of your baby?

134
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm going with her.

135
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,900
You didn't notice that I was
having an affair, did you?

136
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,820
Yes?

137
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,220
Detective, it's me,
Boltzmann's secretary, Mintag.

138
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,030
I'll tell you everything. Please come!

139
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,320
Ah, I see. Thank you...

140
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,470
I'm going out.

141
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,900
Tell me the details later.

142
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,550
I-Inspector!

143
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,880
What is this ruckus?

144
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,580
The secretary... he killed himself!

145
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,180
"Mr. Boltzmann is innocent..."

146
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,150
This is the message
the secretary left behind.

147
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,830
Lunge... I'm passing this case over
to Inspector Kaminski.

148
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,200
The Reichner Park and
President Galland Murder, as well...

149
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,330
Then what do I have?

150
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,180
I no longer... have anything for you.

151
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,540
It seems that you are
all that I have now...

152
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,290
U-Umm, Inspector...
You have a visitor...

153
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,560
It's that woman again...
Eva Heinemann...

154
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,190
Let her in!

155
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,680
I had a great time, Eva.

156
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,280
When... can we meet again?

157
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,850
Well... I'll come after
my next business trip...

158
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,520
Aww, I don't want to return you
to your wife.

159
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,390
At any rate, I'll give you a call.

160
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,570
You won't come back again.

161
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,540
I placed a handkerchief drenched with
perfume in your bag...

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,380
What a superficial man...

163
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,540
You were looking at me again,
weren't you?

164
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,750
Are you disturbed by the fact that

165
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,590
I'm always coming back
with a different man?

166
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,230
No...

167
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,590
You'd like to be invited as well,
wouldn't you?

168
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,050
N-No way...

169
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,430
How disgusting.

170
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,460
No way!

171
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,560
I just...

172
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,930
Oh my, it's become beautiful.

173
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,400
I love this garden...

174
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,510
I forget about the things I hate
when I gaze at my garden...

175
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,810
I'm glad you like it!

176
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm going to plant mimosas here.

177
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
And over there, I'm going to make
a rose arch.

178
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,080
It'll be beautiful
once summer comes...

179
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,420
Someone like you
might be able to do it.

180
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,660
Huh?

181
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,760
Do you have the confidence
to make me happy?

182
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,440
Dad?

183
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
Hey, are you listening, Dad?

184
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,600
Hey, Dad!

185
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,870
Huh?

186
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,310
Oh... How is my cooking today?

187
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,510
You haven't heard anything I said...

188
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,910
That's why Mom went off
with another man...

189
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,050
Oh! Sorry.

190
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,650
No... It's all right...

191
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,130
Actually... Colletta...

192
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,700
If... I had... umm... s-someone I liked...

193
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,070
Oh, no... n-nothing at all!

194
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
My cooking really isn't
any good today, either.

195
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,750
It's not bad.

196
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,720
I see, not bad, huh?

197
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,310
Sorry.

198
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,240
You're a gardener,
but I'm having you do this...

199
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,420
No, this is nothing.

200
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,850
My handyman kept asking
for time off and then quit.

201
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,430
I'll do anything I can...

202
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,590
How about dinner tonight?

203
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,670
Oh... well, o-okay...

204
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,480
Why are you nervous?

205
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,050
W-Well... I'm not used to
expensive restaurants like this...

206
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,950
If you want to be a man worthy of me,

207
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,930
you must be confident
wherever you go.

208
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,650
Just like when you're
working in the garden.

209
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,760
A-Ah... Th-That's right.

210
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,360
I really have confidence in myself
when I'm in the garden.

211
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,630
I feel so happy when I complete
a garden that I envisioned...

212
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,370
I like it best when I'm in the garden.

213
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,780
People who like gardens
can't be bad people.

214
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,600
You said that you liked that garden...

215
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,310
Are you trying to say that
I'm a good person?

216
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,840
Yes, of course.

217
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,960
But...

218
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,260
What is it?

219
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,690
No, umm... You... seem sad...

220
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,590
You, too.

221
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,900
Huh?

222
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,930
You're lonely, too, aren't you?

223
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,530
Oh... Sorry. My daughter's
probably worried...

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,570
Kenzo...

225
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,900
Kenzo...

226
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,050
It's almost Christmas, isn't it, Colletta?

227
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,950
Santa doesn't have to
push himself this year.

228
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,220
Hey, you don't have to
worry about that...

229
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,550
It's just lonely having a Christmas party
with just the two of us.

230
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,520
We don't have to do anything!

231
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,560
No, it may not be
just the two of us this year.

232
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,830
Huh?

233
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,350
That man ruined my life.

234
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,940
S-Sorry... I was just
cleaning up a bit...

235
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,010
His name is Kenzo Tenma...

236
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,780
He's my ex-fiancÃ©...

237
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,420
Y-You're drinking again,
at this time of day?

238
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,390
How can I not drink?!

239
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,060
I just went to the BKA

240
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,220
to see an investigator
by the name of Lunge!

241
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,730
That man sent me away.
How useless!

242
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,890
When are they going
to arrest Tenma?!

243
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,770
BKA? Arrest?

244
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,880
He killed my father and ran away!

245
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,950
He says that he was framed,
but who is he trying to fool?!

246
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,210
I was promised a good future as

247
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,010
the daughter of the director
of a large hospital!

248
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,010
My three failed marriages
are also his fault!

249
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,580
How can he say that
it's Johan's doing?!

250
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,280
Take a look at this!

251
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,750
The kid with my father is Johan!

252
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,420
Do you think that this child
could kill my father?!

253
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,850
Is that what Tenma says?

254
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,620
It's a stupid excuse!

255
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,630
Did you show this photo to the police?

256
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,500
Of course not!

257
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,210
It might be important evidence!

258
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,870
Tenma's the one who did it!

259
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,580
Tenma has a split personality,
as Investigator Lunge says!

260
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,220
Then... why do you still have
his pictures framed like this...?

261
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,690
In the depths of your heart,
you think that Tenma is innocent...

262
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,790
And you still... have feelings for him...

263
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,460
You watch too many soap operas.

264
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,870
Huh?

265
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,370
This man was the only man I've met
who was worthy of me.

266
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,170
He was an elite brain surgeon
who was called a genius...

267
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,240
His position was good enough.

268
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,710
Best of all, this man never defied me!

269
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,420
He listened to my every request!
Yes, yes, yes!

270
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,620
He was a man who always said "yes"!

271
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,030
This man was supposed to make me
the happiest person in the world!

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,970
Could I... take his place?

273
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,540
I'll build gardens for you
for my entire life

274
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,440
if it would set your heart at ease...

275
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Don't get optimistic just because
I slept with you once!

276
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,790
You were just something
to pass the time!

277
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,090
I was just teasing you.

278
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,690
You got carried away!

279
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,990
You fool. Who do you think you are?!

280
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,130
You... You really are a lonely person...

281
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,330
You too!

282
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,540
I'm having a party at my house
with my daughter on Christmas day.

283
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,540
You can come if you like.

284
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,190
This food is amazing!

285
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,090
Did you make all of this?

286
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,930
Yeah. I can't guarantee it'll taste good.

287
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,770
But isn't this a little too much
for the two of us?

288
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,130
Y-You think so?

289
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,470
Oh!

290
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,040
Mom's coming home!

291
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,210
That's it! Right?! Isn't it?!

292
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,780
Colletta...

293
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,650
Mom came home!

294
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,590
Ch-Charlotte...

295
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,630
Mom...

296
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,330
I'm sorry, dear... I'm sorry...

297
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,020
Who cares about mimosas?!
Who cares about roses?!

298
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,780
Who cares about beautiful gardens?!

299
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,460
Who cares about the residence
of the ex-director of a large hospital?!

300
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,830
Let everything burn!

301
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,260
Everything!

302
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,250
Welcome.

303
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,880
It seems like you finally want to
listen to me, Inspector Lunge.

304
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,220
I just happened to have
my hands free.

305
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,960
This is the only man for me.

306
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,560
If I don't kill him...

307
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,790
I can never be happy!

308
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,450
Be My Baby
