1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,010
This is a bus ticket.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,300
I bought it for you.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:04,720
Tenma...

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,810
There are still ways to prove that you're innocent.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,820
I'll help you.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm not chasing after Johan to clear my name.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,200
Thank you, Rudy.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,280
Tenma, you aren't going to...

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,160
Oh, that's right. I never looked down on you.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,040
You looked like an interesting fellow,
but I never had a chance to meet you.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,210
But now we're finally friends, aren't we?

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,680
You saw me cheat that time, though.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,430
I was cheating, too.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,480
Tenma...

15
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,900
Did you see that sign just now?

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,990
No, sorry. I was dealing with this map.

17
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,080
Is it this way? Or maybe...?

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,900
Which way do you hold it?

19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,650
Where did you get that map?

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,160
Don't be like that. I got it
when we got the rental car.

21
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,660
That's what I thought.

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
It must have been when I
was in the men's room.

23
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,500
It's no use. I can't read the
fine print on this map at my age.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,670
You'll have to deal with it since you forgot
your reading glasses at the airport.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,930
Wippenhausen, Ampertshausen, Gartelshausen.

26
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,680
What's with those names? It sounds like you're
chewing on your tongue when you say them.

27
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,810
How interesting! I wonder if German people think
the same thing when they hear English.

28
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,690
Anyway, what's the next intersection?

29
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,200
Look, there are some people.

30
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,950
Let's ask for directions.

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,580
No, let's just keep on going.

32
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,930
But they're hitch-hikers.

33
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,420
Why don't we give them a ride?

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,380
What are we going to do if we get into
some kind of trouble because of that?

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,010
But look...

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,550
He's got that child with him, though.

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,010
I feel sorry for them.

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,930
Why don't we give them a ride?

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,900
That's great, isn't it, Tenma?
They stopped for us.

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,990
Yeah.

41
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,130
Journey to Freiham

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,980
Guten tag. Bitte...

43
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,240
We don't speak German.
Do you speak English?

44
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,200
Oh, you're English.

45
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,620
We want to go to Freiham.
Could you give us a ride?

46
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,740
Give them the map.

47
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,080
Okay.

48
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,330
Where is it?

49
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,580
Where's the place you want to go?

50
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,290
Um, well...

51
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,360
We're about here, so you'd
have to go south for a while.

52
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,870
That's the same direction we're going in.

53
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,590
Well, get in.

54
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
Danke-schoen.

55
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,160
Bayern State
(Germany)

56
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,670
How do you know each other?

57
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,560
You're definitely not father and son.

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,610
You're Asian, and he's German.

59
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,070
Y-Yes...

60
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,320
He's the child of a good friend.

61
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,530
Just from looking at you, I can tell
that your some kind of specialist.

62
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,540
I can tell by your speech and demeanor.

63
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,670
Honey, please stop.

64
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,630
You're being rude.

65
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,260
Forgive him. He has some weird habits.

66
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,340
He used to be a policeman.

67
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,890
What did they say?

68
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,480
It seems he used to be with the police.

69
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,730
Let's get off, Tenma.

70
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,920
No.

71
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:22,820
So... your husband must be retired and enjoying
some travel with his wife, right?

72
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,790
Yes, he's always been a slave to his work.

73
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,170
When he was working, we couldn't even
think of doing something like this.

74
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry for bothering you when you're
finally alone with your wife.

75
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,670
If we're in the way, we can leave.

76
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,320
No.

77
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,800
Ever since we got the rental car from the airport,
we haven't been able to figure out the map.

78
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,310
We haven't been able to
order food very well, either.

79
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,060
I'd be much more confident if
we had an interpreter with us.

80
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,650
Really.

81
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,150
What should we do, Honey?

82
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,570
You can't do anything about that.

83
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,110
We have to go to the next gas station.

84
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,200
There's a car.

85
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,040
Hey, stop! Stop!

86
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,350
What's wrong?

87
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,460
We're out of gas.

88
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,760
In a place like this?
I don't think I can help you.

89
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,430
I can only let two of you on.

90
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,930
Mr. Jones.

91
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,930
Don't worry. Just get on
and get out of here.

92
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,180
But...

93
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,850
There's no reason for you to
stick around here with us.

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,450
When I get to the next gas station,
I'll tell them what happened.

95
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,950
Right. We'd be grateful if you did that.

96
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,050
That was pretty lucky.

97
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,220
We found another ride so quickly.

98
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,770
Yeah.

99
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,410
Take us to the next gas station, please.

100
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,660
There aren't any around here.

101
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,230
It's getting late.

102
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:46,240
If he told them, the people at the gas station
would come for us, wouldn't they?

103
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,700
Yeah.

104
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
That man...

105
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,540
He might have just left us.

106
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,870
Honey... No, he didn't. I thought
he was a nice man.

107
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,540
I'm not so sure.

108
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,020
The sky is so beautiful.

109
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,190
If you're talking about the sunset,
I've already heard it many times.

110
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,230
I've already seen it many times.

111
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,860
It's not the sun setting.
The sun's already gone down.

112
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,530
Look!

113
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,370
Look at the color of the
sky after the sun has set.

114
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,960
I wonder if Robert is also watching it.

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,210
Watching this sky...

116
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,710
Huh?

117
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,220
That's...

118
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Honey, take a look.

119
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,060
Someone's coming.

120
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,480
See? I told you.

121
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,990
I knew he'd come!

122
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,790
A nearby farmer gave us
some gasoline and a lamp.

123
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,130
See, Honey?

124
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,800
It's delicious.

125
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,010
Don't you think so, Honey?

126
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,880
Huh? Yeah.

127
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,600
Thanks to your translating the menu, we've
had such a wonderful meal. Right?

128
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,230
Especially that wine.

129
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,270
Forster Ungeheuer. It's wine
from the Pfalz area.

130
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,690
What's that "Leber" dish?

131
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,070
LeberknÃ¶del.

132
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,530
That's it. It was really good!

133
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,330
If you weren't with us, we'd have probably passed
by the good German restaurants without noticing.

134
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,170
No, thank you for treating us to a meal.

135
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,000
Dieter, how would you like another ice cream?

136
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,300
No. He's had enough.

137
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,930
I think he's a criminal.

138
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm talking about the man I just
read about that killed his wife.

139
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,020
What do you think.?

140
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,150
I wouldn't know.

141
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,280
When I was a police officer, I had my
fair share of accomplishments.

142
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,490
Stop it already.

143
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,040
Don't tell your old stories here.

144
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,420
When I looked at someone, I could always
figure out if he was a criminal and whether
or not he was a bad person.

145
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,340
I-I see.

146
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,510
Stop it.

147
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,720
Did you drink too much wine?

148
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,930
Yet the longer I did it, the
worse I became at it.

149
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,730
Good people and bad people,
the guilty and the innocent...

150
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,440
I don't have a sense for any of it anymore.

151
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,070
I wasn't that great a police officer.

152
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,040
I might have had too much wine.

153
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,550
What did you call this wine?

154
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,180
Ungeheuer.

155
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,260
It was good.

156
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,170
How cute.

157
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,590
Wouldn't it be nice if Dieter made a lot
of friends in a new place like this?

158
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,300
Yeah.

159
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,970
Everyone is happy during their childhood.

160
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,060
It makes me nostalgic.

161
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,310
Yeah.

162
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,530
Oh, my.

163
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,120
This should be the place.

164
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,490
What is it?

165
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,000
Here you go, Honey.

166
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,750
Sorry, but we'll have to
ask you to take a detour.

167
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,550
Go ahead.

168
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,270
This is the place.

169
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,690
The police?

170
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,710
We'll be back soon.

171
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,540
Please wait in the car for us.

172
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,170
Wh-What are we going to do, Tenma?

173
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,400
Tenma, let's run.

174
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,920
What's wrong?

175
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,050
It looks like there's a car in the patrol car's parking
space again. It looks like a foreigner.

176
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,390
It can't be helped...

177
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,900
What should we do?

178
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,610
Um, this seems to be the opposite direction
from Freiham, the place we want to go.

179
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,070
I know.

180
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,780
Sorry, this won't take much time.

181
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,080
I made some plans at Steinbach Castle.

182
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,910
Honey...

183
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,580
Steinbach Castle?

184
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,000
There's something I want to see there.

185
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,490
Are you all right?

186
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,950
Yes. Thank you.

187
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,670
Our son wrote to us about this place.

188
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,590
He said that the view from
this castle was wonderful.

189
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,350
He mentioned wanting to show it to us.

190
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,310
Your son lives here?

191
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,020
We're on our way to see him,

192
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,020
but we keep on making stops.

193
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,290
He was admiring this scenery.

194
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Our son...

195
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,600
Our son killed someone.

196
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,020
We came here to see him, face to face.

197
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,330
We'll be leaving now. Thank you very much.

198
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,750
No, we thank you from the
bottom of our hearts.

199
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,040
Thank you. Take care.

200
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,880
He was such a nice man.

201
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,840
Yeah.

202
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,930
He's currently being pursued
as a murder suspect.

203
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,640
That can't be. He...

204
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,650
No, it's true.

205
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,400
I saw his wanted picture.

206
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,730
But...

207
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,620
The truth is that when I said "hello" to the officer who
arrested Robert today, his picture was at the station.

208
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,620
I can't believe it.

209
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,450
Such a nice person?

210
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,790
Yeah.

211
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,710
Before I saw his picture, I doubted him,

212
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,090
and when I met him, I confirmed it.

213
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,210
He's innocent.

214
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,300
He cannot be a bad person.

215
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,050
Yes.

216
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,850
Our son, Robert, killed someone.

217
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,440
I was so ashamed that I couldn't even
face my friends and family.

218
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,320
When I thought that, I quit the force.

219
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,660
I want to confirm one last thing
with my own eyes, though.

220
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,580
Robert had committed a crime,
but he's not a bad person.

221
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,420
Come...

222
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,420
Let's go see Robert.

223
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,580
Happy Holidays
