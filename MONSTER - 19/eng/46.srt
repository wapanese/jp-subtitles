2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,920
This case is becoming complicated!

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,740
So, anything new?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,640
The police say they'll hold a press conference at 3.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,220
I'm heading to the Prague police station right now.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,480
What a case! I've never had such a case before.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,270
Have you been looking for something in here all night?

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,030
Well... yes.

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,410
Thanks to you, I found the article I was looking for.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,680
Ok, that's good.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,600
Umm... please wait a minute!

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,420
I'm kind of busy right now.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,920
About the Mr. X in this article...

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,360
Mr. X?

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:46,960
Yes.

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,190
This article from three years ago...

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,910
was trying to expose the truth behind the
former Czechoslovakian secret police.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,080
Oh, yeah...

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,910
After the Wall came down... the German right
wing's influence suddenly increased, and...

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,180
the former Czechoslovakian secret
police established a crime syndicate.

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,880
I wrote that article.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,240
Really?

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,610
Would it be possible to meet this member
of the former secret police...

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,900
Mr. X, who was interviewed in this article?

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,800
You said you're a special correspondent from Japan?

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,150
What are you trying to learn by meeting Mr. X?

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,160
Umm... well...

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,320
I was thinking of investigating... the circumstances
surrounding the abductions and confinements...

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,170
that happened in this country during the Cold War.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,880
They're scary people, you know?

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,190
Back then, I risked my life to interview them.

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,090
Even now, they're still scary.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,600
Because of that, it created quite an uproar.

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,490
Don't you know about Detective Suk's case?

35
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,800
Some reporter you are!

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,590
You said you can't speak Czech...

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,430
but if you're investigating the
remnants of the secret police...

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,000
you should have already heard the news!

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Here. We published it in our paper.

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,930
You can read German, right?

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,830
Suk, a young detective from the Prague police...

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
shot and killed two detectives of a special investigative
team dispatched from police headquarters...

43
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,530
and is on the run.

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,830
The murder of Inspector Zeman turned out to be the clue
needed to prove the dark connection between...

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,160
the former secret police and the current Czech police.

46
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,160
Moreover, Suk was the one who revealed the relationship
between the former secret police...

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,310
and the Prague police chief
and the other two policemen.

48
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,170
The three of them were conveniently poisoned,
and Suk distinguished himself in the matter.

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,040
However, the special investigative team was marking Suk.

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,670
Detective Suk killed the two policemen
who were marking him.

51
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,160
The promising elite detective...

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,910
Once he distinguished himself...

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,450
What are you muttering about?

54
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,360
He killed three of his superiors with poison.

55
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,980
Whiskey bonbons...

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,390
A muscle relaxant...

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,880
Johan!

58
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,920
Contact

59
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,700
Excuse me...

60
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,170
Is Jan Suk's mother here?

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
Are you with the police?

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,090
No.

63
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,740
She's in room 409.

64
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,910
Thank you.

65
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,870
Umm...

66
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,650
I think you're wasting your time.

67
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,340
You're Jan Suk's mother, aren't you

68
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,140
Jan?

69
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,870
Jan, you came.

70
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,900
No... I'm...

71
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,880
Thank you for coming, Jan.

72
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,590
Come closer and let me see your face, Jan.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,230
You shouldn't get up.

74
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,620
Jan...

75
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,120
Did your son call or write you?

76
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:57,890
Listen. My neighbor, katherina, hasn't
given me back my stuffed animal.

77
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,390
Maria gave me that precious stuffed animal.

78
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,890
Your son...

79
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,070
Your son is innocent.

80
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,920
Well, I'll be leaving now.

81
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,570
You...

82
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,400
Jan.

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,630
Were you playing there again?

84
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,880
You always play detective there, right?

85
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,550
Where would that be?

86
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,130
You may think it's your secret place, but I know.

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,390
The deserted building on Brno Street.

88
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,510
So you knew.

89
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,280
Yes, I knew.

90
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
See you.

91
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,010
Be careful.

92
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,280
Be back in time for dinner, okay?

93
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,450
Once upon a time...

94
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,720
there was a monster without a name.

95
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,010
The monster wanted a name so
badly that he couldn't stand it.

96
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,880
<i>Once upon a time, there was a monster without a name.</i>

97
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,540
I brought you some food and a newspaper.

98
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,710
You became a star overnight.

99
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,230
Do you think anybody noticed
that I sent my mom the tape...

100
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,360
and the research data from the safety deposit box?

101
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,080
No idea.

102
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,930
It should be safer with her than with us.

103
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,720
But the events of your case are
very similar to the other case...

104
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,720
The other case?

105
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,210
Ten years ago, in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany...

106
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,440
a hospital's director and two other doctors
all died from poisoned candy.

107
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,200
The suspect was a promising young surgeon.

108
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,920
What happened to that guy?

109
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,120
He's still on the run, trying to prove his innocence.

110
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,090
You're better off than that guy.

111
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,010
At least you have me for a witness.

112
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,260
On the stairs up to my flat, you saw...

113
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,160
Yeah...

114
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,450
A beautiful blond girl.

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,390
If that girl's the real murderer, we have to find her!

116
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,610
Suk...

117
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,150
Otherwise, I'll be running for the rest of my life!

118
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,300
Why did this have to happen to me?!

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,230
What have I done?!

120
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,210
Calm down!

121
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,750
Am I supposed to disappear like this?

122
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,720
Calm down!

123
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,920
Get a grip on yourself.

124
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,730
Didn't I tell you to have faith in yourself?

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,700
In the end, you're the only one you can trust.

126
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,030
All right, that's good.

127
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,440
Okay, let's eat.

128
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,690
In this room...

129
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,720
when I was little I used to pretend that I was a cop.

130
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,970
That's the inspector's desk.

131
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,730
I'm surprised it's still here.

132
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,710
I'd sit here and give orders...

133
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,730
just like on the TV drama I watched.

134
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,810
Gentlemen...

135
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,600
it's going to be a tough case this time.

136
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,490
I want everyone to give it everything they've got.

137
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,440
We must not let evil prevail.

138
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,210
In the name of justice.

139
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,980
That sure takes me back...

140
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,930
Suk!

141
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,400
Suk!

142
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Suk!

143
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,990
We're surrounded!

144
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,230
Hang in there, Suk!

145
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,840
It's dangerous by the window, so
let's get you behind the desk.

146
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,520
I'm a goner...

147
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,590
Just hang in there!

148
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,960
Who fired that shot?

149
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,710
The Czechoslovakian secret police?!

150
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,070
Where are they shooting from?

151
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,410
You're going to be fine, Suk.

152
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,420
They didn't hit anything vital.

153
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,790
I'm going to borrow your gun.

154
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,300
Tape!

155
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,680
Suk!

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,340
Suk...

157
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,770
Hang on, I'm coming!

158
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,620
They're missing his vital organs on purpose.

159
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,130
Tape!

160
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,360
The tape isn't here!

161
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,530
They can see us?!

162
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,860
Mr. Grimmer!

163
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm here!

164
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm right here, Suk!

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm coming to help you now.

166
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,710
It hurts!

167
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,270
It really hurts!

168
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,040
It's okay...

169
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,530
I'm done for...

170
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,050
Be quiet!

171
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,740
Mr. Grimmer...

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,510
Don't talk!

173
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,510
Y-You should...

174
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,520
You should save yourself...

175
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,130
Don't be stupid!

176
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,060
From upstairs?

177
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,710
<i>it's about time we finish them off.</i>

178
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,310
<i>No, let's wait a little longer.</i>

179
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,520
Czech...

180
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,950
What are they saying?

181
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,900
<i>Right!</i>

182
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,450
<i>Circle around to the right!</i>

183
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,890
<i>We need another guy over here!</i>

184
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,210
<i>Tape!</i>

185
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,210
It hurts!

186
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,720
<i>Let's just bust in now!</i>

187
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,910
<i>I'm getting hungry.</i>

188
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,710
<i>I haven't eaten lunch yet.</i>

189
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,580
<i>Me neither!</i>

190
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,220
<i>Let's just break through the floor.</i>

191
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't wanna die...

192
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,580
<i>Let's see, what should we eat?</i>

193
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,740
<i>Hey, pass me the tools.</i>

194
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,000
<i>I found a good Italian restaurant.</i>

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>Anyone got a smoke?!</i>

196
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,080
<i>I'm not in the mood for Italian.</i>

197
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,670
<i>Hey, this drill's not working!</i>

198
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,800
<i>This cigarette sucks... I can't smoke this!</i>

199
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,770
<i>What, Chinese food again?!</i>

200
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,010
<i>Get me a bigger tool, something like that!</i>

201
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,650
<i>It's not Chinese, it's Vietnamese!</i>

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,670
"Who are you!?"

203
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,810
Can you speak German?

204
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,930
Only a little...

205
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,290
What are you doing here?

206
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,270
W-Who are you?

207
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,300
Answer the question! What are you doing here?

208
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,480
I-It's already over.

209
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,450
Everyone's already entered the building...

210
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,820
to kill that young cop and the skinny guy.

211
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,560
Am I too late?!

212
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,140
It's too quiet...

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,290
"Monster..."

214
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,130
It's you...

215
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,870
The Magnificent Steiner...

216
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,940
Mr. Grimmer...

217
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,230
The Magnificent Steiner...

218
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,040
has done it again.

219
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,880
Mr. Grimmer!

220
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,400
Hey, Doctor, you finally made it.

221
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,410
Please save him.

222
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,090
He's a good boy.

223
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,370
I beg of you, please save him.

224
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,050
There are a lot of other patients, too.

225
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,120
What on earth is this?!

226
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,120
It's probably me.

227
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,330
The other me...

228
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,100
living inside me.

229
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,080
I came from 511 kinderheim.

230
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,900
The Magnificent Steiner!

231
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,250
Hey kids, are you sitting in front of the TV?!

232
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,640
I wonder what adventure awaits us today?

233
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,550
When you're in trouble, just call my name!

234
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,830
No matter when or where, I'll be there to save you!

235
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,360
I'm the Invincible Steiner!

236
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,800
I won't forgive the evildoers, for my name is...

237
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,310
The Magnificent Steiner?

238
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,080
I was always glued to the TV...

239
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,830
whenever "The Magnificent Steiner" came on.

240
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,380
The main character was a cowardly young man.

241
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,190
He was always cornered by bad guys at crucial moments...

242
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:56,680
but when he woke up, the bad guys had already
been beaten by the Magnificent Steiner.

243
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,350
Without realizing it, he had become
the Magnificent Steiner...

244
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,380
Whenever he was in trouble, Steiner would appear...

245
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,470
and beat up all the bad guys.

246
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,850
The only thing I remember from my childhood...

247
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,890
is that cartoon on TV, "The Magnificent Steiner."

248
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,870
All my other memories were completely erased...

249
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,050
by 511 kinderheim.

250
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,800
You probably couldn't care less, since
it doesn't concern you at all.

251
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,720
All right, I've given him all the emergency care I can.

252
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,140
What about Suk?

253
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,780
Will he survive?

254
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,780
All the bullets passed through his body...

255
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,090
but the arteries from under his armpit
to his upper arm are critically wounded.

256
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,710
Anyway, I've stopped the bleeding for now.

257
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,180
This is all I can do.

258
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,710
Get him to a hospital quickly so he can be treated.

259
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,970
Mr. Grimmer...

260
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,890
you said that this doesn't concern me.

261
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,050
But it does.

262
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,000
511 kinderheim does.

263
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,510
Now, let's call an ambulance!

264
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
There are three over here.

265
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,230
We need another gurney over here! Quickly!

266
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,760
What's the status of the wounded?

267
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,830
They need to be looked at soon, but...

268
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,050
But what?!

269
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,560
They've all been given emergency care.

270
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,760
And it was very precisely done.

271
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,760
Precise emergency care?

272
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,240
It's on the news.

273
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,760
What are they saying?

274
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,150
It's all in Czech.

275
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,540
I only understood which hospital they took the patients to.

276
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,120
Jakub Zima Memorial Hospital.

277
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,670
I think the cops will probably arrest Suk...

278
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,660
But he's...

279
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,120
He's innocent, right?

280
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,860
Yeah.

281
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,730
If I go and testify...

282
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,840
Dr. Tenma, why did you...

283
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,310
More importantly, about what you said earlier...

284
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,960
Would you mind telling me about 511 kinderheim?

285
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,500
The truth is, I don't really remember anything.

286
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,040
I just can't remember...

287
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,140
except for little fragments here and there.

288
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,220
The dark hallway...

289
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,610
The cracks in the ceiling...

290
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,990
The sound of a door creaking...

291
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,560
A musty bed...

292
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:09,010
My memories only became clear some
time after I had left the place.

293
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,800
Someone said it was when I was fourteen...

294
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,880
Now that I think back on it, I was put in a weird school...

295
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,050
where they gave me another name.

296
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,810
Wolfgang Grimmer.

297
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,330
My house was in an artificial neighborhood.

298
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,770
We were not allowed to leave the area.

299
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,180
Someone pretended to be my father...

300
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,530
Someone pretended to be my mother...

301
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,720
I was made to study many different languages...

302
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,560
Russian, English, Spanish, French...

303
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,990
Spy training?

304
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,160
Of all the things I was made to learn...

305
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,660
what do you think was the toughest?

306
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,170
How to smile.

307
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,350
All right, we need to get to Suk's hospital.

308
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,850
Mr. Grimmer, I saw it on the news...

309
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,350
You're wanted as a prime suspect.

310
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,390
I'm the only one who can prove Suk's innocence.

311
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:43,440
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

312
00:22:44,530 --> 00:23:00,840
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

313
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:25,920
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

314
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:34,400
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

315
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,570
The Door to Nightmares
