1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,720
Where's the crime scene?

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,140
Under our feet.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,350
Were there any victims?

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,690
Three men.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,400
I want the perimeter around the
scene thoroughly inspected.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,280
We were told to wait until Agent Kratkiy arrived.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,530
I'll take responsibility.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,240
Find suspects immediately. Move it!

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,530
Who should we detain?

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,490
Anyone suspicious.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
But...

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,580
Can't you take a new detective's order?

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,000
Get going!

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,460
I'm Detective Suk from the Prague police.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,470
This was pretty horrible.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,810
Inspector Zeman.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,900
He was violently beaten to death.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,150
He doesn't even have facial features anymore.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,580
If his police badge hadn't fallen nearby, we probably
wouldn't have been able to identify him.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,040
The bodies of two men are over there.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,500
We don't know who they are yet.

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,840
One was shot in the head.

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,880
The other one, just like the inspector, was beaten to death.

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,850
Preserve the scene.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,810
Detective Suk.

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,690
So who are the suspicious people?

27
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,620
You've got to be kidding me!

28
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,200
They think I'm a novice and make fun of me.

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,580
The guys in uniform won't listen to my orders.

30
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,090
Well, the orders are coming from a very unreliable guy.

31
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,710
Yeah.

32
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,840
What did you say?!

33
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,130
You puked at the crime scene, didn't you?

34
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,590
Who'd want to take orders from such a lousy detective?

35
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,560
Just because you like police dramas doesn't
mean you have to be a policeman.

36
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,520
You've been frivolous even back when we were in college.

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,110
What do you know?

38
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,610
You don't know how well Inspector Zeman treated me.

39
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:03,580
He taught me, a novice who didn't know
left from right, how to be a detective.

40
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,630
I respected him from the bottom of my heart.

41
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,380
I promise!

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,130
I'll get revenge for Inspector Zeman.

43
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,140
If I have to find the killer by myself, I'll do it!

44
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,600
We have to get up for work early
tomorrow, so if you'll excuse us.

45
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,860
C'mon. Hang out with me a little longer.

46
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,610
While you're working in your safe
little jobs, I'm fighting for justice!

47
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,740
C'mon! Drink up!

48
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,120
Hey, quit it!

49
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,050
He worked every day for the sake of justice
and he ended up getting killed.

50
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,220
I can't take it.

51
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,430
It was all for nothing.

52
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,140
Huh?

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,070
What is it?

54
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,940
That girl was at the supermarket.

55
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,360
Huh?

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,620
I saw her twice at the supermarket
when I was on night-duty.

57
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,580
I wanted to talk to her, but I couldn't...

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,170
and now she's here!

59
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,420
Hey, you better stop now.

60
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,010
You don't have a chance with that babe.

61
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,630
Umm...

62
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,550
H-Hey, there.

63
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,930
Do you remember me?

64
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,140
I see.

65
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,520
But I recognize you.

66
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm Jan Suk. I'm not a stalker or anything.

67
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I might not look like it but I'm a detective.

68
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,370
Don't get scared because I'm a detective.

69
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,870
This is my free time, my private life.

70
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,670
I think this is a waste of time, but...

71
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,210
let's give him a hand.

72
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,840
Excuse us for butting in.

73
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,380
He's a bit depressed today, so could you talk to him a bit?

74
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,850
His boss, whom he respected, had an incident.

75
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,220
He's been doing nothing but sobbing like a baby.

76
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,810
I-I wasn't crying!

77
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,270
There aren't people as good as him.

78
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,570
I wanted to be like Inspector Zeman.

79
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,700
That's why I won't let the killer get away.

80
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,700
I'll catch him for sure!

81
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,330
Sorry, I've just been talking about myself.

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,330
Don't worry about it. You have to do your best and
catch that criminal for the inspector's sake, too.

83
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,680
I've talked about myself a lot, but I
haven I heard anything about you.

84
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,890
What's your name?

85
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,560
I don't know my...

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,600
real name.

87
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,980
Wh-What's with that?

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,860
Ah, wait a sec.

89
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,940
I can tell who you are.

90
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,690
I <i>am</i> a detective, so you can leave this to me.

91
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,070
Your name is...

92
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,780
I don't know myself, so there's no way you could know.

93
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,910
What I know about myself is...

94
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,630
...Cedok bridge and three frogs.

95
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,130
That's it.

96
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,300
Wait a sec.

97
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,180
When can I see you again?

98
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,800
I knew it wouldn't work out

99
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,010
Just give up on that daydream.

100
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,520
We've established the identities of the two men who were found dead along with Inspector Zeman.

101
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,620
Prauge Police

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
One of them is Cemistr Malat.

103
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,030
The other one is Yakov Sughachek.

104
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,320
They were part of the former Czechoslovakian secret police.

105
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,330
After communism collapsed, they were involved
in illegal underground activities.

106
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,370
The analysis of the blood at the crime
scene detected blood from

107
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,300
Inspector Zeman, Malat, Suchachek, and someone else.

108
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,300
The blood-type was AB, RH+.

109
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,800
From the amount of blood, we assume
that he had some serious wounds.

110
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,720
We need a description of him as soon as possible.

111
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,640
Detective Suk!

112
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,140
Suk!

113
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,770
Yes!

114
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,650
Why are you spacing out like that?

115
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,570
We've lost such a fine officer and we're all working hard on this case.

116
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,780
What's with your attitude?

117
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,780
I-I'm sorry.

118
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Anyways, as I was saying,

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,210
the witnesses say that there was a man walking around the vicinity at the time of the crime.

120
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,630
He was tall and thin.

121
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,710
He carried around a large bag which
made him look like a traveler.

122
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,590
We have to use all our manpower
to determine who this man is.

123
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,100
That girl...

124
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,150
I guess she'll never come back.

125
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,440
Mr. Detective.

126
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,280
Did you find the criminal you told me about?

127
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,160
N-No. It's pathetic.

128
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,290
While I'm doing this, the criminal is wandering the streets.

129
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,750
Just the other day, Inspector Zeman was burning
the midnight oil on a murder case of his own.

130
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,630
What kind of case was it?

131
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,320
It's a case where an old man who ran an unlicensed nursery home

132
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
and the woman who helped run it were killed.

133
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,850
He was interviewing the first person at
the crime scene the very next morning.

134
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,600
Who was he?

135
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,890
Who was the first person at the scene?

136
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's see. It was a kind-looking young man.

137
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,400
He was tall, thin and carried a large sack.

138
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,950
Huh?

139
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,530
Thin...

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,990
tall...

141
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,490
with a large bag!

142
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,950
Could it be...?

143
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,370
Do you know where that man is?

144
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,870
I-I think I do.

145
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,000
Maybe if I check at the station...

146
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,000
Hello?

147
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,010
Good luck, Mr. Detective.

148
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,720
Hello.

149
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,220
Hey, wait!

150
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,720
Hello?

151
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,620
Cedok Bridge...

152
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,910
Three frogs.

153
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,370
The Cedok Bridge is in the former town of Michalska.

154
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,790
Three frogs?

155
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,490
This is it!

156
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,580
If I come here, I can meet that girl.

157
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
He checked out?

158
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,570
When?!

159
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,990
Let's see. Mr. Grimmer, Grimmer...

160
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,580
He checked out two days ago in the morning.

161
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,870
I'm 100% sure.

162
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,800
The person who killed Inspector Zeman was the
person who was in this room, Mr. Grimmer.

163
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,380
Damn it! Why didn't I realize it sooner?

164
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,310
Inspector Zeman, I'll catch him!

165
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,060
I promise you.

166
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,650
S-Suk, why are you here?

167
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,650
Why are you here, Head Detective Patera?

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,740
I see. I'm amazed you made it this far by yourself.

169
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:54,590
I thought I was going to be able to take the credit for
the Inspector Zeman case, but you were here first.

170
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,260
Well, it's still quite an achievement. You did well.

171
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,720
Or that's what I'd like to say.
I'd like you to keep this a secret.

172
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,430
Huh?

173
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,770
Why?

174
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,640
It's our duty to arrest Grimmer as soon as possible-

175
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,610
There's more to this case than you think.

176
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,200
You don't know about the top secret investigation
that Inspector Zeman was involved in, do you?

177
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,910
Inspector Zeman was on a secret investigation?

178
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,170
He was to root out the former Czechoslovakian secret
police who were hiding in the Prague police station.

179
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,050
Former Czechoslovakian secret police?

180
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,050
The two men that were killed with him were with
the former Czechoslovakian secret police, right?

181
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,140
Very few people besides me and the
Chief of Police know about this.

182
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,390
If you get too involved in this, you might be killed, too.

183
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,070
Keep quiet about this one. Got it?

184
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,320
Wh-What should I do?

185
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,460
Let's see... Grimmer might show up at this hotel again.

186
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,290
Be on the lookout.

187
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,870
Y-Yes, sir.

188
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,760
By the way Suk, do you have a girlfriend now?

189
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,590
Huh?

190
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,260
You were spacing out while sitting
at your desk during the meeting.

191
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,890
N-No, she's not really my girlfriend.

192
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,270
She just shows up at a bar I go to from time to time.

193
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,390
She's totally hot isn't she?

194
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,650
W-Well, kind of...

195
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,650
Hey, introduce me to her. What bar?

196
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,150
Introduce you? I don't think I could do that...

197
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,580
You just said that she's not your girlfriend.

198
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,910
Th-That's true, but...

199
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Suk's not coming today.

200
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Wow! You really are quite extraordinary!

201
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,010
Who are you?

202
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,890
I'm Suk's senior at work. My name's Patera.

203
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,940
He said there was an incredibly
beautiful woman at this bar.

204
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,650
He's on a stake-out tonight, so he can't come.

205
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,980
Want to have a drink with me?

206
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,900
Huh?

207
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,200
Hey, wait.

208
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,530
Spending a little time with me won't hurt.

209
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,880
Hey, Suk!

210
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,050
Hey there, Detective Janacek. Good morning.

211
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,930
I heard from Mr. Patera that the
girl you found is a total babe.

212
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,100
Mr. Patera, did you go to that bar?

213
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,020
Yeah.

214
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,310
D-Don't tell me you put the moves on her?

215
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,230
Hey, Suk! Don't get so worked up.

216
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,780
But the rumors are that Detective
Patera has his way with women.

217
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,950
Don't worry. She dumped me.

218
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,790
If she doesn't fall for Mr. Patera
she must be pretty hard to get.

219
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,000
Th-That's not it.

220
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:26,260
I-I was just talking to her. Just that much was fun.

221
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,430
What are you grumbling about?

222
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,680
Section Chief Farobek wants you
to go to Inspector Zeman's room.

223
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,260
O-Okay.

224
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,310
Oh, yeah.

225
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,690
I got a gift. How would you like a whiskey bon-bon?

226
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,150
I don't need one.

227
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,820
How about you, Suk?

228
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
No, I'm fine.

229
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,440
Hey, Suk!

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,700
Yes?

231
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,830
You have to keep things about the tall, thin man a secret.

232
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:56,910
Yes, sir.

233
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,630
We've pretty much cleaned out Inspector Zeman's desk.

234
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,630
All that's left are his personal belongings.

235
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,630
Organize it and take it to his wife.

236
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,180
Yes, sir.

237
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,730
Huh?

238
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,740
A gym locker key.

239
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,580
This is horrible.

240
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
There's a bunch of sweaty shirts and towels.

241
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,720
Huh?

242
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,510
Documents?

243
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,760
What's this?

244
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,020
These are files that contain information on everyone
at the station, including their personal behavior.

245
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,730
Even my profile is in here.

246
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,700
<i>You don't know about the secret investigation
that Zeman was involved in, do you?</i>

247
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:23,420
<i>He was to root out the former Czechoslovakia!! secret
police who were hiding in the Prague police station.</i>

248
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,130
Huh?

249
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,050
What's the meaning of this?

250
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,930
How come only Head Detective Patera and
Detective Janacek don't have files?

251
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,990
This is not a normal amount of money.

252
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,700
Y-Yes, Chief.

253
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,210
So Suk, what can you deduce from this?

254
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,010
Yes. Inspector Zeman was conducting an
investigation of the people at the station.

255
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,600
Th-The results showed that Head Detective
Patera and Detective Janacek...

256
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,680
were members of the former Czechoslovakian secret police.

257
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,270
Then I'm...

258
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,270
Then I'm sad to say...

259
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,780
I believe he took money to conceal that fact.

260
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,410
That is a big problem.

261
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,460
It makes me sad to say it.

262
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,670
Detective Suk.

263
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,670
Yes?

264
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,380
You must keep this a secret for the time being.

265
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,800
Yes, sir.

266
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,470
I will contact you later.

267
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,180
Return to your regular duties.

268
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,640
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,360
Oh, man.

270
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,860
This has become more troublesome than I wanted it to be.

271
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,820
It was a mistake to underestimate a greenhorn like Suk.

272
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,540
We haven't even tidied up the matter of Zeman's
killer and now we have a bigger problem.

273
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,290
At this point, should we go for money just like Zeman did?

274
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,090
If that doesn't work out, we only have one option left.

275
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:45,270
At any rate, I want to avoid any problems that may
come from me knowing your past work's history.

276
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,100
I hope we can keep this all under wraps.

277
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,070
Man, I want a drink.

278
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,190
I have some whiskey bon-bons if you'd like.

279
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,280
Gee.

280
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,610
Don't say that.

281
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,030
I got them from that extraordinary beauty.

282
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,240
Here, take one.

283
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,300
What's wrong? You look really depressed.

284
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,010
I can't trust anyone anymore.

285
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:27,980
Why?

286
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,270
You can talk to me if you want.

287
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,480
I believed in him.

288
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,070
I never thought Inspector Zeman would do such a thing.

289
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,200
What happened?

290
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,950
I believed in him.

291
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,300
The only thing that brings peace to my heart right now...

292
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,440
is you.

293
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:43,130
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

294
00:22:44,220 --> 00:23:00,530
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

295
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:25,610
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

296
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,090
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>
