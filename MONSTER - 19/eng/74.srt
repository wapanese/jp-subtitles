1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,800
When Zeus told them of their past, the human race remembered how to place seeds and till fields.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,890
Karl, your pronunciation is wrong again.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,390
I'm sorry. I'm trying very hard.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,440
But you've gotten so much better.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,610
When you first came here, I thought
you were a horrible student.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,240
Y-Yeah.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,660
How is he?

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,870
That Japanese doctor?

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,960
I heard that he's traveling the world.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,960
I see.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,460
I'd like to see him again some day.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,670
Me, too.

13
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,090
The Real Monster

14
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,580
You started working?

15
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,160
That's great.

16
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,750
What are you doing?

17
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,250
I'm an interior coordinator.

18
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,920
I see. I would suspect that you have a keen eye for home decoration.

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,470
I said interior but it's a little different.

20
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,810
I'm a kitchen coordinator.

21
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,060
Oh.

22
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,350
I know you'll laugh.

23
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,560
Someone like me, who's never set foot
in a kitchen before, has this job.

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,110
I might ask you to help me with my kitchen.

25
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,780
That'd be fine.

26
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,070
But a kitchen you design would probably be expensive.

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,200
A little.

28
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,210
You haven't been drinking, have you?

29
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,290
No, not even a single drop.

30
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,340
That's great. Take it one step at a time.

31
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,010
No matter how much you must rush, there is always tomorrow.

32
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,810
That is what happiness is, right?

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,720
Tired of hearing that?

34
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,310
Happiness, huh?

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
He said he was happy just knowing
I was waiting at the station for him.

36
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,860
Are you talking about Martin?

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,830
People are so strange.

38
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,590
Sadness fades away and only happy memories remain.

39
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,550
People were built pretty conveniently.

40
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,340
That is how we can continue living.

41
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,570
Let me introduce you. This is Mr. Verdemann.

42
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,360
He is the one who cleared all the charges against you, Mr. Grimmer.

43
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,820
I found out all I could about you.

44
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,750
You were at 511 Kinderheim.

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,420
You traveled around the world as an East German
intelligence agent who pretended to be a journalist.

46
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,380
After that, you continued your investigation on human rights violations

47
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,340
as a freelance journalist

48
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,840
You had a lot of material on that subject in your large bag.

49
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,350
But the thing I could never find out was your real name.

50
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,940
Wolfgang Grimmer.

51
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,820
Not only his name.

52
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,110
He left without telling us anything.

53
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,660
Inspector Lunge.

54
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,950
I'm not an inspector anymore, Detective Suk.

55
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,370
I heard that you became a professor at the police academy.

56
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,630
I've been able to have conversations with my daughter.

57
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,380
Not real conversations, I guess. E-mail.

58
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,050
Even though we're parent and child,
we've never really talked.

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,350
We've lived our lives without knowing one another.

60
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,570
How much can people convey to others in just one lifetime?

61
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,320
We have so much we want to say
while drinking a cold beer.

62
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,620
You're going back to Dusseldorf?

63
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,960
Yeah. The company I work for is there.

64
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,010
I see. Are you okay with that?

65
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,630
There are a lot of things there that...

66
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,930
"You can't ran away."

67
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,510
"You have to face reality and keep moving forward."

68
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,140
Right?

69
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,560
Yeah.

70
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,270
Could you dispose of this for me?

71
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,230
Yeah.

72
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,820
Bye.

73
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,660
Ah, take care.

74
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,280
If anything happens, tell me about it.

75
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,290
Dr. Gillen and I are willing to help you at any time.

76
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,580
So is Dieter and him as well.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Send all of them my regards.

78
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,010
Will do.

79
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,640
Dr. Tenma's hearing continues.

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,520
The truth is still unknown.

81
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,320
Inspector Lunge's testimony begins.

82
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,490
Is this the worst serial murder case in all of European history?

83
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,080
Dr. Tenma proven completely innocent.

84
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,210
Law authorities express their apologies to Dr. Tenma.

85
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,880
The motive behind the incidents is still unknown.

86
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,510
What is he true identity of the mysterious
young man behind the whole incident?

87
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,260
The Medical College of Munster University
offers Dr. Tenma a position as a professor.

88
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,970
Dr. Tenma positively declines.

89
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,560
Dr. Tenma joins the MSF.

90
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,860
The articles gradually get smaller and smaller.

91
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,620
People are built conveniently, huh?

92
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Dieter, you've gotten bigger while I haven't been looking.

93
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,790
You've gotten slimier when I wasn't looking, Mr. Heckel.

94
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,800
You still have a big mouth.

95
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,050
Sorry. I'm going to soccer practice,
so don't follow me any more.

96
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,720
W-Wait up.

97
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,720
Is Tenma back?

98
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:35,190
He's doing that "Doctors Without Borders" crap to look cool, but it won't make him any money.

99
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,610
I can't get a hold of him.

100
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,610
What if he's home?

101
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,240
After I think about the expenses and the work
I put into the job he asked me to do,

102
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,990
the payment doesn't seem like it was nearly enough.

103
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,620
Tenma asked you to do a job?

104
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,040
He said I just had to find someone.

105
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,540
But I worked so hard.

106
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,500
I had to steal some secret police documents.
What happens if they catch me?

107
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,760
Hey! Give Tenma this request form.

108
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,310
Tell him that if he won't pay, I'll have him work as a black market doctor again.

109
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,950
Southern France

110
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,460
Welcome back. We haven't seen you here for a while.

111
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,170
I'm going to a foreign nation.

112
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,340
Please enjoy these with everyone else.

113
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,050
Why thank you.

114
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,770
What nice weather.

115
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,850
The leaves are photosynthesing.

116
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,190
Life.

117
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,940
Countless genes.

118
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,280
Do you know of Mendel?

119
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,450
Yes, he discovered the Law of Inheritance.

120
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,870
I went to the same college as he did.

121
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,330
Brno University.

122
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,880
In a large city, south east of the Czech Republic, in the Moravian region.

123
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,210
It's a nice place.

124
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,250
I'd love to see it.

125
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,380
Thank you.

126
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,180
Come back anytime.

127
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,800
I always have a good time with you.

128
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,470
You're welcome.

129
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,600
I feel great today.

130
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,560
I feel like I can talk about anything.

131
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,030
Even scary stories.

132
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,540
You have something you want to ask me, don't you?

133
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,970
You're...

134
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,390
the twins' mother, aren't you?

135
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,490
Yes.

136
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,450
I loved him.

137
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,710
And that man killed him.

138
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,460
It was that man's experiment.

139
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,340
I'll never forgive him.

140
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,440
Even if I die, the children growing inside of me...

141
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,280
will definitely punish that man.

142
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,530
My hand...

143
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,620
Don't let go of my hand.

144
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,040
My hand...

145
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,550
Who is the real monster?

146
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,560
Those kids are alive, aren't they?

147
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,860
Yes. They're doing well.

148
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,960
I remembered.

149
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,380
Remembered what?

150
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,930
I might never remember again.

151
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,760
So I have to say it now.

152
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,770
I gave them names.

153
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,480
Their names are...

154
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,410
Come in.

155
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,350
You really live up to your reputation.

156
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,430
You're late by ten minutes.

157
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm sorry, Professor Kronecker.

158
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,030
Whatever. You know why I've called you here, don't you?

159
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,450
It concerns your graduation thesis.

160
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,450
Come forward.

161
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,080
Yes, sir.

162
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I know a lot has happened to you.

163
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,970
It must be hard coming back to school after taking a break.

164
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,980
But, that's no excuse.

165
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,980
That's right.

166
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,230
Anyways, your thesis...

167
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,990
is the best.

168
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,580
It's the best paper I've ever seen from any one of my students.

169
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,330
Good work.

170
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,090
I think very highly of you.

171
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,340
Th-Thank you.

172
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,600
What's your goal?

173
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,060
To be a lawyer.

174
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,560
I pray that you will save many people.

175
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,820
You may leave.

176
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,070
Yes, sir.

177
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,820
However...

178
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,830
The court will not allow you to be late,

179
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,250
Ms. Nina Fortner.

180
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,670
Yes, sir.

181
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Yes, hello?

182
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,840
Dieter.

183
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,810
Will you graduate? I'll be with you even if you don't.

184
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,060
I look forward to that.

185
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,440
You'll have to console me the next time we see each other.

186
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,060
I can tell by your voice that you made it.

187
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,610
Good job! Congratulations!

188
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,360
Thank you. Although it's going to
be even tougher from now on.

189
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,490
Let's celebrate. Come home.

190
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,870
I can't come straight home. I have work
and I made plans with friends.

191
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,540
What are you saying?

192
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,460
Tenma's coming home.

193
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,050
I just got a phone call.

194
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,720
Although he's got to leave again right away with the MSF.

195
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,340
When?

196
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,600
He's going to be home tomorrow.
So you have to come soon.

197
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,980
Nina. About tomorrow's plans...

198
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,730
Sorry, I have to go.

199
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,900
Tenma... I'm going to see Tenma!

200
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,590
Bayern State-Run Police Hospital

201
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,000
Good afternoon.

202
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,410
Thanks for your hard work.

203
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,030
You've been asleep all this time, huh?

204
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,990
Can you hear me?

205
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,750
I talked to your mother.

206
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,210
She loves you.

207
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,210
I heard your real name.

208
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,550
You have a name.

209
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,040
There's something I want you to hear, Dr. Tenma.

210
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,250
That time... when that monster appeared in front of me.

211
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,970
Stop!

212
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Don't touch them!

213
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,230
No!

214
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,730
Don't come any closer!

215
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,520
This is an experiment.

216
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,910
Which one will I leave and which one will I take?

217
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,160
This is an experiment.

218
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,620
So, which one will I take?

219
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,630
Don't let go.

220
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,390
Don't let go.

221
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,890
Mom.

222
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,940
Don't let go of my hand.

223
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,940
This one.

224
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,740
No...

225
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,910
This one.

226
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,160
No!

227
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,290
Was my mother trying to save me?

228
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,920
Or did she get my sister and I mixed up?

229
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,420
Which one of us?

230
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,800
Which one of us was the unwanted one?

231
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,210
I should get going.

232
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:43,010
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

233
00:22:44,100 --> 00:23:00,410
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

234
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,490
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

235
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:33,970
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>
