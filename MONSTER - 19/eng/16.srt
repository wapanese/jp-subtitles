1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,750
Help me!

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,030
If you don't hurry, my boy will die!

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,520
I overheard what they were saying.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,470
Tomorrow, they'll start a fire.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,390
They'll burn down the Turkish quarter.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,660
Help me!

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,800
If you don't hurry, my town... my
boy... they'll all be burned!

8
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,310
Wolf's Confession

9
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,080
Hey, where are you going, brat?

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,550
There's no point in having an antique rug
like that unless you know its value.

11
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,720
Don't glare at me like that. I'm an adult.

12
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,990
You thief!

13
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,010
Geez. Do what you want.

14
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,370
See if I feed you when I get rich!

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,540
Don't you dare tell anyone about this!

16
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,430
I'll never be friends with a thief.

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,380
Never!

18
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm so hungry...

19
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,640
Be a good boy and don't cry.

20
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,270
Mama is going to be home soon.

21
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,560
Doesn't that baby have a mama?

22
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,500
Yeah. You shouldn't be walking around here
alone, either. Go home to your own mama.

23
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,990
Don't tell me you don't have a mama...

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,750
I'm so sorry... I've said something horrible.

25
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,960
Don't worry about it. Tenma takes care of me.

26
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,170
Tenma?

27
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,630
Don't hold back. Eat as much as you'd like.

28
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,720
It's not the best food, but please eat.

29
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,890
So you were waiting for Tenma to come home...

30
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,150
Just like that kid...

31
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,940
Where did his mama go?

32
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,110
She was caught by some bad guys.

33
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,440
Bad guys?

34
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,610
She's in real trouble.

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,490
She and the Asian guy who tried to help
her were separated right before my eyes.

36
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,410
An Asian?

37
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,120
You said that Tenma was Japanese, didn't you?

38
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,420
But it couldn't be him.

39
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,630
I'm going to see for myself. Where is this place?

40
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,680
My customer was one of the extremists.

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,020
After the job was done, I left the room,

42
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,520
but I forgot my scarf, so I went back for it.

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,570
That man was talking on the phone.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,320
I ran away to let the people in the
town know about the plan,

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,370
but I was captured, and I ended up here.

46
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,890
My boy is still small. If there were a
fire, he wouldn't be able to escape!

47
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,460
Who is it?

48
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,710
Professor Geidlitz wanted me to send you some fruit.

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,180
Thank you.

50
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,390
I also have a message from the professor.

51
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,250
General Wolf will be here soon.

52
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,180
The man who was in the photo with my brother...

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,770
Yes. He is the person who knows Johan the best.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,160
The professor told me that he knows
more about him than even you do.

55
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,160
You can't die yet.

56
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,750
His Excellency Wolf still has to see you.

57
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,610
I have to show him how skillfully I captured you.

58
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,760
Wolf?

59
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,550
Call him "His Excellency!"

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,190
Look for General Wolf. He was the
first to spot Johan's talents.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,730
It'll be a dream to receive
compliments from His Excellency!

62
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,240
Excuse me.

63
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,120
The group for tomorrow night's arson of the Turkish
quarter has arrived. Do you wish to change any plans?

64
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,620
Everything will go as planned.

65
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,210
Tomorrow night, I will dine under a crimson sky.

66
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,130
If the timing is off a little, my wonderful
dinner will go to waste.

67
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,630
Tell them they'll be punished if it doesn't go as planned.

68
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,300
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,930
Johan will not sit above you.

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,850
You couldn't make him lead you.

71
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,710
He won't buy into your ideas of racial superiority.

72
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,280
Johan sneers at all of humanity.

73
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,150
Silence!

74
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,210
We don't see much of your type in here.

75
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,610
Give this guy my usual.

76
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,400
You got it.

77
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,470
That's pretty impressive.

78
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,160
He's going to turn out to be a bad one.

79
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,130
That tasted so bad! Do they drink that all the time?

80
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,180
Tenma's jacket?

81
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,730
Tenma...

82
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,940
Where are you?

83
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,700
Tenma?

84
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,370
Either way, calm down.

85
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,210
I want to help you, but I'm not in a
situation where I can do anything.

86
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,250
When I escape, though, I'll tell everyone in the town.

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,340
Really?

88
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,630
What is the name of the street you live on?

89
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,260
Calvin Street.

90
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,340
Calvin Street, right?

91
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,860
What's your name?

92
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,930
Ayse.

93
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,390
Ayse, don't worry. I'll save your boy!

94
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,600
I'll help you out of here, too.

95
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,900
So just hang on until then. Okay?

96
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,570
Thank you.

97
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,240
What is your name?

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,660
Nina. Let's meet when I come to get you out of here.

99
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:45,410
Nina... Only bad things have happened
to me since I've come to Germany.

100
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,780
I've finally met a nice person.

101
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,840
We're friends, aren't we?

102
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,260
Tell me, what's your boy's name?

103
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,510
Ayse...

104
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,640
Ayse...

105
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,430
Ayse!

106
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,230
Ayse!

107
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,570
Ayse...

108
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,140
Is that man Tenma?

109
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,730
Yes. I caught him.

110
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,940
Umm, where's His Excellency Wolf?

111
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,280
He's waiting in a different location.

112
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,150
We're going to take him with us.

113
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,410
This is my accomplishment. I was going to kill
him after I showed him to His Excellency.

114
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,970
What should we do with the kid?

115
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,710
Huh?

116
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,710
He said he was looking for Tenma.

117
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, do you know him?

118
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,960
N-No, I don't.

119
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,760
I've never met him before.

120
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,090
Let him go.

121
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,560
You can't take such a dirty little kid to His Excellency.

122
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Get rid of him.

123
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't!

124
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,770
He's really getting on my nerves.

125
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,980
Kill him now so that he shuts up.

126
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,940
Yes, sir.

127
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,740
Don't!

128
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,920
H-He was my henchman.

129
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,180
Doctor Tenma, please forgive the mistreatment.

130
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,100
You are General Wolf's special guest.

131
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,720
Ayse.

132
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:30,000
If you don't hurry, my town... my
boy... they'll all be burned!

133
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,370
We're friends, aren't we?

134
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,450
That's right, Ayse. We're... friends.

135
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,380
What's going on here?

136
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,660
Professor Geidlitz.

137
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,670
They're all dead.

138
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,140
Soon we'll be arriving at the mansion
where General Wolf is waiting for us.

139
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,270
Is Nina there too?

140
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,180
Yes, she is. Don't worry.

141
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,690
She's a special guest, just like you.

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,730
What about a Turkish lady?

143
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,900
I don't know.

144
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,780
We aren't told anything more
than what we need to know.

145
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,870
We have to get to the town or Calvin
Street will burn to the ground.

146
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,790
If we don't let the people there know, the lady
who gave me a meal and the baby will die!

147
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,420
I'm sorry, but we have orders to take you with us.

148
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,720
Stop the car!

149
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,260
Tenma!

150
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,680
Can you make it to the 
Turkish quarter by yourself?

151
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,790
I'll join up with you later, but
I have to go with these men.

152
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,480
But...

153
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,110
Get a grip! You're a boy, aren't you?

154
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,400
If you go, you can save
the people of Calvin Street.

155
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,400
Hurry up and go!

156
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,360
Okay.

157
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,280
If you hitch a ride, you can
make it in thirty minutes.

158
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,140
I'm sorry for having acted so
violently. Please continue.

159
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,300
I'd betrayed the trust you showed me
when you let me keep my gun,

160
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,130
but you wouldn't have stopped unless
I did something like that.

161
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:06,350
Not at all... General Wolf will be pleased that you
know that guns aren't just mere accessories.

162
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,200
Please, this way.

163
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,200
Nina's in this mansion, isn't she? Let me see her.

164
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,580
First, we'll take you to see General
Wolf and Professor Geidlitz.

165
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,790
I'd like to see that she's safe, first.

166
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,000
Geidlitz is dead.

167
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,880
Not just Geidlitz, though.

168
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,260
All his men were killed, too.

169
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,100
We've disposed of the bodies.

170
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,350
Where's Nina?

171
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,850
When we arrived with General Wolf, she wasn't here.

172
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,310
You're Doctor Tenma, aren't you?

173
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,950
W-Who are you?

174
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,740
You probably wouldn't recognize
me even if you saw my face.

175
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,630
Thank you for coming. I am Wolf.

176
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,050
But... you look completely different from the
person in the photo from ten years ago.

177
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,010
Fear.

178
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,100
It was fear.

179
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,560
Can't you go any faster?

180
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,980
What are you talking about? We're going 200 kph!

181
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,590
200 kph?! Can't you see that the meter is broken?

182
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,410
We won't make it in time!

183
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,870
A person's name is a mysterious thing.

184
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,630
People who know me know that I am Wolf,

185
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:07,430
but as for the people who don't know
me, I have to tell them that I am Wolf.

186
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,600
But where's the proof that I am Wolf?

187
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,690
You were the first one to find Johan, right?

188
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,240
Yes, it was twelve years ago.

189
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,730
You sent him to 511 Kinderheim in Berlin...
to make him into an East German soldier.

190
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,410
No, it was done to raise him as a leader.

191
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,580
Yes, to make him into a man of talent who
could support a collapsing country.

192
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:43,050
Now you're trying to make him into the
next Hitler, to unite the extremists.

193
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,100
I'm only using them because it's convenient.

194
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,330
The other members of the group are trying
to make him into a new Hitler,

195
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,900
but I think that's a stupid idea.

196
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,660
Even Hitler only went so far,

197
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,580
but Johan would...

198
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,710
That's right... I gave him the name "Johan."

199
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:25,720
We found them walking near the
Czech border and took them in.

200
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,220
They had evaded the strict security at that border.

201
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,560
Due to malnutrition and cold, they
were on the verge of death.

202
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,610
They lost consciousness just after we found them.

203
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,280
If we hadn't discovered them, they
probably would have died...

204
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,080
The same way you saved his life.

205
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,920
When he came to his senses, I asked him,

206
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,650
"How are you feeling?"

207
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,330
This is how he answered me:

208
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,180
"You will soon know how I feel."

209
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,560
There's no proof that I am Wolf.

210
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,110
All the people I've known have disappeared
from this world, one after another.

211
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:33,530
My wife and children, my siblings and relatives,
my henchmen and friends... they've all died.

212
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,260
They were all killed by Johan.

213
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:48,010
The only way I can prove that I'm Wolf is through
the great sum of money I kept when
I escaped from East Germany.

214
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,140
People believe that I am Wolf,
but no one really knows me.

215
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,280
You understand now. This is the
meaning behind that word...

216
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,310
"Solitude."

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,320
Take a look at this.

218
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,160
"I'll be waiting at the ruins of the Hilden
& Engels warehouse in Romberg."

219
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,240
Johan was here this morning.

220
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,080
He killed Geidlitz and his men.

221
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,960
Yet another person who knew me is dead.

222
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,550
Nina must have seen this message and gone there.

223
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,220
I want you to kill him.

224
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,760
What? Is that true?

225
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,480
It is! We have to go tell everyone at Calvin Street.

226
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,240
Amazing! I'm finally blessed by Lady Luck.

227
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,750
I'll use the fire to steal the rug!

228
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,330
You fire-cloaked thief!

229
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,640
Idiot. Don't say it so loud.

230
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,250
We'll be in for it if anyone hears that.

231
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,710
Let go of me!

232
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,320
Not just the people of the town...

233
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,010
Let go...

234
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,090
If the extremists hear that, we'll be dead!

235
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,470
Let go!

236
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,180
Especially those skinheads with swastika tattoos...

237
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,390
I told you to let go!

238
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,700
So there wasn't a Turkish woman here?

239
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,990
She was dead on the third floor.

240
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,910
Johan did not kill her.

241
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,450
It was done by one of Professor Geidlitz's men.

242
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,290
Do you think he'll be able to kill Johan?

243
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,630
I don't know,

244
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,510
but it might not be too late for him.

245
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,200
What... is this?

246
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,520
Reunion
