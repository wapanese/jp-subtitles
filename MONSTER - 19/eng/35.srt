Munich
(Germany)

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,460
Thank you very much. We look
forward to your cooperation.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,050
No... We should be thanking you.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,260
I would really enjoy a round of
golf with you guys next time.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,810
No, no, if that happens, please go easy on us.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,730
We look forward to your cooperation.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,890
Oh, thank you.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,440
Thank you!

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,480
Thank you.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,020
"Thank you," huh?

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,610
Words lose their meaning when they use them.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,030
Ah, hello, hello.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,990
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,160
Our business talk went on longer than we expected.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,910
I'm Iwai, from the Munich branch of
the Kadofuku Commercial Company.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,750
I'm Lunge, from the BKA.

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,670
Please, do take one of these...

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,050
Thank you.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,760
A thank you and a bow...

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,140
You're even more polite than me.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,470
One coffee,

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,140
and another one for him also.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,520
About that person, Yamamoto,
that the police wanted to see...

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,570
He's currently on a business trip to the Czech Republic.

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,940
He is scheduled to return tomorrow.

26
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,900
He seems to be very busy.

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,780
Do you know Mr. Schubert of the great financial combine?

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,910
Ever since he came out of retirement
and resumed his economic activities,

29
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:30,710
all of the industries in Germany that he worked with and
other affiliated companies are paying attention to him.

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,800
All of the Japanese firms are getting
involved with Mr. Schubert as well.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,630
Why does he laugh?

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,810
Anyways, Yamamoto cannot help you today, but...

33
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,310
He and I both know Mr. Kenzo Tenma equally well.

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
I see.

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,940
But I am really surprised

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,860
that you guys are still investigating him.

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
Yes, because we haven't solved the case yet.

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,330
I was really surprised when
Mr. Tenma was marked as a suspect!

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,250
You were surprised?

40
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,790
Was it that unexpected?

41
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,830
It was beyond any expectation.

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,580
To think that he killed someone...

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,560
To tell you the truth, I didn't think
he could do such a thing.

44
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,480
Although we only went out drinking
about twice three years ago...

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,100
He was not a bad person.

46
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,110
If you say that he was not a bad person,
does that make him a good person?

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,070
A good person...

48
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,990
He was more of the type of person
who didn't like to stand out.

49
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,080
So a person who doesn't like to stand out is a good person.

50
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,830
Well, all I'm saying is that he wasn't an unpleasant person.

51
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,450
My Nameless Hero

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,190
Japanese people don't usually wear these things.

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,740
Japanese people use chopsticks skillfully.

54
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,240
I am Japanese.

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,070
Thank you.

56
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,580
I am Japanese.

57
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,290
I am Japanese.

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,120
I am...

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,210
Tenma.

60
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,340
Ah, Father?

61
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,010
Hi.

62
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,640
How are you?

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,770
I'm fine.

64
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,190
I called you because I heard that you were in Munich.

65
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm living here now.

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,570
The thing is, Father...

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,820
I gave birth to a healthy child...

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,950
I see...

69
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,370
Congratulations.

70
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,000
Even though we've been through a lot,
I'd still like you to see your grandson.

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
Will you come see him?

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,830
Of course.

73
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,670
Then, is tomorrow okay?

74
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,300
Yes, I should be free after 6 PM.

75
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,380
Where shall we meet?

76
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,430
Yes...

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,260
The Marienplatz.

78
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,510
Yes, I got it.

79
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,720
Goodbye.

80
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,310
Thank you.

81
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,150
Wow, you're pretty skillful with chopsticks.

82
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,240
You think so?

83
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,160
Although lately, there are many foreigners who
use chopsticks better than Japanese people.

84
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,490
So, Dr. Takahashi...

85
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,040
From the perspective of someone who had the
same job, what kind of person was Tenma?

86
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,040
What kind, eh?

87
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Hm... let's see...

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,130
He wasn't too anti-social...

89
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,090
though he was indecisive at times...

90
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,680
Except...

91
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,180
Except?

92
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,470
He turned into a completely different
person when he held a scalpel.

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,850
Although everyone called him a genius neurosurgeon,

94
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,770
it really wasn't an exaggeration.

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,030
What about his parents?

96
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,280
He never really talked about them.

97
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,120
He did say that both his father and
older brother were doctors...

98
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,540
I guess he had no choice but to become one.

99
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,040
Speaking of which...

100
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,790
I heard he didn't return to Japan once
after he became a doctor in Germany.

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,800
His parents didn't come to Germany
during that incident either...

102
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,800
and they didn't seem too concerned about
proving their son's innocence.

103
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,180
I guess he wasn't all that close>with his family.

104
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,490
I'm terribly sorry.

105
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,370
Yamamoto just contacted me.

106
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,000
He did arrive in Munich from Prague, but...

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,120
it seems he has to go to his next
business meeting immediately.

108
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,130
He sounds extremely busy.

109
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,800
He did say he will be joining us later on at
the restaurant that we are heading to now.

110
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,840
The restaurant...?

111
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,100
Oh yes! Why don't you come with us, Inspector Lunge?

112
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,930
This surely must be some sort of fate,

113
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,810
and we don't know when well need your help next so...

114
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,570
I'm sorry, I cannot today.

115
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,030
I guess he wasn't all that close with his family.

116
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,950
I am...

117
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,830
Tenma.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,290
Huh?

119
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,380
That sounds great.

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Please let me join you.

121
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,870
Karaoke Bar Oedo

122
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,480
<i>Farewell...</i>

123
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,990
<i>I will be going now...</i>

124
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,370
<i>Farewell...</i>

125
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,160
I've been waiting for this, Iwai-chan.

126
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,210
How about it? Would you like to
sing one too, Inspector Lunge?

127
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,670
Yeah!

128
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,050
Oops, the next song is mine!

129
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,300
Nice!

130
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,970
I've been waiting for this.

131
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,390
<i>Love letter from Canada.</i>

132
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,400
<i>If you were here with me.</i>

133
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,280
Nice! Nice!

134
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,780
<i>That would be a wonderful trip.</i>

135
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,490
I am Tenma.

136
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,530
<i>Love letter from Canada.</i>

137
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,240
I am Tenma.

138
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,750
I cannot blend into Japanese Society.

139
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,170
I don't ask for their help...

140
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,130
I don't have a place to go home to...

141
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,800
I am...

142
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,590
alone.

143
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh! Sorry for being late!

144
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,360
Hey! We've been waiting for you, Yamamoto!

145
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,070
This is Inspector Lunge, the man
I mentioned over the phone.

146
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,860
Oh! Hello.

147
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,490
I'm Yamamoto from the Munich branch of Kadofuku.

148
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,530
Hello.

149
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,370
How were your negotiations with
Mr. Kohou in the Czech Republic?

150
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,710
Oh, he was a tough one.

151
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,840
Oh yes! By the way, I found it!

152
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,130
Found what?

153
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
The thing that Mr. Schubert's right-hand
man, that blond-haired boy, asked of us.

154
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,090
Oh? You found it?

155
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,430
Because getting on that secretary's good side now,

156
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,980
is the best way of getting Mr. Schubert
to do business with us.

157
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,440
I had to search a lot of used book stores in Prague,

158
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,230
but I finally found a copy!

159
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Oh? So this is the picture book?

160
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,900
The cover's fallen off, and it's pretty beat up too,

161
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,660
but if we wrap it up nicely, it'll be okay.

162
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,080
Excuse me!

163
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
Can I get a beer?

164
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
May I?

165
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,250
Oh, go ahead.

166
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,300
Oh, it's in Czech?

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,670
All right? The next song is mine!

168
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,430
Nice! Nice!

169
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,640
We've been waiting for this...

170
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,350
for this person.

171
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,100
Nice!

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,910
Munich Police

173
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,690
Inspector, what are you looking up in the dictionary?

174
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,860
Czech words.

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,820
Czech words?

176
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,370
Does this have anything to do with your investigation?

177
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
No, absolutely nothing.

178
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,250
I can't believe you're looking up something
that is unrelated to the investigation...

179
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,790
It's something from a picture book. I liked the picture,

180
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,710
and I wanted to know what it said.

181
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,720
The inspector reading a picture book?

182
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,340
That is certainly rare...

183
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,430
"Look at me! Look at me!"

184
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,770
"The monster within me has gotten this big!"

185
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,330
I see...

186
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,410
So Johan has finally gotten around
to manipulating that big company?

187
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,330
For a while now, I've been hearing a lot of stories
about Johan from you, Dr. Gillen, but...

188
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,420
seriously, that Johan is quite a monster.

189
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,130
A monster?

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,340
Yeah.

191
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,680
I, myself, have killed many people, but...

192
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,180
he's become something that I wanted to be, but couldn't.

193
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,890
Man, Johan is my hero.

194
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,100
I see.

195
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,440
There is something else I'd like to ask you.

196
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,900
What is it?

197
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,530
If you were Johan, what would you do next?

198
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,570
Do next?

199
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,410
Well, that's obvious!

200
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,250
Kill his current parents, the Lieberts.

201
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,210
Mr. Liebert?

202
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
Mr. Liebert?

203
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,510
Why would you do that?

204
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,510
Why?

205
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,510
Because I would be bored of them.

206
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,510
Mr. Liebert? Mr. Liebert?!

207
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,430
Mr. Liebert!

208
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,180
Yes, who is it?

209
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,900
A psychologist?

210
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,190
And what business do you have with us, Dr. Reichwine?

211
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,700
I have no intention of telling you the entire story.

212
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,040
Johan? Adopted?

213
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,080
What are you talking about?

214
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,500
He's our real son and...

215
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,750
Playing dumb is useless.

216
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,090
The grave of your real son lies in Bruntal.

217
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,430
You took advantage of the town hall's files being burned,

218
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,850
and turned in a birth certificate
to resurrect your dead child.

219
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,600
Who are you?

220
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,690
It wasn't my intent to come here and threaten you.

221
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,070
I came here for your sake.

222
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,320
I want you to read this.

223
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,950
It's a report of information we collected on Johan.

224
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,990
On Johan?

225
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,700
A certain man investigated all of this.

226
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,170
This man is...

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,340
He came by here before trying to sell us insurance.

228
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,340
He was Richard Brown, an ex-detective.

229
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,800
An ex-detective?

230
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,720
He... passed away.

231
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,810
Now please, read it.

232
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,560
The story begins in 1986...

233
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,110
when a high official of East Germany
defected to West Germany.

234
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,190
Is his goal money?

235
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,030
Money?

236
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,360
He holds no interest in money.

237
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,160
Then why has he gotten close to a wealthy man?

238
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,000
You did it when you were small too, didn't you?

239
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:00,620
Did what?

240
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,210
Taking an ant line like this...

241
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,750
and to that ant line...

242
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,800
you mess it up like this.

243
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,720
No way...

244
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,350
I cannot believe such a frightening story.

245
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,600
How can such a crazy story...?

246
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,900
I understand your disbelief of the story.

247
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,570
You lost your son at an early age.

248
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,400
After that, even though you were
not blessed with another child...

249
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,320
A young boy about the same age
as your dead son appeared.

250
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,490
On top of that, he had money.

251
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,120
He gave you a wonderful house.

252
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,540
He gave you a beautiful garden.

253
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,050
And then... he gave you love.

254
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,010
I understand very well that you want to believe him.

255
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,470
However, what's written here is the truth!

256
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,560
What kind of man is this Johan?

257
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,140
Just who is he?

258
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,650
Johan... is a good boy.

259
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,990
Johan is a kind boy.

260
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,610
He is very smart...

261
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,160
and outgoing.

262
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,740
He's...

263
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,700
our reason for living.

264
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,580
Is that all?

265
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,130
You have had a parent-child relationship
for nearly five years,

266
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,760
and that's all you can say?

267
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,470
You don't know anything about him.

268
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,930
Please, help me.

269
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,350
Because of him, my friend, Richard, is dead.

270
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,350
And right now, a man named Dr. Tenma...

271
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,360
is trying to set right what cannot be righted.

272
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,780
Please, help me.

273
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,530
No, more important than that...

274
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,910
You will,

275
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,040
like the middle-aged couples in here,

276
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,870
like those who raised Johan as an adopted son,

277
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,790
be killed.

278
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,670
Let's leave here. Leave with me.

279
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,700
The apple tree has produced some small apples.

280
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,530
Yeah...

281
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,000
Next year, it will produce bigger ones.

282
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,210
I look forward to it.

283
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,710
Yes... I look forward to it too.

284
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,260
You say he's going to be killed by a Japanese man soon?

285
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,220
Johan said that to some children?

286
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,430
Yeah.

287
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,220
What do you think of what he said?

288
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,060
I'll tell you straight out, he doesn't have a death wish.

289
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,310
Then what did he mean?

290
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,900
Who knows?

291
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,020
A hero's thoughts are complicated.

292
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,820
However...

293
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,150
However, I can tell you this much.

294
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,990
Even if the world was wiped out by a nuclear war,

295
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,660
he would still survive.

296
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,430
So he's saying that there's nothing we can do?

297
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,600
It's true that everything we've done
so far has led to nowhere.

298
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,980
I couldn't help Richard either...

299
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,060
Dr. Reichwine...

300
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,400
And we have not found Dr. Tenma either...

301
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,280
We can't even stop him from killing Johan.

302
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,360
Everything has been useless!

303
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,620
Dr. Reichwine, let's calm down and think things through.

304
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm sorry...

305
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,340
Mess up an ant line, eh?

306
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,340
Even ants have souls.

307
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,100
Doctor... where are you going?

308
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,600
Now that it has come to this, I have no choice
but to engage in life-risking close combat.

309
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,690
I'll meet him face-to-face and tell him everything.

310
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,190
That big mogul, Schubert.

311
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,570
Huh? Add another fifty chairs?

312
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,080
Man, they keep adding things.

313
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,120
You mean tomorrow's Mr. Schubert's donation ceremony?

314
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:53,790
Yeah.

315
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,630
People just keep coming one after another
and we've run out of seats.

316
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,090
Nowadays, whenever Mr. Schubert does
something, it becomes a big thing.

317
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,350
The library will be closing soon.

318
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,310
The library will be closing soon.

319
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,920
Excuse me...

320
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,930
I'm sorry,

321
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,720
can you get that for me?

322
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,520
That Czech dictionary.

323
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,730
I can't reach it.

324
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,230
Y-Yes. This one?

325
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,770
Ah, sorry for bothering you.

326
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,740
Thank you.

327
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,950
I borrowed a Czech picture book, but I don't understand it.

328
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,950
I see...

329
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,710
My friend suddenly fainted after reading this picture book.

330
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,460
Really?

331
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,420
I thought it might have had something
to do with the picture book's contents.

332
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,920
Is your friend better now?

333
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes. Completely.

334
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,260
Thank you very much.

335
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,050
You're welcome.

336
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,190
Let's see...

337
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,650
"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away..."

338
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,950
"There was a monster without a name."

339
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,170
"The monster wanted a name so
badly that he couldn't stand it."

340
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,460
"So then, the monster went on a journey."

341
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,140
What a strange book.

342
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,560
It's closing time.

343
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,390
Okay.

344
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,140
We'll be closed tomorrow because of the ceremony.

345
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

346
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

347
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

348
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

349
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,530
The Monster of Chaos
