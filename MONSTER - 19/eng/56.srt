1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,010
June 19th.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,100
I met with Franz Bonaparta for the first time.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,370
R.F. 1719.

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,640
A man with a quiet and calm demeanor.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,390
A refined and aristocratic look.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,160
Dressed in a suit.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,610
In the afternoon...

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,670
the children gathered for a book reading.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,020
Where do you want to go?

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,920
The border.

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,520
Which one?

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,250
The Czech border.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,880
Get in.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,540
Thank you.

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,360
In the afternoon, the children gathered for a book reading.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,720
A very strange mansion.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,390
The Red Rose Mansion.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,920
P. Brevnov W.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,830
A spire on the left.

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,810
A weather vane on the right.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,490
Human dignity.

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,200
An experiment.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,510
A wonderful experiment.

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,000
The deprivation of dignity.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,070
What country are you from?

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,490
I asked where you're from.

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,530
I'm Japanese.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,740
I don't know if a Japanese person would like this, but...

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,880
Eat it.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,000
It's left over from my lunch, though.

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,320
Thank you.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,750
But...

33
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,450
Just eat it!

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,450
You look like you're gonna collapse any second now.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,430
My wife keeps nagging at me to lose some weight.

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,360
Well, thank you.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,840
Yeah, eat up!

38
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,060
If you don't, you won't make it through the long journey.

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,250
I need to end this journey already...

40
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,950
The Never-ending Journey

41
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,910
What did you say?

42
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,000
You let him go?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,920
You just let Tenma leave?

44
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes.

45
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,770
Why didn't you stop him?

46
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,850
You already know he's a man you can't stop.

47
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,680
Yeah, but...

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
On top of which...

49
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,150
we're in a dire situation with Eva Heinemann missing.

50
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,830
Tenma even escaped from jail because of her.

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,100
That lawyer who called himself Baul...

52
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,940
He's most likely the same man who
tried to kill me at my clinic.

53
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,940
His objective was to get close to me...

54
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,460
and obtain my father's notes.

55
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,960
Those notes must be very important.

56
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,490
I'll be going now.

57
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,200
Where to?

58
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,200
To where Tenma is headed.

59
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,610
The "Red Rose Mansion"?

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,690
Where is it?

61
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,840
My father's notes were full of meaningless descriptions...

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,400
but I don't think they were written in code.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,430
The Red Rose Mansion.

64
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,870
P. Brevnov W.

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,770
P is for Prague.

66
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,760
W means west.

67
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,730
A suburb of Prague, west of Brevnov!

68
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,770
A place where you can see "a spire on the left..."

69
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,250
"and a weather vane on the right."

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,470
I see!

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,470
I just hope there's an eyewitness or someone who
can help us solve the case at that mansion.

72
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,640
But it's unlikely now...

73
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,410
No.

74
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,970
"In the afternoon, the children
gathered for a book reading."

75
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,440
That was described in the notes.

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,990
The children from back then could be our witnesses.

77
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,570
Mr. Verdeman.

78
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,350
I blamed you for letting Tenma go.

79
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,520
But if I had been in that situation...

80
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,950
I think I would've done the same.

81
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,950
All right, let's get going.

82
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,460
I was here...

83
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,710
I used to live in this town...

84
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,370
And...

85
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,720
<i>Welcome home.</i>

86
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,960
Are you okay, Nina?!

87
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,690
I'm okay...

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,510
I think it's better if we give up.

89
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,990
No matter how many times we do this, we still get lost.

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,320
No, I'm sure I'll remember.

91
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,430
Back then, my brother told me what happened.

92
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,030
How he was taken away from The Three Frogs...

93
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,270
What he passed, and where he went.

94
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,630
He went past the train station...

95
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,680
and while he was watching the town on his left...

96
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,480
a trolley followed him along the river.

97
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,590
Please turn right over...

98
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,490
<i>You shouldn't.</i>

99
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,890
<i>You shouldn't hide anything from him.</i>

100
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,840
Turn right?

101
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,050
What's wrong?

102
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,560
I-It's nothing...

103
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,950
Well?

104
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,730
Do you recognize any landmarks?

105
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,070
I don't know...

106
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,770
It's useless!

107
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,600
You can't remember something from so long ago.

108
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Nina!

109
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,790
A weather vane on the right...

110
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,910
A church spire on the left...

111
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,140
Nina!

112
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,510
The Red Rose Mansion!

113
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,740
Is this the place?

114
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,320
I don't know.

115
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,430
But...

116
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,560
I know this place.

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm scared...

118
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,870
What's that?

119
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,840
It's like a door just appeared from inside the wall.

120
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,230
There's nothing in this room.

121
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,840
Nina?

122
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,320
Nina?!

123
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,650
Nina!

124
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,560
You devil!

125
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,310
You devil!

126
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,030
The devil has been slain.

127
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,890
How are you feeling?

128
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,670
Welcome back, Mr. Lipsky.

129
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,020
Did you get any customers?

130
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,040
No, business was as bad as usual.

131
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,000
But the puppets are all so wonderful.

132
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,730
The one I'm making now is even better.

133
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,200
I want to see it soon.

134
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,340
Once I finish, you'll be the first to see it.

135
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,170
It's time for me to go to work.

136
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,150
At the restaurant?

137
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,120
Yeah, I can't earn a living on just the puppets.

138
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm really sorry for imposing on you for so long...

139
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,070
No, it's okay.

140
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,620
Don't worry about it.

141
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,010
Mr. Lipsky, there's something I want to ask you.

142
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,080
W-What is it?

143
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,410
Three months ago...

144
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,290
when you found me after I collapsed
and took me to a hospital...

145
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,920
Yes?

146
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,230
Why were you at that mansion?

147
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,360
<i>Nina?</i>

148
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,080
<i>Nina?!</i>

149
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,070
<i>Nina!</i>

150
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,030
<i>Answer me, Nina?</i>

151
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,180
<i>Nina!</i>

152
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,280
<i>What's wrong?</i>

153
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,600
When I go to that mansion...

154
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,330
images come to me for my work.

155
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,730
How should I put it...

156
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,330
But right now, more than that mansion, I...

157
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,720
No, it's nothing.

158
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,190
Anyway, don't worry about it.

159
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,390
You can stay here for as long as you like.

160
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,610
Nina...

161
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,650
Can I come in?

162
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,400
O-Of course!

163
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,760
Are you sure you should be out of bed?

164
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,270
Yeah.

165
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,830
Wow!

166
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,840
So this is where the puppets are born.

167
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,440
Too bad I don't have any customers.

168
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,440
What kind of story is it?

169
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,240
It's the story of a devil.

170
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,840
What's wrong, Nina?

171
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,290
No, go on.

172
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,930
A devil who leaves to find the dragon
that threatens to destroy this world...

173
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,210
but almost dies in the middle of his journey.

174
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,540
A young man passing by saves his life, though.

175
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,510
When the young man learns the true
identity of the one he saved...

176
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,390
he goes after the devil.

177
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,880
And at the end of his journey, the
young man finds the devil...

178
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,830
and with a knife in his hand, slays the devil.

179
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,420
I think it's an interesting story, but...

180
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,580
nobody seems to like it.

181
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,570
A-Are you okay, Nina?

182
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,360
I think I would do the same.

183
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,120
I would do the same.

184
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,210
But...

185
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,650
I can't let him do something like that.

186
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,760
Nina?

187
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,690
If you were human...

188
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,520
you'd save that devil.

189
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,990
You think so?

190
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,590
I think he'd like this story.

191
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,550
Who?

192
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,550
On this bookshelf...

193
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,600
They're all picture books.

194
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,730
Jakob Farobek.

195
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,560
klaus Poppe.

196
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,600
Emil Scherbe.

197
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,080
"The Monster Without a Name."

198
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,070
I'm surprised you know of it.

199
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,620
He wrote many picture books.

200
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,880
Jakob Farobek.

201
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
klaus Poppe.

202
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,320
Emil Scherbe.

203
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,310
They're all pen names of the same person.

204
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,550
The man named Franz Bonaparta.

205
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,580
Franz... Bonaparta...

206
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,580
<i>Human beings....</i>

207
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,070
<i>can become anything.</i>

208
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,410
Because I wasn't a "superior child..."

209
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,800
I was driven away from the book readings.

210
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,560
Book readings?

211
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,290
His book readings were held at the Red Rose Mansion.

212
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,560
I was a student there.

213
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,680
I understood what he was trying to do.

214
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,090
"A deal! Let's make a deal!"

215
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,400
said the devil.

216
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,680
"No! Absolutely not!"

217
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,850
said the man with big eyes.

218
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,600
"Yes! Let's make a deal!"

219
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,840
said the man with a big mouth.

220
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,320
The man with a big mouth's yard became a flower garden.

221
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,850
The man with big eyes became destitute and starved.

222
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,250
The man with a big mouth was cheerful every day.

223
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,530
He was full from all his ripened fruit.

224
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,090
That is why he did not notice.

225
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,600
His flower garden was wilting away.

226
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,520
In the garden where no flower would ever bloom again...

227
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,450
the man with a big mouth cried and muttered...

228
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,120
"I should never have made a deal with the devil."

229
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,460
The man with big eyes was so hungry
that he thought he would die.

230
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,330
Shedding tears, he muttered...

231
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,120
"I should have made a deal with the devil."

232
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,170
"A deal! Let's make a deal!"

233
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,000
said the devil.

234
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:39,170
"The Man with Big Eyes, the Man with
a Big Mouth," by Jacob Farobek.

235
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,760
Each Friday at three o'clock in the afternoon...

236
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,930
we would gather for the book readings.

237
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,390
We would sit around him...

238
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,810
and listen as he read us a book.

239
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,810
With his kind voice...

240
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,740
A very calm and kind voice...

241
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,510
And when he finished reading a story...

242
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,250
he would ask us.

243
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,870
"The meaning of the story..."

244
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,600
"do you understand?"

245
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,510
I... I understand...

246
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,350
I also understood after reading it many times.

247
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,860
Then...

248
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,380
he would take another picture book into his hands.

249
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,610
"The God of Peace," by klaus Poppe.

250
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,140
All right, let's try reading this next.

251
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,870
It's as if I've come here for the first time.

252
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,090
Although it took me quite some time...

253
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,920
all the memories have come together.

254
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,120
The god of peace is always busy.

255
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,790
He is too busy to look in a mirror...

256
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,350
and blows his horn every day.

257
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,910
The god of peace's horn makes everyone happy.

258
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,570
The god of peace is always busy.

259
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,370
He is too busy to look in a mirror...

260
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,040
and scatters magical water.

261
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,000
The magical water creates green mountains...

262
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,450
ripens crops, and makes flower gardens grow.

263
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,170
The god of peace is always busy.

264
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,850
He is too busy to look in a mirror...

265
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,370
and gives everyone a name.

266
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,320
"Your name is Otto."

267
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,680
"Your name is Hans."

268
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,370
"Your name is Thomas."

269
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,370
"Your name is..."

270
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,530
"Johan."

271
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,370
Johan gave his hat to the god as a gift in return.

272
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,270
The god was very happy.

273
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,740
Because he wanted to see himself wearing the hat...

274
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,110
he stood in front of a mirror for the first time.

275
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,150
However...

276
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,410
what he saw in the mirror was a devil.

277
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,090
The devil spoke to him.

278
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,920
"I am you..."

279
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,070
"and you are me."

280
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,930
"Oh, no!"

281
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,360
"No one can live in peace with a devil like this!"

282
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,600
"What should I do?"

283
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,070
So, the troubled god...

284
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,130
Do you know what he did?

285
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,810
I figured that out.

286
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,140
Do you know?

287
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,660
Do you know what the "god" did after this?

288
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,570
I do...

289
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,970
We finally meet.

290
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,460
I'm home.

291
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,100
Welcome back.

292
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,220
It's me, Mother.

293
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,970
I don't think even you could have told us apart, Mother.

294
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,930
I am her, and she is me.

295
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,930
I am you, and you are me.

296
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,410
I understand everything now.

297
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,680
Where we came from...

298
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,830
and where we are heading.

299
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,410
The weather outside is wonderful, Mother.

300
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,080
Let the flames engulf everything.

301
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,760
I understand...

302
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,560
The god...

303
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,440
pointed the gun...

304
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,960
at his forehead!

305
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,370
<i>Shoot me.</i>

306
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

307
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

308
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

309
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

310
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,570
That Night
