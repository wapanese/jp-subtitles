1
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,770
It's me.

2
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,270
Is anyone...

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,270
here?

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
J-Johan.

5
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,320
Many people drank that wine...

6
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,610
at the Red Rose Mansion.

7
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,710
Don't worry.

8
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,670
Look, I'm drinking it, too.

9
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,890
What happened to the bodyguards
who were supposed to be here?

10
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,690
Why did you kill The Baby?

11
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,940
We were supposed to be working together.

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,240
You helped us and we were to find your sister.

13
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,790
Everything is going according to plan.

14
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,880
We... We'll soon have your sister.

15
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,420
If anything happens to me, your sister will...

16
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,800
I won't let you have your way.

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,550
Got it? Everything is going according to my calculations.

18
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,060
What am I?

19
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,730
The monster inside of me isn't inside of me.

20
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,150
It's outside of me.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,860
What are you saying?

22
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,280
Franz Bonaparta...

23
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,500
is alive.

24
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,990
Johan's Footprints

25
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,930
I'm sorry to bother you at night, Ms. Nina Fortner.

26
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,940
Ms. Fortner.

27
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,860
Ms. Nina Fortner.

28
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,790
Don't move.

29
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,250
Who sent you?

30
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,260
I see. Just like The Baby said. You're not just a little girl.

31
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,600
The Baby...

32
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,770
Did The Baby order you to take me?

33
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,270
No. The Baby is dead.

34
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,520
Dead?

35
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,490
Peter Capek ordered us to get you.

36
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,860
He says he'll be safe if we take you hostage.

37
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Capek?!

38
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,910
Take me.

39
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,370
Take me to Peter Capek.

40
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,420
Police!

41
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,800
We will conduct a search in the home of the perpetrator

42
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,100
of the Roedelheim Convention Center shooting, Milan Kolasch.

43
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,850
Get going.

44
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,940
Out of the way!

45
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,600
Out of our way!

46
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,690
Is this Kolasch's room?

47
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,190
I think so.

48
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,090
The police will be here soon to search the place.

49
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,210
I have to leave.

50
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,590
Is Milan...

51
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,800
Is Milan really dead?

52
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,560
Milan...

53
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,060
Milan died for our sake.

54
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:52,200
Peter Capek killed our relatives and he was killed
trying to take revenge for us. Revenge...

55
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,790
Revenge!

56
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,790
Revenge!

57
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,290
Revenge!

58
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,130
Revenge!

59
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,920
No!

60
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,800
Don't think that.

61
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,890
But... But, Milan...

62
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,850
Milan never wanted that.

63
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,150
Revenge begets revenge.

64
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,320
It happens again and again.

65
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,490
Milan didn't want you to think like that.

66
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,490
Someone has to stop it.

67
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,500
Milan tried to end it all.

68
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,130
What do you think Milan's true wish was?

69
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,510
He wanted us to see everyone's home country together.

70
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,430
Study hard.

71
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,680
Some day that wish will be granted.

72
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,070
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Mustafa.

73
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,070
Mrs. Minh.

74
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,080
Mrs. Suleiman, thank you for all the great food.

75
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,830
Dr.  Tenma, you aren't going to...

76
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,440
There's a lot of material on Peter Capek.

77
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,650
It seems like Milan Kolasch was after this Capek character.

78
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,780
Let's find this man.

79
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,900
I want to question him.

80
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,780
Detective!

81
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,870
The leader of the extremist organization, The Baby,
has been found murdered at the Kaiser Hotel.

82
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,630
Someone has to...

83
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,010
I have to... stop it.

84
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,070
That young man has gone to that hotel
with Peter Capek many times.

85
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,410
Is that the Devil's Apprentice?

86
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Follow that car.

87
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,340
Johan?

88
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,850
Are you here, Johan?

89
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,710
Where have you been, Johan?

90
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,630
You must be... Eva.

91
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Where is he?

92
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,890
Where is Johan right now?

93
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,390
Mr. Capek.

94
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,140
We've brought Nina.

95
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,400
Mr. Capek.

96
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:50,910
Peter...

97
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,960
Capek.

98
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,920
Come on. Don't be scared.

99
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,550
Hey!

100
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,010
Wait! Stop!

101
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,270
Which one is it?

102
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,270
Is it Johan?

103
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,020
Or the sister?

104
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,030
At this point, it doesn't matter which one.

105
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,030
Johan let me live.

106
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,290
The one who's going to kill me...

107
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,170
is the sister.

108
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,800
Everything is going according to plan.

109
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,100
But whose?

110
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,810
Mine?

111
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,310
Or Johan's?

112
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,440
Whose plan?

113
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,320
Whose plan?

114
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,120
Kill me already.

115
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,010
Johan was here?

116
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,350
Where did he go?

117
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,020
Take me to him.

118
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,770
Where is Johan?

119
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,110
It's pitch black.

120
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,450
I'm scared.

121
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,660
I want to get out of here.

122
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,040
You can't leave yet.

123
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,340
Is it still going on?

124
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,050
The massacre.

125
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,520
If I hadn't pointed you out at that party...

126
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,650
you and that demon...

127
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,490
If only I hadn't done that

128
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,450
Martin wouldn't...

129
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,410
Martin wouldn't...

130
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,130
have died.

131
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,840
I understand.

132
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,630
Just hold on a second.

133
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,880
Where is Johan?

134
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,640
I don't know. I want to know myself.

135
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,300
Calm down.

136
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,430
I've been watching this apartment for two weeks.

137
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,650
He's never been here.

138
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,730
Where is he?

139
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,860
I told you.

140
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,690
I don't know.

141
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,400
For real.

142
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,530
My ear! My ear!

143
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,660
I'm serious.

144
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,710
It hurts! It hurts!

145
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,670
Next time, you'll wish it was just your ear.

146
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,170
Christof Sievernich.

147
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,800
I've done my homework on you.

148
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,680
Although I knew about your late father,
Ernest, without any research.

149
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,140
The Sievernich group was one of the largest
financial groups in Frankfurt, no,

150
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,690
all of Germany.

151
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,030
I'd never have thought that you were the heir of that group.

152
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,990
Why did Peter Capek want me to point Johan out for you?

153
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,580
Look at how much I'm bleeding.

154
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,950
Let me go to the hospital.

155
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,120
What's going on?

156
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,460
What happened when I pointed that demon out for you?

157
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,710
You've got it all wrong.

158
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,170
What do I have wrong?!

159
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,390
He thought that he introduced me to Johan.

160
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,430
But Johan and I have known each
other for quite some time.

161
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,640
What?

162
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,400
Capek never knew.

163
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,440
We were friends in East Germany over 10 years ago.

164
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,450
Over 10 years ago... in East Germany?

165
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm Sievernich's foster son.

166
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,160
That's what they say at least.

167
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,960
The truth is, I was sold on the black market by a merchant.

168
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:58,340
Johan and I met each other at
East Berlin's 511 Kinderheim.

169
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,350
511...

170
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,270
We met each other there.

171
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,980
We survived.

172
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,150
He and I were the only survivors.

173
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,570
I'm scared.

174
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,860
I'm hungry.

175
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,370
I need to go to the bathroom.

176
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,920
Is the massacre over?

177
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,670
Is everyone dead?

178
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,670
Let's take a look.

179
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,260
Don't worry.

180
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,930
It's gotten quiet outside, hasn't it?

181
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,850
It's okay. Take a look.

182
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,440
You'll go insane if you stay in here.

183
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,190
I'll take a look.

184
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,990
If it's safe, return and let us know.

185
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,200
Okay.

186
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,130
I don't know why, but all the people at
511 Kinderheim went insane that day.

187
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,050
It wasn't just the children.
The staff were killing each other as well.

188
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,890
He's not back yet.

189
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,940
He ran away.

190
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,560
Huh?

191
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,770
He left us and ran away.

192
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,270
No way!

193
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,860
He decided to save himself.

194
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,610
I don't think so.

195
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,990
If you think I'm lying, go take a look.

196
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,000
He's probably enjoying a nice hot meal right now.

197
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,920
A hot meal?

198
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,340
I'll just take a glance.

199
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,130
You won't betray me, will you?

200
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,590
Of course not.

201
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,730
He didn't return either.

202
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,900
I'll stay hidden.

203
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:25,990
With an empty stomach and a dry mouth, I fell
in and out of sleep over and over again.

204
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,380
Am I going to die here?

205
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,760
And then he was there,

206
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,680
standing in front of me.

207
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,760
It's just you and me.

208
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,270
I have a plan.

209
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,150
Was that Johan?

210
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,900
Capek saying that he has a plan is a joke.

211
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,780
We already talked about it as kids.

212
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,030
What's his plan?

213
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,250
Do you want to know?

214
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,080
Where do I begin?

215
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,930
You shouldn't have.

216
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,350
You shouldn't have shot me in the ear!

217
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,100
A politicians face is everything to him.

218
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,110
This is not good.

219
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,610
I am going to run the world.

220
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,400
Isn't that right?!

221
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,120
With Johan's help, the world is going to be mine!

222
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,410
Isn't that right?!

223
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,410
What am I going to do about this ear?

224
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,160
Don't ruin our plan!

225
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,330
Don't ruin it!

226
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,130
Drop the gun!

227
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,220
Kenzo!

228
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,310
Johan told me...

229
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,990
that if you showed up, I should tell you where he is.

230
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,830
After that, he said you might kill me.

231
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,700
Why didn't you kill me?

232
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,840
Have you regained all of your memories?

233
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,590
Yeah.

234
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,680
Then why didn't you kill me?

235
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,100
You must be overflowing...

236
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,770
with hatred, anger, and grief.

237
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,660
You know...

238
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,700
what we are, don't you?

239
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,290
I've heard the story of how...

240
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,670
you, the twins, were born.

241
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:43,020
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

242
00:22:44,110 --> 00:23:00,420
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

243
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:25,500
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

244
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:33,980
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

245
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,450
Welcome Home
