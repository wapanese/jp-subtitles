1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,160
I was the one who saved his life.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,500
I was the one who saved that monster...

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,470
This is it!

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,180
Did you figure something out?

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,140
Schubert's book donation ceremony!

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,430
Is Tenma there?

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,190
Dieter, you wait here!

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,150
Don't follow me!

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,780
It's Schubert!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,120
I want to see Hans Georg Schubert.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,580
Contact him.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,870
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,880
If I'm not mistaken, he's at the University of Munich
for a book donation ceremony today.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,550
We're heading there immediately.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,840
Tenma is going after Schubert.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,180
Nina!

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,350
Lotte! Thanks for coming.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm sorry. I looked all over for him,
but he doesn't seem to be here.

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,870
You and I just got to be good friends, too.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,740
It's such a shame.

21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,000
You guys, aren't twins are you?

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,540
I'm right, aren't I?

23
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,250
I'm right, aren't I?!

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,840
What is this picture book?

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,710
He saw this and suddenly fainted.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,050
Picture book?

27
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,550
Kill... him...

28
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,560
A long, long time ago.

29
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,230
In a land far away, there was
a monster without a name.

30
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,610
The monster wanted a name so badly.

31
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,620
So the monster left to go on a journey to find a name.

32
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,210
But the world was so large that he
split into two to make his journey.

33
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,170
One went to the west and the other went toward the east.

34
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,300
The monster who went to the east found a village.

35
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,180
At the entrance of the village there was a blacksmith.

36
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,980
Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name.

37
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,860
You can't give away your name.

38
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,870
If you give me your name, I'll enter
you and give you strength.

39
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,500
Really? If you can make me stronger,
then I'll give you my name.

40
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,590
The monster entered the blacksmith.

41
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,550
The monster became Otto the Blacksmith.

42
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,060
Otto the Blacksmith became the strongest one in the village.

43
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:28,400
But one day he said, "Look at me. Look at me. Look
at how large the monster inside of me has become."

44
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,150
Crunch Crunch!

45
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,360
Munch Munch!

46
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,280
Chomp Chomp!

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,860
Gulp!

48
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,700
The hungry monster ate Otto from the inside out.

49
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,580
The monster returned to being a nameless monster.

50
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,590
Even when he entered Hans the Shoemaker,

51
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,180
Crunch Crunch! Munch Munch! Chomp Chomp! Gulp!

52
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,770
He returned to being a nameless monster.

53
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,770
When he entered Thomas the Hunter...

54
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,440
Crunch Crunch!

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,940
Munch Munch!

56
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,490
Chomp Chomp!

57
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,650
Gulp!

58
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,530
He once again returned to being a nameless monster.

59
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,870
The monster came to a castle
looking for a wonderful name.

60
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,300
In the castle, there was a sick boy.

61
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,970
If you give me your name, I'll give you strength.

62
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,060
If you can cure this illness and make
me strong, I'll give you my name.

63
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,020
The monster entered the boy.

64
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,030
The boy became well.

65
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,870
The king was so pleased! The prince
is well! The prince is well!

66
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,580
The monster liked the boy's name.

67
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,880
He also liked living in the castle.

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,210
So even though he was hungry, he endured.

69
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,340
Every day his stomach growled, but he endured it.

70
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,890
However, he was so hungry that one day he said,

71
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:32,770
"Look at me. Look at me. Look at how large
the monster inside of me has become."

72
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,030
The boy ate the king and even his servants.

73
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,080
Crunch Crunch!

74
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,080
Munch Munch!

75
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,910
Chomp Chomp!

76
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,750
Gulp!

77
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,010
Since there was no one there anymore
the boy went on a journey.

78
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,720
He kept on walking for days and days.

79
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,070
One day, the boy met the monster
who traveled to the west.

80
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,240
"I have a name. It's a wonderful name, too"

81
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,710
The monster who went to the west said, "I don't
need a name. I'm happy even without a name."

82
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,630
"We just have to accept that we are monsters without a name."

83
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,840
The boy ate the monster who went to the west.

84
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,600
He finally had a name, but all the people who could
call him by that name had disappeared.

85
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,900
And Johan was such a wonderful name, too.

86
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,060
A Nameless Monster

87
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,160
So, you know about this picture book?

88
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,670
Can you read Czech?

89
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,000
Are you Czech?

90
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,010
I don't know.

91
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,090
What do you mean, you don't know?

92
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,220
I have a feeling...

93
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,520
I have a feeling... that someone read this to me a long time ago.

94
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
Who are you?

95
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,230
Are you really Nina Fortner?

96
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,280
Give me a straight answer.

97
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,400
Who are you?

98
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,490
I don't know.

99
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,750
You don't know? We're taking about you here!

100
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,380
There's no way that you cannot know.

101
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,800
Answer me! Tell me what this is about!

102
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,880
Why did I get such a horrible feeling when I read this?

103
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,310
The suicide of the student who called
himself Schubert's son, Farhen,

104
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,480
the fall of the detective that Schubert hired,

105
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,230
the shooting of the prostitute called Margot Langer...

106
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,610
After I read this book, it feels like all those weird
things that have been happening lately

107
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,820
are part of just one big clump.

108
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,650
Why is this happening to me?

109
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,200
Why do I feel like it's all connected to Johan somehow?

110
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,700
Sorry.

111
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,870
I just got excited all of a sudden.

112
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,960
That guy who collapsed after looking at that book...

113
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,180
Did he look that much like me?

114
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,010
Like he was my twin.

115
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,060
He looked just like me, like he was my twin.

116
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,190
Your friend, Johan, that is.

117
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
Where is he now?

118
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,860
He's at the university library attending a book donation ceremony.

119
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,670
Hey, w-wait, Nina.

120
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,670
Wait up. C'mon!

121
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,850
Today, this large collection of books being donated by the CEO of the Schubert group, Hans Georg Schubert,

122
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:44,820
to the East Munich University's Friedrick Emmanuel Library, has many books of extraordinary importance.

123
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,070
One may say that it's a literary treasure
of the German language.

124
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,790
We have a responsibility to preserve
this wisdom of humanity

125
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,040
for the next generation of students.

126
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,800
The head librarian of the Friedrich Emmanuel
Library will continue on from here...

127
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,790
Dammit.

128
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,000
If only I could pull the trigger, it'd be all over.

129
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,590
Move.

130
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,130
Please help me, Doctor!

131
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,010
I don't want to die!

132
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,550
Doctor!

133
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,850
Doctor!

134
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
Mr. Mauler!

135
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,760
I have to shoot.

136
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,390
I have to shoot him!

137
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,470
<i>And now our guest of honor will take the stage.</i>

138
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,790
- <i>He's not just an important part of the Bayern
area economy, but a vital part of the EU.</i>

139
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,970
- Watch. This is how you shoot a gun.
- <i>He's not just an important part of the Bayern
area economy, but a vital part of the EU.</i>

140
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,480
- <i>He's not just an important part of the Bayern
area economy, but a vital part of the EU.</i>

141
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:34,860
And by donating such a large collection of books, he has
done a great deed for our beloved Bayern once again.

142
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,950
I introduce him with great honor.

143
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:47,460
Ladies and gentlemen, Hans Georg Schubert!

144
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,590
You shoot a gun...

145
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,430
like this.

146
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,950
You shoot a gun...

147
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,790
like this.

148
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,140
There sure are a lot of people here.
It seems he has got a lot of influence.

149
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,100
He's pretty popular, that Mr. Schubert.

150
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,230
Really.

151
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:50,790
And by donating such a large collection of books, he has
done a great deed for our beloved Bayern once again.

152
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,790
I introduce him with great honor.

153
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,510
Ladies and gentlemen, Hans Georg Schubert!

154
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,390
You're after me, aren't you?

155
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,180
There are many people here.

156
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,570
There were people swarming here to see you.

157
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,880
So that was it.

158
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,720
Unbelievable.

159
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,690
Don't make a sound.

160
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,110
Just shut up and watch. Got it?

161
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,910
I want you to listen to what I have to say.

162
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,500
I want you all to stay calm and listen to me.

163
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,210
I'm nearly blind.

164
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,460
I can't see how many people have gathered here.

165
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,180
You mustn't move all at once.

166
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,730
That's right. Just lie here quietly.

167
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,820
Watch what I have to do.

168
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,960
Make a single file line...

169
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,260
and carefully get out of here.

170
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,600
What's going on?

171
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,390
What's wrong?

172
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,100
The books!

173
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,440
They're on fire.

174
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,650
Put out the fire!

175
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,190
Hurry up!

176
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,130
What's going on?

177
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,800
My job was to shoot Schubert.

178
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,880
What's going on?

179
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,810
I see!

180
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,730
So you've changed your mind, Johan.

181
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,100
I like it better this way. It's much better.

182
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,820
They're all running around in circles,
like ants running from a fire.

183
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,160
This is great. It's great, Johan.

184
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,240
It's great.

185
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,210
Take a look at this.

186
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,980
The books... The books are burning!

187
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,990
They're all running around.

188
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,070
They're all scrambling to escape.

189
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,000
Can you feel it?

190
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,790
The fear.

191
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,470
I have to shoot.

192
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,720
You can't do it.

193
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,230
I have to shoot.

194
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,770
You can't shoot anyone.

195
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,230
I have to shoot.

196
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,360
You're Just a doctor.

197
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,570
You can only give people life.

198
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,120
Taking someone's life is my job.

199
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,330
You can't do it.

200
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:43,070
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

201
00:22:44,160 --> 00:23:00,470
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

202
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

203
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:34,030
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

204
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,570
The Demon In My Eyes
