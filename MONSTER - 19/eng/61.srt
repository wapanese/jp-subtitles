1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,630
You've found a job as a waitress and a place to live,

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,170
but this bed is pretty horrible.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,970
Look how much it tilts when I sit on it.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,880
If you'd try to sleep on it, it'd easily fall over.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,760
I'll sleep on the bed. You should sleep on that sofa.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,020
You shouldn't sleep there either.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,690
Go back to Dr. Reichwine's place in Munich.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,940
Why?

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,690
Why? Because you have to go to school.

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,700
I don't need to go to school.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,490
So you're not going to study at all?

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,240
You can teach me.

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,410
Studying isn't enough. At this rate
you won't have any friends.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,540
I have friends. You and Tenma.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,090
If I wasn't around, you'd be the one who's lonely.

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,920
Either way, you're going back to Munich.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,760
No!

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,510
I'm not going to Munich.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,310
H-Hey, Nina! Are you going today, too?

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,190
Hey, wait for me!

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,440
Stop! Give it up already.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,940
You go to the same place every day.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,160
No matter how many times you do it, it's always the same.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,570
You're not going to remember anything.

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,200
Nina!

26
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,900
The Door to Memories

27
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,100
We lived here.

28
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,600
Mom and myself... and Johan.

29
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,210
That day, Johan was dragged down these stairs.

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,220
No! Stop! Let me go!

31
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,590
Mom! Nina!

32
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,100
That's not right.

33
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,140
Nina is my name now.

34
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,980
What was I called back then?

35
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,940
Nina? Anna?

36
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,530
My name...

37
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,150
What is it?

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,410
The car that Johan was in drove along this road.

39
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,790
You mustn't hide anything from him.

40
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,630
The children gathered here.

41
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,300
They listened to what was called a reading seminar.

42
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,810
At this Red Rose Mansion.

43
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,270
The lock is broken.

44
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,150
They tried to make them here.

45
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,320
The superior students.

46
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,530
Who are the superior students?

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,540
Johan?

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,670
And...

49
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,720
Who did it?

50
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,560
He escaped.

51
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,690
He ran on foot and escaped.

52
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,020
He ran through the rose bushes.

53
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,030
Ouch!

54
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,070
Are you okay?

55
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,330
This pain...

56
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,660
This pain...

57
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:20,870
Could it be?

58
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,050
I waited in this room.

59
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,510
I waited for Mom to come home...

60
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,930
for Johan to come home...

61
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,140
while reading this picture book.

62
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,100
Humans can become anything.

63
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,150
Franz Bonaparta.

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,530
While they were holding reading seminars
at the Red Rose Mansion,

65
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,150
I was in this room reading this book,

66
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,570
and waiting for Johan to come home.

67
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,700
I was smiling.

68
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,540
I faced the opening door and said

69
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,290
"Welcome home."

70
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,790
Welcome home.

71
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,300
Welcome home.

72
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,510
Welcome home. Welcome home.

73
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,220
Welcome home. Welcome home.

74
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,180
Welcome home. Welcome home.

75
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,230
Welcome home. Welcome home.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,190
Welcome home. Welcome home.

77
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,480
Follow me.

78
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,490
But the door wouldn't open.

79
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,660
No matter how many times I said, "Welcome
home," the door wouldn't open.

80
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,830
It wouldn't open! It wouldn't open!

81
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,370
That's because I...

82
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,040
I remember!

83
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,540
I...

84
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,080
Stop, Nina!

85
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,460
Please don't remember anymore.

86
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,210
Don't try to remember anything.

87
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm the same. I have a lot of painful memories.

88
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,380
You don't need to remember it.

89
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,640
I know. I'll go to Dr. Reichwine's place.

90
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,390
You, too. You're coming home with me.

91
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,020
Let's do what Tenma told us to.

92
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,110
From now on... happy memories...

93
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,490
let's make them.

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,090
Prague Police Station
(Czech Republic)

95
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,170
Please wait a minute, Officer!

96
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,000
What do you mean, all I can do is
sit next to the officer and listen?

97
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,220
We plan to fulfill your request to the fullest.

98
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,010
The fullest?

99
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,930
Even in the best case scenario, I can only
spend 30 minutes with each of them.

100
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,310
Just listening to them should be good enough for you.

101
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,520
It's an exception of exceptions to cooperate
with you this much already.

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,240
It'll be a miracle if we can prepare the 5 witnesses for testimony.

103
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,410
That's why we have to use this chance to
collect as many testimonies as possible.

104
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,240
You're so naive.

105
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:01,740
Huh?

106
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,330
They probably wouldn't want to talk about their own past...

107
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,290
The children from the reading seminars...

108
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,000
All the skeletons that they just found

109
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,300
must have something to do with the former
Czechoslovakian secret police.

110
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,890
However...

111
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,640
the truth, in this case, might just stay in the bushes.

112
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,020
This is the head detective in this case.

113
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,530
This is Mr. Verdeman, a lawyer from Germany.

114
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,940
I leave the rest to you.

115
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm Detective Suk.

116
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,820
Nice to meet you.

117
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,330
I've already arranged a list of questions.

118
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,040
Please do everything exactly as I tell you.

119
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,790
You're only here as an observer.

120
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,590
3 Cerveny Street.

121
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,050
A.k.a. the Red Rose Mansion.

122
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,560
It burned down and this is its current condition.

123
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,230
There's no mistake that in '68,

124
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,060
you participated in a reading seminar there, Mr. Erno.

125
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,650
How about it?

126
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,950
Do you know of the man called Franz Bonaparta?

127
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,910
Would you please be quiet?

128
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,530
You don't have time.

129
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,530
I'm just trying to be careful.

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,330
Are you going to be so careful that you let
this end without getting any information?

131
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,380
You don't understand how much
we had to do just to set this up.

132
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm not sad.

133
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,340
I thought that the mansion was a positive force in my life.

134
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,300
But now, looking at the burned remains
of the mansion, how do I put it...?

135
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,770
I thought that sadness would bubble to the surface.

136
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,770
So you don't feel homesick or anything like that?

137
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,940
Homesick?

138
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,440
Yes. That was like school to you, right?

139
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,820
Mr. Verdeman! Please be quiet. I can't
ask the questions that I've prepared.

140
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,990
I don't know about that...

141
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,870
Sadness... Homesickness...

142
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,950
I don't understand them...

143
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,620
Emotional scars?

144
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,710
What do you mean?

145
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,210
Do you think participating in the reading
seminars has had an effect on your life?

146
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,510
No, not really.

147
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,220
Do you have a family?

148
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,220
You don't have to answer. You have that right.

149
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm divorced.

150
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,230
It wasn't really a problem with us.

151
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,940
Our kids, my eldest son and his little
brother, committed suicide.

152
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,080
They didn't really have problems.

153
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,040
Why did those two...

154
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,500
Why did they commit suicide?

155
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,040
Is there something you want to say?

156
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,010
I'm saying that your questions
stick too much to the manual.

157
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,340
So, what have we learned so far?

158
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,810
You're just like a kid these days.

159
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,810
You probably hit on women using a manual.

160
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,150
You look just like a father.

161
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,780
I don't have a father, but I'd never want a parent like you.

162
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,160
The next person may come in.

163
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,030
My memories of the reading seminars?

164
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,330
Anything you can tell us. No matter how small.

165
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,660
"The God of Peace is very busy."

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,790
Wh-What are you doing?

167
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,880
"He doesn't have time to look in the mirror.
He blows his trumpet every day."

168
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,760
The God of Peace by Klaus Poppe.

169
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,880
You know of this, don't you?

170
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,050
Yeah, I kind of remember it...

171
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,140
I also like the one about the monster from
the west and the monster from the east.

172
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,400
What do you like about these books?

173
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,440
How do I put it? They take me away to a different world.

174
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,530
A different world?

175
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,490
Yeah.

176
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,540
Crying, being happy, being scared...
All those feelings just seem to go away.

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,790
Why does this book make you feel that way?

178
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,960
I don't know.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,790
But it's true that I don't feel anything.

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,550
Even your own name disappears.

181
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,220
That is true freedom.

182
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,550
That's how I feel.

183
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,180
Why do you feel that way?

184
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,310
Did Franz Bonaparta teach you to be that way?

185
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,310
Who was that person? The person who read to us?

186
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,770
Is that what you remember clearly from the seminars?

187
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,270
What I remember clearly?

188
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,870
One day, a man came to visit the mansion.

189
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,790
They said he was from a radio program.

190
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,790
He liked the song "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

191
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,790
He told us about The Wizard of Oz.

192
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,250
Who was he?

193
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,510
Tell me about him!

194
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,260
What are you doing?

195
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,050
Please tell me!

196
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,800
Get a hold of yourself!

197
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,260
Please, anything!

198
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,600
What are you after?

199
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,270
It seems like you're asking questions
for your own personal information.

200
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,980
You're here for personal reasons, too.

201
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:29,110
You're the young detective who was framed for a
series of incidents because of the secret police.

202
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,950
That's you, right, Detective Suk?

203
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,700
You've become desperate to clear your own name.

204
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,290
Am I wrong?

205
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm the same.

206
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,040
My father was arrested for being
a spy for former East Germany.

207
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,840
I always believed that my father was innocent.

208
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,220
But my father really was a spy.

209
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,970
I can't believe in anything anymore.

210
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,150
But now, I'm trying to prove that a certain man is innocent,

211
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,860
and I'm trying to find something to believe in again.

212
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,950
The person whom the witness is talking about...
The man from the radio program...

213
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,450
is my father.

214
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,620
My father might have been part of the brainwashing
experiments at the Red Rose Mansion.

215
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,830
I mustn't look away.

216
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,460
I have to know the truth.

217
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,260
May I go home now?

218
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,970
No, just a little longer.

219
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,720
The man I was talking about told me this...

220
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,970
"Run away from here."

221
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,440
"There is a good place somewhere over the rainbow."

222
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
"That is where your family is."

223
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,530
"Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz was able to go home in the end."

224
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,950
"You should ran away from here, too."

225
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,830
After that, I cut all my ties to the mansion.

226
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,460
Is that enough?

227
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,960
My wife and kids are waiting for me.

228
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,130
Y-Yeah.

229
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,600
We mustn't avert our eyes.

230
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,060
You're right.

231
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,020
There are two more people to be interviewed.

232
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,810
Yeah, let's continue.

233
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,760
Hey, Dieter. Stop daydreaming and hold this.

234
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,850
It's going to be your desk for studying.

235
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,520
Nina doesn't want to talk about what happened in Prague.

236
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,280
From what you told me, she probably
remembered a lot of her memories.

237
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,740
It seems that the brakes were applied before
the last bit of memory was recovered.

238
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,950
Thanks to you.

239
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,870
I wonder if I did something wrong.

240
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,040
No. You did a good job.

241
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,250
Let's put this desk together already so that
we can have white sausage and beer!

242
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,420
You ate all the white sausage last night.

243
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,550
Really? What have I done?!

244
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,340
Doctor!

245
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,430
We brought your favorite, white sausage!

246
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,390
You're so considerate.

247
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,400
Dr. Reichwine. How are you?

248
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm sorry I haven't gotten in touch with you for so long.

249
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,320
Nina!

250
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,280
Lotte!

251
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,150
I'm sorry to have made you worry.

252
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,410
I m fine.

253
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,910
You know of Eva Heinemann, don't you?

254
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,540
She is currently being pursued by that organization.

255
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,880
I've sent her to you. Please take care of her.

256
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,130
Please take care of Nina and Dieter, too.

257
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,470
It's going to be over soon.

258
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:15,100
In my mind, this is the only way to end this series of events.

259
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,060
From Kenzo Tenma.

260
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,950
That's a letter I received three days ago.

261
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,740
There's been no sign that Eva is trying to get here.

262
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,280
I wonder where this was mailed from.

263
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,740
The stamp is hard to read.

264
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,750
Can you look it up, Karl?

265
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,620
Yeah, probably.

266
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,630
And then you could find out where Tenma is?

267
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,840
However, what concerns me is this last sentence.

268
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,220
"In my mind, this is the only way
to end this series of events."

269
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,980
Well, let's finish putting that desk together.

270
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,480
I hope I still have my coordination after that beer.

271
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,490
Dr. Reichwine.

272
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,320
I want to remember everything.

273
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,000
Are you prepared for when that happens?

274
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,380
I'm willing to use any method to get my memory back.

275
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,420
Even if you're serious about it, I don't want to do anything.

276
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,430
But, if that's what you really want...

277
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,140
Are you okay, Nina?

278
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,930
Yes, I am, Dr. Gillen.

279
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,310
Except...

280
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,440
the things I talk about under hypnosis...

281
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,570
might be extremely scary.

282
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,820
Do you think you can handle it?

283
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,620
I'll be fine. Let's face this together.

284
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:59,160
Close your eyes, take a deep breath,
and relax your whole body.

285
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,010
Describe your mother for me.

286
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,380
Mom...

287
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,760
Mom... Kind...

288
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,390
Sing... Singing voice...

289
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,520
A beautiful singing voice...

290
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,530
The smell of bean soup.

291
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,780
How about your father?

292
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,070
Dad...

293
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,160
Dad was a government soldier.

294
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,740
A government soldier?

295
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,870
Did you meet him?

296
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,330
No.

297
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,000
Mom said Dad was killed.

298
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,550
Mom was an anti-government activist.

299
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,470
Your father was killed and your mother, who was involved in anti-government activities, fled the country.

300
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,770
Who was she running from?

301
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,060
The three frogs...

302
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,850
hidden.

303
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,440
But, my brother was caught...

304
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,530
by the man with the glasses.

305
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,240
Your brother was caught...

306
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,990
The Red Rose Mansion!

307
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,450
A lot of people died!

308
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,950
Is that what your brother saw?

309
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,710
It hurts!

310
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,170
It hurts!

311
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,920
The rose's thorns hurt.

312
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,630
Welcome home.

313
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,890
Nina...

314
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,300
Nina...

315
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,470
I know where Tenma's letter was mailed from.

316
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,730
Where?

317
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,440
Frankfurt.

318
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,020
Nina.

319
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,150
You've remembered everything, haven't you, Nina?

320
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,650
I'm not Nina.

321
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,360
Then who are you?

322
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,570
I don't want to tell you.

323
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,910
Don't worry. There's nothing to be afraid of. Tell me.

324
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,660
Who are you?

325
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,950
I don't want to tell you.

326
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Don't worry. There's nothing to be afraid of.

327
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,790
I don't want to tell you.

328
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm home.

329
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,510
I'm home.

330
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,550
I'm going to clap my hands.

331
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,680
When I do that you'll wake up from your hypnosis.

332
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,190
Nina!

333
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,270
She's all right.

334
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,200
Did I say something terrible?

335
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,030
No.

336
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,910
You wouldn't tell me that.

337
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,250
But you remembered it all.

338
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,620
2 Days Later

339
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,180
Dr. Reichwine, Dieter.

340
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,970
Forgive me for leaving so suddenly.

341
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,140
I'm going to Frankfurt, where Tenma is.

342
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,060
I understand it all.

343
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,570
I know who I am.

344
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,150
I know where Johan came from and where he will go.

345
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,160
If I go, I could end it all.

346
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,700
If I go, I could save Tenma.

347
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:43,130
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

348
00:22:44,220 --> 00:23:00,530
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

349
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:25,610
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

350
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,090
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

351
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,720
A Pleasant Dinner Table
