1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,950
In the beginning, my dressing room was sometimes
so full of flowers that you could barely get in it.

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,090
And then I started getting designer clothes and bags.

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,260
And after that I started getting gems
bigger than I had ever seen.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,010
I had no idea who it was all from.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,310
It was you, wasn't it?

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,230
I felt something special when I saw
your show for the first time.

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,270
Something special?

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,020
Do you mean my boobs or my butt?

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,030
Something you can't see with your eyes.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,360
I wish you had just come to my dressing
room to meet me in person.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,030
Just as myself?

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,080
Huh?

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,040
What do you mean?

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,670
It seems like you're willing to listen to me.

15
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,460
The Baby's Depression

16
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,920
It's delicious!

17
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,010
I've never had food this good before.

18
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,880
Please eat as much as you like.

19
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,100
Do you eat this all the time?

20
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,890
Yes, but food is only good as the company it's had with.

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,900
I always eat alone. Do you always have company for meals?

22
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,490
Yes. I pay a lot of people to eat with me.

23
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,910
What? Why do you do that?

24
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,120
Why do I pay people to eat with me?

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,620
Looking back, even though I had a lot
of people over to have a good time,

26
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,580
I always felt like I was eating alone.

27
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,170
How about now?

28
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,380
I'm actually having fun!

29
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,510
I'm so glad!

30
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,390
Do you think we could make this a regular
thing where we have dinner together?

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,600
Sure! I might get tired of eating the
same thing all the time though.

32
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,060
It's been strange lately.

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,100
What has?

34
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,270
I've never felt like this before.

35
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,110
I've made my own kingdom in Frankfurt.

36
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,870
I've fought to create a new order.

37
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,410
My dream is to become just like Fuhrer Hitler.

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,710
My dream is to become a dancer.

39
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,550
What I'm doing now isn't what I had in mind.

40
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,630
But everyone is mesmerized when I'm dancing.

41
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,760
People feel better when they see me dance.

42
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm scared.

43
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,640
Huh?

44
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
This is the first time I've felt like this.

45
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm scared!

46
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,900
What are you saying?

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,530
Uh, umm, I mean...

48
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,410
The three murders that happened in the last month.

49
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,700
It was Johan's will.

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,460
Yes. Just as you said.

51
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,210
I understand the meanings of the murders of the
Bilker Investment Bank employee, Fritz Overt,

52
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,420
and the general store owner's daughter, Frieder Schelling.

53
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,720
It was to hide scandals.

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,350
We can understand those two murders.

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,930
But,

56
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,730
the foreign trader, Erich Klemperer.

57
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,440
Do you know him?

58
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,730
He doesn't have anything to do with Johan.

59
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,740
Do you really think so?

60
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,700
Do we really know where Johan came from?

61
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,380
Or are you hiding something from me?

62
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,920
There's no use worrying about that.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,220
Anyway, you've found out where Nina is, haven't you?

64
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,980
She has left the psychologist's house in
Munich, and she's coming to Frankfurt.

65
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,190
Our top priority right now is to secure Nina.

66
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:43,700
I'm sure you know this already, but may
I remind you that she is Johan's sister.

67
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,870
Those eyes back then...

68
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,790
Her eyes, when she held a gun at me when
we burned down the Turkish district...

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,210
It makes me shiver just thinking about them.

70
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,630
Isn't it wonderful?

71
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,930
Are you talking about the program you built?

72
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,600
I only helped with it.

73
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,730
It was all my master's doing.

74
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,150
It's all proceeding according to his program.

75
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,080
Is it really all proceeding according to his program?

76
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,710
There it is!

77
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,000
It's my favorite.

78
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,220
This time it's my treat.

79
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,270
Isn't it good? This is the best ice cream stand in Frankfurt.

80
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,690
I finally feel at ease.

81
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,240
I've been pretty tense lately.

82
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,740
Why?

83
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,740
Why am I?

84
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,450
I don't need a bodyguard.

85
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,750
It's Mr. Capek's orders.

86
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,380
You don't have to worry about me.

87
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,470
No one out there knows who I really am.

88
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,470
It will cause us a lot of grief if we let you
go out on one of your joyrides again.

89
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,980
I don't go out on joyrides.

90
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,730
Three people have died to hide your scandals.

91
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
I wonder how many people I can
kill without getting caught.

92
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,740
Who do you think gave you the power you hold now?

93
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
The four founders of the organization

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,250
Professor Geidlitz, General Wolf, Mr. Capek,

95
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,210
and your late father.

96
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,470
I know you think you can just take your
father's place, but it's not an easy task.

97
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,100
We don't know if you're cut out for the job.

98
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,810
Are you trying to say you're the one
who's going to take his place?

99
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,320
I know all about your hidden scandals.

100
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,160
You know what happens to people who know about them.

101
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,040
You can't threaten me.

102
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:48,380
I don't want to make you, the leader of
the extremists in Frankfurt, my enemy.

103
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I had a good time tonight.

104
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,770
So did I!

105
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm glad I called you.

106
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,530
Call anytime.

107
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,830
It's been a long time since I've been able to walk
around town like this, without a bodyguard.

108
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,170
Will you be okay? Should I escort you?

109
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,130
You're... going to protect me?

110
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,270
Don't worry. My hotel is just over there.

111
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,270
Wow! You live in a hotel?

112
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,350
This isn't much, but please...

113
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,730
I don't need it.

114
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,280
Good-bye.

115
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,950
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,450
It's just a habit.

117
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,280
Let me apologize.

118
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,590
I've always bought people with money.

119
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,810
May I...

120
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
come to your hotel room?

121
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,070
People call you The Baby,

122
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,070
but what's your real name?

123
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,080
My name is...

124
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,790
Yes, we know where the sister is.

125
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,880
I've been trying to reach The Baby by
phone, but he hasn't been answering.

126
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,550
I'm going to see him in person.

127
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,510
Yes. Good-bye.

128
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,730
Hello.

129
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,100
It's me.

130
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,980
Th-The Baby's...

131
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,650
The Baby's...

132
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,200
been murdered.

133
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,480
Come on.

134
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,480
Don't be scared.

135
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Don't be scared.

136
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,530
Are you okay, Mr. Capek?

137
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,240
You look pale.

138
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,420
Please forgive my rude question,

139
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,500
but were you the one who had The Baby killed?

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,260
What a stupid question!

141
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:31,100
The news of The Baby's death will be well known by dawn.

142
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,350
With his death, the balance within the organization may crumble.

143
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,610
I don't know what will happen.

144
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,110
We are bodyguards.

145
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,110
We just carry out whatever job were hired for.

146
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,120
But, if this was your doing, you've made a mockery out of it.

147
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:00,090
Why do you think I called you here
after I heard of The Baby's death?

148
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,840
Because you felt threatened.

149
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,090
Do you have any clues on who killed The Baby?

150
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,980
Are we really controlling Johan's actions?

151
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,230
What are you scared of?

152
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,740
Everything is going according to plan.

153
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,450
Everything...

154
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,500
is proceeding according to his program.

155
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,090
Fine. Let's take you somewhere safe.

156
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,220
I have a villa in Idstein.

157
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,300
No one knows about it.

158
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,020
Let's go there.

159
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,890
But what about the twin sister?

160
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,730
You said you knew where she was.

161
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,520
Yes. She's here in Frankfurt.

162
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,230
She's at a motel called Tourette.

163
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,240
Securing her is the most effective
thing we can do to keep me safe.

164
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,290
We'll get on it in the morning.

165
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,330
No! Right now!

166
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,330
I understand.

167
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,470
I've contacted two of our men and told them
to meet us at your villa in Idstein.

168
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,440
The Baby sent his guards away last night
so he could do whatever he wanted.

169
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,690
Were with you, so don't worry.

170
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,070
Yeah.

171
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,070
You weren't hurt that day at the convention
center when you were shot at.

172
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,830
You're a very lucky man.

173
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,830
Milan.

174
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,130
Milan, listen to me.

175
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,340
I've met someone incredible.

176
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,350
Nice to meet you. I'm Peter Capek.

177
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,560
You've shown me something amazing.

178
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Those are your reading seminars!

179
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,480
Will you let me ask you a few questions about your new...

180
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,030
Read this.

181
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,290
Everything is drawn in these.

182
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,460
How beautiful. What beautiful children.

183
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,430
These children are growing exactly as
Franz Bonaparta's program dictates.

184
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,220
These are the children who will lead the human race, right?

185
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,490
Stop...

186
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,740
Stop the car.

187
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,300
What's wrong?

188
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,340
Your villa is just at the end of this road.

189
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,930
What did you say earlier?

190
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,890
Huh?

191
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,220
You had two other guards...

192
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,930
Yes, they are at the villa.

193
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,980
They may be there already.

194
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,980
Are you sure that they won't leak any information?

195
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,650
Huh?

196
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,900
Is there some kind of guarantee that no one knows that I'm going to my villa?

197
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,780
Yes, they are trustworthy.

198
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,790
We're not going there.

199
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,500
Hold on a second.

200
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,920
Where are we going then?

201
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,500
We're just not going there.

202
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,760
But we'll just end up driving all night then.

203
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,140
That's an order.

204
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,640
I know you feel your life is in danger.

205
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,690
We're going to the villa.

206
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,100
A l-lignter.

207
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,680
He wasn't going for his gun.

208
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,770
It's me.

209
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,270
Is anyone...

210
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,320
here?

211
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,150
J-Johan.

212
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,280
Many people drank that wine...

213
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,160
at the Red Rose Mansion.

214
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't worry.

215
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,760
Look, I'm drinking it, too.

216
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,930
What happened to the bodyguards
who were supposed to be here?

217
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,650
Why did you kill The Baby?

218
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,030
We were supposed to be working together.

219
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,170
You helped us and we were to find your sister.

220
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,750
Everything is going according to plan.

221
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,840
We... We'll soon have your sister.

222
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,470
If anything happens to me, your sister will...

223
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,720
I won't let you have your way.

224
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,520
Got it? Everything is going according to my calculations.

225
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,650
What am I?

226
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,780
The monster inside of me isn't inside of me.

227
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,070
It's outside of me.

228
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,830
What are you saying?

229
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,250
Franz Bonaparta...

230
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,470
is alive.

231
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:43,100
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

232
00:22:44,190 --> 00:23:00,500
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

233
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:25,580
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

234
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:34,060
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

235
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,450
