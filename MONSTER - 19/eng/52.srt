1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,230
I first became aware of myself in a coin locker.

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,280
In that eerie darkness.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,370
Blue...

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,810
The blue sky...

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,510
The blue ocean...

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,590
And...

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,030
The blue window frame.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,690
I want to go to Tunisia.

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,860
Gunther Milch, arrested in 1988 for robbing an
armored car from the Bavarian BASF Bank.

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,630
Did time in Badenburg Prison.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,920
Escaped in '91.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,120
Spent half a year cutting through the iron bars...

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,400
with a nail sharpened into a file.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,020
Was caught three days later...

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,900
and was sent to kreiner Prison.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,320
But in 1993...

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,530
escaped through a drainage pipe in the bathroom.

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,520
The prison uniform, soaked with excrement, was
found three days later on a nearby riverbank.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,760
Arrested for attempted robbery of a Maximilian
& Co. paycheck delivery truck.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,480
In '97, escaped from a shower stall in Ingeburg Prison...

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,850
after spending a year, and a half
digging a hole with a spoon

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,120
The toilet here stinks pretty bad.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,620
I escaped through a sewer once, so I know.

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,580
Shut up and walk!

25
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,190
What a gloomy look.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,950
Face forward.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,950
If I'm not mistaken, that's Dr. Tenma.

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,570
Keep walking!

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,740
I didn't think he'd look so depressed and hopeless.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,770
I'll ask you one more time.

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,280
The Lawyer

32
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,410
In '86, the poisonings at Eisler Memorial
of Director Heinemann...

33
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,150
Surgical Director Oppenheim, and Dr. Boyer...

34
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,900
Do you still deny any involvement?

35
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,880
Since we started the interrogation,
you haven't said a word.

36
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,020
Enough of this!

37
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,540
Dr. Tenma, what are you up to?

38
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,240
Even if you keep silent, you'll still be
prosecuted and made to stand trial...

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,510
and you won't stand a chance in court.

40
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,660
Talk to us.

41
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,900
Tell us everything and remove the
burden from your shoulders.

42
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,150
What happened?

43
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,740
What's the commotion?

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,640
Milch has stomach problems!

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,040
Doctor.

46
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,810
Dr. Dürer!

47
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,790
Where's Dr. Dürer?

48
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,630
The doctor's currently in the interrogation room.

49
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,780
Peter drank some sort of cleaning fluid.

50
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,270
Is he choking on his own vomit?!

51
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,790
What?!

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,340
I...

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,900
I can't breathe...

54
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,310
Damn.

55
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,190
I guess we'll have to use him.

56
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,240
That doctor.

57
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,770
Please have a look at him.

58
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,540
Does it hurt here?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,480
How about here?

60
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,700
Bring some hot water...

61
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,780
a towel, and a change of clothes!

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,270
And get out!

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,310
It might be contagious!

64
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
Why are you pretending to be sick?

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,390
Show some mercy.

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,060
You're the first doctor to see through my act so quickly.

67
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,770
Heh, I figured that if I got sent to the hospital...

68
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,840
I'd have a better chance of escaping.

69
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,600
Do you know how I rob armored cars?

70
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,460
I jump out in front of the truck and pretend to be sick.

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,950
When the guards run out of the truck to help me...

72
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,750
my accomplices show up with guns.

73
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,590
I've never killed anyone.

74
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,880
Unlike you.

75
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,380
How about it?

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,830
Wanna escape with me?

77
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,570
You've got a gloomy-looking face.

78
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,040
Staying in a place like this will suck the life out of you.

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,480
I hate cramped places the most!

80
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,140
I first became aware of myself in a coin locker.

81
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,910
In that eerie darkness...

82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,720
When my parents went to work, they put me
in there and I'd eagerly await their return.

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,270
"Let's go to Tunisia someday."

84
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,150
My parents used to say that.

85
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,510
My dad said...

86
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,100
"If work goes well today, let's go to Tunisia."

87
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,820
But I waited for three days, and
they never came back for me.

88
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,360
My parents must have left me behind
and went to Tunisia on their own.

89
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,150
I'm going, too.

90
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,600
I'll get out of this cramped place...

91
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,440
and go to Tunisia.

92
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,810
What a gloomy-looking face.

93
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,340
There's no hope in your face.

94
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,330
Not like mine, where hope exists.

95
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,920
What will you do if they catch you again?

96
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,830
I'll just escape again.

97
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,470
No matter how many times it takes...

98
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,830
Now then...

99
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,490
Are you going to say nothing again today?

100
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,840
The truth is...

101
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,600
even as we speak, something terrible is happening.

102
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,120
You need to hear the truth quickly.

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,830
But you won't believe it.

104
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
You won't believe a word I say.

105
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,810
But I have to fight.

106
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,310
No matter how many times...

107
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,490
The truth...

108
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,560
I have to tell you the truth.

109
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,880
Now...

110
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,610
I sentence the accused to twenty years in prison.

111
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,310
When my dad was found guilty...

112
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,080
my path in life was decided.

113
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,620
After the war...

114
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,390
my dad moved from Sudeten,
Czechoslovakia, to Germany...

115
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,440
where he opened a small radio station in 1949.

116
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,440
However, during the cold war between
East and West Germany in the 60s...

117
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,380
he was arrested for being a spy...

118
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,850
and for the murder of a Bundestag member's secretary.

119
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,670
His arrest was a huge shock to the West German society.

120
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,680
My dad pleaded innocent...

121
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,840
but was still sentenced to twenty years in prison.

122
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,350
My mom continued to proclaim my dad's innocence...

123
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,470
until she died in '71.

124
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,260
My dad died in prison in '72, filled with resentment.

125
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,200
In '73, while I was in high school...

126
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,950
my dad's innocence was proven.

127
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,620
After I graduated from Düsseldorf University...

128
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,080
I got a job at the Hoffmann law firm...

129
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,310
a major firm at the time.

130
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,910
I won my first case...

131
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,470
proving the charges were false
and the defendant was innocent.

132
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,330
After that, I consistently won a not-guilty
verdict in every case I argued.

133
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,750
I, Fritz Verdeman...

134
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,040
went from being the son of a spy, to
a "star" in the legal world, overnight.

135
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,900
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

136
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,630
The radio station my dad managed...

137
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,400
started and ended each day with this song.

138
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,620
To people like you who lived in the East...

139
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,060
this song may seem like a symbol of freedom.

140
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,580
Yes.

141
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,560
My dad died in prison while asserting his innocence.

142
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,800
In order to let him rest in peace...

143
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,790
I want to take on every case in which...

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,360
there's a possibility that the defendant
may actually be innocent.

145
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,390
Please tell me more...

146
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,640
about Dr. Tenma's case.

147
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,650
Elsa, how'd your checkup at the maternity center go?

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,190
It went very well.

149
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,150
They said I could expect the baby any day now.

150
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,580
You just passed a man in the lobby, right?

151
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,750
Yeah.

152
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,270
Was he the one you mentioned before?

153
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,140
Yeah.

154
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,410
Alfred Baul...

155
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,670
He asked me to represent Dr. Tenma with him.

156
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,690
Didn't you turn down Dr. Tenma's case the other day?

157
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,720
Yes, because the client at the time
was Hans Georg Schuwald.

158
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,220
I didn't know why a billionaire would
want me to defend Dr. Tenma.

159
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,020
But this time, the reason is clear.

160
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,800
What reason would that be?

161
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,270
The clients who brought the case to Baul were...

162
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,540
the patients whose lives were saved by Dr. Tenma.

163
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,540
This much is certain...

164
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,770
Dr. Tenma was an outstanding doctor.

165
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,980
Why don't you take the case?

166
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:25,270
If I won the case, the billionaire
would pay me handsomely.

167
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,520
But not so with the patients.

168
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,060
If you were working solely for profit...

169
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,610
you'd have a bigger office by now.

170
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,140
Hey...

171
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,560
This is "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

172
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,000
Turn it off.

173
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,940
Please turn it off.

174
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,020
Okay.

175
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,530
That aside, let's go get something to eat.

176
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,160
For the new life that's about to be born...

177
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,760
you have to eat enough for two.

178
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,060
Yeah.

179
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,470
The baby's kicking because it's hungry.

180
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,630
So, honey, which restaurant would you like to go to?

181
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,710
Let's see...

182
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,460
How about that one place?

183
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,540
And then he...

184
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,980
disappeared in the midst of the blaze.

185
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,880
That was the last time...

186
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,000
I saw Johan.

187
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,290
Should I start from the beginning again?

188
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,230
I'll repeat it as many times as I have to.

189
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,750
As many times... as the truth takes...

190
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,260
You're the fourth one.

191
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,960
The lawyers who wanted to represent
me in court all suggested...

192
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,910
that I plead guilty to some of the charges...

193
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,950
to lighten my sentence.

194
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,270
That's all they could talk about.

195
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,010
I see.

196
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,960
It seems to me that you don't really care
about proving your innocence...

197
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,510
rather, you want to prove the existence
of a certain young man named Johan.

198
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,750
That's right.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,990
If that's the case, you don't need a lawyer.

200
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,700
Dr. Tenma...

201
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,230
When did all of this <i>really</i> begin?

202
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,280
Like I said, when a boy who was shot
in the head was brought in...

203
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,990
No, did anything happen before that?

204
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,670
A Turkish woman...

205
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,190
<i>Give my husband back!</i>

206
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,810
<i>People's lives aren't equal.</i>

207
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,350
Everyone's lives are equal.

208
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,320
I don't know...

209
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,200
if I made the right decision.

210
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,240
I can't tell if a patient is good or evil.

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,230
My crime was...

212
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,220
My crime was saving that boy's life.

213
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,320
But...

214
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,310
But...

215
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,260
Does a doctor have the right to choose to save a life...

216
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,440
based on whether the patient is good or evil?

217
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,490
<i>Lives aren't equal.</i>

218
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,550
They're all equal.

219
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,160
I don't know...

220
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,480
Even now, I can't decide...

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,760
It's the same way with lawyers.

222
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,950
We don't know if the people we defend are good or evil.

223
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,950
Here is the list of people who asked me to represent you...

224
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,870
Mr. Michael Hotter.

225
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,960
Mr. Stefan kramp.

226
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,380
Mr. Franz Kiefer.

227
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,580
Mr. Rudolf Huber.

228
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,680
Mr. kiefer...

229
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,090
Mr. Huber...

230
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,810
They're doing well?

231
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,340
Mr. Horst Henschel.

232
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,200
Mr. Arnold Hoss.

233
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,400
Mr. Hoss, too...

234
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,950
That's right... I wonder if he's living
happily with his grandkids?

235
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,470
Time's up.

236
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,670
I see...

237
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,270
That's good...

238
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,320
Dr. Tenma...

239
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,590
I accept.

240
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,300
I will represent you.

241
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,790
Lawyers can't tell if a person is good or evil, either.

242
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,350
When we represent someone, there's
only one thin we can do...

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,830
Have faith.

244
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,350
One more glass.

245
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,280
I said one more!

246
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,070
But, ma'am...

247
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,790
Since when did this bar start refusing to serve customers?

248
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,100
Wait!

249
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,330
You just laughed at me, didn't you?

250
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,810
N-No...

251
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,740
You did!

252
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,320
You looked at me and laughed!

253
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,400
I know you!

254
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,360
You...

255
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,240
used to come to my house to kiss ass.

256
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,280
You're the assistant manager at Nordrhein-West Bank.

257
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,110
What's with that look?

258
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,470
After going to the trouble of coming back here.

259
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,170
Eva Heinemann has returned to Düsseldorf!

260
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,190
Thank you for filling me in on these important details...

261
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,180
Dr. Reichwein.

262
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,530
As soon as I heard you were going
to be Dr. Tenma's lawyer...

263
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,490
I started trying to get in touch with you.

264
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,560
I apologize for being difficult to reach.

265
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,000
I've been all over the place asking about the case.

266
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,480
Asking about?

267
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,950
Yes, asking Dr. Tenma's supporters, his former patients.

268
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,710
Did they say anything?

269
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,250
Dr. Tenma seems to be an outstanding doctor.

270
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,820
Then...

271
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,050
did you get any important evidence?

272
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,450
No.

273
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,890
I'm hoping to find a witness to confirm Dr. Tenma's alibi.

274
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,000
At any rate, if we want to prove Tenma's innocence...

275
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,470
we need to be able to prove that
this Johan person actually exists.

276
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,900
Dr. Reichwein.

277
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,250
Huh?

278
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,490
About Dr. Tenma attempting to
shoot this young man, Johan...

279
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,460
I'd like you to withhold that part of your testimony.

280
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,830
Huh?

281
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,680
But... that's the only event that proves Johan exists.

282
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,720
Whether or not Johan exists, Tenma is still innocent.

283
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,020
Hear me out, Dr. Reichwein.

284
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,220
All this country wants is a scapegoat.

285
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,900
My child will be born soon.

286
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,920
For my unborn child's sake, I want true justice...

287
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,370
The judges and prosecutors who want an easy solution...

288
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,000
have groundlessly sentenced innocent people
for crimes they never committed.

289
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,590
Our unjust country must repent for its sins.

290
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,680
That's what's important, Dr. Reichwein.

291
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,640
R-Right.

292
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,690
I'm looking for a particular person right now.

293
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,200
Huh?

294
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,880
She may know something vital.

295
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,850
She...

296
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,330
She?

297
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,760
Dr. Tenma's former fiancée...

298
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,960
Eva Heinemann.

299
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,670
Is something wrong, Dr. Reichwein?

300
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,710
She's here.

301
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,910
She came with me to this city...

302
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,630
That woman...

303
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,910
They're all laughing... Everyone is laughing at me.

304
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,730
They take one look at me and laugh.

305
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,300
Eva, about what I said...

306
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,730
I'm listening!

307
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,440
Shut up already.

308
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,010
Please meet with the lawyer.

309
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,150
For Tenma's sake.

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
Huh?

311
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,070
I told you before, didn't I?

312
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,390
I...

313
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,110
actually tried to shoot him, you know.

314
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,100
I was surprised when you first told me about that.

315
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,910
But you didn't shoot him.

316
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,320
That's right, I didn't shoot...

317
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,390
Do you know why?

318
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,550
Because it would've been a problem if he died!

319
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,430
I can't let the man who ruined my life die that easily.

320
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,950
I want him to rot in prison for the rest of his life...

321
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,170
forever regretting that he dumped me.

322
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,920
She fell asleep.

323
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,750
What happened? Did you have a dream?

324
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,460
I heard... three gunshots...

325
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,360
I didn't...

326
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,750
I didn't see him...

327
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,520
The blonde boy...

328
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,320
Eva...

329
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,560
Have...

330
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,680
you seen Johan?

331
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,800
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

332
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,800
A symbol of freedom...

333
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,640
Mr. Verdeman, your wife...

334
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,050
She's gone into labor, and she was
taken to the maternity center.

335
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,790
What? Really?

336
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,500
Mr. klinger, call Mr. Baul immediately.

337
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,860
Yes, sir.

338
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,650
Please ask him to meet with Dr. Tenma in my place.

339
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,790
Nice to meet you.

340
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,360
I'm your lawyer, Baul.

341
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,820
I was asked to meet with you today...

342
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,990
How are you doing? Getting enough sleep?

343
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,600
Yes.

344
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,740
That's good.

345
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,100
Oops...

346
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,120
I was originally right-handed.

347
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,720
I can't get used to holding a pen with my left hand.

348
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,430
My right hand won't move anymore.

349
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,460
Remember me now?

350
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,660
I have lost quite a bit of weight...

351
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,030
Well, you know, I impressed even myself...

352
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,190
when I escaped that sea of fire.

353
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,530
You actually shot me.

354
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,120
My left hand...

355
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,880
may not be used to holding a pen
but it can handle a gun just fine.

356
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,840
The truth is...

357
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,710
I'm thinking of killing someone.

358
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,040
Your former fiancée...

359
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,080
Eva Heinemann.

360
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

361
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

362
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

363
