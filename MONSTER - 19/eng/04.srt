1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,920
How are you feeling, Mr. Junkers?

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,660
Mr. Junkers, do you recognize me?

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,060
Can you see this finger?

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,260
How about it? Can you answer me?

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,950
What's that?

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,080
The monster... is coming...

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,750
What's that, Mr. Junkers?

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,790
The monster... is coming...

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,690
Coming? What's coming?

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,490
The monster is coming...

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,360
The monster... is coming...

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,160
The monster?!

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,000
Night of the Execution

14
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,370
Junkers...

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,030
I know you're able to speak.

16
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,640
Of the four murders
of middle-aged couples

17
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,340
in the past two years,

18
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,410
you were seen near the scene
of three of them, you see.

19
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,280
How about it, Adolph Junkers?

20
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,630
Never mind. We know that
you are a lock picker.

21
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,360
Your job is just to open locks.

22
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,100
Slitting throats
in a single stroke...

23
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,040
is not something you could do.
That means there were

24
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,840
other perpetrators
in addition to yourself.

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,480
I think that there would have to be
at least three people

26
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,180
in order to open a strong lock,

27
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,850
and murder a middle-aged couple
without resistance...

28
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,060
We're almost finished
making a list of men who use knives.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,270
It's just a matter of time
before we pinpoint your colleagues.

30
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,660
Whether you talk, or not.

31
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,340
But that is not what
I really want to know.

32
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,180
Why four couples
from across Germany?

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,690
And why only kill
middle-aged ones without children?

34
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,350
Money and items were stolen,

35
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,120
but the amounts were too small
to split three ways to justify murder.

36
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,870
How about it?
Want to make a plea bargain?

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,740
If you make a statement,
you can escape prosecution...

38
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,070
Who asked you to do this?

39
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,960
Mr. Junkers. that's enough.
That's enough!

40
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,160
I'll have to ask you to
end this questioning!

41
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,590
No, just a little bit more.

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,470
Please leave this room!

43
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,990
That's an order from
his attending physician!

44
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,610
Oh, all right.
I'll come again another day.

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,370
But I will place a guard
to watch him closely

46
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,070
so that he isn't poisoned
or that he doesn't disappear.

47
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,020
Dr. Tenma, for some reason,

48
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,210
all kinds of trouble
seems to happen around you.

49
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,410
What are you trying to say?!

50
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,820
It's just a joke.
Excuse me.

51
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,970
Hey! You, where are you going?!

52
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,080
A walk.

53
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,540
Doing things without permission
is going to get me in trouble!

54
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,990
Even patients need recreation.
We're just going out into the garden.

55
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,420
If you're worried,
do you want to come with us?

56
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,270
It's a warm and pleasant day.

57
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
You can talk, can't you?

58
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,710
On days like this,
it makes you glad you're alive...

59
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,710
I need days like this,
or else it becomes unbearable.

60
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,020
I see people in
life and death situations every day...

61
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,360
That's why it's easier for doctors to
focus on fame and research.

62
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
I used to be like that...

63
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,700
I tried to gain a reputation
and do my own research...

64
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,930
I thought that succeeding in surgery
was a way to fortify my status...

65
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,900
But after performing surgery
on a certain boy, I changed.

66
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,950
He was the elder of fraternal twins.
He'd been shot in the head.

67
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,180
Because I saved him, I was able to
return to being a real doctor...

68
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,050
The weight of people's lives
are all the same...

69
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,720
A doctor's work
is to save those lives...

70
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,870
Thank you.

71
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,850
You can start over.
It's not too late.

72
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,660
Doctor...

73
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,300
You and I are close in age,
but you're like my old man.

74
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,660
You saved my life...

75
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,790
I feel like you're my parent...

76
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,070
I suddenly have a big kid, huh?

77
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,310
When I was little,
I wanted a mechanical clock...

78
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,680
Huh?!

79
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,150
You know...

80
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,580
The kind where a nutcracker doll
would stroll out on the hour...

81
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,720
Every day,

82
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,950
I would press my face against
the show window of the watch store...

83
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,290
My first break in was that store...

84
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,170
They caught me right away
and I didn't get the clock...

85
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,570
But, after that,
break ins became my job...

86
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,080
At first, it was only because
I wanted that clock...

87
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,210
I only wanted the clock...

88
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,320
I...

89
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,260
Tell them everything...

90
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,420
Tell the police everything
and start over from scratch...

91
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,300
Killed...

92
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,140
My associates, all of them...
They were all killed...

93
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,280
Who killed them?!

94
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,280
The one you called "the monster"?

95
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,050
Make this one yours, now.

96
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,530
I went through a lot of trouble
to set this up.

97
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,400
She's the daughter of a member of
the state parliament, you know.

98
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,900
She is beautiful and intelligent.
She's really something...

99
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,970
I'll have to meet her first.

100
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,600
But... I guess...

101
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,710
I should do as you say
and settle down...

102
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,780
You should!

103
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,980
For someone with your prestige
to not have a wife... Huh?

104
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,520
Hey!

105
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,930
<i>The kind where a nutcracker doll
would pop out every hour...</i>

106
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,100
This is it!

107
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,440
Excuse me!
About the clock in the window...

108
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,500
Hey! What's going on?!
It's already time for your date! Hey!

109
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,780
<i>You can start over.
It's not too late.</i>

110
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,070
Officer... Policeman on watch...
You're there, aren't you?

111
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,710
I'll tell you everything.

112
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,180
But can you call Dr. Tenma, too?

113
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,710
Officer?

114
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,990
Officer?

115
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,810
It's late, but can I visit
one of the rooms?

116
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,140
Yes, of course, Dr. Tenma.
What is that?

117
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,150
I found something good.

118
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,190
Hey! What's the matter?!

119
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,770
Get a hold of yourself!

120
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,430
He's dead!

121
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,710
Candy...

122
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,050
Mr. Junkers!

123
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,790
Mr. Junkers!

124
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,200
<i>It's the same as the last time!
Poisoned by candy!</i>

125
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,030
My patient's disappeared!

126
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,770
It's the same thing that happened
nine years ago!

127
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,600
Mr. Junkers!

128
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,140
Mr. Junkers!

129
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,900
It's me, Tenma!

130
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,240
Doctor!

131
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,580
You mustn't come, Doctor!

132
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,990
Let's go back to the hospital,
Mr. Junkers.

133
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,350
Everything will be all right.

134
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,320
Don't, Doctor. You mustn't come!

135
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,960
You mustn't see him, Doctor!

136
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,100
"Him?"

137
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,700
He's the one
who killed my accomplices!

138
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,110
You'll be killed, too!

139
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,650
Wh-Who's there?!

140
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,250
Don't, Doctor! You mustn't come!

141
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,060
It's been a long time, Doctor.
It's me.

142
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,930
Nine years ago, you saved my life,
didn't you?

143
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,630
Nine years ago?!

144
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,170
Have you already forgotten
about those twins?

145
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,640
Johan!

146
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,760
Johan!

147
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,570
That's right, those twins...
You remembered.

148
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,400
Run!
You'll be killed!

149
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,000
Wh-What do you intend to do?

150
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,310
Mr. Junkers is my patient!

151
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,150
What am I going to do?

152
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,250
Execute him.

153
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,290
Don't do it!

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,850
Doctor, run!
He killed my friends!

155
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,400
Wha?!

156
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,960
We were hired by him!
He always called us on the phone!

157
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,270
A large reward
was transferred into our account

158
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,770
after each job was done...

159
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,600
And we'd split it between the three of us!

160
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
Could it be?

161
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,470
The one who ordered the murders
of the four middle-aged couples

162
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,570
was you?

163
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,750
The police were watching me,
so we became a hindrance!

164
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,680
He's already killed Fritz, the Slayer,
and Big Boy Boris!

165
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:08,760
Just before he died, Fritz said,
"We've been hired by a monster."

166
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,530
He doesn't think anything of
killing people!

167
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,780
Run! Doctor, you'll be killed!
Run, Doctor!

168
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,610
You talk too much, Junkers...

169
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,210
Don't!

170
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,810
Don't do it, Johan!

171
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,280
Mr. Junkers doesn't seem to know
who you are, but I do.

172
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,650
I was your attending physician!

173
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,160
You are Johan Leibert, the elder of twins.

174
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,390
You are the son of Michael Leibert,

175
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,660
former advisor of Commerce
in East Germany,

176
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,760
who defected to West Germany
in 1986.

177
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,130
If we know this much about you,
you can't possibly escape!

178
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,670
Don't add to your crimes, Johan!

179
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,010
Johan?
I used that name before...

180
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,590
But that is not my real name...

181
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,660
What do you mean?

182
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,860
My past must not be known...

183
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,090
Those four couples
and the Leiberts, too...

184
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,030
But you're different, Doctor...
You saved my life...

185
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,870
You're like my parent, after all...

186
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,110
Parent... me?!

187
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,870
After all, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here.

188
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,920
Stop it!
You mustn't kill!

189
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,160
Why not?

190
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,320
"Why not?"
What do you think a human life is?!

191
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,920
Because I saved your life,

192
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,470
I was able to go back to being
what a doctor should be!

193
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,430
By saving your life,

194
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,800
I realized that
the weight of each life is equal.

195
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,840
No one has the right to
take another person's life!

196
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,900
I've lived for many years as a doctor
with that in mind.

197
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,810
What's so funny?!

198
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,930
Doctor, after that incident,

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,360
I heard you soon became
the Chief of Surgery...

200
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,660
I'm so glad that you were selected
as the Chief of Surgery.

201
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,900
What is it you want to say?

202
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,270
You're here now because

203
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,310
the Director, the Chief of Surgery
and the Chief died, right?

204
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,980
That's really good...

205
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,120
It can't be... You did it?

206
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,630
After all, you said it yourself...
This is what you wanted.

207
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,130
When I became conscious,
that's what you said

208
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,260
That you hated them so much
you could kill them.

209
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,070
<i>I am not wrong!</i>

210
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,170
<i>That bastard... That bastard...</i>

211
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,580
<i>He's better off dead.</i>

212
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,710
...off dead... off dead...

213
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,250
I did just as you wished, you know.

214
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,120
Doctor... I'm afraid, Doctor...

215
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,700
Doctor... Save me, Doctor...
I don't want to die!

216
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,730
Doctor!

217
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,960
I was supposed to have died back then.

218
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,230
You brought me back to life, Doctor.

219
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,440
Honestly, this rain is terrible.

220
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,710
I hate the rain. It washes away
all the evidence.

221
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,150
What about you, Dr. Tenma?

222
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:07,420
Let's see... That means,
from what you said...

223
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,040
In 1986, right after the Leiberts
defected from East Germany

224
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,340
with their twin children,
the Leibert family was shot

225
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,740
and the parents died.

226
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,110
The elder of the twins, the boy,

227
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,380
was hit in the head
and in serious condition.

228
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,590
You operated on the boy
and saved his life.

229
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,050
But, surprisingly, the boy,

230
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,930
killed the director, chief of surgery
and head of neurosurgery

231
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,290
with poisoned candy and ran away...

232
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,230
And last night, he appeared
after nine years

233
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,870
and killed a state police officer,
once again with poisoned candy...

234
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,910
And shot Adolph Junkers
right in front of your eyes.

235
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,210
He is the one who hired
Junkers and two others

236
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,250
to kill the four middle-aged couples.

237
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,960
His name is Johan Leibert.

238
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,550
And that's all of it?

239
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,100
- Hey.
- Yes?

240
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
Let him go for today.

241
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,610
Would you ever think that someone with
Dr. Tenma's credentials

242
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,270
would ever commit such a crime?

243
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,210
He has an alibi for the time
the policeman was killed,

244
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,850
and there was no gunpowder residue
on his hands.

245
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,880
With this, the clue to solving
the murders

246
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,620
of the four middle-aged couples
is gone.

247
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,630
For the time being, shall we
go after the guy, Johan Leibert?

248
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,000
Inspector Lunge...

249
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,450
The Girl of Heidelberg
