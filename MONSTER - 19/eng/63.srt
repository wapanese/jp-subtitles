1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,910
Do we have a guest list for the reception?

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,880
Yes, I have it.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,420
We have an idea of who was there at the time.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,800
He was after the governor, wasn't he?

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,800
All the attendees were important people.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,640
Most of them probably have enemies.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,470
Well, see if you can find any connections to the culprit.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,310
The Frankfurt police station sure is in a large
uproar over this convention center shooting.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,070
They sure are. Even though they know the identity
of the culprit, they don't know who he was after.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,160
They know his identity?

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,490
Yes. He's a dentist in the redevelopment area.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,870
A dentist? Oh, man.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,250
What's wrong?

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,710
The first place I planned on going
to after I retire was a dentist.

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,010
I've been so busy every day that I haven't been able to go.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,590
Count me out if there are dangerous dentists out there.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,260
Inspector, right here.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,940
I'm Inspector Weissbach, Northrhein-Westphalia Police.

19
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Reinhard Dinger.

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Age: 42.

21
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,070
Occupation: Taxi driver.

22
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,740
Suspected of killing a passenger in Gunter Forest Park.

23
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,530
He was also suspected in the Bilker Investment Bank employee murder case in '97,

24
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,790
the Hofgarten murder in '96,

25
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,790
and a murder on the bank of the Rhine River in '95.

26
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,800
He is wanted as a suspect for all these
murders in the Dusseldorf area.

27
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,140
By signing here, I request that the suspect
be transferred to Northrhein-Westphalia.

28
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,890
Are the arrangements ready?

29
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,810
Yes.

30
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,400
Get out.

31
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,320
All right. Let's go.

32
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,430
Unrelated Murders

33
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Do you want anything to drink?

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,580
No.

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,790
There's no smoking here.

36
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,090
The passenger cars are all non-smoking.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,930
If only you had lived your life strictly to that moral code.

38
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,640
How many people have you killed with those hands?

39
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,900
Counting irreplaceable lives on your fingers...

40
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,650
would even make the stomach of one of your murder victims turn.

41
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,370
This is my last assignment.

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,330
I retire tomorrow.

43
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,090
I had a rather simple career as a
police officer, but it wasn't bad.

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,630
From now on, all I have to do is live happily
with my wife, tend my garden and such.

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,850
That's what life is about.

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,980
I want you to regret the fact that you've
destroyed other people's modest lives.

47
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,110
Even a man who spat at me?

48
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,490
A customer, who I picked up on Addler Street, spat at me as he was getting out.

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,910
Don't tell me that's why you killed him...

50
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,290
People who spit at other people are filth.

51
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,340
A couple who got on at Gerensheim Station were even worse.

52
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,220
They started having sex in the back seat of my car.

53
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,340
In my back seat!

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,350
That's why I killed them.

55
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,690
A young alcoholic with a dirty mouth.

56
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,230
A prostitute that tried to pay her fare with her body.

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,650
A old hag smeared with make-up
that insulted everyone she saw.

58
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,240
A lot of people have gotten in my taxi.

59
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,790
They're all scum.

60
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,830
That's why I killed them.

61
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,420
Then I'll ask you one thing.

62
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,300
What about the Bilker Investment Bank employee?

63
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,720
How was he scum?

64
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,890
He was hard-working and sincere.

65
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,020
That bank worker loved his family.

66
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,210
Because you killed him,

67
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,480
a financial corruption scandal that he was going to blow the whistle on remains a mystery.

68
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,700
The aftertaste from that one was pretty bad.

69
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:21,950
Look.

70
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,830
You talk as if you're delivering heaven's judgment,
but you're really just trying to justify yourself.

71
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,630
I didn't have a choice.

72
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,630
Did someone ask you to kill him?

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,470
I won't tell you.

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,190
I told you there was no smoking.

75
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,660
If you try to smoke in front of me again, I'll kill you.

76
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,370
What made you this way?

77
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,460
I've always had the right answers.

78
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,090
I just got that extra push on the back that day.

79
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,140
That day, there was a man walking his dog in the park.

80
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,560
The man kicked it just because it pooped.

81
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,650
The dog, which was getting kicked, was frightened.

82
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,860
All it did was poop.

83
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,940
I stopped him.

84
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,420
When I came to, I was being taken away by the police.

85
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,510
There was a boy there.

86
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,100
The boy said this to the police officer.

87
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,230
"It's not that man's fault."

88
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,320
"The man with the dog hit him first."

89
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,740
Because of him, I wasn't arrested.

90
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,160
To thank him, I told him I'd take him home in my car.

91
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,040
He said he didn't have a home to go back to.

92
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,460
On top of that, his little sister was with him.

93
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
They were twins.

94
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,260
I didn't know what to do, so I brought
them to my apartment.

95
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,180
It was weird. After they took off their jackets
all they were wearing was pajamas.

96
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,640
It was like they ran away from a hospital.

97
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,190
Now that I think of it the boy had
a bandage around his head.

98
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,520
After we ate that night, I watched the news.

99
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,990
I started to talk to myself like always. I began to curse.

100
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,620
"This stupid world,"

101
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,080
"filled with stupid people,"

102
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,700
"all the scum should die!"

103
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,420
What do you think the boy said?

104
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,300
He said, "You re right."

105
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,050
And then he said this...

106
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,720
People like that are worthless.

107
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,270
That is when he unleashed me.

108
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,650
Get serious!

109
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,030
Are you saying that is when you started killing people?

110
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,830
Thank you for your hard work, Inspector.

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,620
No prob.

112
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,170
You got through your last assignment safely.

113
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,210
Yep. All that's left is to clean out my desk.

114
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,380
Thank you for your dedication over the years.

115
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm kind of disappointed.

116
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,060
I guess I do have one unsolved case.

117
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,190
What's wrong, Inspector?

118
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,070
His little sister was with him.

119
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,070
They were twins.

120
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,910
All they were wearing was pajamas.

121
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,410
It was like they ran away from a hospital.

122
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,420
Do you remember anything from that night?

123
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,170
Anything is fine.

124
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,050
Anything that you can remember is fine.

125
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,970
Your name is Anna. Anna Liebert. Isn't that right?

126
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,060
Now that I think of it, the boy had
a bandage around his head.

127
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,900
The twins. They've completely disappeared.

128
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,650
Inspector!

129
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,870
Huh? When did I meet them?

130
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,080
Let me think. Maybe 11 years ago.

131
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,500
What did they look like?

132
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,510
They had beautiful faces and were blond.

133
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,010
How is this possible?!

134
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,520
The twins that disappeared back then.

135
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,690
The twins that were the key to Dr. Tenma's case.

136
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,400
Geez.

137
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,120
Only 30 hours until I retire.

138
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,010
A vampire, huh?

139
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,940
Isenburg Prison
(Frankfurt)

140
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,060
I see.

141
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,730
13 people...

142
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,770
You can't keep on living unless you drink their blood.

143
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,070
They have to be virgins.

144
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,230
I see.

145
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,400
Let me ask you something.

146
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,200
The incident 3 months ago... The daughter
of the general store owner in Frankfurt,

147
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,280
Frieder Schelling.

148
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,500
Did you drink her blood?

149
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,800
As you said, all your victims until
recently have been young girls.

150
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,130
You've even done background checks
on them before pursuing them.

151
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,930
I understand that you need virgin blood.

152
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,930
But this Frieder Schelling...

153
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,350
She's 21 years old,

154
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,650
although she looks like she's in her teens.

155
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,650
But that's not the problem.

156
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,610
She has worked at a cafe on Seiler Street in Frankfurt since she was 16.

157
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,870
It was close to a famous gymnasium.

158
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,370
The boys there treated her like the Madonna.

159
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,420
But, she had a baby when she was 17.

160
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,380
The rumor was that the father was one of the students from the gymnasium.

161
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,850
Her parents opened a general store after the baby was born.

162
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,180
The parents of the student who impregnated her were rich,

163
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,060
and they opened the shop with the money they received from them.

164
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,230
Did you know that?

165
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,150
You knew so much about the other girls.

166
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,490
Do you drink the blood of non-virgins?

167
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,210
The aftertaste from that one was pretty bad.

168
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,170
Why did you target her?

169
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,170
I met the real thing.

170
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,800
The real thing?

171
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,800
I knew it when I met him.

172
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,850
I was still just a bat pretending to be a vampire.

173
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,190
He was the real thing.

174
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,110
Did he tell you to kill her?

175
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,440
Who was it?

176
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,230
Where did you meet him?

177
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,690
In a suburb of Frankfurt.

178
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,280
Griesheim.

179
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,910
There's a park there just like any other park.

180
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,670
He wrote a girl's name in the sand
in the sandbox with a stick.

181
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,130
I just carried it out.

182
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,340
Who was it?

183
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,640
I told you. A real vampire.

184
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,070
Pinneburg Prison
(Hamburg)

185
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,180
I can't wrap my head around it.

186
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,940
Your murder of Erich Klemperer, 4 months ago.

187
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:59,780
All your other missions were in Niedersachsen.
Why just this one in Frankfurt?

188
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,700
Was this another message from the aliens?

189
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,330
Did the aliens all of a sudden change their minds
and make you kill people in Frankfurt?

190
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,210
Or did you have a different reason?

191
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,590
Klemperer did have a villainous past.

192
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,680
He escaped from East Berlin during the Cold War.

193
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,260
For a few years, he managed to make a
good living trading foodstuffs here.

194
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,480
But there were rumors that he was involved in the
placement of adopted children from the East to the West.

195
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,240
In other words, he sold children from the East to rich people without children in the West.

196
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,700
It wasn't a message. I had a face-to-face meeting with them.

197
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,700
I was ecstatic.

198
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,960
There really was an alien standing in front of me.

199
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,250
Where did the UFO land?

200
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,210
A park in Griesheim.

201
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,340
He spoke in an alien language.

202
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,760
So he made it easy for me and wrote
the words in the sandbox.

203
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,610
I was so ecstatic. I wish I could let you taste it as well.

204
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,830
Dusseldorf Police Station

205
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,450
Thanks for your hard work, Inspector Weissbach.

206
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,960
We're counting the seconds until your retirement.

207
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,630
You're that eager to get rid of me, huh?

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,010
That's right! Let's have a drink tonight to celebrate
us getting rid of such a hassle like you.

209
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,220
That doesn't sound like a good drink to me.

210
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Who's that man?

211
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,690
That's Dr. Gillen.

212
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,600
I hear he's a criminal psychologist.

213
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,690
He's here to interview the taxi driver serial killer, Dinger.

214
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,280
Did someone ask for him?

215
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,740
No. He said he's here for a research paper.

216
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,450
I hear he's an authority in that field, so he was
able to get permission from the big shots.

217
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:26,840
So you ran over the man who spat at you as he was leaving your cab.

218
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:35,390
I've said this in interviews over and over again. The people I've killed were worthless people.

219
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,230
You people just don't understand the truth.

220
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,110
Truth?

221
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,070
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

222
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,700
You're always talkative during interviews,

223
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:55,040
but you don't like discussing the murder
of the Bilker Bank employee, Fritz Overt.

224
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,660
In your previously documented testimony,

225
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,460
you claim that you had legitimate reasons
for killing the people that you killed.

226
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,170
But, you have never given a clear reason
why you murdered Mr. Overt.

227
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,890
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

228
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,390
How did it go, Dr. Gillen?

229
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,770
I'm Inspector Weissbach.

230
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,610
Was there anything academically interesting
that you heard from Dinger?

231
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,360
No.

232
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,490
He didn't say anything he hasn't said before.

233
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,700
I'll see you.

234
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,040
The truth is I have something I
desperately wanted to ask him.

235
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,210
I'm facing retirement today.

236
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,430
I don't think I'll ever be able to rest if I don't ask him.

237
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,930
What do you think of this academically?

238
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,230
There was a child who was like a monster.

239
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,940
After he had grown up, he came to visit a man
who took care of him when he was a child.

240
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,230
A child who was like a monster?

241
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,490
This is such an absurd story.

242
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,330
Please tell me everything you know about it!

243
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,330
Why are you two here?

244
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,830
I told you I don't want to talk to that man.

245
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,130
I'm still a detective, at least for today.

246
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,170
This is an interrogation.

247
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,340
You told me about the twins yesterday.

248
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,430
You said that he unleashed you.

249
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,610
If he came back to visit you after he'd
grown up and asked you for a favor,

250
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,650
would you listen to him?

251
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,160
Hmm? I don't know.

252
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,370
The murder of the Bilker Bank employee, Fritz Overt...

253
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,670
Did someone ask you to do it?

254
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,880
A hard-working man. A sincere man.

255
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
That's the kind of man Mr. Overt was.

256
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,390
Not the kind of scum that you always talk about.

257
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,440
He was going to expose a financial corruption scandal.

258
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,320
If you call him scum, the righteousness of
your crimes will be completely destroyed.

259
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,490
It wasn't a request.

260
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,710
There's no need for words between him and I.

261
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,500
Him?

262
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,920
That bank employee was scum to him.

263
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,300
That's what I believe.

264
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,380
Why?

265
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
Because he is correct!

266
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,680
Who is "he?"

267
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,390
Is it that twin?

268
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,640
When did you meet him?

269
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,350
Griesheim. A park in that city.

270
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,690
A suburb of Frankfurt, Griesheim.

271
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,900
A park in Griesheim.

272
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,120
He wrote a name in the sand in the sandbox.

273
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,040
He didn't say anything.

274
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,410
But I knew.

275
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,710
I must kill the man with this name.

276
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,250
There's no need for words.

277
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,380
We all understood.

278
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,800
These people are worthless.

279
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,140
What do you mean?

280
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,060
Are you saying that the three people that you interviewed
were all ordered by the same person to kill their targets?

281
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,490
By using three unrelated serial killers, the meaning
of the three murders becomes harder to spot.

282
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,780
The meaning of the three murders?

283
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,870
What do you mean? Tell me!

284
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,120
Tenma and Nina are coming to Frankfurt.

285
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,090
Johan!

286
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,010
They're trying to start something in Frankfurt.

287
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:43,240
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

288
00:22:44,330 --> 00:23:00,640
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

289
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:25,720
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

290
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:34,200
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

291
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,480
The Baby's Depression
