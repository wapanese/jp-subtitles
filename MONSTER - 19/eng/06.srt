1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,300
Maurer, you haven't been
taking a bath, have you?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,810
You promised, when I moved
to the desk next to you,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,070
that you'd take one every other day.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,800
You're such a pest.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,510
You have a visitor
in the reception office.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,710
I'm going home,
so make your own tea, will you?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,120
A visitor? At this hour?

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,220
He hasn't had a bath, either.
He smells almost as bad as you do!

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,570
What the hell?
Upsy daisy!

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,840
And whose fault is it that
I haven't been able to take a bath?

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,710
She doesn't realize that she's able to
make a living at this paper

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,010
with no future,
thanks to me.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,380
Jeez.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,780
Sorry to keep you waiting. Huh?

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,390
Uh... My name is Tenma...

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,360
I'd like to ask for your assistance!

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,850
Right... He really is filthy...

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,830
I see, so you're a doctor...

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,740
You don't look like one.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,510
In other words, Doctor,
is this what you're trying to say?

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,500
The next target of the person
who's been killing

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,140
middle-aged couples
throughout Germany

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,940
is here in Heidelberg?

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,910
That couple is fostering a young girl,
and when that girl turns 20,

25
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,180
the killer will come to take her away...

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,090
And when he does, the foster parents
are sure to be killed...

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,590
But you have no idea
who that girl or her foster parents are,

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,000
or where they live...

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,200
If that's not delusional,
I don't know what it is.

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,110
It's not a joke. Please believe me.

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,210
Ridiculous! Not even the gossip rags
would write up that story.

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,910
I didn't come here
to get you to write it up!

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,720
After those twins
slipped out of the hospital,

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,590
there is at least
a 6-month blank period

35
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,560
before the brother showed himself.

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,220
So what?

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,360
I believe that,
after leaving the hospital,

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,060
those twins came to
Heidelberg together.

39
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,360
You believe...

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,370
And the two were raised by
the girl's current foster parents.

41
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,970
But the brother ran away from here
after a short period,

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,030
leaving his sister behind.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,010
Why don't you write a novel?
'Course it probably won't sell.

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,110
It is possible that there is
a missing person's report out on the boy.

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,760
And there might even be
a newspaper article about him!

46
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,320
Please let me check the newspapers
from nine years ago! Please!

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,170
Please!

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,630
We mustn't allow
any more people to be killed!

49
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,270
Please...

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,080
The president has a thing against
computerization, you see...

51
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,190
These are smaller versions
of the daily newspapers,

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,350
and manuscript files.

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,460
And these are files
of cancelled stories and raw data.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,160
T-Thank you very much!

55
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,730
Is that the Japanese bow?
You're quite welcome.

56
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,470
Let me say this...

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,570
I just don't have the time
to spend on silly stories.

58
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,210
Hurry up and leave
when you're satisfied!

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,350
Jeez! Every once in a while,
I get a nut case like him.

60
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,190
<i>Please...</i>

61
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,600
<i>Please let me find something!</i>

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,970
The Missing

63
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,640
Good morning, Nina!

64
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,080
Good morning!

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,010
Thank goodness.
You're looking well, Nina.

66
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,810
Fainting like that...
You startled me.

67
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,180
I guess you really didn't like
the boy we hooked you up with.

68
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,190
T-That's not true.

69
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,990
I just suddenly felt bad.
I have to apologize to him.

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,270
Oh, never mind.
You don't have to worry about him.

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,470
Huh?

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,970
That Otto... When I talked to him,

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,340
I found out that he's not
your "prince on a white horse."

74
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,840
He says he didn't send you
any email message.

75
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,180
Is that so?

76
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,850
So you're saying that you fainted
because you saw that boy?

77
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,360
Yes...

78
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,990
What did he look like?

79
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,820
I only saw him for a second,
so I'm not sure...

80
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,660
What was your impression of him?

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,860
It felt very nostalgic...

82
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,670
Oh...

83
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,770
But that's not it...
I can't explain it well, but...

84
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,340
But?

85
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,460
You needn't force yourself, Nina.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,020
Absolute evil...

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,730
I don't know how to put it, but...

88
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,100
Yes, it felt just like
when I had that nightmare...

89
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,910
"Absolute evil"...
It's beginning to sound religious.

90
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,910
I don't go to a church...

91
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,150
But, it seems to me that
everything will be cleared up

92
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,020
if I see that person again.

93
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,920
You feel that you will regain
the memory you've lost...

94
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,330
Yes.

95
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,590
That's one means you may be
able to employ...

96
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,790
But I don't think you should let that
be a burden on you.

97
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,930
Thinking about your future
without stressing, is also important.

98
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,940
Yes...

99
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,500
Don't worry. Just work up a sweat
playing sports,

100
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,270
and your insecurities
should disappear.

101
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,510
Maurer, pull another all-nighter?

102
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,720
Yeah...

103
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh, by the way, were you the one
who let that guy use the file room?

104
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,390
That guy?

105
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,590
Yes. I asked him
what he was doing there

106
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,460
and he said
you had given him permission.

107
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,370
You mean he's still there?

108
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
Jeez!

109
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,840
Hey, you! It's about time you... Huh?!

110
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,170
Oh! Hey!

111
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,580
Are you all right? Hey! Huh?

112
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,820
Come on. Eat up.

113
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,830
Yes...

114
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,340
Good, isn't it?
I always have breakfast here.

115
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,240
Don't you go home?
What about your family?

116
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,010
Haven't got one.
My wife left me, you see.

117
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,120
Huh?

118
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,280
I was always so busy with work.

119
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
When I finally realized it,

120
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,620
my wife had gone back to her parents
with our daughter.

121
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,830
Have you ever thought about
bringing your wife home?

122
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,360
Why would I do that?

123
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,330
She's the one who walked out!
Why should I go to get her?

124
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,860
Well, you seem to regret
being so occupied with work.

125
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,330
Don't be silly!

126
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,770
Work is most important to a man!

127
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,080
Any wife who cannot understand that
is welcome to leave me!

128
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm sorry. It was none of my business.

129
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,150
That's right.
It's none of your business.

130
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, uh... One more thing...

131
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,690
You smoke too much.
I say that as a doctor.

132
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,160
I told you it's none of your business!

133
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,330
Quit saying the same thing
my wife said!

134
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,430
Your wife was worried
about your health, too.

135
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,940
Mind your own business.

136
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,840
Nina's birthday present?

137
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,720
Yes. I finally finished it.

138
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,720
Her sweaters used to be
this tiny before.

139
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,960
Dear, are you really going to tell her
that she's not really our daughter?

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Why can't we leave it?

141
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,390
You're right...
There's no need to tell her that.

142
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,400
Nina is our daughter, after all.

143
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,380
I'm home!

144
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,740
Welcome home!

145
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,880
Boy... am I hungry!

146
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,220
Think about the future?

147
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,230
Dr. Gaitel may be right.

148
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,240
"Tomorrow, your birthday, let's meet at
Heidelberg Castle at 7:00 PM."

149
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,880
Tomorrow... at Heidelberg Castle?

150
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,250
I'm so busy, but here I am staring at
a mountain of papers with you!

151
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
Isn't it about time you gave up?

152
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,570
Listen, Doctor...

153
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,980
If... it's just a thought, now...

154
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,790
If I were to go to get my wife...
Do you think she'd come back?

155
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,120
Yes. If you quit smoking, that is.

156
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,130
Oh!

157
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,300
What is it?

158
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,300
I found it!

159
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,770
Huh?

160
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,000
11-year-old boy disappears...

161
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,300
It is possible that he was kidnapped,

162
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,210
but there has been no word
from a kidnapper.

163
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,770
16 Necker Street...

164
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,280
Someone named Fortner has filled out
a missing person's report!

165
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,380
The raw data should be
in here somewhere...

166
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,680
Oh, here it is!

167
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,220
Huh? Oh!

168
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,090
W-What is it?

169
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,730
You said that that killer would

170
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,960
come to take his sister away
when she turned 20, didn't you?

171
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,970
If the boy in this article
is her brother...

172
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,460
Look! His birth date is printed here.

173
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,210
Today is the 20th birthday
of those twins.

174
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,960
Uh, hello, Dad? It's me.
I just finished work.

175
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm going to meet up with a friend
then I'll be coming home.

176
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,330
Yes... At Heidelberg Castle.

177
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,830
I see.

178
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,860
Your mom is making preparations
for a birthday party, you know.

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,960
Was that Nina?

180
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,940
Yes. She says she's going to meet
a friend before coming home.

181
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,130
I wonder who it is.

182
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,840
Nina's all grown up, after all.

183
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,550
<i>Maybe this will help me
to remember things...</i>

184
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,490
<i>I want to know who I really am.</i>

185
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,460
Doctor, what do you intend to do if
the twin girl is at the Fortners' home?

186
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
Whatever the case,
that family is in danger.

187
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,370
I will contact the police
and ask for protection.

188
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,640
Do you think the police will
do anything just from your reasoning?

189
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,700
Nothing has happened yet.

190
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,810
It'll be too late
after something happens!

191
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,420
Nothing's going to happen.
It's all in your head!

192
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,190
Listen, Doctor...
Of the four murder cases,

193
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,620
I myself went to
the crime scene in Cologne.

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
There was something different
about that scene.

195
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,630
I sensed no purpose,
no greed, no bitterness...

196
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,270
It was like someone simply ended
these people's lives.

197
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,340
I could tell just by looking
at the crime scene.

198
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,210
You said that a kid
who wasn't even 20, did it.

199
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,740
But do you think a youngster could kill
those people without feeling any emotion?

200
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,080
That wasn't something done by a kid!

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,410
It was something bigger...

202
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,620
Bigger... What?

203
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,890
That's just it...

204
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,400
I just can't find the right words
to describe this case.

205
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:48,840
If I have to describe it, it's trite,
but that was the Devil's work.

206
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,280
If that killer were to appear before me,
I would kill him without a pause.

207
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,780
16 Necker Street... We're here.

208
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,740
Good evening!
Sorry to call on you so late...

209
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,310
Yes?

210
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,950
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Maurer of the Heidelberg Post.

211
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,350
What would a newspaper reporter
be wanting?

212
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,590
Uh... I'd like to ask you
some questions...

213
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,860
- What is it?
- Oh!

214
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,690
It's regarding this missing persons report
that you filed in 1986...

215
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,640
Y-You can forget about that matter!

216
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,700
Uh... Could you please talk to us?
Don't you have a girl living with you?

217
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,880
The twin sister of
the boy who disappeared...

218
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,450
Please! Please answer me.

219
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,750
Oh, dear...

220
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,860
Huh?

221
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,530
A cake...

222
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,360
They had a birthday cake prepared...

223
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,400
You took in a pair of twins
nine years ago, didn't you?

224
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,360
The girl still lives with you,
doesn't she?

225
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,800
Please leave!

226
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,500
We have raised her
as our true daughter.

227
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,640
Please don't make waves.

228
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,210
Please leave us alone.

229
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,510
You took in a pair of twins
nine years ago.

230
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,080
The boy had surgical scars
on his head

231
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,520
and the girl had amnesia.

232
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,960
Isn't that right?!

233
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,090
Mr. Fortner, you must contact
the police at once!

234
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,160
Your lives, and your daughter's,
are in danger!

235
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,170
Mr. Maurer...

236
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,040
W-What are you talking about?

237
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,780
Please let us see your daughter.

238
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,110
She is out at the moment.

239
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,950
Where is she?!

240
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,720
At Heidelberg Castle.

241
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,680
She said she was going
to meet a friend.

242
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,020
Please let me use your car!

243
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,060
W-Wait! We must
notify the police first.

244
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,300
We don't have the time
to explain things to the police!

245
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,730
Give me the key, quickly.

246
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,370
All right. I'll call them from here.

247
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,040
Thank you.

248
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,210
Hey, Doctor!

249
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,010
Be careful! As I said earlier,
he's a terrible person.

250
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,970
You'd better not die!

251
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,020
Mr. Maurer...

252
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,720
Come back alive...
Then I'll quit smoking.

253
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,620
I'll follow the quack's advice.

254
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,390
Your wife will be happy, too.

255
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,790
Now, how should I explain
this to the police?

256
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,500
Our daughter... Is she all right?

257
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,510
What has happened?

258
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,670
Don't worry.
Let me use your phone.

259
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
What has happened to our daughter?

260
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,410
Please tell us!

261
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,980
Calm down!

262
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,350
Huh?

263
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,350
What in the?!

264
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,090
The phone line's been cut...

265
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,210
Anna... Please be safe... Anna!

266
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:51,320
It's way past time...
I guess that message was a prank.

267
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,550
I'm going home.

268
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,520
You can't.

269
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,730
Huh?

270
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,170
You have to... wait here.

271
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,550
Who are you?

272
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,880
I was asked to make sure
you waited here.

273
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,960
I said to wait...
Don't you understand?

274
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,530
Wait!

275
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,300
You have to wait here!

276
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,500
That's what I was told!

277
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,040
Anna!

278
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,850
Anna... No, you're Nina Fortner,
aren't you?

279
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,120
Do you remember me?
I'm Dr. Tenma. I'm glad you're safe.

280
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,720
Anna... Dr. Tenma...

281
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,030
Let's go. You must go home.

282
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,260
Y-You... Are you...
my prince on a white horse?

283
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,570
Huh?!

284
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,070
Who are you?

285
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,660
Don't butt in... Don't butt in, will you?

286
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,140
She's gotta wait here.

287
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,210
If she doesn't, I-I...

288
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,610
I won't get paid!

289
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,850
He said no one would come!

290
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,220
Damn!

291
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,910
Are you all right?

292
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,540
I-I'm amazed...

293
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,470
I need something to tie him up with!

294
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,950
Oh...

295
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,540
Who asked you to do this?

296
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,580
I-I don't know.

297
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,850
When did he say he was coming here?

298
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't know. He just said
he would come here

299
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,580
after doing something important.

300
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,490
Don't tell me... your home...

301
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,900
Huh?

302
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,200
I have to hurry back to your home!

303
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,470
W-What's going on?

304
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,630
I'll explain later!
We've got to hurry, Anna!

305
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,570
- Anna...
- Hurry!

306
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,290
Damn... I can't get loose...

307
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,940
Please tell me! Who are you?
And I'm not Anna!

308
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,410
I'm Nina!

309
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,280
No, when you were brought into
my hospital, you were Anna.

310
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,180
And your brother's name was Johan.

311
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,560
My brother...

312
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,450
House of Tragedy
