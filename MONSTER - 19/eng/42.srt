1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,420
A key...

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,680
A key and a card... number code...

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,270
The experiment data and a tape are in a safe deposit box.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,940
A tape?

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,690
A tape of an interview with that certain young boy.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,120
The monster who led 511 Kinderheim to destruction.

7
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,600
The Adventures of the Magnificent

8
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,600
Prague Police Station

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,790
It's this room.

10
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,090
Inspector Zeman, he's here.

11
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,680
Huh?

12
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,810
Inspector?

13
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,350
Oh.

14
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,270
Ouch.

15
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,110
This person was the first one at
the murder scene yesterday.

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,530
It's Mr. Grimmer, isn't it?

17
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,490
I'm sorry for making you stay all night.

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,580
I dropped my nail clipper under the desk.

19
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,080
When you're as big as me, you bump into a lot of things.

20
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,130
You're big, too.

21
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,840
Yeah. I bump into a lot of things.

22
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,670
My name's Zeman. I'm in charge of this investigation.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm Grimmer.

24
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,930
Go ahead and sit down.

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,480
Pardon me, but I was in the middle of clipping my
nails, so if you'd allow it, I'd like to continue.

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,680
Go ahead.

27
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,310
My wife's so annoying.

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,980
When my nails grow out...

29
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,780
She doesn't let me have any white parts that stick out.

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,910
Thanks to that, I'm always cutting them too short.

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,450
Yesterday was terrible, wasn't it?

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,170
Yeah, I never thought that...

33
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,500
I hear you're a freelance journalist.

34
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,130
Do you know his whole history?

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,390
Mikhail Ivanovich Petrov.

36
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,890
Real name, Reinhart Bierman, a German.

37
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,440
After the German unification,

38
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,150
he was charged with many counts of human rights
violations, internment and child abuse.

39
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,780
After the Berlin Wall fell, he fled
here to the Czech Republic.

40
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,580
The Germans wanted him arrested,

41
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,290
but the Czech Republic authorities left him alone and kept him under surveillance.

42
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,500
Surveillance?

43
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,550
Yes, in order to follow the movement of the unstable
element in the former secret police of Czechoslovakia.

44
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,470
Secret police?

45
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,930
You knew how scary the limitations of free speech
were during the Cold War, didn't you?

46
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,770
They even supplied weapons to extremist groups
all over the world for terrorist activities.

47
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:38,030
They were that kind of group, but in
order to make the talks of separation

48
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,280
between Czech and Slovakia go quietly, they
went underground without censure.

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,030
Petrov was in contact with that group.

50
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,960
He might have sold them the information that he had.

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,580
Ouch!

52
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,550
Look at that. I cut them too short again.

53
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,140
That's right. You didn't happen to see
a woman by any chance, did you?

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,300
A woman?

55
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,350
Petrov's killer was apparently a young woman...

56
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,810
and a fairly attractive one at that.

57
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,480
The children said they passed by
a woman in front of their house,

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,570
but I didn't see her.

59
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,820
I see.

60
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,070
Those children...

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,490
the orphans that Petrov was taking care of...

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,080
What's going to happen to them?

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:39,090
They're at the station for the time being, but
they'll all be taken to nursery homes.

64
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,010
I see.

65
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,090
It must have been hard for you to get involved in all this.

66
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,930
Not really.

67
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,470
Speaking of which, what information
were you trying to get from Petrov?

68
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,560
The many things that you just mentioned
that involved Petrov.

69
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,280
What did you learn from him?

70
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,150
I was just about to find out.

71
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,990
There, perfect!

72
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,030
Now my wife won't get mad at me.

73
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,040
Please feel free to leave whenever.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm sorry for holding you here so long.

75
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:17,630
No problem.

76
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,590
While he was dying...

77
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,930
did he say anything before he stopped breathing?

78
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,680
No.

79
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,940
Milslov, Josef... Where's Thomas?

80
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,490
Here.

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,950
So all three of you are here.

82
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,570
Then, get in this car.

83
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,750
C'mon, hurry up. Get in.

84
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,640
Next. Three for Vinofrady Nursery.

85
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,980
Honza, Antonin, Izzy.

86
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:17,980
Here.

87
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,190
It makes me sad.

88
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,190
We all just became such good friends
and now we're going to be separated.

89
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,990
But even when we're separated,
we're still under the same sky.

90
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,500
Someday we'll all be able to play soccer together again.

91
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,370
Cheer up, Antonin.

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
You were the leader, weren't you?

93
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,090
You can write letters to everyone.

94
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,510
That will keep them in good spirits.

95
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:48,840
Okay.

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,010
Yes, that's it.

97
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,600
Where are we going, Mister?

98
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Hotel Kafka.

99
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,730
And before that Prochazka Bank.

100
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,440
To Prochazka Bank and then to the hotel.

101
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
I don't know Czech.

102
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,240
Can you speak German or English?

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,500
Today is a nice day, isn't it?

104
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,920
Why did you stop? We're not there yet.

105
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,760
Where will it be, Mister?

106
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,510
Drive me to the industrial district.

107
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,020
Hey, turn away other people.

108
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,770
Did you watch the soccer game yesterday?

109
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,020
No, I was busy.

110
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,000
Why are we so far from the city?

111
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,340
I want to go to a hotel in the city.

112
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,220
The key.

113
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,130
Huh?

114
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,390
The key!

115
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,890
What are you talking about?

116
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,790
What a trouble-maker!

117
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,800
Shoot him!

118
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,430
Stop him!

119
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,620
Are you all right?

120
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,330
I thought you might be in trouble, so I followed you.

121
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,960
Are you injured? Are you okay?

122
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,510
Inspector.

123
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,300
They're probably the former secret police I mentioned before.

124
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,100
Did they want anything from you?

125
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,430
No, not really.

126
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,310
I don't think they would go this far for nothing.

127
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,520
No, nothing.

128
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,030
You aren't hiding anything, are you?

129
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,320
N-No.

130
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,950
You must have some idea. They came this far.

131
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
I'm telling you, nothing.

132
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,040
So maybe he took it out of the safe deposit box already...

133
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,250
The tape...

134
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,260
the audio tape.

135
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,060
They're looking for the roots.

136
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
The... roots?

137
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,610
The roots of the monster.

138
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,610
Monster?

139
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,610
We'll know easily once we hear the tape.

140
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,120
We'll know exactly where the monster's
mother is in the Czech Republic.

141
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,370
Hello, this is Inspector Zeman.

142
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,370
Yeah, that supermarket robbery suspect...

143
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,370
Did he name any accomplices?

144
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,710
I see. Good job, Detective Suk.

145
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,130
Me?

146
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,340
I still have a few odd jobs I need to do.

147
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,010
I think I'll be back at the station in about an hour.

148
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,180
Bye.

149
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,820
If you don't stop there, he won't be able to speak.

150
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,330
Are you ready to talk yet?

151
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,250
Where's the key?

152
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

153
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,670
You little...!

154
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,050
Hey, wait.

155
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,510
There's no reason for you to hide it, Mr. Grimmer.

156
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,560
Where's the key to the safe deposit
box that Petrov gave you?

157
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,520
I told you, I can't give you answers to things I don't know.

158
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,320
I see. You want money.

159
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,860
Well then, let's talk.

160
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,910
How much do you want for it?

161
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,330
I might be a third-rate journalist but
I'm not so poor that I can't eat.

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,250
Mr. Grimmer.

163
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,300
This won't do. Your nails are so long.

164
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,430
Didn't I tell you? My wife gets annoyed about these things.

165
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,800
When your nails get too long...

166
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,610
Hey, it'd be better if you didn't move.

167
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,740
Or else I'll cut them too short.

168
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,580
Where? Where is the key?

169
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,330
Where?

170
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,050
Even if you opened that safe deposit box
and got the tape and documents...

171
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,260
you wouldn't be able to use them.

172
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,350
It only has worth in our organization's hands.

173
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,430
What we're trying to achieve is...

174
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,730
the resurrection of the Eastern world.

175
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,070
That tape has the identity of the monster recorded on it.

176
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,450
Our organization needs that monster.

177
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,330
If we have the monster, reunification is possible.

178
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,750
The reunification of the graduates of 511 Kinderheim.

179
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,930
We'll assemble the alumni of 511 Kinderheim,

180
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,680
the ones who were raised in former East Germany, to be the communist elite.

181
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,270
There is no group more elite than that one.

182
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,770
The monster is said to have controlled all of
511 Kinderheim and made it destroy itself.

183
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,280
He's the only one.

184
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,780
He's the only one to unify such an elite squad.

185
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,040
So where's the key?

186
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,460
An elite group?

187
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,300
What's so funny?!

188
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,850
What are you after?

189
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,730
If you want money, I can understand.

190
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,810
I'm a capitalist.

191
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,610
I'm just selling the key to make a fortune.

192
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,650
Why are you doing this?

193
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,200
For social justice?

194
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,870
No one would go this far for that.

195
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,790
Who are you?

196
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,660
You said you were a journalist from East Germany,

197
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,670
but most of those people are with foreign intelligence agencies,

198
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,470
so I wouldn't be surprised if you were a spy.

199
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,390
Where were you sent from?

200
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,930
Is this some 007 movie?

201
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,350
What were your orders?

202
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,740
You're going to die, you know.

203
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,330
This is your last chance. Where's the key?

204
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,250
Do you know of "The Magnificent Steiner?"

205
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,050
In the sixties, it was a cartoon that aired in West Germany.

206
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,270
You could see it in East Germany.

207
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,900
The main character was normally a weak, sickly man.

208
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,440
When he was in an emergency,

209
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,200
someone would come and help him.

210
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,950
A secret friend.

211
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,040
But, the main character never realized...

212
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,460
that his secret friend...

213
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,960
was actually himself.

214
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,680
When the main character was in mortal danger,

215
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,730
he'd transform into the terrible Magnificent Steiner.

216
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,230
When the main character came to his senses,
the bad guys would be defeated.

217
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,700
Then give it a try and transform.

218
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,580
C'mon, transform!

219
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,260
Throw some water on him.

220
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,450
He's about to cough it up.

221
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,740
It's just a matter of time.

222
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,460
What do you want?

223
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,200
Huh?

224
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,430
A woman came in...

225
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,120
A woman came in...

226
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,830
One gun shot.

227
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,510
One dead body shot with the gun.

228
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,890
The other two dead bodies didn't have bullet wounds.

229
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,120
Was it "The Magnificent Steiner?"

230
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,710
He did it again.

231
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:43,270
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

232
00:22:44,360 --> 00:23:00,670
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

233
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:25,750
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

234
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:34,230
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

235
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,570
Detective Suk
