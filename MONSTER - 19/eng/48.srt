1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,440
What's wrong, Nina?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,400
As if being dragged down these stairs...

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,040
he was taken away...

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,910
Who was?

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,880
My big brother...

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,760
Yes...

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,590
He was known as the "Man of the Red Rose Mansion."

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,240
What was his name?!

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,080
Franz Bonaparta.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,200
Franz... Bonaparta...

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,880
However, I don't know if that was his real name or not...

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,430
since he also had a pen name.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,760
A pen name?

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,080
He was also the author of a picture book.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,680
I...

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,480
I...

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,520
was reading a picture book in here, and...

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,040
Someone opened this door...

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,760
and came home...

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,240
A picture book?

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,040
Yes.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,550
It was a very peculiar picture book.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,960
The title was "The Monster Without
A Name," or something like that.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,600
There's nothing here Nina.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,320
What is this... memory...?

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,710
I should have been reading a picture book in here, but...

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,870
the one who opened the door and came in...

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,200
was me.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,600
I'm welcoming myself back home?

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Welcome back.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,120
Mr. Jan Suk's mother?

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,510
Oh, Mrs. Suk is in room 409.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,280
Unfortunately, her memory seems to come and go.

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
I wonder how she's doing today?

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
Jan?

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,150
Is that you, Jan?

37
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,480
No.

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
My, what a pretty girl you are.

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,520
Are you a friend of Jan's?

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,160
Yes.

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Such pretty flowers.

42
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,240
I'll arrange them over here.

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,150
I'll have to make sure Aunt Olga doesn't take them away.

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,360
Aunt Olga always takes my things for herself.

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,040
Like yesterday, she took away my doll.

46
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,640
She's such a mean person.

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,760
But she passed away over ten years ago, didn't she?

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,160
Oh, that's right.

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,800
You know a lot, don't you?

50
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,840
I've heard a lot from Jan.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
I see.

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Is Jan still at school?

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,630
No.

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,320
Oh, that's right.

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,360
He already graduated and became a detective.

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
Don't worry.

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Jan is fine.

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,070
You have nothing to worry about.

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,840
You have very gentle eyes.

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,080
Please talk about anything you want.

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,960
Like different stories you remember.

62
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,080
Let me see...

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,520
katherina from next door is very stylish.

64
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,880
And then...

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,030
Oh, this is fun.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,480
It's been a long time since I've had this much fun.

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
I'm glad.

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
I'll have to thank you somehow.

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,440
There's no need to thank me.

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,840
I just wanted to see the thing Jan left in your care.

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,680
The thing he left with me?

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
A cassette tape.

73
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,520
Oh, that's right here.

74
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,080
The Scariest Thing

75
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Who would've thought you'd leave it with Suk's mother...

76
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,040
I'll wait here while you go get the
cassette tape and the documents.

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,960
However, you're going to forget about your business deal.

78
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,360
That was our agreement.

79
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,360
Let's go, Dr. Tenma.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,830
I'm sorry I said this had nothing to do with you.

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,280
The story you told about what happened
to you in the last ten years...

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,160
However, if that cassette tape is the
key to revealing the big picture...

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,520
your innocence may be proven.

84
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,920
The same goes for you as well, Mr. Grimmer.

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,680
It's true that I've been investigating
what 511 kinderheim was.

86
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,800
But you know...

87
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,080
even if everything is revealed...

88
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,350
my life won't change at all.

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,880
You guys would like to visit Mr. Suk's mother?

90
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,870
She seems to be doing very well today.

91
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,310
Thank you.

92
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,760
I guess the conversation she had with her
previous visitor did her a lot of good.

93
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,550
A visitor?

94
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,470
Who was it?

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,830
I don't know...

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,120
A beautiful woman with long, blond hair...

97
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,080
The tape!

98
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,280
So, you guys actually came.

99
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
I was told you were coming soon.

100
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,310
Where is the tape?

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
The tape?

102
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,320
It's right here.

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,920
How is Jan doing?

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,150
Right now, he's...

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,910
Please take me to the hospital he's in.

106
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,400
Jan's in trouble, isn't he?

107
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,280
Right now my head feels very clear.

108
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,640
The person who was just here woke me up.

109
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,320
But it might only be for today.

110
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
Please let me see Jan.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,560
I will take you to him.

112
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,630
To the hospital where Jan Suk is.

113
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,910
Mr. Grimmer...

114
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,160
We've struck a deal with the secret police.

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,360
Mom...

116
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,120
Why didn't you call me, Jan?

117
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,640
It's nothing... serious... Mom...

118
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,440
You tried to keep me from worrying again, didn't you?

119
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
It's the same as that time.

120
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
That time?

121
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,760
You fell from a tree when you were nine, remember?

122
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,720
Even though I was worried...

123
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,080
you said nothing was wrong and that
you were fine, and kept walking.

124
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,600
Even though your ankle was badly sprained...

125
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,190
Oh, God...

126
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,350
Please don't let me forget this child...

127
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,470
Jan is my child.

128
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,870
Even if I forget many other things...

129
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,590
please, God...

130
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
please, just don't let me forget about Jan.

131
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,600
<i>Then, let's go back to the other question.</i>

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
<i>What is it that you're most afraid of?</i>

133
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,070
<i>The monster inside of me is getting bigger</i>

134
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,880
<i>Chomp chomp.</i>

135
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>Munch munch. Crunch crunch.</i>

136
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
<i>Gulp.</i>

137
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,870
<i>Chomp chomp.</i>

138
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
<i>Munch munch.</i>

139
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,880
<i>Crunch crunch. Gulp.</i>

140
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,270
That's enough.

141
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,160
I don't want to hear any more.

142
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,000
No, you should listen.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,760
The nephew you sent to 511 kinderheim...

144
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,040
is the same as this drugged boy being interrogated!

145
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,080
You should know what they did to your nephew!

146
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
We must listen to what comes after this.

147
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,960
What lies be beyond this...

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,310
<i>What I am most afraid of...</i>

149
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
<i>is that...</i>

150
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,440
<i>I'll forget Anna.</i>

151
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,520
<i>Because of all these strange experiments
done on me every day....</i>

152
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,590
<i>my memories are disappearing.</i>

153
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,720
<i>Please...</i>

154
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,960
<i>don't let me forget Anna.</i>

155
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,960
<i>In this whole world...</i>

156
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,960
<i>there's only Anna and me.</i>

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,960
<i>Please, just this one memory.</i>

158
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,470
<i>Please...</i>

159
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,160
<i>That's as far as I'll let you listen.</i>

160
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,830
What is this?

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
It's the voice of a young man.

162
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,880
Could it be that he deleted the old recording, and...

163
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,360
<i>I finally understand now.</i>

164
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,120
he recorded over it?

165
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,110
<i>I finally understand after listening to this tape.</i>

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
The person who came to visit Suk's mother recorded this?

167
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Dr. Tenma?

168
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,840
This is what Johan's voice sounds like now...

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,790
<i>I finally understand...</i>

170
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,190
<i>where I need to go....</i>

171
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,520
<i>Dr. Tenma.</i>

172
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,000
He took time off?

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480
You mean the inspector?

174
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,830
I can't believe that someone as devoted
to work as he would do that!

175
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,120
I heard it's his first long vacation
since he came to this station!

176
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,080
Well, he didn't seem all that busy lately anyway.

177
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,680
He was considered to be an elite detective of the BKA.

178
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,240
He probably worked too hard.

179
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,160
Well, he doesn't know when to stop.

180
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,110
I heard his wife and daughter left him because of that.

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
So, where did the inspector say he's
going to spend his vacation?

182
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,920
He said Prague, in the Czech Republic, but...

183
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,960
I wonder if he even knows how to take a break.

184
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,280
Prague (Czech Republic)

185
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
Have you decided?

186
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,350
Coffee.

187
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
Yes, sir.

188
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
No, wait, I'm on vacation.

189
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,600
A beer.

190
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,080
What brand is this beer?

191
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,680
It's the local Prazdroj.

192
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,080
You think the public will be satisfied
with a report like this?

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,040
We don't even know the whereabouts
of Detective Suk yet!

194
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,270
On top of that, do you know what would happen
if we announced these half-assed results...

195
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
about the former Czechoslovakian
secret police connection.

196
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,320
We'll be sitting ducks for the media!

197
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,320
B-But now that all the people
who were involved are dead...

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,470
The current situation of the Czech
police and the Prague station...

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,560
can't be resolved by simply
using the dead as scapegoats!

200
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
Y-Yes, sir.

201
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
If you understand, then hurry up
and continue the investigation!

202
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,440
And track down Suk too!

203
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,590
On the double!

204
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,760
Yes, sir!

205
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,830
Excuse me.

206
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,720
Umm, there is someone who would like to see you.

207
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,480
I won't see anyone who doesn't have an appointment.

208
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,310
Besides, I don't have time for that right now.

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,280
But, umm...

210
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
Y-You're!

211
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, you surprised me, Inspector Runge.

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,280
We haven't seen each other since
last year's Interpol conference.

213
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,080
The lecture you gave at the subcommittee
seminar was very interesting.

214
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm sorry to have interrupted you at a busy time.

215
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,950
No, I had no idea you were over here on vacation.

216
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm really envious.

217
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,120
Under the circumstances,
I can't even get a decent break...

218
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,110
It seems you have your hands full, Commissioner Nepela.

219
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,280
Yeah.

220
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,160
I'm at the point where I'd like to ask you
for some advice, if you don't mind.

221
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,120
After all, the case is in absolute chaos right now.

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,950
The connection between the Prague police department
and the former Czechoslovakian secret police...

223
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,800
It all began when an inspector named Zeman...

224
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,000
was found dead among members
of the former secret police.

225
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,600
At the time, Inspector Zeman...

226
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,150
was conducting an investigation into the murder
of the director of an unauthorized orphanage.

227
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,960
We found out later, but...

228
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,240
both Zeman and the murdered orphanage director...

229
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,280
had ties to the secret police.

230
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,470
Who is the suspect?

231
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,320
A man named Grimmer, who first discovered
the bodies, has surfaced as a suspect, but...

232
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,080
the children at the orphanage said
they witnessed another person...

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,760
leaving the scene of the crime.

234
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
Another person?

235
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,640
A blond beauty.

236
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,000
However, the case didn't end there.

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,520
It got even bigger.

238
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,640
The previous commissioner and two veteran detectives...

239
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,870
were all killed with poisoned candy.

240
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,720
They were also affiliated with the former
Czechoslovakian secret police.

241
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,080
Who is the suspect for the poisonings?

242
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,400
A young detective named Suk who worked
directly under Inspector Zeman.

243
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,680
Any proof?

244
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,800
We don't have any proof.

245
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,160
But the two detectives with the special investigative
task force who were watching Suk...

246
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
were found shot to death in Suk's room!

247
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,760
I see.

248
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,750
So, where is this Detective Suk now?

249
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,720
He is currently missing.

250
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,110
All the circumstantial evidence points to Suk.

251
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,520
Y-Yes?

252
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,400
He doesn't smell like a man who'd commit such a crime.

253
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
O-Okay...

254
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,190
Umm, how do you know?

255
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,680
I know of a very similar case.

256
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,680
Impressive!

257
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,040
Even though you're on vacation, that
hand of yours is still working.

258
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,960
The objective collecting of data, wasn't it?

259
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,000
And you also said something else at the lecture.

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,720
By using that data...

261
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
you can conduct the investigation from
a completely subjective perspective.

262
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,680
In other words, by becoming the killer himself, right?

263
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,640
So, what do you say?

264
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,110
If you were Suk what would you be thinking?

265
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Where would you be now?

266
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,310
I'm terribly sorry.

267
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,760
But unfortunately, I'm on vacation.

268
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,390
Oh, no, I should be the one apologizing.

269
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
How do you like the city of Prague?

270
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,990
For the most part, I've been visiting
secondhand bookstores.

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Secondhand bookstores?

272
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,280
Are you looking for something?

273
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,920
I went to thirteen stores already.

274
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,470
I finally found a copy.

275
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,070
The truth is, the reason I came here today...

276
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,920
was to see if you could translate this Czech text
into German when you have some free time.

277
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,430
Oh, a picture book?

278
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm surprised.

279
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,480
I didn't know you had such hobbies.

280
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,870
If you don't mind leaving this with me, I'll have
one of my men translate it by tomorrow.

281
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,640
Is it for your child... no, grandchild?

282
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes, well... you could say that.

283
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,350
Suk is definitely innocent!

284
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,200
As his friend...

285
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,430
I firmly believe without a doubt that he is innocent!

286
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,680
The police asked me tons of questions, but...

287
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,800
there's nothing shady about him!

288
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
If you're with the police, then please help him!

289
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,800
We'll cooperate in any way possible to help him!

290
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,800
Unfortunately, I'm on vacation right now.

291
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,790
I can't be of much help.

292
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,320
Was there anyone else he opened up to?

293
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,840
He was close to getting a girlfriend.

294
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,800
He'd only gotten as far as getting her name, though...

295
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,240
What was her name?

296
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,070
Anna...

297
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,880
Oh, that's right! Anna Liebert!

298
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
She had blond hair and was extremely pretty.

299
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,040
He was really happy because he thought
everything was going well.

300
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,520
Anna Liebert...

301
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
One of the twins who survived the homicide
involving a high official...

302
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,400
who fled East Germany due to exile ten years ago.

303
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,050
Moravia Publishing Company

304
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't think we have any left.

305
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,480
Emil Scherbe's "The Monster Without A Name"...

306
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,680
was indeed one of our publications, but...

307
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,840
if it was published during the old regime...

308
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,150
that would've still been during the
previous company president's time.

309
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,800
Is Emil Scherbe a pen name?

310
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,710
Yes, it probably was.

311
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,560
There were several other pen names as well...

312
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,920
Something Bonaparta...

313
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,390
Also, Jakov Vyrobek.

314
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
klaus Poppe and such...

315
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,400
klaus Poppe's box is here, actually.

316
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,710
What? I'm surprised you found it!

317
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,240
May I open it?

318
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
Sure, go ahead.

319
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,800
It's probably just some old rough sketches anyway.

320
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,480
A pregnant woman...

321
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,960
And then...

322
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,960
children were born.

323
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
A girl.

324
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,240
Twins...

325
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,240
I see.

326
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,120
You were able to translate it?

327
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,120
I appreciate this, Commissioner Nepela.

328
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,120
Oh, I'd like to ask something, since it's been bothering me.

329
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,160
But could you please read the last page to me?

330
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,520
<i>Let me see....</i>

331
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,720
<i>"Even though he now had a name..."</i>

332
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,560
<i>"there was no one left to call him by his name."</i>

333
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,670
<i>"Johan."</i>

334
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,960
<i>"It is a wonderful name."</i>

335
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>What a curious picture book...</i>

336
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,680
Johan.

337
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,910
<i>Inspector Runge, how about having
dinner with me sometime?</i>

338
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,080
<i>How long is your vacation going to be?</i>

339
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,360
You.

340
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,830
I'd like coffee instead of beer.

341
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,640
I think it'll be a long vacation.

342
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

343
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

344
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

345
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

346
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,490
The Cruelest Thing
