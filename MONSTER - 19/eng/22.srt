1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,510
Hey, hey, move it! Don't
disturb the investigation.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,970
What happened?

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,680
Tell us how you're handling the investigation.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,020
Is this murder the work of the serial killer?

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,710
The victims, the Jopps, don't
have children, do they?

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,980
No matter how you look at it, the scene
looks just like one of the serial killings

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,210
of middle-aged married couples that
are happening all across Germany.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,910
No comment.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,660
We've heard that a special agent from the
confederate detective agency is coming.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,830
Is this proof that this is one
of the serial murders?

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,870
No comment.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,210
It'd be faster to just ask the confederate
detective agency itself.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,840
Leave it to me!

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,510
I'll get you your story.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,970
Be sure to leave a lot of space for me.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,230
Thanks.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,440
Excuse me.

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,070
I'm Mr. Kipper for Hamburg Talk.

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,650
You're the investigator from the
confederate detective agency.

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,240
Could I get a statement?

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,790
Is this incident related to
those serial murders?

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,960
Mr. Kipper from Hamburg Talk, I'll
say something special, just for you.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,380
You're absolutely correct.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,770
This murder was done by the killer
of those middle-aged couples.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,930
I knew it! The suspect is the
Japanese doctor, then.

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,840
I saw the report.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,760
It looks exactly like the serial killings.

28
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,430
I've got my scoop!

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,850
Thanks!

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,940
Wait a second.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,640
Yes?

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,310
Hamburg Talk is pretty influential
around here, isn't it?

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,900
So your article will spread to other
papers across the country, right?

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,120
Of course. Thank you for your cooperation.

35
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,140
Lunge's Trap

36
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,070
I am the killer.

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,950
I am the killer.

38
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,910
I've become the killer.

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,990
Should I knock?

40
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,370
Yes. It would be best not to alarm them.

41
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,880
What a courteous old couple.

42
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,120
I've been invited into the
living room without hesitation.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,220
They don't suspect a thing.

44
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,480
The husband's seat.

45
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,770
Of course, I sit on the couch for guests.

46
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,320
A few minutes later, the husband
dies on the floor over there,

47
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,030
but I haven't started to
make any movements yet.

48
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,540
Where is the wife?

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Right, she isn't in the living room yet.

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,210
She is making tea in the kitchen.

51
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,510
Before the tea is prepared, the wife is killed,

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,260
which means that I have to take action soon.

53
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,410
I take out my knife, and while the
husband is still confused, I stab him.

54
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,650
I miss.

55
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,070
The husband runs while holding
his wound with his left hand.

56
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,240
The next attack is aimed at
the husband's right shoulder.

57
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,820
Another clumsy miss.

58
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,610
What an amateur I am!

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,330
The husband cries out for his wife,

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,500
but the wife can't hear
him from the kitchen.

61
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
Her hearing has been getting worse.

62
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,960
Yes. I know that.

63
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,210
Scream if you want!

64
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,760
I can take care of your wife
easily after I've killed you.

65
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,550
I've caught up to you.

66
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,760
The husband's left handprint.

67
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,060
I catch up to the husband
at this sideboard.

68
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,850
This is the final blow!

69
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,610
No, I don't deliver the final blow here.

70
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,820
I am five meters from
where the husband died.

71
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,320
Why?

72
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,990
Why didn't I deliver the final blow here?

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,820
Why?

74
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,590
Is this the man who killed the Jopps?

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,510
No, it's not that simple.

76
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm just asking the people of the neighborhood.

77
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,240
If he shows up, treat him naturally.

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,140
Then contact me as soon as possible.

79
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,560
That's all.

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,690
You won't be in danger.

81
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,650
I guarantee it.

82
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,780
It's hard to believe something so horrible
happened in a neighborhood like this one.

83
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,370
Yeah. The Jopps were such kind people.

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,500
Whenever I called out to her in the morning,
she'd always respond cheerfully.

85
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,380
You called out to her?

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,090
Her hearing has been going bad
for about a year now, hasn't it?

87
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,880
Is that true?

88
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,640
It's written in her doctor's reports.

89
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,600
She shouldn't have been
able to hear you say hello.

90
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,900
She must have sensed me
some other way and responded.

91
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,290
So the people of the neighborhood
didn't know about her hearing?

92
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,820
Probably not.

93
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,330
This is quite the company.

94
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,580
It's extraordinary to have come this
far at such a young age, Mr. Giebel.

95
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,330
Nah. The makers we sign contracts
with just have pretty good cars.

96
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,570
You have my deepest condolences
for losing your uncle and aunt.

97
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,060
Yeah. I didn't have any other
relatives besides them.

98
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,150
Since your aunt and uncle were childless,
they must have been quite fond of you.

99
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,080
Yes, as if I were their own.

100
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,190
Can you catch the killer?

101
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,860
Yes, I have a good hunch.

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,700
Is it that Japanese doctor?

103
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,620
You know the details well.

104
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,430
Of course... There were other
cases similar to this one.

105
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,540
How much did you inherit?

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,130
Huh?

107
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,510
The Jopps were very wealthy.

108
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,780
Does that have anything
to do with the incident?

109
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,230
You're the only one who
would inherit the money.

110
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,310
Isn't that correct?

111
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,690
What are you saying?

112
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,290
It's not the right time to
be talking about that.

113
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:31,120
Even if companies seem to be spectacularly
successful on the surface, there are
often poor managers underneath.

114
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,030
There are many cases like that.

115
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,670
What the hell are you getting at?

116
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,470
Are you accusing me of killing
them for the inheritance?

117
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,910
Don't worry. You have a perfect alibi.

118
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,930
You took your secretary and subordinates
out to eat. There are witnesses.

119
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,650
Wh-What are you saying?

120
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,530
You're not the killer. That's right, isn't it?

121
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,160
Inspector Lunge!

122
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh, you.

123
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,900
What's happening?

124
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,530
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't play dumb with me.

126
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,700
These last few days,
I checked up on that nephew.

127
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,540
At first glance, his company looks quite good,

128
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,540
but behind it all, their stockbrokers mess
up, and their financial state is horrible.

129
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,330
And you've been thoroughly scouring that company.

130
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,520
What's the truth?

131
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,050
Do you really see this case as
part of the serial murders?

132
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,640
Everyone is printing our exclusive scoop.

133
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,060
If there's no relationship between this murder and the
previous ones, it'll be a terrible miscommunication.

134
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,040
It's just as you said.

135
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,420
It's the work of a copycat.

136
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,110
He made it look like one of
the serial murders.

137
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,700
I knew it! I have to change the story.

138
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,870
No, just leave it as it is.

139
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,220
You're going to write the story stating that
the murder is one of the serial murders.

140
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,360
This isn't a joke. Why should
I print false information?

141
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,790
Just do it.

142
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,470
I-I'm a journalist. You can't
pressure me into doing things.

143
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,300
You said your name was Kipper, right?

144
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,510
Didn't you find her to be a fascinating woman...

145
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,990
even though you have such a caring family...
a wonderful wife and daughter?

146
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,230
I guess such a fascinating woman would make
you want to be unfaithful, though...

147
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,910
If you do as I say this time... no, 
if you keep on doing it...

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,670
If you do it, he'll come back.

149
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,710
I'm expecting good things from you.

150
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,510
Coming.

151
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,310
I have a favor to ask.

152
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,500
I see. They were a wonderful couple.

153
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes.

154
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,550
Umm, did they have any foster children?

155
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,570
No.

156
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,260
Was there a child who was staying
there for only a little while?

157
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,800
No.

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,190
They loved their nephew very much, though.

159
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,140
Oh, how would you like another cup of tea?

160
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,810
No, I'm fine.

161
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,730
Don't hold back.

162
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,530
There's no doubt.

163
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,450
It's the man in the photo.

164
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,990
He's in my house now.

165
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,740
I see.

166
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
Thank you for your cooperation.

167
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,830
Inspector Lunge.

168
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,380
You have a visitor.

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,670
Who is it?

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,090
The nephew of the Jopps.

171
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,260
You must think I'm the killer.

172
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,850
Isn't that right?

173
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,850
I killed them for the inheritance...
That's what you think, right?

174
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,520
It is true that I have quite a few debts now,

175
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,360
and the money they left me
would definitely save me...

176
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,280
But I'm not that type of person!

177
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,120
Is that all?

178
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,040
"Is that all?"

179
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,640
You treat me like a murderer
and then say, "Is that all?"

180
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,710
I have somewhere I must go.

181
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,550
Wait right there.

182
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,800
I want you to take back what you said.

183
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,310
The police have called off the
people following you.

184
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,980
The police here are treating you as innocent.

185
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,270
Just leave it as it is.

186
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,650
Then who do you think the killer is?

187
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,690
The killer?

188
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,030
I couldn't care less.

189
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,450
As long as I can catch that one man...

190
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,880
The bloodstains over there mean...

191
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,260
He made a mistake.

192
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:35,270
So you don't think this murder's
perpetrator was the Japanese doctor?

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,020
Let's see...

194
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,940
It's a copycat of the couples' serial murders.

195
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,320
What are you saying?

196
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,050
There's something in this case that
was missing in other cases.

197
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,790
The killer catches up to the victim here,

198
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,750
but not here.

199
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,460
He delivers the final blow all the way over there.

200
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,130
Why? Why did he hesitate?

201
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,600
It's different.

202
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,280
There's a feeling.

203
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,380
A feeling?

204
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,520
At the scene of the crimes
of the man I've been chasing,

205
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,490
there have been valuables stolen to make it seem
like a robbery, but there's no feeling at all.

206
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,160
When I went to the site of the crime this
time, however, there was a feeling.

207
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,500
He paused when he saw his and
his victim's faces in the mirror.

208
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,460
Well, don't worry.

209
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,340
The police here are brainless.

210
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,260
This is the doing of a copycat who
made it look like Johan's work.

211
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,890
How long will this continue?

212
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,850
How long?

213
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,330
It's been a while...

214
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,580
We finally meet, Dr. Tenma.

215
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,680
I've been looking for you for so long...

216
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,170
So very long...

217
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,050
I wanted to talk with you.

218
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,310
You can't run away.

219
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,430
Let's talk.

220
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,570
How long are you going to keep
doing this, Dr. Tenma?

221
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,530
I'll end it here.

222
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,020
As long as I get rid of you...

223
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,870
Move!

224
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,280
I killed the Jopps... Forgive me!

225
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,280
I have no interest in you.

226
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,030
You're in my way.

227
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,750
Dammit!

228
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,890
What's this wound?

229
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,810
At this rate, he'll die from blood loss.

230
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,980
Who did this to Inspector Lunge?

231
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,110
I have no choice but to leave him
in front of a hospital and run.

232
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,300
Damn!

233
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,680
Are you awake?

234
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Where are the keys to the handcuffs?

235
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,510
Don't bother looking for your gun.

236
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,480
I have it.

237
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,930
Tell me where the keys are.

238
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,600
I can't help you like this.

239
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,560
I've looked at your wound.

240
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,610
The wound, fortunately, did not
reach your abdominal cavity.

241
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,100
However, if I don't stop 
the bleeding, you'll die.

242
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,840
Confess, Dr. Tenma.

243
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,170
What?

244
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:20,220
The three murders at Eisler Memorial Hospital, the
serial killings of couples over the last three years...

245
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,890
Confess to them.

246
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,830
You really will die!

247
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,480
It was all "Johan's" work.

248
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,480
You were searching for the real killer, "Johan."

249
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,070
Johan doesn't exist.

250
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,340
You are Johan, Dr. Tenma.

251
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,340
Confess.

252
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,580
There wasn't much I could find
in this old warehouse,

253
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,160
but I found materials for emergency treatment.

254
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,210
All that's left is my hands.

255
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,250
If only my hands were free, I could save you.

256
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,420
When you're Dr. Tenma, you're
an exceptional surgeon.

257
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,800
That face of yours doesn't have
one speck of wickedness.

258
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,460
How many people have you
killed with those hands?

259
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
You're mistaken.

260
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,070
When do you change into "Johan"?

261
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,070
When do you change into that killing machine?

262
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,650
You're mistaken.

263
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,780
I don't make mistakes.

264
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,830
The drop in blood pressure is making you
waver in and out of consciousness.

265
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,290
Your crime scenes...

266
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,660
You shouldn't talk anymore.

267
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,560
At your crime scenes, there's no feeling.

268
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,800
Don't talk.

269
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:44,590
You lose your emotions when you hold the lives
of people in your hands every day, Dr. Tenma.

270
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,930
It's there. That calmness is
always at the crime scene.

271
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,310
Total calmness.

272
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,690
You're mistaken.

273
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,530
Whenever I was performing surgery,

274
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,530
I prayed I wouldn't make a mistake.

275
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,740
I prayed that it would go well.

276
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,450
I worried that there'd be problems.

277
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
The truth is that I was
scared out of my mind.

278
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,920
People's lives are in my hands.

279
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,130
In my hands...

280
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,670
There's no way I could be calm!

281
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,930
Don't... move.

282
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,260
I'll save you.

283
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,390
I'll shoot...

284
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,520
I'll stop the bleeding. Where is the key?

285
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,270
Is it in your pants pocket?

286
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,520
I'll... shoot...

287
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm so relieved!

288
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,210
Are you feeling well?

289
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,670
You're complexion looks better now
than when you're working.

290
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,340
I'm sorry to have worried you.

291
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,850
The emergency treatment was perfect.

292
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,180
That's what the doctors said.

293
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,850
If it hadn't have been done
so well, you'd be dead.

294
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,330
Tenma... saved my life.
That's what happened, right?

295
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,110
Well, Tenma might have gotten away,
but... Giebel confessed to the murder of the Jopps.

296
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,340
Good work, Lunge.

297
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,570
Thank you.

298
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,080
What do you think?

299
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,460
Tenma saved his life.

300
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,090
It might be hard for
him to arrest Tenma now.

301
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,170
We should take Lunge off of the Tenma case.

302
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,470
We're sorry that Inspector Lunge
caused you so much trouble.

303
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,800
He wasn't trouble at all.
He's very nice to be around.

304
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,310
He said he's in a hurry and would like to
get done with rehab as soon as possible.

305
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,860
He's already squeezing the ball
and walking around the halls...

306
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,410
He's having fun!

307
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,900
Fun?

308
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,910
Yes.

309
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,620
He says it quite often.

310
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,910
He says that he's never
had so much fun before.

311
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,660
Now what did he say the killer's name was...?

312
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,750
That's right, Tenma.

313
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,960
"Chasing after a criminal like Tenma
is the most fun I can have."

314
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,550
Eva's Confession
