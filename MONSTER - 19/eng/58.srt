1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,450
If I knew it would turn out like this...

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,170
I wouldn't have taken the job.

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,240
I didn't like it from the start...

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,200
Everything is going to be okay!

5
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,260
Just relax!

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,990
T-That's just a scratch!

7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,220
We're almost at the hospital!

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,630
I told you, no hospitals.

9
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,020
I said a doctor, but not a hospital.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,520
The Hellblau Hotel.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
I... I know what you're trying to say.

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,240
If you go to a hospital, the police will come.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,150
And then you'll be back in prison again.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,450
But you know what?

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,720
We don't have time to get to that
underground doctor's place!

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,450
To the Hellblau Hotel...

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,070
Your life is more important!

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,440
- if you're alive, you can...

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,350
<i>- Hurry the hell up!</i>
- if you're alive, you can...

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,990
<i>- Hurry the hell up!</i>

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,460
The Hellblau Hotel!

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,830
That's why...

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,950
nothing good ever comes from
getting involved with women.

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,930
Please...

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,010
get to Dr. Tenma quickly...

26
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,330
Two Months Ago

27
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,290
Behave yourself.

28
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,380
The person you're about to see...

29
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,000
I Hate This Job

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,880
is someone you wouldn't be able
to see under normal circumstances.

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,030
I guess I should've brought my autograph book.

32
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,730
I'll kill you if you joke around.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,550
Come in.

34
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,930
This man, Martin, is my subordinate.

35
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,650
You can leave now.

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,880
I wish to speak with him alone.

37
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,050
Y-Yes, sir.

38
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,930
I'll really kill you if you screw something up.

39
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,000
Can I sit here?

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,360
Go ahead.

41
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,490
How long have you been with The Baby?

42
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,290
Almost three years, I think.

43
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,610
And before that?

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,390
Prison, huh?

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,750
How many years?

46
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,910
Eight years.

47
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,130
Murder?

48
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,010
Something like that.

49
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,130
You got out rather quickly, considering.

50
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,640
I was an exemplary inmate.

51
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,360
I hear you're exemplary when it
comes to doing jobs, as well.

52
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,820
I'll do anything.

53
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,720
Any job.

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,350
Except...

55
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,740
Except?

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,630
I'm not too thrilled with jobs that involve women.

57
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,390
Well, I won't be picky about my jobs.

58
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,470
I just don't want to get involved with women.

59
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,090
This job does involve a woman.

60
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,980
I want you to look after a certain woman for a while.

61
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,190
An unpleasant job...

62
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,620
I want you to pick up a certain woman from Düsseldorf.

63
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,440
Since you say you don't like to get involved with women...

64
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,160
you should be perfect for this job.

65
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,310
You should be able to keep things professional.

66
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,230
Miss Eva Heinemann?

67
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,360
Who are you?

68
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,280
Martin.

69
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,850
Well, I don't think my name matters.

70
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,840
I was told to take you to Frankfurt.

71
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,920
Told by whom?

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,470
A man wearing glasses and an expensive suit.

73
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,280
A man wearing glasses?

74
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,640
He's not with Roberto's group, is he?

75
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,190
I don't know much myself.

76
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,910
But he seems to be a very important person.

77
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,970
If you don't want to go, I won't force you.

78
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,920
I'm not too thrilled about this, either.

79
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,980
I'm being targeted.

80
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,440
Will you be my bodyguard?

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,600
Well, that's part of my job, so...

82
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,810
Wait here.

83
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,900
Carry this.

84
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,520
Let's go.

85
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,990
It's better than getting killed by that man.

86
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,760
What an unpleasant bitch.

87
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,720
The way she shakes her ass...

88
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,890
The smell of her perfume...

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
It pisses me off.

90
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,500
I hate this job.

91
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,850
Why don't you talk to me?

92
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,090
Well, we can talk about something if you want.

93
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,360
I don't really feel like talking.

94
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,720
Then I'll be quiet.

95
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,690
Any drinks?

96
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,840
Aren't there any drinks?

97
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,510
Sorry, but I don't drink.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,190
I'll go check the dining car.

99
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,340
I see. So you're traveling alone.

100
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm traveling alone myself.

101
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,390
Oh, if you don't mind, could you please
tell me where you'll be staying?

102
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,210
Oh, here. This is my card.

103
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,800
What are you doing?

104
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,850
W-What do you mean?

105
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,210
This woman asked me for a drink, so I...

106
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,040
Don't you lay a finger on this woman.

107
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,430
Why don't you talk while you're eating?

108
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,110
Like I said, I'll talk if you want me to.

109
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,940
Why don't you drink alcohol?

110
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,060
My mom was a terrible alcoholic.

111
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
No, I don't mind if you drink.

112
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,770
Your mother probably had a reason why she had to drink.

113
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,820
You think so?

114
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,690
I do.

115
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
There's a reason I have to drink...

116
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,460
No, please, tell me.

117
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,640
That is, if you don't like eating without a conversation.

118
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,630
It's a long story.

119
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,540
Sure, go ahead.

120
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,000
I used to have a fiancé.

121
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,530
He was a Japanese surgeon...

122
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,760
with brilliant skills.

123
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
And then...

124
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,680
And then I tried to kill my former fiancé.

125
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,930
Well, are you surprised?

126
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,980
I tried to kill that man!

127
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,380
But you didn't shoot him.

128
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,470
Your story is better than mine.

129
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,710
What's your story?

130
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,830
Tell me.

131
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,980
I... actually pulled the trigger.

132
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,680
My girlfriend was on top of some guy in the bedroom.

133
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,490
I shot the guy along with her...

134
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,460
until the gun ran out of bullets.

135
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,370
The room was filled with the smell of
her blood, the smell of his blood...

136
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,170
and the smell of her perfume...

137
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,570
When I realized it...

138
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,170
I was standing alone in the middle of everything.

139
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,840
You're so stupid.

140
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,130
Right?

141
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,310
What an unpleasant job...

142
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,330
My employer is waiting at this hotel.

143
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,560
You said you killed someone.

144
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,630
Don't touch me.

145
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,590
Which room?

146
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
I'll take you there.

147
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,910
The way you're dressed isn't suited for this hotel.

148
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,260
Just wait here.

149
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,950
It's room 1014.

150
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,200
What a bitch.

151
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,670
I don't know what the man with the glasses will say to her.

152
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,900
But if that woman refuses his deal...

153
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,410
this unpleasant job will be over.

154
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,720
I won't have to deal with that woman anymore.

155
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,590
What's the matter?

156
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,230
You don't look too good.

157
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,530
It wasn't a bad deal.

158
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,320
He said I could use this card as much as I wanted.

159
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,600
What are you doing?

160
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,330
Let's get going.

161
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,850
Where are we going?

162
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,840
Shopping.

163
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,580
I really hate this job.

164
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,800
This place next.

165
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
But they sell men's suits here.

166
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
I need you to look decent, too.

167
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,680
I'm fine with this.

168
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,320
I'm not.

169
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,330
I can't have a man in my company looking so shabby.

170
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,510
I like this one.

171
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,540
As for the necktie...

172
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,800
Kenzo...

173
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,440
Try this on.

174
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,350
Necktie, huh?

175
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,890
It's hideous.

176
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,240
How is it?

177
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,240
Well...

178
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,760
You look a little better.

179
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,750
However...

180
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,700
wear your tie properly.

181
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,160
Stop walking around with your shoulders
slouched like a gangster.

182
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,400
I thought I was walking normally.

183
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,680
Your "normal" isn't normal.

184
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,990
From now on, you have to guard me.

185
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,530
I'll make sure I won't be embarrassed.
no matter where I go.

186
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,950
That's your job, isn't it?

187
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,950
That's right.

188
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,110
That's my job.

189
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,240
Don't put your elbow on the table.

190
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,490
Fork in your left hand, knife in your right.

191
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,930
Don't make any noises when you're eating.

192
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,000
Looks like it's true.

193
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,570
What is?

194
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,570
Your story.

195
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,480
That you were the daughter of
the director of a big hospital.

196
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,280
You thought it was a lie?

197
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,310
Before I brought you to this city...

198
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,360
you just seemed like an alcoholic woman,
no matter how I looked at you.

199
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,550
I'm quite different now, aren't I?

200
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,070
You look like a classy lady, no two ways about it.

201
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,530
This is my true form.

202
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,750
Eva Heinemann just returned to where she belongs.

203
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,970
What's that?

204
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,490
An invitation to a party.

205
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,570
A party?

206
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,480
That's right.

207
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,940
This was the Job that was given to me.

208
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,970
Job?

209
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,230
To attend several parties.

210
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,440
That's it.

211
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,520
That's good.

212
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,270
It sounds like a fun job.

213
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,850
You're coming as well.

214
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,010
You'll be my escort, a gentleman worthy of me.

215
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,110
This is getting more unpleasant by the second.

216
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,830
How does it feel to finally be back on home ground?

217
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,560
What's so funny?

218
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,860
What are all these people talking about?

219
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,060
The weather?

220
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,930
Stocks?

221
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,850
I can't even tell what language they're speaking.

222
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,410
I'm starting to feel sick.

223
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,510
There you are.

224
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,120
Don't mind me.

225
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,430
Please enjoy yourself.

226
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,490
Let's go.

227
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,460
We're leaving.

228
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,500
W-Wait!

229
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,130
He wasn't at this party.

230
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,600
My job here is done.

231
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
Who wasn't here?

232
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,360
Take me away from here!

233
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,020
I don't care where!

234
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,600
Just hurry up and take me away from here!

235
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,350
At the time...

236
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,200
I didn't know why this woman's hand was trembling.

237
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,930
I've managed to somehow survive the day.

238
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,740
What's wrong?

239
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,680
Didn't you return to the place where you belong?

240
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,830
My life used to be like that every day.

241
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,180
I thought if I returned to that world...

242
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,370
the real me would come back.

243
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,440
But now...

244
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,360
places like this bar are the only places
where you feel comfortable.

245
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,270
I don't belong in a place like this, either!

246
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,830
Not a place like this!

247
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,980
Not places like that, either!

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,280
There's no place for me, no matter where I go!

249
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,050
I knew that!

250
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
I think...

251
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,050
that after I've finished this job...

252
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,120
I'll surely be killed.

253
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,110
I thought it'd be better than staying a mess and
getting killed by Roberto in Düsseldorf.

254
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,360
I thought it'd be better to die as the
well-dressed Eva Heinemann.

255
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,270
Even though it's all the same...

256
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
once I'm dead.

257
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,920
I thought I'd protect her.

258
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,450
My bad habit came out.

259
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,600
At the time, I suddenly thought to myself...

260
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,590
that I wanted to protect this woman.

261
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,690
Man!

262
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,260
How the hell did this happen?!

263
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,230
T-That's why I'm going to tell...

264
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,700
everything to Dr. Tenma right now...

265
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,570
H-Hang in there!

266
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,370
Almost there!

267
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,280
We're almost there!

268
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,680
Necktie...

269
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,440
If I didn't have something like this...

270
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,680
I wouldn't have had to go to a place like that.

271
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,560
I wouldn't have had to...

272
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,990
see something so terrifying.

273
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

274
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

275
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

276
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

277
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,530
The Man Who Saw the Devil
