1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,960
You'll be okay. Hang in there!

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,960
Shoot me.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,920
Shoot me.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,380
Kill him...

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,340
I'll save you!

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,070
Will you shoot me like you did back then?

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,740
Yes.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,080
I'll end everything.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,370
End?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,090
What is "the end"?

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,050
End...

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,300
End...

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,010
End...

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
End...

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,470
End.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,270
I've seen "the end of the world," time and again.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,480
What is "the end"?

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,860
It will end.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,820
You'll die, and I'll die, too.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,870
You've seen it?

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,080
What have you seen?

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,870
Hey!

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,620
What have you seen?

24
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,850
You don't know.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,430
I'll tell you...

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,730
the actual, horrible story.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm home.

28
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,030
I'm Home

29
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,180
This actual, horrible story...

30
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,690
The various things I saw...

31
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,450
The various stories...

32
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,740
that I told to you...

33
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,050
I was taken from the room at the Three Frogs...

34
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,760
and placed in a pitch black room with no walls.

35
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,430
Everything I touched felt funny.

36
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,940
A room without an up or down, left or right...

37
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,900
but I knew someone was observing me.

38
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,860
A completely silent room...

39
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,450
No... Sometimes, I..

40
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,080
faintly heard screams.

41
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,500
Meals were provided from some unknown place.

42
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,010
I counted the number of meals I was given...

43
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,470
Five.

44
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,890
Six.

45
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,930
Seven.

46
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,980
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

47
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,270
Twenty-one, twenty-three...?

48
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,530
When I could no longer keep track
of the number of meals...

49
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,380
that man was standing there.

50
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,760
Listen to me now.

51
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,840
People...

52
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,180
can become anything.

53
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,600
<i>Huh?</i>

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,730
<i>A little child like you shouldn't be wandering
around in a place like this.</i>

55
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,320
<i>No, this is the child who...</i>

56
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,740
<i>Oh, this is the child?</i>

57
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,750
<i>Wow, you're cute..</i>

58
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,000
<i>Oh, this is the child.</i>

59
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,760
<i>Wonderful. How beautiful.</i>

60
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,390
<i>Look here. This is the child.</i>

61
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,760
<i>This kid?</i>

62
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,260
<i>Our achievement.</i>

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,770
<i>This is our achievement.</i>

64
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,270
<i>This is the child?</i>

65
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,770
<i>This is the...</i>

66
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>Our...</i>

67
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,560
I can only remember bits and pieces of the speech.

68
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,490
<i>by the achievement of the...</i>

69
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,580
<i>new... this...</i>

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,790
<i>know... we, selected comrades... propose a toast...</i>

71
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,920
<i>to the future of our nation.</i>

72
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
<i>Cheers!</i>

73
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,500
<i>Cheers!</i>

74
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,740
The first person collapsed.

75
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,410
Several people ran towards him.

76
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,700
Those who ran towards him...

77
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,420
also started collapsing, falling down, one after another.

78
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,500
Groans...

79
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,710
Yells...

80
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,180
Fear filled the room.

81
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,140
The forty-two people who were there died...

82
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,690
except for one man, Franz Bonaparta.

83
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,960
I ran...

84
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,460
trying to escape from that place.

85
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,600
I didn't notice when my arm was scratched
by the thorns in the rose garden.

86
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,730
I ran.

87
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,280
When I arrived at the Three Frogs...

88
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,610
you welcomed me home.

89
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,990
I kept talking...

90
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,620
day after day...

91
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,040
telling you all that I had experienced.

92
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,620
No...

93
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,650
No...

94
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,480
No...

95
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,030
No!

96
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,890
Nina...

97
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,440
Can you hear me, Nina?

98
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,520
Calm down.

99
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,940
Nina.

100
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,570
It's me.

101
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,490
It's Tenma.

102
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,740
Do you understand?

103
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,660
It's me.

104
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,080
Right.

105
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,500
That's right.

106
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,630
Calm down.

107
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,880
All right.

108
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,260
Good girl.

109
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,320
It's all right.

110
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,900
It's all right now.

111
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,780
No!

112
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,400
No, no!

113
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,240
It wasn't me!

114
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,040
I wasn't the one who said "welcome home"!

115
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,750
The one who said that was...

116
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,790
I...

117
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,710
What I said was...

118
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,270
<i>I'm home.</i>

119
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,520
<i>Welcome home.</i>

120
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,530
Johan's wrong.

121
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,740
He only listened to my story.

122
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,040
The one who was taken to the Rose Mansion was...

123
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,920
The one who was taken to the Rose Mansion was...

124
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,040
me!

125
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,140
The one who was taken and dragged
down the stairs in the Three Frogs...

126
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,520
The one who was counting the meals in the
pitch black room, the one without walls.

127
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,360
The one who was standing in the
midst of all those dead people...

128
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,150
That...

129
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,330
That was me!

130
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,830
I'm scared.

131
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,920
I'm scared.

132
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm scared.

133
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
<i>I'm home.</i>

134
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,050
<i>Welcome home.</i>

135
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,700
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

136
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,200
<i>Well...</i>

137
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,210
<i>Well...</i>

138
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,510
I told him...

139
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,930
for days and days...

140
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,930
It's all right.

141
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,680
I told Johan what I experienced.

142
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,770
Johan thought my experience was...

143
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,440
It's all right now.

144
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,060
Johan thought my experience was...

145
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,650
his own experience.

146
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,150
It's my fault that Johan...!

147
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,530
It's all right now!

148
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,200
I told Johan everything just a little while ago.

149
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,370
Johan listened to my story...

150
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,960
and he looked like he was smiling.

151
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,170
But he also looked like he was crying.

152
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,300
I've...

153
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,840
I've never seen...

154
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,010
such an expression before.

155
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,770
I couldn't...

156
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,020
shoot him.

157
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,020
But he will probably destroy himself...

158
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,730
just like me.

159
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,230
No, you can't!

160
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,030
Just like I'm destroying myself!

161
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,240
You can't!

162
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,450
You can't...

163
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,910
If you die...

164
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,000
If something happens to you...

165
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,590
what am I supposed to do?

166
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,800
If you die...

167
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,590
where would I go?

168
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,350
Stay alive.

169
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,850
Please.

170
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,730
No matter what.

171
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,270
Please!

172
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,660
Yeah, it's me.

173
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,170
A car was found near a lodge?

174
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,460
Yeah...

175
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,590
It fell off a cliff.

176
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,170
Edward was killed in this car.

177
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,680
The one who did this was probably...

178
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,900
Johan is probably...

179
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,160
going to kill Franz Bonaparta.

180
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,330
His son lives in Prague.

181
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,590
I told Johan about that.

182
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,680
But...

183
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,010
I wonder if that will put an end to everything.

184
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,230
I wonder if that will calm his madness.

185
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,660
His sister's memories...

186
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,330
The things that are missing from her memories...

187
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,920
Inside Johan...

188
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,220
was there one more memory?

189
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,890
I wonder... what we were trying to create.

190
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,730
Franz...

191
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,570
Franz Bonaparta...

192
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,300
Stay alive...

193
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,140
at any cost.

194
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,550
The place you should go...

195
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,810
The place we should go...

196
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,140
We'll definitely get there someday.

197
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,160
Hey, it's great to see you!

198
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,790
This is a rare visit.

199
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,090
Now...

200
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,340
please come in.

201
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,470
I was just making tea.

202
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,350
I wanted you to try my famous tea.

203
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,400
So, do you like it?

204
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,570
It's a special herb tea.

205
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,990
You came all the way out here.

206
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,040
You must have something important to say.

207
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,620
Just tell me what it is you need.

208
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,080
I'll prepare it right away.

209
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,090
Who are you going to kill next?

210
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,930
Huh?

211
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,100
Enough with the strange jokes.

212
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,230
Stop it.

213
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,600
I woke up...

214
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,610
from the dream.

215
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,070
You must be tired or something.

216
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,610
What are you going to do about the plan?

217
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,870
I woke up.

218
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,910
Wait a minute.

219
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,620
Then why did I raise so much money?

220
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,000
I woke up...

221
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,330
from the dream.

222
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,340
Then why did I kill all those people?

223
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,430
I've seen the final scene so many times...

224
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,810
but I see a different scene now.

225
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,850
The true final scene.

226
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,360
The memory that only I possess.

227
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,620
The place where I should truly go.

228
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,390
The place where I should go...

229
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,790
Ruhenheim...

230
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,000
This is it.

231
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,950
Yes

232
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:44,380
Cherish what you know is true in this world.

233
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:44,380
Ima kono sekai de wakaru koto mitsumete

234
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,340
Yes

235
00:22:47,340 --> 00:23:01,020
Please believe in the kindness of your eyes

236
00:22:47,340 --> 00:23:01,020
Anata no hitomi no yasashisa wo shinjite

237
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:25,880
Make it home to your land of harmony

238
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:34,300
Make it home to your land of purity

239
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,760
Make it home
