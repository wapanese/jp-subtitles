1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,550
This jam is really good.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,760
Thank you.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,010
It's homemade lingonberry jam.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,010
Homemade...

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,520
I was told to show this to any guest who likes it.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,770
This is the maker of the jam.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,690
Who is he?

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,020
His name is Conrad.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,190
There's an area just south of here where
a lot of lingonberries grow.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,280
At some point, that area became his.

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,540
He makes such a fantastic jam that I don't
see how anyone could complain.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,380
He really is a pleasant man and he's one of my few friends.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,380
Showing people this picture was his idea.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,930
He thinks that having people see
the real jam maker, Conrad,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,890
will make people want to buy his jam in the future.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,430
So we'll have to come back here for some jam sometime.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,930
That's right.

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,110
He'll be thrilled to hear that.

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,770
Are they really going to invade this peaceful town?

20
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,860
The Peaceful House

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,110
Invade? There are other means to their end.

22
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,780
There are cases where a single gun has destroyed towns.

23
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,490
Zweifelstadt in 1958.

24
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,130
They all thought that their neighbor was the killer.

25
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,170
The residents were all on edge just going through their normal daily activities.

26
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,920
They were all in a group hysteria.

27
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,180
One of them,

28
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,470
a man called Volg Rogner, shot his neighbor
with a gun he bought for self-protection.

29
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,850
After that, no one could stop it.

30
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,060
Fire raged through the town, and everything
at hand was used as a weapon.

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,780
All the residents participated in the massacre.
There wasn't a single survivor.

32
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,950
Is that going to happen in this town?

33
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,280
We have to stop it,

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
before it starts.

35
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,040
It might have already started.

36
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,090
Hey, pay up!

37
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,890
You have it! Now give it up!

38
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,470
No! That money's mine!

39
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,970
It's going to pay for your drunk dad's booze anyway.

40
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,690
It's not good for your health to drink so much.

41
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,600
This is an intervention.

42
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,320
You want to go get some grub.

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Yeah!

44
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,780
Boy.

45
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,750
You hate them, don't you?

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,380
You hate them enough to kill them, don't you?

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,550
Where are you going?

48
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,140
I'm going to go talk to Conrad.

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,140
Talk about what?

50
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,770
Didn't you notice Ralph and the customers
grinning at us at his cafe?

51
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,900
That's because it's rare to see us together as a couple.

52
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,280
Who knows what they'll do if they find out
we won 20 million marks in the lotto.

53
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,870
D-Don't...

54
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,620
I have to talk to him rather than continue living in paranoia.

55
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,880
We don't even know if he knows that I won.

56
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,630
Then what are you going to do?

57
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,720
I'll pay him off.

58
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,890
That way he'll keep his mouth shut.

59
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,850
What if Conrad gets greedy and keeps
asking us for more money?

60
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,020
Th-Then I'll...

61
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,390
Then you will what?

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,020
I-I don't know.

63
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,650
Isn't it around here?

64
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,490
The place where he picks lingonberries.

65
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,740
Honey.

66
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,910
Huh?

67
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,250
Conrad's a pretty good person.

68
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,210
He's not the kind who'd try to cash in on our good fortune.

69
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,460
Isn't that right, honey?

70
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,230
What's wrong?

71
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,230
You didn't!

72
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,440
It wasn't me!

73
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,950
I can't believe you've done something
you can never take back!

74
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,110
I told you it wasn't me!

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,950
Then who did it?!

76
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,290
How should I know? I haven't even
shot my gun since I bought it.

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,580
What an annoying dog.

78
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,840
It's pissing me off.

79
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,300
I'm so irritated.

80
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,810
You seem to be in good spirits today.

81
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,060
Did anything good happen?

82
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,020
He finally appeared.

83
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,770
Who appeared?

84
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,280
A wonderful man who will take me away from here.

85
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,790
Alcohol. Alcohol.

86
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,580
Dammit.

87
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm the laughing stock of this whole town.

88
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,380
This isn't cool at all...

89
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,430
Alcohol.

90
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,390
Isn't this...

91
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,150
what you really want?

92
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,410
Your son already took one.

93
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,460
A gunshot.

94
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,510
The dog isn't barking anymore.

95
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,610
That was great.

96
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Mr. Lipsky.

97
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
You're Franz Bonaparta's son, aren't you?

98
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,410
Tell me where to find your father.

99
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,210
It's a race against time.

100
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,130
If I don't hurry, something horrible is going to happen.

101
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,710
You know, don't you Mr. Lipsky,

102
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,420
where you father is.

103
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,510
That doll is based on Nina, isn't it?

104
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,770
Nina told me you were here.

105
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,060
Nina...

106
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,690
The curtain...

107
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Could you open it for me?

108
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,650
Yeah.

109
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,620
How long have I been like this?

110
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,990
Don't worry about it.

111
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,120
You need to rest.

112
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,710
Thank you.

113
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,040
I know that you've been watching out for me.

114
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,380
Don't worry about me.

115
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,090
I'm okay.

116
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,010
I'm not trying to kill myself.

117
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,970
Dr. Reichwine and Dieter will be here soon.

118
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,140
What about you?

119
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,100
I have to go.

120
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,190
Where?

121
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,900
I don't know.

122
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,360
You were looking at a lot of materials
over there, weren't you?

123
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,820
Did you figure anything out?

124
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,990
I'm okay, so talk to me.

125
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,830
I got some information from people affiliated with
the former Czechoslovakian secret police in Prague

126
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
and from a subordinate of General Wolf.

127
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,760
About Franz Bonaparta?

128
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,470
Yeah. He's a very mysterious man, but I think
I was able to put together a profile on him.

129
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,890
He's a German-Czechoslovakian.  It seems that Franz Bonaparta is an alias as well.

130
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,450
After WWII, many German-Czeckoslovakians were chased out of their Bohemian homeland,

131
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,200
but his family remained.

132
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,080
It's unclear what role he played in the communist Czechoslovakian government.

133
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:59,000
I know that he married a Czech woman and had a child.

134
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:09,760
I know the child is one of the students who participated
in his first reading seminars in the '60s.

135
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,640
"Bonaparta has a son in Prague."

136
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,570
I think that Peter Capek's last words were about that son.

137
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,900
This is a copy of an old photo, but I have a photograph of the boys

138
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,370
who participated in the reading seminars in the '60s.

139
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,950
The kid on the left is...

140
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,830
"The unexceptional child."

141
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,790
He was an unexceptional child, so he couldn't
participate in the reading seminars anymore.

142
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,710
You know him?

143
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,340
Bonaparta had no use for him.

144
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,470
It's probably a man I know in Prague.

145
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,100
Does he know where his father... where Bonaparta is?

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,940
I don't know.

147
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,400
But he is your best lead.

148
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,280
If you don't hurry, something horrible is going to happen.

149
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,740
Something horrible?

150
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,490
I know...

151
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,740
what Johan is trying to do.

152
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,990
What is that?

153
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,490
The perfect suicide.

154
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,620
True solitude.

155
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,290
A true expression of love.

156
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,960
If you don't hurry, many innocent people will die.

157
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,800
Your bookshelf.

158
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,010
You have a lot of books written by Bonaparta
under his many pen names.

159
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,810
I've read many of them.

160
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,730
The more I read, the more I notice something.

161
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,820
I wondered why they all have German names.

162
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,990
Klaus Poppe's "The God of Peace."
It's that way in this book, too.

163
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,490
The problem is with this pen name, Klaus Poppe.

164
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,750
Franz Bonaparta and all the other pen names are all Czech.

165
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,250
This is the only pen name that's German.

166
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,340
Could it be that Klaus Poppe is your
German-Czechoslovakian father's real name?

167
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,350
There was a detective who figured out my father's
real name using the same line of reasoning.

168
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,520
A detective?

169
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,360
Inspector Lunge from the BKA.

170
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,730
Lunge!

171
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,650
He was here?

172
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,690
He left weeks ago.

173
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,740
He left?

174
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,280
He also figured it out.

175
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,370
No, it's more like he became the person,
rather than figured it out.

176
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,620
"I am Klaus Poppe. I have no place to go home to."

177
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,460
"In order to take back the tranquility in my heart,
I have to return to my heart's homeland."

178
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,430
German-Czechoslovakians lost their homeland
after Germany lost the war.

179
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,680
Where in Germany are his ancestors from?

180
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,100
I don't know that many details.

181
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,690
When I was little, my father said this:

182
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,730
"Our home is a town surrounded by
mountains in South Germany."

183
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,200
I had no use for it, so I gave it to Inspector Lunge.

184
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,740
A postcard I received about 3 or 4 years ago.

185
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,580
It had no return address.

186
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,830
There was a hand-drawn sketch of
a town from a mountain-top view.

187
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,750
Signed KP.

188
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,500
KP.

189
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,590
Klaus Poppe.

190
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,720
That's all I know.

191
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,640
South Germany.

192
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,300
A city surrounded by mountains.

193
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,230
Is my... Is my father going to be killed?

194
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,890
I don't know.

195
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,650
But it won't end there.

196
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,190
Nina... Is she safe?

197
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,740
I want to give this doll's drama a happy ending.

198
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,660
Please protect her.

199
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,570
Yes.

200
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,080
What's going to happen?

201
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,330
He is... Johan's trying to recreate it.

202
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,090
The tragedy at the Red Rose Mansion.

203
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,670
The massacre at 511 Kinderheim.

204
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,800
Please...

205
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,510
no matter what happens, please come back alive, Tenma.

206
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,480
You saved me, so you, too, should...

207
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,730
It's starting...

208
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,700
to rain.

209
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,590
Alcohol! Get me alcohol!

210
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,460
Dammit.

211
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,850
What happened?

212
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,600
Have the police found Conrad's body?

213
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,850
No, they still consider him missing
and they're looking for him.

214
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,150
I knew we shouldn't have hidden the body in the woods.

215
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,230
We should have gone straight to
the police when we found him.

216
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,070
What are you saying?

217
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,610
Even you thought I shot him!

218
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,160
We're in this situation because you had to play the lotto!

219
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,490
You're the one who bought the guns!

220
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,130
It's not going to come, no matter how long you wait.

221
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,130
The bridge has been flooded because of this heavy rain.

222
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,590
Even traffic has been stopped by the flood.

223
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,850
So this is a solitary island.

224
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,850
Klaus Poppe?

225
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,230
Do you know of him?

226
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,060
Jakub Farobek...

227
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,520
Emil Scherbe...

228
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:07,370
I think they are all the same person.

229
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,120
But you notice these things when
you've seen as many as I have.

230
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,840
I have no idea why he uses so many pen names though.

231
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,800
The pictures are nice, but I don't like his books very much.

232
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,720
There are many picture books with dark topics.

233
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,760
But, this man's books are different.

234
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,310
How are they different?

235
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,150
There's a lot of malice.

236
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,530
One more thing.

237
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,410
Helmuth Voss's picture book.

238
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,490
It was released in '89.

239
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,960
There weren't many printed, so it
was very hard for me to obtain.

240
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,000
This is the same person as Klaus Poppe.

241
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,000
How do you know?

242
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,630
You just notice these things.

243
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,220
People's style shows up no matter how hard
they try to make the art look different.

244
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,850
The content is completely different from
the other books he has written.

245
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,270
A thief sneaks into a mountain town.

246
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,940
He plans to steal the money from the people there,

247
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,900
but as he lives with the people there, he forgets how to steal.

248
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,160
He then lives a quiet life working
for the people of the town.

249
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,490
The title is "A Restful Home."

250
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,000
The disturbing feeling you get after reading
his books is completely gone.

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,500
Too bad his art isn't very good.

252
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,460
Isn't it strange?

253
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,630
When his stories get good, his art gets bad.

254
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,470
It seems like he lost sight of his goal.

255
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,260
"A Restful Home."

256
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,680
A town in the mountains.

257
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,900
Our home is a town surrounded by
mountains in South Germany.

258
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,110
Get me a map.

259
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,690
Huh?

260
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,150
Do you have a map of South Germany?

261
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,240
What are you looking for?

262
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,200
A town in the mountains of South Germany.

263
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,290
Here it is!

264
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,670
Ruhenheim.

265
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,220
Ruhenheim
(A restful home)

266
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,180
It sure is pouring out!

267
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,180
How is it? Have you found Conrad yet?

268
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,140
I have no idea where he is.

269
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,230
My partners are still looking for him...

270
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,690
but not in this rain.

271
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,780
The rails and the roads are all flooded by the river.

272
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
You must be worried about your friend.

273
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,030
What's going on here?

274
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,950
This town is normally so peaceful.

275
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,790
First, Conrad goes missing.
Then Mrs. Hillman's dog is shot.

276
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,540
Mrs. Hillman is so upset that she can't even get out of bed.

277
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,800
Last night, Mr. Kemner was attacked after he left the pub.

278
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I heard he was in critical condition.

279
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,350
We don't know who did it.

280
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,640
If Mr. Kemner dies, it will be the first murder in this town.

281
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,190
Because of this rain, we can't get any help.

282
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,520
What am I supposed to do when I don't have enough men?

283
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,690
It has to be outsiders.

284
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,490
There's never even been a crime in this town before.

285
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,240
It has to be the work of outsiders.

286
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,620
We're outsiders.

287
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,830
I didn't mean you.

288
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,330
It sure is pouring out.

289
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,840
I can't go outside at all in my wheel chair.

290
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,680
I'll go find my partners and make another round.

291
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,300
Be careful!

292
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Your husband's shoes...

293
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,190
are pretty dirty.

294
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,610
It's as if he was walking in the rain.

295
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,200
I'm going to borrow the phone.

296
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,260
That alcoholic.

297
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,180
He's not the kind who'd try anything funny.

298
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,900
What's wrong?

299
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,530
Are you out of gas?

300
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,740
I could call a repairman...

301
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,790
Another gunshot...

302
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,180
I couldn't get through.

303
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,270
We cant stop it...

304
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:43,220
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

305
00:22:44,310 --> 00:23:00,620
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

306
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:25,700
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

307
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:34,180
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

308
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,570
The Town Massacre
