1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,120
Go on. Eat up.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,960
The white sausage is great here.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
How is it? It's delicious, isn't it? It's Dieter, isn't it?

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,720
If you don't eat, Dieter's going to eat it all.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,260
Don't worry, Dr. Tenma.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,730
It's safe here. Only regulars come here.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,820
If someone new came,
Otto would throw them right out.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,900
Because I only have people like you
here, business does not improve.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,200
Who ordered the Spetzel?

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,990
That was me.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,160
I've prepared a bed in the attic.

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,160
If you can stand the rats, you can rest there.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,830
Thanks, Otto.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,630
He might seem a bit unsociable, but
he's got a good side to him, too.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,590
Eat! You can't go on an empty stomach.

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,890
Thank you. You've even gone so
far as to arrange a room for me.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,300
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,890
If you hadn't saved me, I'd be in the morgue.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,560
I feel more alive eating this great food.

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,230
Oh, I'm so full.

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,860
I've contacted Dr. Gillen.

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,320
He's relieved that we've found you.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,410
He left a message for you in a newspaper ad.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,580
"Let's discuss our memories of cheating."

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,250
You knew about it?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,250
Yes.

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,340
Then why didn't you contact him?

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,340
I didn't want to draw him into this.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,850
Don't be silly.

30
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,850
The thing we need the most is friends.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,600
So, you said that you were watching over me for some time?

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Because of the incident with Richard Braun.

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,860
Richard?

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,450
When he was on the police force, he
shot a young serial murder suspect.

35
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,620
When I was reading that newspaper article,
Dieter saw the boy in the photo.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,580
He was in 511 Kinderheim.

37
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,500
511 Kinderheim?

38
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,130
An orphanage in East Berlin.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,130
A special one.

40
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,600
Dieter's foster parent was originally a teacher there.

41
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,850
Was there something about that orphanage?

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,850
Johan was there, too.

43
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,270
So the boy that Richard shot and Johan
might be connected somehow then?

44
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,900
I don't know.

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,860
I came here because I wanted to investigate that
in more detail, but now Richard is dead.

46
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,330
At the cemetery, I saw you in front of his grave.

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:54,130
It's as if Richard brought you to me...

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,470
You've hung in there for so long by yourself.

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,430
But now you're not alone.

50
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,100
I will prove your innocence.

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,100
Johan is just in front of our eyes.

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,850
The photo... Huh? What happened to it?

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,190
I must have left it in the office.

54
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,110
I thought we'd know everything once
I'd shown you Johan's picture.

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,360
Probably, the man who came to kill you...

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,700
Was ordered to destroy it...

57
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,200
That man's name was Hesse.

58
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,580
His wife had been coming for counseling.

59
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,840
I looked at his contact information and found
out there wasn't anyone named Hesse.

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,670
Johan is right in front of our eyes.

61
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,300
And if he's so close, that means we'll meet him.

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,930
We'll meet him face to face...

63
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,180
We'll meet Johan...

64
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,130
In Broad Daylight

65
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,060
Tahlbach & Schubert AG...

66
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,020
That company was the center of Schubert's financial world.

67
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,150
Schubert, who usually didn't appear
anywhere, began to show up again.

68
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,950
At about this time of the morning, he used to inspect
the companies that he was involved in.

69
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,830
That's what Richard found out.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,880
Not only this company, but all of his financial groups
came here and greatly improved their earnings.

71
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,880
Ever since that certain boy became his assistant, that is.

72
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,130
Here he is.

73
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,480
The one in the wheelchair is Schubert.

74
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,100
The one pushing him is Karl.

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,980
And...

76
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,550
Well, is it him?

77
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,640
There's no doubt.

78
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,550
Good.

79
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,810
It's the first time...

80
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,190
It's the first time I've seen him in broad daylight.

81
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,940
That's right. We'll bring everything into broad daylight.

82
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,700
It has to be now.

83
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,240
That's right!

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,450
We have to prove your innocence now!

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,370
But for now, we should go hide in Otto's attic.

86
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,960
We'll clear your name soon.

87
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,260
Richard's file is around here somewhere.

88
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,090
There it is.

89
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm glad I brought this home.

90
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,390
We're almost there.

91
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,440
We're almost there, Richard.

92
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,230
Your revenge will be complete when
we find one more person.

93
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,690
We're right on Johan's heels.

94
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,070
I've found Dr. Tenma, a key witness.

95
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,740
All that's left is...

96
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,120
We need to find a witness from
the night of Richard's death.

97
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,580
There's got to be one.

98
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,710
We just need someone to verify that Johan
was the one with Richard that night.

99
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,590
If we can't do that, there's still the student, Farhen, who
claimed to be Schubert's son, and committed suicide.

100
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,390
If Johan was the young boy who went
with him to see the prostitute,

101
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,940
and if we could find that prostitute, we'd be able to prove it.

102
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
That's not all.

103
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,030
If we find the people who said they were Johan's parents,

104
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,570
we might be able to find out exactly who Johan is.

105
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,820
After all, I found the grave of Johan Liebert.

106
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,950
We've got Johan right where we want him.

107
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,630
Say, Dr. Tenma.

108
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,260
When I look at you, you remind me of Richard.

109
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,220
It looks like you're fighting for all the justice in the world,

110
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,310
but you're not alone.

111
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,270
Dieter is with you.

112
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,140
So is Dr. Gillen, too.

113
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,230
And so am I!

114
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,190
It's okay. Sleep well tonight.

115
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,410
I didn't want to drag him into this.

116
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,120
It's the first time...

117
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,420
It's the first time I've seen him in broad daylight.

118
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,130
It has to be now.

119
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,050
You're...!

120
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,470
Hurry, run away!

121
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,220
Now!

122
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,900
Hello, this is Reichwine.

123
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,160
Doctor, it's Gillen.

124
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,080
Oh, actually, I was just about to call you.

125
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,910
I'm on my way there now.

126
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,960
Where's Tenma?

127
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,830
He's at the hideout I mentioned before.

128
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,050
Tell him not to leave!

129
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,220
Something's wrong...

130
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,880
I felt there was something wrong.

131
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:13,140
Dr. Tenma isn't chasing after Johan to clear his name...

132
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,230
I was worried about that, too.

133
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Dieter...

134
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,630
Why are you here?

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Tenma told me to come here.

136
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,890
Where's Tenma?

137
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,100
He left.

138
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,100
Where d he go?

139
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,140
He's going to do it.

140
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,020
Huh?

141
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,640
Tenma's going to do it.

142
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,650
Stop him.

143
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,610
Mr. Reichwine, stop him.

144
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,820
Tenma...

145
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,120
He's going to become a murderer.

146
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,160
Let's quit here for today.

147
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,460
Don't say that. Please listen to me, Doctor.

148
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,290
It gets interesting here.

149
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,250
I'd like you to take your time telling me the next part.

150
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,680
The third woman I killed was the best.

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,970
Come on, Doctor.

152
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,510
Listen to me.

153
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,600
Do you have any idea what her voice
sounded like as I strangled her?

154
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,940
C'mon, Doctor. Listen to me!

155
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,730
Doctor, that woman...

156
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,990
Where did you go, Tenma?

157
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,370
So, we finally meet, Dr. Gillen.

158
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,330
Who are you?

159
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm Lunge from the BKA.

160
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,260
I've heard the rumors.

161
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,640
Many of my research subjects were arrested by you.

162
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,190
I read your book as well.

163
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,900
Thank you.

164
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,440
It's a great book.

165
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,440
"A Summary of Abnormal Criminal Psychology."

166
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,870
There are no other books that go
so deep into the criminal mind.

167
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:09,000
Especially the 3rd Chapter, pages 262 to 294 on Heinz Kaul.

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,260
I had a deep interest in the discussion
that claimed that the trauma he

169
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
experienced at a young age led him to crime.

170
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,640
How detailed. I'm honored you read it so thoroughly.

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,440
My method of investigation is to
dive into a criminal's heart...

172
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,610
and walk through what he would think and do.

173
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,110
You have a lot of experience.

174
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,660
If you have some time, I'd love to talk with you...

175
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,950
Since we both don't have much free time, let me ask one thing right now.

176
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,160
You've been in Munich a lot lately, haven't you?

177
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,670
And what about it?

178
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,750
Please sit.  It won't take long.

179
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,760
You met with Dr. Reichwine, a psychologist, there

180
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,390
just the other day.

181
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,180
Yes, he was a great teacher I had in college.

182
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,310
At Dusseldorf University, right?

183
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,600
Yes.

184
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,110
There was a great brain surgeon that graduated from

185
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,860
Dusseldorf University at around
the same time as you, right?

186
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,860
What are you trying to say?

187
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,450
Did you meet him,

188
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,320
Dr. Tenma?

189
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,330
What are you talking about?

190
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,410
"Let's discuss our memories of cheating." --Rudi.

191
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,460
From May 1st until May 22nd, you printed this three
line ad in all the major newspapers in the area.

192
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,340
That's quite surprising.

193
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:49,100
I can't believe that such good students like you
and Dr. Tenma were cheating in college.

194
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,390
Great things, aren't they? True friends, that is...

195
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,190
We weren't really friends back in college.

196
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,740
Last year in May, in Oder Park...

197
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,870
With your cooperation, the Velbert police were just
about to arrest Dr. Tenma, but he got away.

198
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,370
That was because the bug I was wearing broke.

199
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,880
I think you helped him escape.

200
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,460
He, Dr. Tenma, is innocent.

201
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,890
I want you to listen with an open mind.

202
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,600
The three murders at Eisler Memorial
Hospital in Dusseldorf,

203
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,640
the murder of the patient in the building
that was under construction,

204
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,980
the murder at Heidelberg,

205
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,650
the murders of the middle-aged couples across
the nation were not committed by Tenma.

206
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:47,370
That's my opinion, as an expert in criminal psychology,
from my face to face meeting with Tenma.

207
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,620
I see.

208
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,500
Then, where is he now?

209
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,710
He's gone somewhere.

210
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,880
Why is he running?

211
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,550
If he's innocent, why is he running?

212
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,710
He's not running.

213
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,970
Why did he leave without telling
you? You're his friend, right?

214
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,680
I have proof that he's not the killer.

215
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,690
Take a look at this.

216
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,940
All of the case's information has been
gathered and analyzed here.

217
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,180
It must have been quite a lot of trouble to put this together.

218
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,310
Do you understand now?

219
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,310
Yeah.

220
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,820
The death of Farhen, the man who
pretended to be Schubert's son,

221
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,820
the death of the former police officer investigating
the case, Richard Braun.

222
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,330
The suspicion about Schubert having an illegitimate son...

223
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,750
The one in the center of it all is that young boy...

224
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,290
and that boy's name is the same as the name
of the real killer that Tenma spoke about.

225
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,710
Johan Liebert.

226
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,590
There is a person with the same
first and last name in Bruntal.

227
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:38,560
After the death of Richard Braun, someone
began to target Dr. Reichwine.

228
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,150
I understand quite well.

229
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,530
It's useless.

230
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,320
It's impossible to prove that all those things are related.

231
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,210
And because he knew that fact the best, Tenma left.

232
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,330
Am I wrong?

233
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,590
Those hand movements...

234
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,930
Don't pay any attention to that.

235
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,890
It's something I use to help me remember.

236
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,030
A psychologist like me would say that it's the physical
representation of the uncertainty in your heart.

237
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,950
I'm the same.

238
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:36,330
Instead of my hands, I play with this cassette recorder.

239
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,830
The information recorded in your hand
movements is by nature, subjective.

240
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,550
That's how you've done your work
for a long time now, hasn't it?

241
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,630
Your hand's memories are correct.

242
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,010
Your decisions were never mistaken.

243
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,730
What are your hobbies?

244
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,640
Do you live only for your work?

245
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,100
Have you ever made a mistake?

246
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,860
Are you horribly afraid of making a mistake?

247
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
To you, Tenma must be the killer.

248
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,700
If he's not, your identity will be destroyed.

249
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,750
Look at the truth.

250
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,870
This is a photo of Johan Liebert.

251
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,500
Can you prove that everything is just Tenma's lies?

252
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,390
This guy...

253
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,350
Where is this young man now?

254
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,690
He's a student at Munich University.

255
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,900
He's Schubert's secretary.

256
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,150
Can I have this photo?

257
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,200
This is police business from now on.

258
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,870
I might have made a terrible mistake.

259
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,880
Where is Dr. Tenma now?

260
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,010
He should be in Munich.

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,400
It's Lunge.

262
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,910
Send a message to the Munich Police.

263
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,370
This is a request for emergency police officer deployment.

264
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,790
Tenma is in Munich.

265
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,460
A sniper rifle?

266
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

267
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,930
You should have gotten a call from
a Mr. Heitmeyer in Fussen.

268
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,310
It'll be an advanced payment of 10,000 Marks.

269
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,940
I've got it right here.

270
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,410
Your order will be a bit hard to get ready
for you, so you'll have to give me a week.

271
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,330
You better toughen up before then.

272
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:28,330
If you pay a heap of money for something you can't use,

273
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,880
On to the next item of news...

274
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,350
The reception party for next week's Munich Electronics
Fair was held today by the Chamber of Commerce,

275
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,520
and was attended by many leaders of the financial world.

276
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,690
The News Media Network, which is involved with the EU,

277
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,860
is now supported by Bayern's industry.

278
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,530
This will be a large-scale convention as never seen before.

279
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,240
Furthermore, at this reception a man who has not
been seen in public for the past twenty years,

280
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,370
Harts Georg Schubert, attended and
received a unanimous welcome.

281
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,710
Although Schubert was in a wheelchair, he looked healthy and had great appeal with the financial leaders.

282
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,490
Sanctuary
