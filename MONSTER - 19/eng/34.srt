1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,010
He's been released from the hospital?

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,270
Yes, Johan Liebert was released this morning.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
Oh, I see.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,690
I heard that he just collapsed all of a sudden, but I guess it was nothing serious.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,200
You come to the library often.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,160
You're the librarian from the college library.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,250
I see, he was released from the hospital. Thank goodness.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,370
I didn't know what would happen to him.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,830
He collapsed right in front of you?

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,420
He was looking for a book.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,510
And then all of a sudden, he fainted?

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,340
Yes.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,550
He started screaming.

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,010
Screaming?

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,270
He picked up this picture book. Then
he turned the pages like this.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,980
A picture book?

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,980
At the Edge of Darkness

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,400
Shouldn't you rest for a while?

20
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,400
There's nothing wrong with your brain or your brain waves.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,820
Physically, you're completely healthy.

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,030
The doctor said it must have been anemia or stress from
too much work that made you pass out like that.

23
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,330
If it wasn't that, then you must have had quite a shock.

24
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,870
Or that was just what he said.

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,880
I never knew you had surgical scars on your head.

26
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,260
Either way, you should take a break from
your work and studies and relax.

27
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,510
Oh, yeah. While you were in the hospital, you got a letter.

28
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,890
A letter?

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,020
There's no return address written on it.

30
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,690
I don't think it's a letter bomb though.

31
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,580
What is it? What's so funny?

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,080
Who is it from?

33
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,920
It's from the Red Hindenburg.

34
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,630
Huh.

35
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,770
I see we got a pretty boy who wandered in.

36
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,110
Are you lost? Or are you looking for a good time?

37
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,030
I'll show you everything you need to know, from start to finish. Come with me.

38
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,240
Do you know of the Red Hindenburg?

39
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,320
In this letter it says it's around this area,

40
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,540
The Red Hindenburg.

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,040
You, at your age?!

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You've got some pretty screwed up tastes!

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,630
It's down there.

44
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,140
Drugs... Give me some drugs.

45
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,200
Is the Red Hindenburg up here?

46
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,940
Come in.

47
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,030
Thanks for coming.

48
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,490
Have a seat.

49
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,620
What a face!

50
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,040
You have such a beautiful face.

51
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,300
I saw you on the news.

52
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,310
So, you used the name "Margot Langer" and now
you're using the name "The Red Hindenburg?"

53
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,310
Before then I was "Blue Sophie." Names aren't important.

54
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,690
It's that right, Johan Liebert?

55
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,530
Anyways, that's what my boyfriend calls me.

56
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,870
The boyfriend that's right behind this door, at least.

57
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,450
Isn't that right, dear?

58
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,540
So don't try anything funny.

59
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,000
He's got a big gun cocked and ready behind there.

60
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,090
He's got it big where it counts
too, If you know what I mean.

61
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,010
You found me.

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
What a carefully laid plan to get back
at that millionaire, Schubert.

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,490
It was pretty impressive.

64
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,490
You brought that Farhen kid to him before didn't you?

65
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,910
I never would have thought that Schubert's
real son would show up right afterwards.

66
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,420
The one I feel bad for is Farhen.

67
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,710
You made him commit suicide
after you were done with him.

68
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,550
It took you two years.

69
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,510
Just like two years ago the real Margot Langer died.

70
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,770
When she died, I really reaped the benefits.

71
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,570
It's not that I was close to her.

72
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,370
She wasn't a streetwalker anymore.

73
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,450
She had already washed her hands of this business.

74
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,290
We only had two or three drinks together.

75
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,920
She hadn't had someone to talk to for a long time.

76
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,050
After she weakened, I told her to tell me everything.

77
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,220
She told me about the love affair with Schubert
and the son she put up for adoption.

78
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,970
And then she got killed.

79
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,770
And then I took her name, Margot Langer, and
got all the money I wanted from Schubert.

80
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,530
The police said her murder was committed
by some phantom killer.

81
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,160
The police never thought this plan was going to happen.

82
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,830
Oh, yeah. That's right.

83
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,000
That detective, Richard or whatever,
I feel sorry for him, too.

84
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,590
If he hadn't gotten involved, he wouldn't
have committed suicide either!

85
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,220
So how many people have you killed?

86
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Well, let's end the small talk here and get down to business.

87
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,570
You can't escape it anymore and you're giving up.

88
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,480
Isn't that right, dear?

89
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,950
Tell me.

90
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,990
How much will you give me?

91
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,660
Are you listening?

92
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,220
What do you think true fear is?

93
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,890
I thought I had been to the darkest place in the universe.

94
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,430
It's no use trying to change the subject.

95
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,190
But beyond that...

96
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,610
I saw even blacker darkness.

97
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,410
Hold it right there!

98
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,200
Do you think I'd let you just leave like this?

99
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,290
I've stopped.

100
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,670
I don't have any interest in Schubert anymore.

101
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,380
Don't mess with me.

102
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,170
It's useless.

103
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,340
I am a non-existent person.

104
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,510
Don't underestimate me.

105
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,590
Honey, come out here!

106
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,450
Honey, what are you...?

107
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,950
Roberto!

108
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,510
Could I have a balloon?

109
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,690
Buy your drugs with this.

110
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,230
Carstensen St.
(Munich)

111
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,320
Are you still not ready, Doctor?
He's bleeding from the head!

112
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,940
What are you talking about? We were here first!

113
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,320
Shut up, kid! That's nothing to be screaming about!

114
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,200
Just sit and wait your turn!

115
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,370
No matter how much noise you make,
there's only one doctor here.

116
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,550
What's that long stick thing you got there?

117
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,090
Well, it's just a...

118
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,770
Is the doctor here really that good?

119
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:52,770
Yes. If this doctor wasn't here, then the Asians in the neighborhood, especially the Vietnamese, would die.

120
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,230
Oh, really?

121
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,440
You're not Vietnamese, are you?

122
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,650
No.

123
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,950
Wait for your turn.

124
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,080
You don't look so good, but the injured come before
you. You need to take care of your health.

125
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,160
I'm not a patient.

126
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,580
Sit and wait with us.

127
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,750
Hurry up and look at this, will ya Doc?!

128
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,380
We were here first!

129
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,340
Excuse me.

130
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,590
What the hell?

131
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,260
Wait your turn!

132
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,890
Doctor, I have something I need to ask you.

133
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,430
Do you understand what they're saying?! Wait outside.

134
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,140
I don't have time for this.

135
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,400
A woman? On top of that...

136
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,560
Didn't you hear me? Please get out.

137
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,780
How old is this doctor?

138
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,660
I'm in the middle of finishing a suture.

139
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,660
It's your fault if something happens to this patient.

140
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,250
A stab wound in the thigh?

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,080
Caused by a knife.

142
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,420
The stitches are pretty clean. But...

143
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,920
You should have inserted a drainage tube.

144
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,970
Don't complain to me about things.

145
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,050
If you're not going to do it properly, you should
send him to a hospital as soon as possible.

146
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,640
I am doing it properly.

147
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,680
This is not a hospital.

148
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,480
You aren't a real doctor.

149
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,650
If I could take him to a real hospital, I would have already.

150
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,610
The people here are illegal residents
and illegal immigrants.

151
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,200
If they went to a real hospital, they'd be arrested
immediately and deported back to their home country.

152
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,290
Do you know how many of these people have
died because they couldn't go to the hospital?

153
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,800
Don't say such arrogant things, when
you don't know the circumstances.

154
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,720
Insert a drainage tube.

155
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,760
There's a good possibility that he
was stabbed with a dirty knife.

156
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,020
If you don't insert the tube, you'll
cause an abscess formation.

157
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,400
Okay.

158
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,360
Take out one or two stitches.

159
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay.

160
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,280
Put the drainage tube in about 5 cm deep.

161
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,090
You did a great job.

162
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,510
Okay, who's the next patient?

163
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,580
Are you awake?

164
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,340
I heard from your patients.

165
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,840
You've been up for 48 hours working.

166
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,300
I looked at the patients you treated.

167
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,720
You're pretty good for an unlicensed doctor.

168
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,890
How old are you?

169
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,850
Seventeen.

170
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,810
What a surprise. You're so young.

171
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,650
You're as good as a real doctor.

172
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,900
I guess.

173
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,740
The doctor who's licensed to practice here mysteriously
disappeared, just leaving his equipment here.

174
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,370
Just because you have equipment
doesn't make you a doctor.

175
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,580
Where did you learn medicine from?

176
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,290
My dad was a doctor.

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,620
Was?

178
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,590
My dad was a Vietnamese doctor. He brought me to East Germany to study.

179
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,550
We stayed here and opened this small clinic for business.

180
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,090
But when the wall was destroyed,

181
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,810
Even with his limited training, he tried
to save the Asian immigrants here.

182
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,980
But then...

183
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,730
This group of punks calling themselves
Neo-Nazis killed him.

184
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,280
He was killed... just because the
color of his skin was different.

185
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,580
I was all alone, so I was sent to an orphanage.

186
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,210
Then I was adopted by some German people.

187
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,300
But they only adopted me out of their sense of civic duty,

188
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,930
as I was just a poor yellow-skinned girl.

189
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,680
So I ran away from them.

190
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,020
I always helped my dad when I was younger.

191
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,940
I read all the books my dad left behind.

192
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,150
I decided to continue in my dad's footsteps.

193
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,240
Move. I'll finish up.

194
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,950
That should do it. Take it easy until it heals, okay?

195
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:58,910
Yes, sir.

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,420
Well, let in the next patient.

197
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,170
That was the last one.

198
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,800
You should go home and study.

199
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,890
This country gives people who study a chance.

200
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,560
It seems like you're a real doctor.

201
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,140
You're saying that amateurs should just back off, right?

202
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,150
I'm not telling you that.

203
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,440
I'm just...

204
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,570
What would happen to these people, if I was gone?

205
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,150
Who's going to look after the people here?

206
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,570
I'm just saying...

207
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,780
Mom!

208
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,780
What?

209
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,040
My pimp went crazy all of a sudden.
Then he pulled a gun on me.

210
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,710
Mom!

211
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,170
She walked all this way after getting shot?!

212
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,800
My mom said you could save her.

213
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,090
But...

214
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,600
Save her. I'm begging you. Save my mom!

215
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,100
I got it. Don't worry. Leave her to me.

216
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,810
Please, Doctor!

217
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
She's a hooker.

218
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,490
The only people who suffer like this are people like them.

219
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,490
I want to do something for her, but...

220
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,070
I can't do anything about this.

221
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,910
I'll put her on the operating table.

222
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,240
Take her legs.

223
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,330
It's useless. We have to take her to a real hospital.

224
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,130
If we take her now, it will be too late.

225
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,710
I know my limits! This is beyond me!

226
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,260
Don't give up until the end!

227
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,600
As long as your patient is breathing, don't
give up your hopes until the very end!

228
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,100
Don't give up your hopes!

229
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,440
If the artery to her inner stomach is damaged,

230
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,730
her blood pressure will suddenly drop,
and she'll eventually go into shock.

231
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,030
But, since she was able to walk all the way here,

232
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,990
that means that her blood pressure has been
decreasing steadily and she's in pre-shock.

233
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,620
Looking at this gunshot wound, there's a good
possibility that it damaged part of the spleen.

234
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,540
In other words,

235
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,710
if we preform emergency surgery on her abdomen while
transfusing blood and remove it, then there's still hope.

236
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,300
Let's start.

237
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,840
Take the scalpel.

238
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,450
It looks like he calmed down and
was able to fall fast asleep.

239
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,950
Miraculously, there was no damage to the bones,
the small intestine, the large intestine,

240
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,160
or any of the organs of the digestive system.

241
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,210
We were able to limit the damage
to the spleen. We were lucky.

242
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,840
It was a spectacular operation.

243
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,970
It's because you were there.

244
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,180
Mommy...

245
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,310
Dr. Tenma.

246
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,100
Stay here.

247
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,570
There's something I need to ask you.

248
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,120
This newspaper article...

249
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,290
"Blue Sophie" a.k.a. "Red Hindenburg."

250
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,290
The first person on the scene of this prostitute's murder...

251
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,580
was you.

252
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,290
Yeah.

253
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,510
Could I ask you...

254
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,510
What the place looked like?

255
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,470
That night, someone called me over there.

256
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,690
She was shot through the head.

257
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,270
It was a quick death.

258
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,770
I've seen many other crime scenes just like that.

259
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,440
But this was the first time...

260
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,240
When I went into the room, I could feel it.

261
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,580
It wasn't a robbery.

262
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,080
It wasn't to settle a grudge.

263
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,960
She was just killed.

264
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,130
Johan!

265
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,220
If you're in the middle of the darkness, you'll
be completely enveloped by darkness.

266
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,560
Shine light on it.

267
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,400
Got it?

268
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,650
Study hard!

269
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,570
You can definitely do it.

270
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,900
You can become a great doctor.

271
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,120
Wait! Where are you going, Dr. Tenma?

272
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,960
It looks like you're the one sinking into a deeper darkness.

273
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,840
You'll be back, won't you Dr. Tenma?

274
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:43,070
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

275
00:22:44,160 --> 00:23:00,470
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

276
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

277
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:34,030
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

278
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,530
My Nameless Hero
