1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,990
What's going on?

2
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,620
What's wrong?

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,540
The books!

4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,620
They're on fire!

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,750
Put out the fire!

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,630
Hurry up!

7
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,150
What's going on?

8
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,150
My job was to shoot Schubert.

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,280
What's going on?

10
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,910
I see.

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,160
So you've changed your mind, Johan.

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,540
I like it better this way. It's much better.

13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,210
They're all running around in circles,
like ants running from a fire.

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,430
This is great. It's great, Johan.

15
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,510
It's great.

16
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,230
Take a look at this.

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,000
The books... The books are burning!

18
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,510
They're all running around.

19
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,590
They're all scrambling to escape.

20
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,020
Can you feel it?

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,020
The fear.

22
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,930
Whether you can shoot first or not
that is where the path diverges.

23
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,720
That determines whether you can use a gun or not.

24
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,650
What have you learned about guns before?

25
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,310
Nothing.

26
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,400
So you're simply a natural then?

27
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,820
No.

28
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,030
I've never shot one.

29
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
Not even once?

30
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,660
That's right.

31
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,540
When you fire a gun, always fire twice.

32
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,420
If you fire twice, the probability that you will deliver
the finishing blow increases by 100 times.

33
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,130
If you can't do that,

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,420
then it's as if you've just been killed.

35
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,390
I have to shoot.

36
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,600
You can't do it.

37
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,100
I have to shoot.

38
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,610
You can't shoot anyone.

39
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,110
I have to shoot...

40
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,860
You're just a doctor.

41
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,950
You can only give people life.

42
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,370
Taking someone's life is my job.

43
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,710
You can't do it.

44
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,150
Always shoot twice.

45
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,280
The Demon In My Eyes

46
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,900
He didn't shoot me.

47
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,450
The trembling... has stopped.

48
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,750
Johan.

49
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,430
The smoke's in the way!

50
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,520
Hurry! If I don't then...

51
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I won't let him get away.

52
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,600
Save us.

53
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,980
We can't get out of here.

54
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,860
Open up, please.

55
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,690
Please calm down.

56
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,110
Everyone, please calm down.

57
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,120
Follow the security guards and get in line.

58
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,330
I-It's no good!

59
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,330
The doors are all locked.

60
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
What?

61
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,670
Then escort Mr. Schubert.

62
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,380
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,340
Do you have a safe place prepared for him?

64
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,300
Or do you plan to take Mr. Schubert
through this sea of flames?

65
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,350
Knock the doors down!

66
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,060
Yes, sir.

67
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,070
There are a lot of books burning.

68
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,780
The flames will burn everything.

69
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,280
Is this all you wanted to do?

70
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Are you satisfied using this way to convey
the pictures of hell in the books

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,170
that I had you read to me?

72
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,050
So what you wanted wasn't to become like me?

73
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,300
I've decided not to do that.

74
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,520
A different idea popped into my head.

75
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,400
You're not afraid, are you?

76
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,660
Where did you come from?

77
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,870
Who are you?

78
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,170
Can you see me?

79
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,680
Even though your eyes are getting worse and worse,
if I'm this close, you should be able to see me.

80
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,020
Can you see what's reflected in my eyes?

81
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240
I was born in a town that was straight out of a fairytale.

82
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,570
Many people died.

83
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,330
I held the hand of my other half and walked.

84
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,500
There were only two like us.

85
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,390
We didn't have names.

86
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,930
Lady!

87
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,100
It's you.

88
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,230
Dieter, do you know this woman?

89
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,820
A fire.

90
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,470
Karl, I have a document I want you to get for me.

91
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,300
Go back to the estate and get it.

92
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,810
Is this it?

93
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Mom...

94
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,050
Th-This is...

95
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,180
A Report on the Investigation Concerning
the Death of Margot Langer.

96
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,550
Herflich Detective Services.

97
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,270
Margot Langer.

98
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,140
Real name, Helenka Novakova.

99
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,730
Born August 12, 1955, in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

100
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,610
In 1970, at the age of 15, immigrated
illegally into former West Germany.

101
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,290
As a high-class call girl in Munich,

102
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,170
she had clients from the center of the business and political worlds

103
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,380
and her name was well know among the social elites.

104
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:54,390
Furthermore, one of her clients was Hans Georg Schubert.

105
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,810
Dad, you were still investigating mom's death.

106
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,570
At the age of 23, she had Schubert's child.

107
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,900
That boy's name was Karl.

108
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,910
Got it, Karl? Listen carefully to what your mom has to say.

109
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,910
Take this money and get on the train on Line 5.

110
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,210
But what about you, Mom?

111
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,790
I told you I can't come with you.

112
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,500
I'll stay with you.

113
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,090
No!

114
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,510
If you stay with me, if you stay here, they'll
keep on calling you the son of a whore.

115
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,600
So hurry.

116
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,850
Dad...

117
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,980
They say dad abandoned me.

118
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,730
He didn't abandoned you...

119
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,070
because I don't hate him.

120
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,490
Mom!

121
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,290
Mom!

122
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,880
He stayed in a number of foster homes...

123
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,640
and suffered many hardships.

124
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,720
He had some wonderful parents, but he was alone.

125
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,060
Always alone.

126
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,860
Although it's not in this report...

127
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:37,950
Although she was a high-class
prostitute, she retired in 1992.

128
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:45,830
There was some information that soon after, she was
involved with the head of the black market bank,

129
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,250
but that has never been confirmed to be true.

130
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,920
Somewhat related to that, the black market bank
has been involved in money laundering for the

131
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,550
German criminal underworld for about
the last five years, since '91.

132
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,560
In other words, they were an organization
that single-handedly monopolized

133
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,190
the process of taking illegal funds from the underworld
and converting it into legal money.

134
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,780
After retiring from being a prostitute, Margot
Langer lived in Offenbach, Hessen.

135
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,990
The picture is of the apartment she stayed in.

136
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,830
She lived with a young man who was around
18, but their relationship was unknown.

137
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,590
November 2, '95, Margot Langer is discovered on Heide St.

138
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:44,100
According to the police file, the murder was
random and the culprit was never found.

139
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,600
Mom...

140
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,030
Furthermore, three months before Margot Langer's
death, she sent a letter to a friend.

141
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,280
I have a copy of what was written here.

142
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,950
This is my mom's hand-writing.

143
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,760
I quit my job and I'm now living a quiet lifestyle.

144
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,010
The things I think about in my peaceful life are...

145
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:30,140
the son that I am separated from and my friend who
tried to cross the Czechoslovakian border with me.

146
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,150
My friend was captured at the border
and was taken back to Prague.

147
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,570
Afterwards, she gave birth to twins
and is now living happily.

148
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,710
Yes. Recently I met a young man who's
the same age as the son I left behind.

149
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:54,250
His face looks exactly like the face of my Czech friend.

150
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,510
Talking to him feels like I'm talking to my son.

151
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,470
He must have been raised to be a fine young man.

152
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,890
He must be living happily somewhere.

153
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,810
That's what I believe.

154
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,270
Don't worry, Mom.

155
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,940
I'm not alone anymore.

156
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,070
Dad wanted me to read this letter.

157
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:31,660
I finally understand what mom meant
when she said she didn't hate him.

158
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,330
Don't worry, Mom.

159
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,250
I'm already...

160
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,890
Dammit! All the doors are locked.

161
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,770
Dieter, did you contact the fire department?

162
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,730
I did already!

163
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,930
Damn it!

164
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,940
What's happening inside this library?

165
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,720
Out of the way. Move away from the door.

166
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,220
It's open!

167
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,270
Don't rush. Carefully, one at a time.

168
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,270
Make a line and get out in an orderly fashion.

169
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,900
Women and elderly people first.

170
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,400
Thank you. I don't know how to repay you.

171
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,280
Two more shots left.

172
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,080
Wait. Hey, you!

173
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,790
Johan.

174
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,220
Stop!

175
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,730
Dr. Tenma.

176
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,940
You mustn't shoot!

177
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,690
Nina!

178
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,480
D-Don't, Nina!

179
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,990
Don't do it!

180
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,750
Damn it!

181

<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>
