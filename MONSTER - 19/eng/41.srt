1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,100
Mr. Petrov?

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,440
No,

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,400
maybe I should call you Mr. Reinhart Hermann?

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,110
There was a special orphanage in East Berlin.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,620
It was an experimentation ground for brainwashing
young boys and changing their personalities.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,330
It was called 511 Kinderheim.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,000
You were the director there.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,460
You should know everything.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,010
What were you trying to do...

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,680
back there in East Berlin...

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,100
at 511 Kinderheim?

12
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,990
Wait!

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,990
Wait a sec, Mr. Petrov.

14
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,210
I've heard that you were a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

15
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,130
But in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, your speciality
was scientific personality management.

16
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,960
Or in other words, brainwashing.

17
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,840
That's not right.

18
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,480
Why would they have an expert in brainwashing
as the director of an orphanage?

19
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,230
If you were just raising the children,

20
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,060
there must have been someone more qualified than you.

21
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,150
Right?

22
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,360
Go home.

23
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,990
You don't know anything.

24
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Get out of here.

25
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,240
Where is it hidden?

26
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,700
The records of the experiments at 511 Kinderheim.

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,080
There are a lot of rumors.

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,660
Rumors about the whereabouts of many secret government documents

29
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
from East Germany after the wall fell.

30
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,130
One set of documents was shipped
through Romania to Russia,

31
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,850
but a revolution broke out there and
Ceausescu's state was destroyed.

32
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,270
The whereabouts of the documents were lost there.

33
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,020
But I don't think the documents about 511 were destroyed.

34
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,480
Why do you think so?

35
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,030
Because you're a scholar.

36
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,830
To a scholar,

37
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,410
his data and thesis are more important than his life.

38
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,920
He can't give up on something that precious so easily.

39
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,920
I'd like you to show me those documents.

40
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,840
What were you trying to do...

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
at 511 Kinderheim?

43
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,930
I don't know anything.

44
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
Was your experiment a success?

45
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,700
Is it fun using people like marionettes?

46
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,170
Was the experiment...

47
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,210
a failure then?

48
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,930
In 1985, 511 Kinderheim was destroyed in a fire.

49
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,940
According to the rumors, the children
there massacred each other.

50
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,690
At that time,

51
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
I wasn't the director.

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,990
It has nothing to do with me.

53
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,030
Yeah,

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,450
you barely escaped.

55
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,410
Five of the directors were the first to be killed in the revolt.

56
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,960
If I was there, that would not have happened.

57
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,750
The experiment was a success.

58
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,460
Oh, is that what you meant?

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,340
When you were in charge, everything went well.

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,270
That means all the materials on 511
Kinderhiem were burned then.

61
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,270
So only the data from when you
were in charge is still around.

62
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,280
You're stepping on dangerous ground.

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,570
I'm not responsible for whatever happens to you.

64
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,990
Now you're threatening me?

65
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm not scared at all.

66
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,120
Get out of my sight.

67
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,000
No, I'm going to hang around until I get the truth from you.

68
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,250
Get lost!

69
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't show yourself in front of me ever again.

70
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,090
Get outta my sight!

71
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,350
Grandpa!

72
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,100
You were late coming home, so we came to get you.

73
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,400
Who's this person?

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,440
No one.

75
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,320
Let's go home.

76
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,490
Keep your nose out of this.

77
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,960
So he spends the rest of his life surrounded by his
grandchildren and enjoys an easygoing lifestyle.

78
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,130
Even though he did such awful
things to children in the past.

79
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,440
Coming.

80
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,570
Who is it?

81
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,820
A package from Mr. Petrov.

82
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,870
Petrov?

83
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,160
Wait a second.

84
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,270
Corner rooms have such a bad view,

85
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,400
but they're pretty convenient in situations like this.

86
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,790
Wait up!

87
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,380
I was in quite a dangerous situation this morning.

88
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,380
Some strange men came to my hotel room.

89
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,100
Are those your grandchildren?

90
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,510
They look so nice.

91
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,850
You have a life free from worldly cares.

92
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,940
Back when I was a newspaperman in East Germany,

93
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,110
I could never have imagined it, a life like this.

94
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm a freelance journalist now.

95
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,570
Free.

96
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,280
I couldn't even imagine what it was like under socialism.

97
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
Freedom is so nice.

98
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,500
I could just follow you forever.

99
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,420
I followed you from where you left this morning.

100
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,670
What a nice house.

101
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,800
The rooms look so spacious.

102
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,470
The rent must be high.

103
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,310
You spend your time at the cafe without a care in
the world, and go on walks with your grandsons.

104
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,730
Even though you're not working,
you enjoy such a nice lifestyle.

105
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,980
Where are you getting money from?

106
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,820
What do you sell?

107
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,610
Did you get a good price for the
data on the failed experiments?

108
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,870
It was a success?

109
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,240
Leave me alone.

110
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,500
Then you sold it for even more.

111
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,540
Leave me alone.

112
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,670
Just...

113
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,460
leave me alone.

114
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,900
My, my.

115
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,610
He took his grandkids to see a movie
and had chocolate parfait at the cafe.

116
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,540
Different kids again...

117
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
One, two...

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,170
three, four...

119
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,630
five, six.

120
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,650
Don't tell me...

121
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,530
Hey there. This is Mr. Petrov's house, isn't it?

122
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,200
Can I come in?

123
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,540
Hey there.

124
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, my God.

125
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,790
He's doing...

126
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,380
the same thing...

127
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,720
the same experiment...

128
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,390
over again.

129
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,350
What is this?

130
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,780
What is this?

131
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,240
That man is trying to do the experiment over again.

132
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,330
At the German border, there's
a place with many prostitutes.

133
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,250
These boys were born there.

134
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,050
After the wall fell, many children were abandoned
in the midst of all the poverty.

135
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:24,390
So you gathered those children here to continue the experiment from 511 Kinderheim.

136
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,520
Oh, Mr. Petrov. Do you have a guest?

137
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,190
Don't mind him.

138
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,020
He'll be leaving soon.

139
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,070
How would you like knedliky for supper tonight?

140
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,410
Your knedliky is everyone's favorite.

141
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,290
Continue the experiment at 511 Kinderheim?

142
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,080
I've been telling you,

143
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,210
the experiment there was a success.

144
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,090
There's no need to do it again.

145
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
A success...?

146
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:10,350
The education program that I applied was an
incredible success at molding personalities.

147
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,310
Education?

148
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,440
Where was the education in that?

149
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,860
That was human experimentation!

150
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,490
Think!

151
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,740
What is education?

152
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,660
Isn't creating people that society
demands called education?

153
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,540
When you look at education,

154
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,540
you look at whether it creates the
people who are demanded.

155
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,090
Education is an experiment!

156
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:48,100
There was an active education system at 511 Kinderheim.

157
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,140
How can you say it so nonchalantly after doing such horrible things.

158
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,890
Horrible things?

159
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,860
Think about what you did to the children!

160
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,900
Don't talk to me like you know, when
you've only scratched the surface.

161
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,160
What's with that look?

162
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,710
That experiment where children killed each other,

163
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,420
is that what the results of your experiment were?

164
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,380
I told you.

165
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,760
That happened after I was no longer the director there.

166
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,810
The program was taken over by an outside element.

167
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,190
An outside element?

168
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,530
Darkness.

169
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,620
Hatred, nihilism, destructive urges.

170
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,580
Humans are easily controlled by those things.

171
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,460
They were possessed by those things...

172
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,830
back then at 511 Kinderheim...

173
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,800
After the arrival of a certain boy, that is.

174
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,510
So that wasn't your fault either?

175
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,220
Like I told you,

176
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,010
the experiment was a success.

177
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,930
That's a lie.

178
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,230
The people who graduated from 511 Kinderheim
were all trained to have one missing part.

179
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,940
They cannot love others.

180
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,860
That's an interesting point.

181
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,490
That's the end of our conversation.

182
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,490
Leave.

183
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,160
Don't mind me anymore.

184
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,750
No, Czechoslovakia is a democratic nation.

185
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,710
I'll report you to the police.

186
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,800
You don't have the right to run
an orphanage in this country.

187
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,800
You don't have approval here.

188
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,760
If I tell them, you'll be arrested.

189
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,930
You want a deal?

190
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,190
You want me to give you the experiment
data, so that you won't report me.

191
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,770
Is that the deal you want?

192
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,900
Let's go everyone.

193
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,370
What are you trying to do?

194
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,080
Let's play soccer!

195
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,160
Soccer?

196
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,250
Let's play!

197
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,410
All right, let's go.

198
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,420
Let's go!

199
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,500
What are you thinking?

200
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,260
Just like you heard, we're going to go play soccer.

201
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,610
Hey, everyone.

202
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,780
Mr. Petrov wants to make a deal with me.

203
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,950
But for your sake, I don't really care about the deal.

204
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,210
When I tell the police, you'll be free.

205
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,000
Don't you all want to leave that house?

206
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,960
No.

207
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,300
You have more freedom outside.

208
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,720
Hey, listen.

209
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,350
Hey, wait up! Wait up!

210
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,690
Look out, Mister! The ball!

211
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,990
He's so bad!

212
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,040
They're laughing.

213
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,880
How come...

214
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,210
they seem...

215
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,550
happy from the bottom of their hearts?

216
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,310
Don't tell me...

217
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,810
Mister!

218
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,990
Wait up, Mister!

219
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,760
Such a pretty lady.

220
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,260
Mr. Petrov, are the children...?

221
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,050
Huh?

222
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,020
What?

223
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,730
Mr. Petrov!

224
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,400
Miss Anna!

225
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,610
Miss Anna!

226
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,280
Mr. Petrov!

227
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,830
Hold on!

228
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,040
Grandpa?

229
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,540
Grandpa!

230
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,880
Who did it?

231
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,840
Mr. Petrov?!

232
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,050
A woman.

233
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,840
A woman?

234
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,090
Grandpa!

235
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,350
What's wrong, Grandpa?

236
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,770
You're bleeding, Grandpa!

237
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,570
Mr. Petrov, are you the children's?

238
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,190
Key.

239
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,870
A key and a card... number code...

240
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,290
The back of my third drawer.

241
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,830
The experiment data and a tape are in a safe deposit box.

242
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,500
A tape?

243
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,260
A tape of an interview with that certain young boy.

244
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:05,560
It's him, while under the influence of drugs, talking
about the past trials he himself endured.

245
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,770
The monster who lead 511 Kinderheim to destruction.

246
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,900
Grandpa!

247
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,530
Don't die!

248
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,990
Grandpa!

249
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,820
How about it?

250
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,830
Are these children missing anything?

251
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,800
Mr. Petrov, are you really using the education
from 511 Kinderheim on these children?

252
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,720
Hatred, nihilism, destructive urges.

253
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,810
I wanted to make people who would
not be taken by the darkness.

254
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,310
Do you know how to do that?

255
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,900
Love?

256
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,070
It really is a new discovery.

257
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,570
Mr. Petrov.

258
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,830
That's just a natural thing to have between
children and their parents.

259
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,080
No.

260
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,790
It's an experiment.

261
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,500
Grandpa!

262
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,210
Grandpa!

263
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,510
Grandpa!

264
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:43,110
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

265
00:22:44,200 --> 00:23:00,510
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

266
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:25,590
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

267
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:34,070
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>
