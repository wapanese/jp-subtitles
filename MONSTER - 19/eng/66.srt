1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,400
Mom!

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,900
Don't let go of my hand!

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,690
Mom!

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,950
Mom! Mom!

5
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,950
Welcome Home

6
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,630
The man.

7
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,680
He was a German-Czechoslovakian
who stayed in Bohemia after WWII,

8
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,890
the eldest son in his family.

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,650
He was a soldier who graduated
from a military officer school.

10
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,440
He was an elite who would carry
his country into the future.

11
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,190
His name...

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,110
His name doesn't matter.

13
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,290
The woman.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,750
She was the only daughter of a Moravian
elementary school teacher.

15
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,300
A beautiful woman with blonde hair and blue eyes.

16
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,020
She attended Brno University, majored in genetic engineering,

17
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,980
and carried the hopes of her teachers.

18
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,980
Her name...

19
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,690
Her name doesn't matter.

20
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,950
They met at a cafe in Prague.

21
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,330
They instantly fell in love.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,590
Soon after, she became pregnant.

23
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,640
And then the man confessed...

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,310
that this was his mission.

25
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:36,820
Men and women selected by their race, intellect,
physique, and endurance were to have children.

26
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,910
This experiment was conducted with dozens of couples.

27
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,870
They were one of those couples.

28
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,540
The man completed his mission exactly
as the scenario prescribed.

29
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,290
But at that point, he no longer wanted to play his part in it.

30
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,880
And then he said this:

31
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,890
Let's run away!

32
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,890
The two of them ran away.

33
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,670
The man said he wouldn't be a
part of the scenario anymore.

34
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,170
But the scenario had already taken that into account.

35
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,480
The woman was confined to an unfamiliar room.

36
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,620
Let me see him.

37
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,580
He has received a new mission.

38
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,750
Let me see him.

39
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,010
He has received a new mission.

40
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,090
Let me see him.

41
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,970
He has received a new mission.

42
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,350
The woman said over and over

43
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,720
"Let me see him."

44
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,810
"Let me see him."

45
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,690
"Let me see him."

46
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,560
"Let me see him."

47
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,070
She knew.

48
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,860
She knew he wasn't alive anymore.

49
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,540
The pregnancy went well.

50
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,960
She was carrying twins.

51
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,420
Show me your face.

52
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,760
She came to notice that

53
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,310
the man who often came to visit her,

54
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,020
the man who drew her,

55
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,110
was the man who was conducting the experiment.

56
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,030
I won't forgive you.

57
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,530
I will never forgive you.

58
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:40,250
Even if I die, the children growing inside
of me will have revenge on you.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,340
You say some pretty interesting things.

60
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,760
After a few months, she finally went into labor.

61
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,730
When she was put in the delivery
room to ease her labor pains,

62
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,110
she went into action.

63
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,330
Through an opening about 20 to 30 cm wide,

64
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,960
her heavy body racked with the pain of labor,

65
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,670
she escaped through the air ducts.

66
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,650
She collapsed on the road only
a few meters outside the gate.

67
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,490
Her water had broken.

68
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,700
How beautiful!

69
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,950
What beautiful children!

70
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,210
These are the children who will lead the human race, right?

71
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,920
Wonderful.

72
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,180
I've thought of names for them.

73
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,310
Don't concern yourself with unnecessary things.

74
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,730
I've thought of them...

75
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,270
their names.

76
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,770
You didn't have to.

77
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,610
Names!

78
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,360
Give them names.

79
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,780
Give them...

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,870
Don't worry.

81
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,210
They don't need names.

82
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,350
Franz Bonaparta.

83
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,970
That's right.

84
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,940
Johan asked me where he was.

85
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,320
Bonaparta's alive?

86
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,360
"I won't forgive you."

87
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,450
"I will never forgive you."

88
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:26,830
"Even if I die, the children growing inside
of me will have revenge on you."

89
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
Franz Bonaparta is alive, isn't he?

90
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,690
You should ask Johan that.

91
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,370
He's here.

92
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,850
You're quite the doctor.

93
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,570
There's a hospital up ahead.

94
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,490
I'll take you there if you tell me where Johan is.

95
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,950
At this rate, you're going to die from blood loss.

96
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,210
I-I can't tell you what I don't know.

97
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,090
Tell us now.

98
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,430
You're quite the doctor.

99
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,430
You shoot me and then threaten me
after I've lost so much blood.

100
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,690
Where is Johan?!

101
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,740
You're quite the doctor.

102
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,800
Tell us now.

103
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,470
Hurry!

104
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,470
I can't tell you what I don't know.

105
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:27,850
Eva.

106
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,230
There's a pay phone over there.

107
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,480
Call the hospital and tell them there's
an injured person in the car.

108
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,240
Wh-What are you saying?

109
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,610
He's just about to tell us where Johan is.

110
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,160
His life is in danger.

111
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,160
Hurry, make the call.

112
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,260
You saved someone again.

113
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,690
You're always the same.

114
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,520
You can't kill anyone.

115
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,450
I wanted to meet you.

116
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,540
I'll tell you where Johan is.

117
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,060
Kenzo, an ambulance from the hospital will be here soon.

118
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,310
Let's get out of here.

119
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,440
Where is Kenzo?

120
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,820
He left...

121
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,870
He had a message for you.

122
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,170
"I can't get you involved in this."

123
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,880
"I ruined your life."

124
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,420
"I'm truly sorry."

125
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,800
"Please be happy."

126
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,230
Why are you crying?

127
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,700
I don't understand.

128
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,450
I don't understand it at all.

129
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,200
Johan?

130
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,430
Welcome home.

131
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,400
Fire!

132
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,660
There are flames coming out of the Three Frogs!

133
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,930
Now, eat up.

134
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,100
But if you eat so quickly, you'll choke.

135
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,650
You must have been hungry.

136
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,570
Where are you from?

137
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,690
What are your names?

138
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,780
You don't like talking, do you?

139
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,330
That's fine. You can talk to us after your stomachs are full.

140
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,000
Wait up!

141
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,710
Wait up!

142
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,170
I said wait up!

143
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,880
Over here!

144
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,260
What should we do?

145
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,380
What do you mean?

146
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,050
With those kids...

147
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,010
Do you think they're really orphans?

148
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,810
Even if they have parents, they must have some
reason why they don't want to go back.

149
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,440
Don't you think?

150
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,690
We wanted kids, didn't we?

151
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,360
Yeah.

152
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,320
Lets adopt...

153
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,740
Don't be ridiculous.

154
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,330
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

155
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,460
Either way, let's call the police.

156
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,260
Huh?

157
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,380
What's wrong, little one?

158
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,480
Look at these. Aren't they pretty?

159
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,900
I'm going to give them to those nice old people.

160
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,070
You don't have to.

161
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:01,820
Huh?

162
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,580
I told you. I have a plan.

163
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,040
Let's go.

164
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,210
Wait up! I told you to wait!

165
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,870
We finally meet.

166
00:18:51,750 --> 00:19:00,170
Back then, when I ran away from the Red Rose Mansion
and arrived at the door of the Three Frogs.

167
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,630
You greeted me.

168
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,390
So this time, I'll say it to you.

169
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,350
Welcome home.

170
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,270
I came to see you on our 20th birthday in Heidelberg.

171
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,940
A lot of time has passed.

172
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,650
You came to see me?

173
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
You came to kill.

174
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:37,710
The Fortners, the Lieberts, and all the people
who were kind to us... all of them...

175
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,960
You killed them all!

176
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,310
Please live!

177
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,230
Huh?

178
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,740
I said, today is a nice day.

179
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,740
Y-Yeah.

180
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,080
Driver.

181
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,040
Yes?

182
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,460
Could you go a bit faster?

183
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,750
Don't worry. Hang in there.

184
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,550
Shoot me.

185
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,180
Kill.

186
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,140
I'll save you.

187
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,080
Are you going to shoot me like you did back then?

188
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:52,910
Yes.

189
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,120
I'll end it all.

190
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,630
End?

191
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,300
What is the end?

192
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,590
The end...

193
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,050
The end... The end...

194
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,550
The end... The end...

195
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:11,810
The end.

196
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,400
I've seen the end many times.

197
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,950
What is the end?

198
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,610
I'm ending it!

199
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,330
You will die and so will I.

200
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,620
You've seen it.

201
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,880
What did you see?!

202
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,760
What did you see?!

203
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,810
You don't know anything.

204
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,110
I'll tell you...

205
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,870
a truly frightening tale.

206
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,210
I'm home.

207
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:43,230
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

208
00:22:44,320 --> 00:23:00,630
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

209
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:25,710
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

210
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:34,190
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

211
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,570
I'm Back
