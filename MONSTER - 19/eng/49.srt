1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,980
Ceske Orphanage

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,620
Goodness gracious, you're so...

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,360
How many times must you pretend to
run away before you're satisfied?

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,630
If you do it again, you won't get dinner.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,090
You hear me, Milos?

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,250
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,330
Take your hands out of your pockets
when talking to someone!

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,450
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,170
For real?!

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,070
Yeah. It was that blonde girl.

11
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,150
You saw her on Dominican Street, right?

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,010
I wonder if she lives around here?

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,160
Why didn't you keep following her?

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,680
But I was hungry.

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,810
<i>In that case, let's find out where she lives...</i>

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,490
<i>and report her to the police.</i>

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,960
<i>And tell them that Mr. Grimmer didn't kill the director</i>

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,590
<i>We'll prove his innocence.</i>

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,630
<i>Prove his innocence?</i>

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,360
<i>Then Mr Grimmer will be off the hook.</i>

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,430
<i>That's right.</i>

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>We'll hold a meeting to come up with a plan.</i>

23
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,450
<i>Milos, hurry up and finish your dinner already.</i>

24
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,840
The Cruelest Thing

25
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,680
This is the unlicensed orphanage where it first started.

26
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,810
The former director of 511 kinderheim
was murdered by someone here.

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,930
The kids said that a blonde girl walked
them right after it happened.

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,520
He restarted his experiment here.

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,910
Unlike the one at 511 kinderheim...

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,910
this one was to determine the
effects of love on the children.

31
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,630
What would you like to do?

32
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,670
Should we go in?

33
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,840
The police should have already removed any evidence.

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,710
Mr. Grimmer, what's that?

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,220
Huh?

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,500
Mr. Policeman,
 Mr. Grimmer is innocent!

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,750
Mr. Detective,
the blonde girl is the killer!

38
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,850
It's those kids.

39
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,240
The kids from this orphanage must have
come back and put these notes here.

40
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,760
Huh?

41
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,970
"To Mr. Grimmer."

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,830
Milan Boucek.

43
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,710
It's a famous soccer player's card.

44
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,520
This must be something precious to the children.

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,710
How should I react?

46
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,740
In this type of situation, what should I feel?

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,680
My emotions were stolen by 511 kinderheim.

48
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,840
After that, I went to a special school
to learn how to express emotions...

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,250
But these types of situations are
the most difficult to handle...

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,830
What kind of expression would be appropriate here?

51
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,900
How about paying those kids a visit?

52
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,730
St. Bardejov Orphanage

53
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,940
You're Mr. Grimmer?

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,870
I always hear a lot about you from the children.

55
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,170
They went out to play and haven't returned yet.

56
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,560
I hope they come back soon...

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,350
Here, take a look at this.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
It's the children's diary...

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,150
Actually, it looks more like letters addressed to you.

60
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,940
"Mr. Grimmer, let s play soccer again."

61
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,370
"Mr. Grimmer is bad at soccer, so
I'll teach him how to get better."

62
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,400
"Mr. Grimmer, come play with us again."

63
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,710
I'm smiling now, right?

64
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,390
I learned how to do this.

65
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,890
I learned how to make a smile.

66
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,900
I'm actually part of those kids' memories.

67
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,230
Why would they think of me?

68
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,670
Because they all like you.

69
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,420
They like me...

70
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,910
I thought about...

71
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,770
what kinds of emotions I should've felt...

72
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,930
when my own child was dying.

73
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,690
Should I cry in this situation?

74
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,280
Just how much should I cry?

75
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,960
Should I scream at the top of my lungs?

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,150
Or should I clench my teeth?

77
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,640
Even now, I still don't know how I should have reacted.

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
I just don't know...

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,430
Mr. Grimmer!

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,110
Hey, Antonin...

81
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,910
Mr. Grimmer, this is bad!

82
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,470
What's wrong, Antonin?

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,120
We just got a message from the Ceske Orphanage...

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,390
Something bad happened...!

85
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,090
Calm down, Antonin.

86
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,200
Calm down and tell me.

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,070
We found the blonde girl!

88
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,660
Yesterday, we went looking for
her to find out where she lives.

89
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,810
And then Milos...

90
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,560
Milos disappeared

91
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,280
krumlov National Hospital

92
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,940
I see.

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,210
The people who came to visit you were...

94
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,510
a middle-aged gentleman...

95
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,190
a tall German...

96
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,210
and a Japanese man with long hair...

97
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,820
Yes.

98
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,890
By the way, wasn't there one more person you've left out?

99
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,760
According to the nurse, there was a woman with
long blonde hair who also came to visit you.

100
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,990
A woman?

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,360
No, a woman didn't come to visit me.

102
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,610
No, the nurse was sure of it.

103
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,600
A very beautiful woman.

104
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,840
Yes, she was very beautiful.

105
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,840
But she was actually a man.

106
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,050
I see.

107
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,220
What's your name?

108
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,100
Milos.

109
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,320
Have we met somewhere before?

110
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,470
Huh?

111
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,330
N-No.

112
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,930
What were you doing there?

113
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,330
Nothing, really...

114
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,800
You come around here a lot, don't you?

115
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,360
Y-Yeah...

116
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,050
Are you looking for someone?

117
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,810
Umm... my mom.

118
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,890
Why not come over here and have a seat?

119
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,800
I have some juice for you, too.

120
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,000
Umm... Are you moving?

121
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,310
Why do you ask?

122
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,760
You have a big bag...

123
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,830
and there's nothing in this room.

124
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,810
Does your mother live around here?

125
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,680
Huh?

126
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,870
Didn't you say you were looking for your mother?

127
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,230
Yeah.

128
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,370
But I don't know if she actually lives around here.

129
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,420
Then how are you going to find her?

130
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,610
Do you have a picture of her?

131
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,600
No, I don't.

132
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,610
Then you don't know what she looks like.

133
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,250
I'll know.

134
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,360
When I see her, I'll recognize her.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,510
Nobody at the orphanage believes me.

136
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,600
They all say there's no way I'd know...

137
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,200
but I'll recognize my mom when I see her.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,600
And...

139
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,580
And?

140
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,420
My mom will recognize me when she sees me, too!

141
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,850
What if she pretends that she doesn't
recognize you when she sees you?

142
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,200
Were you born because you were wanted?

143
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,170
Why were you abandoned?

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,170
Didn't your mother abandon you
because she didn't like you?

145
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,270
T-That's not true!

146
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,660
Being born really isn't that uncommon...

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,110
Huh?

148
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,110
Almost everything in this world is meant to die.

149
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,400
In this world, a life born is nothing
more than an insignificant speck...

150
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,220
and shouldn't even be counted as an existence.

151
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,910
Death is natural.

152
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,450
Then why are you alive?

153
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,990
Is it because someone wanted you?

154
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,680
Who wanted you?

155
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,050
What is your reason for living?

156
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,980
A girl with long blonde hair...

157
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,550
Ah, that would be Anna.

158
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,820
Anna?!

159
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,190
Does this Anna live around here?

160
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:15,830
Yeah, I'm pretty sure her apartment
is in the alley two blocks down.

161
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah, she's such a nice girl.

162
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
So polite, she never fails to greet me.

163
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,790
Anna?

164
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,400
Yeah, she's such a good girl.

165
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,610
Always has a smile when she speaks.

166
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,250
Do you know what floor and room she lives in?

167
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,890
Yeah, up there.

168
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,940
Third floor, that window.

169
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,080
If what the kids say is true...

170
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,160
and if Milos was really kidnapped by that woman...

171
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,440
and that Anna girl is really her, then...

172
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,930
Then if that person is who I think he is...

173
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,920
Everything will end here and now!

174
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,620
They got away already?

175
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,040
Where did Milos go?

176
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,410
Or was he kidnapped?

177
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,120
He was following the blonde girl
in order to prove my innocence.

178
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,490
What should we do now, Dr. Tenma?

179
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,720
What expression should I make in this situation?

180
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,240
The kids got dragged into this case because
they wanted to prove my innocence.

181
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,570
The kids told us, right?

182
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,360
That Milos usually wanders the streets of Prague...

183
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,440
looking for his mother.

184
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,710
He wanted... to meet his mother.

185
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,250
I... felt nothing, even when my own child died.

186
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,950
One day, back when I was still
working for the newspapers...

187
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,880
a female colleague told me...

188
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,320
that she liked me.

189
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
So I married her...

190
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,200
because I was taught that you're less
likely to be suspected as a spy...

191
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,710
if you're married.

192
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,760
She got pregnant...

193
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,000
and gave birth to a boy.

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
Then one day, my wife was out shopping nearby.

195
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,870
When I entered my son's room...

196
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,470
he was lying face down and had stopped breathing.

197
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,570
I gave him CPR...

198
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,220
and called the doctor.

199
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,500
I did everything I knew I should do, without hesitation.

200
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,220
But he still died.

201
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,040
At the funeral, my wife broke down...

202
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,200
"How can you remain so calm?"

203
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,320
"Why can't you cry?"

204
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,960
"You're always like this."

205
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,120
"That's how you treat me, too."

206
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,210
"You're unable to love another person."

207
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,000
"There's nothing in your heart."

208
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,480
And then my wife left me.

209
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,970
We have to find Milos!

210
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,810
You said Milos was the child of a prostitute
in the red-light district...

211
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,400
near the Czech border, right?

212
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,720
Yeah...

213
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,330
If the person who was living here is who I think he is...

214
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,490
I don't think he'll let the boy live.

215
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,240
But he won't simply kill the boy either.

216
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,000
If that person is who I think he is...

217
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,970
he'll put the boy through the cruelest thing...

218
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,730
before killing him.

219
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,400
If you keep going down this road, you'll be in Germany.

220
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,590
And my mom is somewhere down this road?

221
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,230
There's a very lively place up ahead.

222
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,370
I'll be able to see my mom, right?

223
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,440
I'll wait for you here.

224
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,420
Go on ahead by yourself.

225
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,810
You'll be able to recognize your mother when you see her.

226
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,450
And your mom will recognize you when she sees you.

227
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,680
But if no one calls out to you...

228
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,410
that means nobody wanted you.

229
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,490
What will you do then?

230
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,420
What will you do?

231
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,970
Go on now.

232
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,450
Mom.

233
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,770
Cruel, huh...

234
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,330
Thank you, thank you!

235
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,600
Huh?

236
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,170
What is it boy?

237
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,080
I'm looking for someone.

238
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,850
Looking for who?

239
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,850
My mom.

240
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,350
Your mom?!

241
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,840
That's a good one!

242
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,240
What's so funny?

243
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,840
Yeah, I know your mother...

244
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,350
Where...

245
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,100
Where is she?

246
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,090
Well, you see...

247
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,640
Technically, I know like...

248
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,960
fifty of them here!

249
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,430
<i>Why were you abandoned?</i>

250
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,740
Ah, my boy!

251
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,890
My boy!

252
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,350
Who are you, lady?

253
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,880
It's okay.

254
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,190
Umm, I'm looking for my mother...

255
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,770
Never mind that, just let me hold you.

256
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,380
What's with the kid?

257
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,220
Don't tell me that's your son.

258
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,160
No way!

259
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,480
I wouldn't screw up like that.

260
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,690
Even though you're infected...

261
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,690
Shut up!

262
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,930
You wanna fight?

263
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,160
What's your problem?

264
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,640
Let go of me!

265
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,630
Wait, not here!

266
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,040
I already paid you.

267
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm a customer.

268
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
Do what your customer tells you to do.

269
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,740
But wait...

270
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,130
A kid's watching!

271
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,240
Wait.

272
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,720
keep watching.

273
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,760
Don't leave.

274
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,550
I'm a teacher in Germany.

275
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,800
At my school, I have a good reputation with the parents.

276
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,150
I'm an honorable man, and a wonderful teacher.

277
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,690
A wonderful teacher!

278
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,960
Please take that.

279
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,180
<i>Who wanted you?</i>

280
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,110
Hey, boy...

281
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
Money...

282
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,390
Are you sick, lady?

283
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,620
Soon...

284
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,170
I'm gonna die soon.

285
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,630
Why are you here?

286
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,100
I just told you, because I'm gonna die soon.

287
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,440
Money, please.

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,470
I only have this much.

289
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,470
<i>Almost everything in this world is meant to die.</i>

290
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,810
<i>Who wanted you?</i>

291
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,860
<i>What is your reason for living?</i>

292
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,510
I see...

293
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,480
That's how it is.

294
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,170
The red-light district ends around here.

295
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,100
Lots of people saw Milos in the district.

296
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,840
Should we turn back?

297
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,400
He may still be in there somewhere...

298
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,550
Milos!

299
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,090
Milos...

300
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,750
It's all right...

301
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,280
Everything is all right now.

302
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,610
Okay...

303
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,560
Come to me.

304
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,210
In order to...

305
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,880
In order to prove my innocence...

306
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,790
You tried your best, right?

307
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,870
It's all right now.

308
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,760
Come here.

309
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
It's all right...

310
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,520
It's all right now.

311
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,310
Is this how I'm supposed to feel, Dr. Tenma?

312
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,580
Would it be better if I cried?

313
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,150
I was never taught...

314
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,470
such complicated feelings.

315
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,710
What's wrong, Milos?

316
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,560
What did you see...

317
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,450
What did you see back there?

318
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,840
What have you experienced?

319
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,400
Milos, listen to me.

320
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,190
You don't have a mother.

321
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,450
But...

322
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,680
There <i>is</i> a reason why you were born!

323
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,170
You were born because someone wanted you!

324
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,480
You were definitely...

325
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,110
You were definitely wanted by someone!

326
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,410
Definitely...

327
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,070
Hey, Dr. Tenma...

328
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,270
What I just said isn't wrong, is it?

329
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,190
No.

330
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,810
Right now...

331
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,480
What kind...

332
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,200
What kind of expression do I have?

333
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,050
You're crying.

334
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:43,440
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

335
00:22:44,530 --> 00:23:00,840
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

336
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:25,920
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

337
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:34,400
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

338
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,570
The Rose Mansion
