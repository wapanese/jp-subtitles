1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,730
This is the biggest scandal in the
history of the Czech police.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,320
Regrettably, the three people who were killed

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,990
had been involved with the former
Czechoslovakian secret police.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:19,370
With this case, I believe that the dark tendencies
in the Prague police have all been wiped clean.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,040
Gentlemen, you are all proud members
of the Prague police force.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,130
I'm expecting your actions to reflect the
embarrassment you feel in your heart.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,130
Furthermore, as the new Chief of Police,

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm going to make some big changes in
order to gain back the people's trust.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,430
I'm going to introduce the special five-member senior
investigation team sent from the central office.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,940
I want you to cooperate with them so that this
horrible incident can finally be resolved.

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,940
Detective Suk, is it?

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:52,940
Yes.

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,660
I want to express my deep gratitude to you as the
new Chief of Police for your investigation.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,580
Thank you.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,120
So what's the case you're in charge of now?

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,170
It's the case about the caretaker of an unlicensed orphanage that Inspector Zeman was investigating,

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,840
the Petrov murder case.

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,340
I see. Please continue your investigation and finish it up.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Yes, sir. Well, if you'll excuse me...

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,180
Oh, one more thing.

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,480
The tall man that is suspected of killing Inspector Zeman...

22
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,610
Do you know anything about him?

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,740
No, I haven't found out anything about him.

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,990
I see. You may leave.

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,990
Excuse me.

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,380
Jan Suk.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,220
He's been assigned here for one year.

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,390
He had a close relationship with Inspector Zeman.

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,390
He exposed the hidden past of
detectives Patera and Janacek.

30
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,650
He had a meeting with Chief Hamlik just before his death.

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,320
Mark that man!

32
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,400
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,170
Hey, there.

34
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,810
I was very pleased to actually reach you by
phone at the place you said you'd be at.

35
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,310
Did you think you'd been betrayed again?

36
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,230
No.

37
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Orange juice.

38
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,250
Mr. Grimmer, are you sure it's okay
to be in such a crowded place?

39
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,960
What do you mean?

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,130
The new Chief of Police hasn't taken you off the
suspect list for the murder of Inspector Zeman,

41
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,800
and the former Czechoslovakian secret police must be after you as well.

42
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,550
Or could it be that being in crowded places is actually safer?

43
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,470
There are no safe places.

44
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,310
Huh?

45
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,440
If they want to get me, they could do
it wherever or whenever they want.

46
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,190
For instance, they could do it from the
window with the red curtain up there.

47
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,880
Mr. Grimmer, who exactly are you?

48
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,050
No way. Why do you have to go through so much?

49
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,050
I guess I just step into things a little too deep.

50
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,090
That's nothing to laugh at.

51
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,390
They're coming to kill you!

52
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,810
It's okay.

53
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,810
I step that deep because I want to.

54
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,190
Suk is currently at a cafe in the Republic Square.

55
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,610
He's here.

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,450
That man he's with is definitely Grimmer.

57
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,700
Yes.

58
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,370
Should I continue following them for a little longer?

59
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,670
So you were collecting data on
the brainwashing experiments

60
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,970
that Petrov was performing on children in former East
Germany, and that's how you got involved in all that.

61
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,630
Yeah.

62
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,680
And right before Petrov died, he gave you
the key to a bank safe deposit box?

63
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,770
Yeah.

64
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,730
He said something about "The Upbringing of a Monster."

65
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,020
"The Upbringing of a Monster?"

66
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,150
I don't know what that means, but it
seems that a lot of people want it.

67
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,990
You mean the former secret police?

68
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,330
And a blonde woman.

69
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,000
The children at the nursery home also said that.

70
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,960
Just after Petrov was killed, they saw a pretty
blonde woman outside the house.

71
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,960
Do you have a clue who that could be?

72
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,400
I don't have the faintest idea.

73
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,780
Are you going to be okay?

74
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,740
You must be hiding the fact that you're meeting
with me from your higher-ups.

75
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,990
Are you okay betraying the police like that?

76
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,750
I'm not hiding anything.

77
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
This is part of my investigatory discretion.

78
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,460
After I'm done investigating, I'll give
a full report to my superiors.

79
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,130
If I search hard enough, I'm sure
I can prove your innocence.

80
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,890
What's wrong?

81
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,640
Don't look now, but to your left...

82
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,940
there's a man under a parasol reading a newspaper.

83
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,480
He seems suspicious.

84
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,570
The secret police?

85
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,950
Who knows?

86
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,410
Well then. Shall we go?

87
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,370
Go where?

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,420
Did you bring it? The key I gave
you to the bank safe deposit box.

89
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,380
Yes.

90
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,050
Do you want to know the true nature of a monster?

91
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,430
Yes.

92
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,260
Then let's go do it.

93
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,930
Although we might be better off never knowing...

94
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,060
Haha! You look pale.

95
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,250
That woman is close.

96
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,370
What's wrong?

97
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,920
Nothing.

98
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,510
It must have been my imagination.

99
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,930
Suk is on the move.

100
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,180
I'll follow him.

101
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,460
I called you earlier. I'm Suk from the Prague police.

102
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,590
Please wait a moment.

103
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
It's right here. Please go in.

104
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
Here are the safe deposit boxes.

105
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,160
You can verify the contents in the room over there.

106
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,710
A data report and a cassette tape.

107
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,710
I have a tape recorder.

108
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,430
Are you ready? I'm going to play it.

109
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,610
Where is this?

110
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,690
511 Kinderheim.

111
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,070
A child's voice...

112
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,530
What is your name?

113
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,870
My name is Johan.

114
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,520
My name is Johan.

115
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,860
What is your last name?

116
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,400
I'll ask you again.

117
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,360
What is your last name?

118
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,410
My name is Otto.

119
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,910
My name is Hans.

120
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,000
My name is Thomas.

121
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,420
My name is...

122
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,630
Which one is your real name?

123
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,010
A long, long time ago.

124
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,430
In a land far away, there was a monster without a name.

125
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:25,150
The monster wanted a name so badly.

126
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,230
Is that some kind of story?

127
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,940
I was waiting for Anna.

128
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,530
Who is Anna?

129
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,490
I was waiting for Anna... while I
was reading that picture book.

130
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,660
This boy is being questioned under the influence of drugs.

131
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,710
Where is your father?

132
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,330
I don't know.

133
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,130
Your mother?

134
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,750
I think she's alive.

135
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,970
You are quite an exceptional boy.

136
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,050
Are you afraid of anything?

137
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,760
What is the thing that frightens you the most?

138
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,190
I'll ask a different question.

139
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,770
Have you ever killed a person?

140
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,610
Huh?

141
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,400
Many people died.

142
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,870
So many that it seemed like Anna and I
were the only two people in the world.

143
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,660
Where was that?

144
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,210
I'll go back to the other question.

145
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
What is the thing that frightens you the most?

146
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,170
The monster inside of me is getting larger.

147
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,970
"Crunch Crunch! Munch Munch! Chomp Chomp! Gulp!"

148
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,520
"Crunch Crunch! Munch Munch! Chomp Chomp! Gulp!"

149
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,270
"Crunch Crunch! Munch Munch! Chomp Chomp! Gulp!"

150
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,730
That is the thing that frightens me the most.

151
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,360
That is it.

152
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,750
I feel sick.

153
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,790
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

154
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,880
Are you okay, Mr. Grimmer?

155
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,630
Yeah.

156
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,840
What is on this tape?

157
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,640
Is this "a monster's true nature?"

158
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,970
I don't understand it.

159
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,640
Even if we don't know what it means...

160
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,900
there are plenty of people who want to get a hold of it.

161
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,070
The former Czechoslovakian secret police...

162
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,160
It's the same if you listen to just the beginning
or if you listen all the way through.

163
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,870
You can't go back.

164
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,960
What are you going to do with that tape and report?

165
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,430
No.

166
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,810
Naturally, it'd be better to store the evidence here, but...

167
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,470
but you're going to hold on to it?

168
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,350
Then let's leave separately.

169
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,110
I'm the one they're probably marking.

170
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,490
Give me your cellphone number and your address.

171
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,490
If we both make it out safe, we can
get in contact with each other.

172
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,160
I made it home safe.

173
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,180
What a bad feeling.

174
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,810
He doesn't seem very reliable.

175
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,480
So? A flat on Lanover St, huh?

176
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,030
What's the meaning of this?

177
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,660
We're the ones asking the questions here.

178
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,790
You know about us, don't you?

179
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,040
You're from that special senior team that
was sent from the central office.

180
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,550
This is Detective Third Rank Novak,
and I am Detective Third Rank Zander.

181
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,720
Why are you in my apartment?

182
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,050
How long have you been meeting with Grimmer?

183
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,140
Don't tell us you haven't been.

184
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,600
You met him at the cafe in the Republic Square
then headed toward the Prochazka Bank.

185
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,940
Do you know the man in this photo?

186
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,190
Captain Karl Ranke.

187
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,070
He's a big-shot in the former Czechoslovakian
secret police who's gone underground.

188
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,120
I-I don't know that man.

189
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,080
We looked into your bank account.

190
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,620
There was a large deposit this month. What was it for?

191
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,370
Huh?

192
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,130
What are you talking about?

193
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,800
I don't know anything about that money.

194
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,840
Your mother is currently seriously ill at the
Krumlov National Hospital, isn't she?

195
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,980
It must take a lot of money to pay
for a hospitalization like that.

196
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,230
What are you trying to say?

197
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,280
After your mother divorced your
father, she raised you by herself.

198
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,950
You also think very well of your mother.

199
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,030
What are you trying to say?!

200
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,910
We'd like to search your apartment.

201
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,250
Do what you want.

202
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,630
I don't have anything to hide!

203
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,760
Do what you want.

204
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,960
Zander, come here.

205
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,430
What are these?

206
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,190
They were in your washstand.

207
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,820
I've never seen these things before.

208
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,980
They're not mine.

209
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,570
We can't tell if there's a drug in it until we test it.

210
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,910
The muscle relaxant found in the dead bodies...

211
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,750
was inside whiskey bon-bons.

212
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,750
Let's go to the station for a little talk.

213
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,220
That's fine. Investigate as thoroughly as you like.

214
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,020
That's fine.

215
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,730
Excuse me, but could I change my shirt before we go?

216
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,730
That's fine.

217
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,030
Calm down. Calm down.

218
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,870
I didn't do anything wrong.

219
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,240
If I explain it to them, they'll understand.

220
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,890
Do I smell gun powder?

221
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,760
Suk!

222
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:43,010
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

223
00:22:44,100 --> 00:23:00,410
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

224
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,490
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

225
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:33,970
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>
