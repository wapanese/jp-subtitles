1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,700
I got divorced three years ago.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,580
No, it's more like my wife ran away from me.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,420
I wish I'd paid more attention to her.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,340
She left me because I paid more attention to this thing.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,680
This is what she said to me:

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,060
"You're just a collector who peeks into people's hearts."

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,140
Doctor.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,650
You've got problems.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,320
You might be right.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:43,260
My talent for fishing around in the abyss of
people's hearts also carries a high risk
of sinking into that abyss myself.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,580
Your fourth victim was an 18-year-old girl...

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,920
Do you remember the sexual arousal
you felt when you chopped her up?

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,050
Doctor.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,300
Ask me about the twelfth murder.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,390
Hanna Kempf of Krupp-Haus.

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,230
Fifty-two years old.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,410
When I did that, I...

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,940
No, you don't have to tell
me about that incident.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm sure I'll want to ask
about it sometime in the future,

20
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,150
but for now, I'd like to ask
about the first eleven incidents,

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,660
okay?

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,910
Tell me, is the peak of your sexual arousal
usually before or after you kill someone?

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,790
As you can see there, his victims are limited to
missing school girls from the ages of 16 to 18.

24
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,360
Monster's Abyss

25
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,220
His crimes should obviously be
classified as sexual murders.

26
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
He confessed to a twelfth murder, though.

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,730
The victim of this murder was a 52-year-old
woman named Kempf, and on top of
that, there was no evidence of sex.

28
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:25,130
He claims that he did this at the request of
a friend,  and our investigation is in a
state of confusion due to his claim.

29
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,790
Huh?

30
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,820
Who is it?

31
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,460
Who's there?

32
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,870
It's me, Rudy.

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,680
Tenma!

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,220
You surprised me.

35
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,350
Sorry, this was the only way I could reach you.

36
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,440
You know why.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,310
Yes, I've heard.

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,980
Do you think I'm a serial killer?

39
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,150
I don't know.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,080
I've just heard rumors in the papers, on the
news, and from old college colleagues.

41
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,960
What did you come here to ask me?

42
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,150
It's not that we're good friends, especially since...

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,380
you've had nothing but contempt for me.

44
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,680
That's what I feel when I look into your eyes.

45
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,510
I feel that you despised me.

46
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,850
Oh, I see.

47
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,520
You want me to give back that money I borrowed.

48
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,020
Is it money?

49
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,500
No, it's not that.

50
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,690
I've heard that you're one of
the top criminal psychologists.

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,490
I have something I want you to take a look at.

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,200
"Look at me! Look at me!"

53
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,960
"The monster inside me has
grown so big, Doctor Tenma!"

54
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,020
"Help me! The monster inside me is about to explode!"

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,630
What is this?

56
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,470
I see.

57
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,680
This Johan is the real killer of the director.

58
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,270
He killed the foster parents that took care of him, left
you those messages, and once again disappeared.

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,780
I have to find him as soon as possible.

60
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,550
And with that, prove your
innocence as soon as possible.

61
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,790
Twenty years ago, there was a kid at a famous
medical school who didn't rest until
he became the top of his class.

62
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,590
When a Japanese student came to that school,
his situation changed completely.

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,100
He was sociable and popular with everyone.

64
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,220
On top of that, his grades were excellent.

65
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,480
The student who was at the top of the class
was displaced during the midterm exam.

66
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,230
He worked his hardest for the finals so that
he could become the top student again.

67
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,700
He had done perfectly in
all of his classes until then,

68
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,490
but the last test was his worst subject:
Introduction to Medical Law.

69
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,830
If he did poorly on that test, all his hard
work would have been for nothing.

70
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,960
That man played his last card.

71
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,080
It was the only way he could get the high score.

72
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,760
However...

73
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,150
However, the Japanese man didn't tell anyone.

74
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,830
The result was that the man took back
his position as the top student.

75
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,200
So do you have any ideas
about those two messages?

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,400
Is your theory that of multiple personalities?

77
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,410
You're trying to say that one personality is a
murderer, and the other personality
is trying to stop those murders.

78
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,890
There are, of course, examples of serial killers
leaving messages like this behind,

79
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,640
but there's also the possibility that they're using
this to escape from being guilty of their actions.

80
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,730
Seeing through that is where we
psychoanalysts show our skill.

81
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,910
Many people think that all serial killers are
introverts, but they are sadly mistaken.

82
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Some of them are intelligent,
sociable, and very persuasive.

83
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,150
They're all big fat liars.

84
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,460
Are you saying that he's just playing with me?

85
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,340
Hold on. You shouldn't rush to conclusions.

86
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,130
Will you tell me more about Johan, first?

87
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,180
The truth is that I got divorced three years ago.

88
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,890
No, it's more like my wife ran away from me.

89
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,980
Thank you, Rudy.

90
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,360
That was a fascinating conversation, Tenma.

91
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,070
I'd really like to research this in further detail.

92
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,320
Get in touch with me in a week.

93
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,620
What do you think of him?

94
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,580
I understand him.

95
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,330
Oh? In what way?

96
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,290
The monster he was talking about...

97
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,420
I see.

98
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,360
So there's a monster.

99
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,640
Of course, they exist... inside of you,
inside of him, even inside of me!

100
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,800
Stop it.

101
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,060
Stop your academic nonsense.

102
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,110
What do you mean?

103
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,650
I'm saying that monsters really exist in this world.

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,360
What's with your eyes?

105
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,910
Don't look at me with those eyes!

106
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,300
I hate being looked down on.

107
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,170
What are you doing?

108
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,340
We're done here.

109
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,390
Are you scared?

110
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,390
Are you scared? Huh?!

111
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,620
There are much more frightening things in this world.

112
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,730
I'll let you know something good.

113
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

114
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,110
So he's definitely going to see you again?

115
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,910
He will.

116
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,330
When he does, I'll contact you at once.

117
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,870
However...

118
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,460
However...?

119
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,380
After you arrest him, I'd like you
to let me use him for research.

120
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,630
He's a fascinating criminal,

121
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,010
that Dr. Tenma.

122
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,100
I'll let you know something good.

123
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,900
Go to the Kempf Mansion,

124
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,900
to the basement storage room.

125
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,740
You'll understand when you get there.

126
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,170
The proof that monsters exist is there.

127
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,910
Hello?

128
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,490
Hey, Tenma.

129
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,540
I'd love to see you.

130
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,120
Got it.

131
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,250
I'll be waiting!

132
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,710
Inspector Kohl.

133
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,920
I've gotten in touch with Tenma.

134
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,680
8:00 P.M. in Oder Park, in front of the fountain.

135
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,760
Goodbye.

136
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,230
I'm currently following the route of entry
that Jurgens used to commit his crime.

137
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,650
According to his confession, he snuck in through
this storage room and spent a few hours here.

138
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,370
When she came home, he snuck up to the
second-floor bedroom and killed her.

139
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,800
There's nothing unusual here... just pictures.

140
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,170
A lot of them.

141
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,550
They have Mrs. Kempf in them.

142
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,150
A doll.

143
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,570
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

144
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,610
There's no proof that there's a monster
like Jurgens said there was.

145
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,080
It seems that Jurgens committed this murder
to throw the investigators off his trail.

146
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,580
He claimed that he killed at
the request of his friend.

147
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,130
He called that friend a "monster."

148
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,360
When I was a kid, my mother
would always punish me.

149
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,320
There was a large doll that
she loved very much.

150
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,240
It was a female doll with long hair.

151
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,870
When I was beaten, I pleaded
with the doll to help me,

152
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,700
but it would only look at me and grin.

153
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,550
There were just a lot of
photos in that storage room.

154
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,600
No matter where I looked, it was just
my mother, my mother, my mother...

155
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,560
always watching over me.

156
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,400
What does this mean?

157
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,520
Is it that?

158
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:30,220
Is it that Jurgens changed this storage room
to look like the room from his childhood?

159
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,240
This is Jurgens as a child.

160
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,220
This can't be. He couldn't have
known Mrs. Kempf as a child.

161
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,090
What's with this photo?

162
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,150
Jurgens' face as a child was put on top.

163
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,370
This one, too. This... this too!

164
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,740
And this one, too!

165
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,710
Mrs. Kempf was not supposed to have had any children.

166
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,920
Then this boy is...

167
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,000
Who are you?

168
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,840
The proof that monsters exist is there.

169
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,310
I just did everything exactly as the
letters from my friend told me.

170
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,350
Your friend?

171
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,290
One day, I got a letter in a
blank envelope with no address.

172
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,900
He knew about me.

173
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,740
He wrote to me in an overly familiar
way, and at first I was angry.

174
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,040
After that, I got a letter every week.

175
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,160
He was a letter demon.

176
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,080
But then the letters didn't come as quickly.

177
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,550
Gradually, I started enjoying receiving them.

178
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,170
Those letters were fun.

179
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,550
I thought that he might really be my friend.

180
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,560
Then one day, he called me with that letter.

181
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,980
"Go look at the basement in that mansion..."

182
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,910
The storage room in the basement
of Mrs. Kempf's mansion...?

183
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,990
How did he know?

184
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,700
How did he know about my childhood?

185
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,830
I was totally confused, there
in the basement storage room.

186
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,080
What's going on?

187
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,130
Is Mrs. Kempf my mother?

188
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,240
When I came to my senses, I went up
to the second floor and killed her.

189
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,470
He was a letter demon.

190
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,940
Did that "friend" send letters to Mrs. Kempf, too?

191
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,530
This one...

192
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,040
This one...

193
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,000
This one...

194
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,580
And this one!

195
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,500
"Look at me! Look at me!"

196
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,010
"The monster inside me has grown so big!"

197
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,640
"Help! The monster inside me
is about to explode!"

198
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,930
These are the messages that Johan left me.

199
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,850
They're the same.

200
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,820
The friend and Johan are real...?

201
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,810
He's still not here?

202
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,120
It's past eight o'clock.

203
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,880
Inspector Kohl, look there.

204
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,090
He's here.

205
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,010
He's an Asian man with long hair.

206
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm sorry for bothering you
at such a busy time, Rudy.

207
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,690
I analyzed what you'd said.

208
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,150
I thought you made it up.

209
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,450
"Johan doesn't exist."

210
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,210
"He's just something you made up."

211
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,710
Hear me out, Rudy. I...

212
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,870
I'm currently researching a
serial killer named Jurgens.

213
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,460
There's only one incident where the modus
operandi is different from the others.

214
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,230
No, listen to what I have to say.

215
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,200
That's all for today. Come again!

216
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,060
The carnival is over.

217
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,690
Tell all the groups, "When I give the
signal, move in and capture him."

218
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,440
Sir.

219
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,900
Don't forget to listen to their conversation.

220
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,940
Tenma, you looked down on me, didn't you?

221
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,070
Ever since you saw me cheating, you've
always looked down on me.

222
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,420
Didn't you?

223
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,330
Inspector Kohl.

224
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,620
This is bad.

225
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,290
Tenma and the doctor are
walking towards the west exit.

226
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,210
They'll get lost in the crowd leaving the carnival.

227
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,590
I deserve all the scorn you can give me.

228
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,400
Rudy, more importantly, right now...

229
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,010
Do you remember?

230
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,930
I used that hidden paper to cheat on the exam.

231
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,910
Just like this.

232
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,650
"Run! You're surrounded by the police!"

233
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,400
Don't look, just walk.

234
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320
Is the doctor being threatened?

235
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,160
The crowd is too loud. I can't hear anything.

236
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,960
Jurgens said that he killed
at the request of his friend.

237
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,880
This is...

238
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,170
This was in Mrs. Kempf's storage room.

239
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,930
Mrs. Kempf didn't have any children.

240
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,850
The Johan you spoke of and Jurgens'
friend are probably one in the same.

241
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,070
They're outside the west gate.
Should we stop them?

242
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,360
Wait! Tenma might have a gun!

243
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,240
Mrs. Kempf had letters that had the same
messages as the letters he left you.

244
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,660
Johan was feeding off of her, and when
her use had run out, he disposed of her.

245
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,580
It might have been to eliminate his past, just as you said.

246
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,010
You're innocent.

247
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,220
Maybe I can't tell you anything more than that,
but from what I've analyzed, I can tell you this:

248
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,140
I don't know how, but
Johan can sniff out the killers.

249
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,860
On top of that, he can
isolate them and control them.

250
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,530
I can't find the case where Johan had killed
his foster parents after adolescence.

251
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,830
It's probably because he thought that foster
parents weren't necessary anymore.

252
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,500
I can think of something else.

253
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,250
Johan found his ideal family and joined it.

254
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,050
Why is he trying to erase his past, though?

255
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,590
Does he have some reason for doing that?

256
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,890
Is he joining his family for some reason?

257
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,020
If so, for what reason?

258
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,010
Now, we've made it to the bus terminal.

259
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,740
Get ready. Find out which bus he gets on.

260
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,740
Surround the terminal with the squad cars.

261
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,200
Get ready for pursuit!

262
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,820
Yes, sir.

263
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,240
I've already got you a ticket.

264
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,790
Tenma...

265
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,860
There are still ways to
prove that you're innocent.

266
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,460
I'll help you.

267
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,470
I'm not chasing after Johan to clear my name.

268
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,930
Thank you, Rudy.

269
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,220
Tenma, don't tell me...

270
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,350
You're going to... to Johan...

271
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,730
Oh, yes. I never looked down on you.

272
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,230
It's true.

273
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,980
You looked like an interesting fellow,
but I never had a chance to meet you.

274
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,240
But now we're finally friends, aren't we?

275
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,620
You saw me cheat, though.

276
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,580
You lifted your head and looked my way.

277
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,460
I was cheating, too.

278
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,110
What did you say?

279
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,130
Five buses left at the same time?

280
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,140
Tenma...

281
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,550
Journey to Freiham
