2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,000
You haven't had a drink since then, have you?

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,540
I haven't. Not one since then.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,380
Good. As long as you stay away from
alcohol, you can get a fresh start.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,620
As long as I keep meeting with you once
a week, I won't be able to drink.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm afraid of your thunder.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,640
Thunder? What do you mean by that?

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,770
This is counseling.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,480
I don't even have time to drink.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm working on my first important
case since becoming a detective.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,900
First case?

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,190
Doctor, what do you make of this man?

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,880
What do you mean?

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:46,910
[Note: <i>Physiognomy</i> is the prediction of a person's
characteristics based on his facial features.]

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,610
With your famous physiognomy,
tell me what kind of person he is.

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,910
Physiognomy?

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,620
Richard, are you confusing me
for a fortune teller?

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,590
Well, it's widely known that you can determine
a person's personality with a glance.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,090
You can tell what type of personality
people have just by looking at them.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,640
That's because of my many years of
experience talking to my clients.

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,140
So with that experience, can you
tell me if he's a crook or not?

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,110
A crook?

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,270
He couldn't be. He doesn't have
the face of a swindler.

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,030
He's the type of guy who would break down
if he ever got someone to go for his scam.

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,120
So he could commit suicide?

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,370
He wouldn't do that.

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,120
He would not consider suicide.

28
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,880
Spoken so firmly... I feel the great persuasive
power of your mental abilities.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,000
It's all from experience.

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,960
So what about that man?

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,340
He's Hans George Schubert.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,720
Schubert?

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,640
You know of him, Doctor?

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,860
Yes, he's rich.

35
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,880
The Vampire of Bayern.

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,230
He's the one who hired me.

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:01,210
The man in the photo, Edmund
Fahren, called himself his son.

38
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,200
And he figured out it was a
scam right away, didn't he?

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,780
No, Mr. Schubert completely believed him.

40
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,250
It was quite a clever trick.

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,000
It took me a lot of work to determine
whether or not he was a fake,

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,920
but there's still one mystery left...

43
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,260
How did he know so much about Schubert's son
that he could make Schubert believe him?

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,290
Shouldn't you ask Edmund himself?

45
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,230
I can't. He recently committed suicide.

46
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,390
The Secret Woods

47
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,550
Come on, Martin.

48
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,320
You're an old friend.

49
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,730
Just show me Edmund Fahren's last note.

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,060
We've checked the handwriting.

51
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,570
There's no doubt that he wrote the letter.

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,060
There's no need to show it to
an outsider like you.

53
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,800
The two witnesses,
Karl Neuman and Lotte Frank.

54
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,370
They were Fahren's co-workers,
weren't they?

55
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,910
They were just friends.

56
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,140
"Just friends," you say...

57
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,040
How are you doing?

58
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,580
Same as always?

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Yes, we don't have enough men.

60
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,120
I haven't had any rest ever
since I took your place.

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,310
You've gotten pretty arrogant,
Martin the Blockhead.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I've asked you to stop calling me that.

63
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,100
You're not my boss, and I'm not
your subordinate anymore.

64
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,480
Hey now, Martin.

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,440
You don't understand the trouble
we went through that time.

66
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,610
We spent all that time tracking down that serial killer.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,450
And then you shot him in a drunken stupor.

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,390
You don't know the trouble we had after that.

69
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,980
Could I ask you to leave now?

70
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,730
We don't have time to deal
with a simple suicide.

71
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
I'd like to see the scene of the crime.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,910
You've got the scene under control,
don't you?

73
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,100
Not really. It wasn't a crime.

74
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,020
I've already given them permission to move out.

75
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,040
They're probably moving his
belongings out this very day.

76
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,540
Geez!

77
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,050
When did Martin the Blockhead get so pushy?

78
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,220
I made it.

79
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,790
There's going to be a trader coming
to pick up his belongings soon.

80
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm just going to have a look.

81
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,030
So he hung the rope from this pipe.

82
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,740
He wrote his last words at this desk.

83
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,450
So he was writing an essay...

84
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
"The Birth of Tragedy."

85
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,540
"Assumptions and Reality."

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,500
"Psychology of the World."

87
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,590
It looks like he was a philosophy student.

88
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,800
This must be what he was writing about.

89
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,100
This is "History of the Gaelic War."

90
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,870
Why is there one unrelated book here?

91
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,630
Spanish...? No... Latin?

92
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,770
I can't read it at all.

93
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,070
Huh?

94
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,780
It's as good as new and looks unused,
but only this part is underlined...

95
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,740
Room 204.

96
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,390
Hey, go get some more boxes.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay.

98
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,810
Let's put the books in the boxes first.

99
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,810
Understood.

100
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,080
Keep up the good work.

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,130
What should we do with this?

102
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
Put it over there.

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,760
Okay.

104
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,470
Hello?

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,980
Can I ask you about the person next door?

106
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,520
I told them everything I know.

107
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,940
I'm not a cop. I'm a detective.

108
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,420
I don't care. It's still annoying either way.

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,260
I have a report to give tomorrow, but thanks to
the ruckus next door, I can't concentrate at all.

110
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,160
I understand. Let me ask just one thing.

111
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,170
Were these people close to Fahren?

112
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,790
I don't know, but I've never
seen them around here.

113
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,960
It seems that he didn't have
very many friends.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,920
I see.

115
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm done here, aren't I?

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,680
No, wait!

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,140
Just one more thing.

118
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,100
What is it?

119
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,270
Could you translate this for me?
Where it's underlined...

120
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,730
You've got to be kidding me!

121
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,980
I want you to be responsible
for my bad grade.

122
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,160
Thanks for doing this.

123
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,400
Let's see...

124
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,160
"I can't...

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,530
go on...

126
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,490
pretending..."

127
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,370
What is that?

128
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,410
How should I know?
Isn't that enough for you?

129
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,750
"I can't...

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,210
go on...

131
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,710
pretending..."

132
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,800
I've heard that before somewhere.

133
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,230
Do you like it up here, too?

134
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,680
Hey, there. You're Johan, right?

135
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,330
Come up here.

136
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,000
There's a much better view
of the scenery from up here.

137
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,130
Okay.

138
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,010
Thank you.

139
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,310
It's a bit scary.

140
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,440
There's nothing to be afraid of.

141
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,570
Hey, stop that.

142
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,240
I said stop it.

143
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,330
I said stop it! It's dangerous.

144
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,210
Do you come here often?

145
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,040
Yeah.

146
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,730
Around this time, all the lights
in the houses come on.

147
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,510
Families return to their homes and
it smells like dinner everywhere.

148
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,680
It's what I've always wished for.

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,980
Wished for?

150
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,610
Yeah, I never had that when
I was a little boy.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,770
How is your family?

152
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,070
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,160
Did I say something to hurt your feelings?

154
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,120
The truth is, ever since I was a boy, I've
been adopted by foster parents.

155
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,000
If you wouldn't mind, can I ask you?

156
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,000
About your life...

157
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,430
What the hell? This is it.

158
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,510
"I can't go on pretending..."

159
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,180
They were Fahren's "last words."

160
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,150
They weren't his last words at all.

161
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,900
He was just translating that
passage of the book.

162
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,490
That's my life story.

163
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,160
It's a little morbid.

164
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,040
It's strange. I feel like I can tell you anything.

165
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,340
What you just said... your rich father...

166
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,820
Are you talking about Mr. Schubert?

167
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,690
Johan.

168
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,150
Are you...

169
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,860
crying for me?

170
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,520
We have to do something.

171
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:01,150
It's only natural that I, someone who takes
care of Mr. Schubert, am worried.

172
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,200
Ever since Fahren's suicide,
he hasn't been eating at all.

173
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,500
At this rate, he'll be the one to die.

174
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,210
Karl, why don't you tell him that
you're his real son?

175
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,590
I just wanted to see what
kind of person he was.

176
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,850
If I told him the truth,

177
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,850
he'd just think I was after his money.

178
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,020
That's the kind of person Mr. Schubert is.

179
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,940
Money is everything to him.

180
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,150
He doesn't understand how I feel.

181
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,340
But you have to do <i>something</i>.

182
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,140
Your father is suffering in the abyss of despair.

183
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,250
I see. That's how it is.

184
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,610
I have a good idea.

185
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,320
"I can't go on pretending."

186
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,930
The letter that Fahren left
behind wasn't a suicide note.

187
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,940
It was from this Latin book in his room.

188
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,270
He was just translating the underlined portion
from this book, "History of the Gaelic War."

189
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,110
It seems that this was not a suicide.

190
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,280
I don't have any proof.

191
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,200
This is just my opinion from working
on police matters for seven years.

192
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,830
Are you listening, Mr. Schubert?

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,710
You don't seem very energetic.

194
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,550
That's... enough...

195
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,760
Huh?

196
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,010
I said that's enough.

197
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,310
What are you saying? That's not good.

198
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,710
If it wasn't a suicide, the killer
might be after you as well.

199
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,320
He... He was my son.

200
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,780
Wait a second. I told you already.

201
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,520
His birthplace and personal history
don't have anything to do with you.

202
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,580
He was a fake!

203
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,630
It's true that he wasn't a bad person, and he's not the
kind of person who would try to bring you misery,

204
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,260
but he <i>did </i> try to trick you.

205
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,910
The master is tired.

206
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,390
Please let him be.

207
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm not going to stop investigating this case.

208
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,610
It's not just because I don't want to solve
my first case since changing occupations.

209
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,190
I feel something.

210
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,420
I feel that there's something more
malicious happening here.

211
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,070
In life...

212
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,830
In life...

213
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,160
there are some things you can
never make up for.

214
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,920
Do you understand?

215
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,010
I do.

216
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,740
I do, so very well.

217
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,970
The search will continue.

218
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,220
Got it?!

219
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,260
Over here.

220
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,490
A children's bill of rights?

221
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,540
Yes.

222
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,910
It's kind of like an international guarantee of base
norms for the protection of children's rights.

223
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,500
It's the theme I'm working on now.

224
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm volunteering to take care of
these children, too.

225
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,420
It doesn't have anything to do with that.
I'm just doing it because I like it.

226
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,630
Well, lets hear the rest of the story
that you were telling before...

227
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,930
about Schubert going bankrupt
three times in the past.

228
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,310
Yes, each of the three times, he
disappeared for a little while,

229
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,430
and when he reappeared,

230
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,100
he came back with plans to aggressively
start his business again.

231
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:10,070
I'd heard that kind of thing from him while I was
doing my part-time job reading to him on Fridays.

232
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,910
Did you hear about where he went
to when he disappeared?

233
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,010
Yes.

234
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,250
So it would be good if we took him there.

235
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,210
There are places that can make anyone better...

236
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,490
Like when you watch people's homes
from the school's rooftop.

237
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,790
Mr. Kunz,

238
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,560
it seems that one of the sinks in
the bathroom is clogged up.

239
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,560
Would you take a look at it?

240
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,770
It's that sink.

241
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,240
Lotte, what's wrong with it?

242
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,620
Hey, open up. Don't mess with me.

243
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,920
What is she thinking?

244
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,490
Hey, open up! Come on!

245
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,870
What are you going to do with the master?

246
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,310
His eyes are bad.

247
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,980
Open up!

248
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,140
This is kidnapping! It's kidnapping!

249
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,490
Okay. The plan worked perfectly!

250
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,990
All right! Let's go.

251
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,160
Where are you taking me?

252
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,320
A good place.

253
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,970
I know you aren't Margot Langer.

254
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,550
I just want information on the late Mr. Fahren.

255
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,300
He showed up here, didn't he?

256
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,050
Which one was Fahren?

257
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,480
Which one?

258
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,730
There were two pairs.

259
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,490
They both called themselves Schubert's son.

260
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,480
Was it the blonde one...

261
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,860
or was it the one with black hair?

262
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,150
Black hair?

263
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,650
The one with black hair came with a girl.

264
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,240
I can't believe he brought
a girl to a place like this.

265
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,080
He had black hair and was with a girl?

266
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,810
Were they these people?

267
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,810
Yes, that's them.

268
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,630
This young man...

269
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,170
claimed to be Schubert's son?

270
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,560
Is it really this place?

271
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm sure it is. Right around here.

272
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,100
Where have you brought me?

273
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
It's, well... Um...

274
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,600
It's the Obenberg Forest.

275
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,280
We wanted to... cheer you up.

276
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,250
Let me out.

277
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
Can you see the lake?

278
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,360
Yes.

279
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,100
Are the autumn colors of
the forest beautiful?

280
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,970
Yes, very much so.

281
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,200
What about the wrens?

282
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,800
I can't hear the calling of the wrens.

283
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm very sorry.

284
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,600
This is now a construction site.

285
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,880
Can't you hear them?

286
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,970
Listen very carefully.

287
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,430
They are crying so beautifully.

288
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,940
Many apples have fallen in the grove.

289
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,990
Give me your hand.

290
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,630
Please come over here.

291
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,130
What a sight!

292
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,760
The leaves catch the setting sun
and look as if they are on fire.

293
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,060
The lake is so still that
it looks like a mirror.

294
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,100
Can you see it?

295
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,020
Can you believe it?

296
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,820
Can you believe that such
a splendid sight exists?

297
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,290
I can see it.

298
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,130
I can see it!

299
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,940
Wait a second.

300
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,830
What did you just say?

301
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,110
You said there were two <i>pairs</i>.

302
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,410
The black-haired one brought a girl with him.

303
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,330
So Fahren didn't come alone?

304
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,410
The blonde one had someone with him, too.

305
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,520
Fahren didn't even talk that much.

306
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,640
The other young man talked in much more detail.

307
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,890
I don't know who he was...

308
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,110
But if he'd called himself Schubert's
son, I would have believed him.

309
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,320
Who...

310
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,570
was he?

311
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,470
Proof
