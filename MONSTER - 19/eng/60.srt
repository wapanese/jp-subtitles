1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,010
You can't sleep in a place like this!

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,620
I'm fine, I'm fine.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,260
Leave me here.

4
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,120
You left her there.

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,850
Am I right?

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,570
You left your mother there, didn't you?

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,290
The next morning, you were told...

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,320
that your mother froze to death.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,550
But at the time, you thought to yourself...

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,790
that it wasn't your fault.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,230
You only left her there because she asked you to.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,490
That's exactly right.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,650
It wasn't your fault.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,140
You only let those who wanted to die, die.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,010
You aren't wrong. You're right!

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,460
You set them free from the misery of living.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,830
Eva wants to die, too.

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Just then, the devil arrived.

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,420
I passed by making sure not to look at the devil.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,570
I can't look...

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,080
I must not look at him.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
I recited that to myself, like a child.

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,200
Eva wants to die, too.

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,390
<i>Please kill me!</i>

25
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,170
<i>Leave me here.</i>

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
Kenzo...

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,650
I...

28
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,100
won't be a part of the devil's plans.

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,800
Because nobody...

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
wants to die.

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,480
The Man Who Knew Too Much

32
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,690
Where's the woman?

33
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,210
Eva isn't here anymore.

34
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,220
Where did you send her?

35
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,670
I finished her off.

36
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,290
Don't lie, Martin.

37
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,090
You can still...

38
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,730
I'm not lying.

39
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,720
Pathetic.

40
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,690
What is?

41
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,760
Losing your life for a woman.

42
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,480
You're awake.

43
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,440
5 Minutes Ago

44
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,840
They're here.

45
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,530
Their car just stopped outside.

46
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,800
It's only a matter of time.

47
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,990
I stole a maid's uniform.

48
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,960
Put that on and escape through the back door.

49
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,460
What about you?

50
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,970
If we leave together...

51
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,210
it's like asking to be caught.

52
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,850
You'll be killed if you don't run!

53
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,040
If I'm by myself, I'll manage.

54
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,130
Go to the place written in the note on the desk.

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,470
It's Tenma's hotel.

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,680
Hurry up and change.

57
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,050
I'll be waiting for you at Frankfurt Central Station.

58
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,440
Let's run away together.

59
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,820
knock it off.

60
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,960
This isn't the time for jokes!

61
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,710
Listen!

62
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Going to Tenma's place is the only way you'll be safe...

63
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,720
and it's what you wanted!

64
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,450
That's an order!

65
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,660
Hurry up and go!

66
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,050
You have no right to give me orders.

67
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,930
It was a joke.

68
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm going.

69
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,550
Don't do anything reckless that'll get you killed.

70
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,270
I have no obligation to go that far for you.

71
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,950
Goodbye...

72
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,080
That's right.

73
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,990
I have no obligation...

74
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,760
I have no obligation to go that far for that woman.

75
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,010
One...

76
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,250
Two...

77
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,450
Three...

78
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,280
Four...

79
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,310
I'm surprised I lived through that.

80
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,930
Frankfurt Central Station, huh?

81
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,480
Out of bullets...

82
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,560
Guess I'm out of luck.

83
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,470
Idiot!

84
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,620
Aim for the head!

85
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,280
<i>In a suburb of Frankfurt...</i>

86
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,440
<i>four people died in a gunfight at</i>
<i>the Regen Motel in Sossenheim.</i>

87
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,530
<i>It is thought that the fight was an internal gang dispute.</i>

88
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:10,600
<i>The police are now questioning the people staying</i>
<i>at the motel, to get a better picture...</i>

89
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,170
Robby...

90
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,600
Did you hear that, Robby?

91
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,910
It's the story of my fight...

92
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,210
Robby...

93
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,770
We're here, Martin.

94
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,040
Are we at Frankfurt Station?

95
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,050
Hey, Doctor...

96
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,060
I've done all the emergency treatment I can...

97
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,170
but I can't do the rest here.

98
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,960
Let's go to a hospital.

99
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,500
Don't...

100
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,010
I already know...

101
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,960
it'd be useless...

102
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,390
Eva...

103
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,970
Where is Eva?

104
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,670
What happened to Eva?

105
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,830
She... didn't come here?

106
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,080
What are you laughing about, you idiot?

107
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,240
Just keep quiet!

108
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,430
I can't do that.

109
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,550
Listen to me, Dr. Tenma.

110
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,480
I don't know where to start.

111
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,500
I've learned... too many things...

112
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,280
The Red Rose Mansion experiment is still going...

113
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,490
Do you understand... what I'm saying?

114
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,360
And...

115
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,860
the devil got himself a disciple...

116
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,070
That man...

117
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,730
is trying to create a dictator...

118
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,090
That man?

119
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,270
The man with glasses...

120
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,470
The survivor from the Red Rose Mansion...

121
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,990
Peter... Čapek...

122
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,360
Peter... Čapek...

123
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,950
That man...

124
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,180
is trying to control the devil, but...

125
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,860
The devil is...

126
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,390
The devil is more terrifying...

127
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,780
More terrifying...

128
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,230
Hotel Jahreszeit...

129
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,730
Room 606...

130
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,640
That's where the devil's disciple is...

131
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,230
You must not... look at the devil...

132
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,770
You must not play a part in the devil's plans.

133
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,980
Nobody... wants to... die...

134
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,000
Martin!

135
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,470
I am... so fortunate...

136
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,400
I don't have to look at the devil anymore...

137
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,600
Eva...

138
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Eva is...

139
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,160
at Frankfurt Central Station...

140
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,740
I'm sure she bought two tickets for us...

141
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,450
so we could go as far as we can...

142
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,250
As far as we can...

143
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,430
Is Eva waiting for you?

144
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,770
Please protect Eva for me...

145
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,890
Protect Eva...

146
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,760
Don't die.

147
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,290
You have to go to the station, right?

148
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,210
Don't die.

149
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,990
You don't have to wait there, you know.

150
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,110
You've still got plenty of time before the first train comes.

151
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,920
Are you waiting for someone?

152
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,770
It's a guy, isn't it?

153
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,760
I can tell these things.

154
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,600
I've been working at the station for a long time.

155
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,850
Then, can you tell if someone will come or not?

156
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,710
I can't tell something like that.

157
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm not a fortune teller.

158
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,830
However, the fact that you have someone
to wait for is a happy thing.

159
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,250
Whether the person comes or not.

160
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,610
Happy?

161
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,600
That's right.

162
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,590
You don't get the chance for something
like that when you're my age.

163
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,570
Happiness, huh?

164
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,370
Oh, I guess the person you're waiting for is coming.

165
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,690
Kenzo...

166
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,810
Martin is...

167
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,800
dead.

168
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,480
Looks like he wasn't the one she was waiting for.

169
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,390
He came to my place to give me
some important information.

170
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,910
With the last of his strength...

171
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,390
Hurry up and run.

172
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,420
Eva.

173
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,570
There's still time before the first train comes.

174
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,200
Will you keep me company for a bit?

175
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,190
Sure.

176
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,840
You sure you don't want alcohol?

177
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,840
Martin...

178
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,670
He hated alcohol.

179
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,820
I see...

180
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,070
To Martin.

181
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,760
It's been a while.

182
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,560
Yeah.

183
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,390
Are you eating properly?

184
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,520
You look pretty worn out...

185
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,280
Yeah.

186
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,770
Strange, isn't it?

187
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,720
Here we are, holding a funeral for Martin.

188
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,120
He was a good person...

189
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,630
I did terrible things... to such a good person...

190
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,790
I made him wear the same suit and tie...

191
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,550
that I once gave you.

192
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,090
I'm the worst...

193
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,490
I'm the absolute worst...

194
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,200
Why am I still alive?

195
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,940
I even gave false testimony against you...

196
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,300
that made you out to be guilty of a crime.

197
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,180
So why am I still alive and well?

198
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,800
Because Martin protected you.

199
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,830
Why would he protect me?

200
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,560
Why would he protect a woman like me?

201
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,870
"Nobody wants to die."

202
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,760
That's what Martin said.

203
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,610
He said he was happy.

204
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,070
He said you were waiting for him at the station.

205
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,280
That alone made him happy.

206
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,030
Munich...

207
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,270
Go to Munich.

208
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,270
A friend of mine who's a psychological counselor is there.

209
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,750
Dr. Reichwein.

210
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,990
You know him?

211
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,450
Yes.

212
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,890
For now, ask Dr. Reichwein to hide you.

213
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,480
He'll treat you well.

214
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,560
Then go to the police.

215
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,000
Tell them that you're being targeted by
The Baby's organization in Frankfurt.

216
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,530
And how you're being targeted by Roberto.

217
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,330
Tell them everything.

218
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll tell them about you, too.

219
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,310
You didn't kill anyone.

220
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,640
Everything was Johan's fault!

221
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,920
I'll tell them everything!

222
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,620
So you should come to Munich, too!

223
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,340
He's right in front of me.

224
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,550
He's very close.

225
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,950
You saw him at the party, didn't you?

226
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,230
Johan is right in front of me.

227
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,230
I have to end this.

228
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,090
I can't...

229
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,260
lose any more people like Martin.

230
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,970
You understand, don't you?

231
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,030
I have to bring this to an end.

232
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,830
I'll write a letter to Dr. Reichwein.

233
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,250
I'll include all the information I know.

234
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,970
Kenzo...

235
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,670
Now, get going.

236
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,500
But Kenzo...

237
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,840
The only way you can help me...

238
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,720
is by going to Munich and telling them everything.

239
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,210
You did well to bring us and Johan together.

240
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,370
I thank you.

241
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,440
I heard rumors that someone like him was in Frankfurt...

242
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,990
so we asked you to help us identify him.

243
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,010
Pardon me for interrupting you during your meal.

244
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,610
You have a phone call.

245
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,740
Hello, it's me.

246
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,740
Johan?

247
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,630
I see.

248
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,530
Where?

249
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,760
An apartment on Haldecker Street?

250
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,690
An apartment on Haldecker Street...

251
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,450
Johan...

252
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,230
I can bring this to an end, too.

253
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,930
Hotel Jahreszeit...

254
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,680
Room 606...

255
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,330
That's where the devil's disciple is...

256
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,120
You're the one who wants a gun?

257
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
Yes.

258
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,450
There are many different types of guns.

259
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,280
I want the biggest one you can give me.

260
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,560
A beginner can't handle a big gun.

261
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,270
What are you trying to shoot?

262
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,930
A devil.

263
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

264
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

265
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

266
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

267
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,530
The Door to Memories
