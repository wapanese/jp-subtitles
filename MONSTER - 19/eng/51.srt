1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,440
Are you crying?

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,500
It's a letter from my friend.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,360
My best friend.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,310
When I was fifteen years old...

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,290
we tried to cross the Czech border together.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,980
She was caught and sent back to Prague.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,270
She said she's doing well.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,450
She knows me better than anyone in my family...

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,800
A true friend.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,280
Who knows what kind of censorship
this letter had to go through...

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,280
before she could send it to me?

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,150
<i>"If we ever get a chance to meet again..."</i>

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,430
<i>"please come to this place...."</i>

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,310
<i>"Cedok Bridge, the Three Frogs."</i>

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,700
I want to go back... to Prague...

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,030
Margot...

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,530
Hey...

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,410
Huh?

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,670
Please call me by my real name.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,690
Just for tonight, I'd like you to use my real name.

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,570
I am Helenka Novakowa.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,860
Just for tonight, I'm not Margot Langer.

23
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,530
The Monster's Love Letter

24
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,440
I sold my Reiser-Berger Pharmaceutical
stock in the nick of time.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,630
Then I bought some Kneuter Research stock...

26
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,910
and I hit the jackpot.

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,320
I just had to celebrate after that...

28
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,710
Did you drink?

29
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,190
Yes, a little bit.

30
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm appalled.

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,110
It was just one glass.

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,230
I've said this many times.

33
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,160
When you're an alcoholic...

34
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,750
it doesn't matter how much you drink, it's all the same.

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,150
And you've been ditching the alcohol
rehab group I recommended for you.

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,920
By the way...

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,920
Doc, can you keep this secret?

38
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,140
The thing is, there's a woman I want you to see.

39
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,660
Another one of your lovers?

40
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,900
Well...

41
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,170
She's a really bad alcoholic.

42
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,450
She's waiting right outside.

43
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,280
Could you take a quick look at her?

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,690
I can't do that without an appointment.

45
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,880
Have one set up for her.

46
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,040
A quick look would be fine.

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,250
I've got a house call to make.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,490
For a very important patient, at that.

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,480
I went to Prague, in the Czech Republic.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,990
It was beautiful.

51
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,680
Prague Castle.

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,740
The cathedrals, with their marvelous Gothic architecture.

53
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,420
The view of the old commercial district
at night was also stunning.

54
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,970
It was like I was in a fairyland.

55
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,410
And Cedok Bridge?

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,400
Did you go to Cedok Bridge?

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,110
Of course, just as you asked me to.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,710
And...

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,400
I found it! The Three Frogs!

60
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,420
Was the woman there?

61
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,970
No...

62
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,400
No one was there.

63
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,330
To be honest...

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,410
I didn't find anything by going there.

65
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,640
Tenma, Nina, and even Dieter...

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,920
I didn't find anything that indicates where they are.

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,430
Take this...

68
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,940
It's a rabbit's foot that brings good luck.

69
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,690
It's for our child you're carrying...

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,280
Margot... no, Helenka...

71
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,940
I...

72
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,530
Thank you.

73
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,730
Prague

74
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes?

75
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,440
Ah, excuse me...

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,960
I've come from Germany, and I'm
trying to find a missing woman.

77
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,720
Do you know her?

78
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,220
Margot Langer...

79
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,450
Ah, I mean Helenka Novakowa.

80
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,630
Helenka...

81
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,970
By the way, Mr. Schuwald...

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,960
Your son, karl, mentioned this to me...

83
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,490
You haven't been eating again, right?

84
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,240
I know that during the fire in the
University of Munich Library...

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,710
you experienced something truly terrifying.

86
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,490
And I understand that you haven't overcome that fear yet.

87
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,490
But you still have karl...

88
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,980
who is such a splendid son.

89
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,710
There's no need to worry anymore.

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,430
Just eat properly!

91
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,200
That monster...

92
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,410
As long as that monster exists, I will...

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,430
How did that monster know so
much about Margot Langer?

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,680
He knew more than my son did.

95
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,840
Margot had a friend in Prague who knew
her better than her own family did.

96
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,420
The woman she exchanged letters with.

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,080
Around 1980...

98
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,650
you went searching for the missing Margot...

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,230
and you met that woman in Prague.

100
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,270
Yes.

101
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,350
I thought she may have heard something from Margot.

102
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,260
However...

103
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,170
She hadn't heard anything.

104
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,770
We talked about Margot for a little while in her doorway.

105
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,020
At the time...

106
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,630
they were listening...

107
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,410
to our conversation.

108
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,890
Who?

109
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
They were quietly listening...

110
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,480
standing behind the woman.

111
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,620
They were twins...

112
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,420
Yes, come in.

113
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,630
Have a seat over here.

114
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,690
You were referred by Mr. Talbach.

115
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,440
You also have drinking problems.

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,650
Well, let's just have a casual conversation for now.

117
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,890
Doctor!

118
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,740
What's wrong, Mehres?

119
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm in the middle of a counseling session.

120
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,390
Just now, on TV...

121
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,400
Tenma! Dr. Tenma!

122
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,600
Excuse me for a minute!

123
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,670
<i>I repeat...</i>

124
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,740
<i>The Czech police have just announced...</i>

125
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,800
<i>the capture of the main suspect in the poisoning...</i>

126
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,400
<i>of three murdered doctors from Eisler Memorial</i>
<i>Hospital in Düsseldorf, Germany...</i>

127
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,610
<i>the murders of the journalist Mauler</i>
<i>and the Fortners in Heidelberg...</i>

128
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,400
<i>and the street murder at Heidelberg Castle.</i>

129
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,360
<i>The Japanese doctor, Kenzo Tenma,</i>
<i>who had been hiding in Prague....</i>

130
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,830
<i>was apprehended on the afternoon of the 5th.</i>

131
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,300
<i>We're still waiting for more information on his arrest....</i>

132
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,770
<i>the details will be released later...</i>

133
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,960
<i>- during the police press conference....</i>
- Tenma!

134
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,350
You can't come in here!
This is a private office...

135
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,100
so please wait in the other room, Ms. Eva Heinemann!

136
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,140
Kenzo...

137
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,830
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

138
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,840
Hess, you look ten years younger.

139
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,210
Maybe because I've been taking
care of my grandkids too much.

140
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,850
How've you been, Hubert?

141
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,210
I somehow made it to my senior year...

142
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,800
Mr. Kiefer, I heard you've been doing very well lately.

143
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,630
I've been bragging that I know a script writer
who's been invited to Hollywood.

144
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,950
I'm so honored...

145
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,850
Yes, I just happened to catch a producer's eye.

146
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,840
My mind's become very sharp...

147
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,960
and new ideas just keep pouring into my head.

148
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,540
That's great to hear.

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,070
Ever since that surgery...

150
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,230
If that brain surgery hadn't been successful...

151
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,610
right now, I'd be...

152
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,520
I wouldn't have been able to take walks
in the park with my grandchildren.

153
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,600
That seat...

154
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,590
He was always drinking tea by himself.

155
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,400
Though there were other cafés where doctors met...

156
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,120
he always came to this one, in the
back of Eisler Memorial Hospital.

157
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,720
When we the patients, would come here...

158
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,100
he would look up from over there...

159
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,470
and wave at us with a smile.

160
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,360
He was a kind doctor.

161
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,630
Yes.

162
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,300
There's no way a kind doctor like
him could do something like this

163
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,130
This is the reason I asked you to come today.

164
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,600
No, even the people who couldn't make it here
today must be feeling the same way...

165
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,120
if they were Dr. Tenma's former patients.

166
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,140
Dr. Schumann, we've got trouble!

167
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,590
Old man Merkel collapsed!

168
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,910
All right, I'll be right there.

169
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,830
I'm in the middle of something right now.

170
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,680
Sorry, but please wait a minute.

171
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,120
Okay.

172
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,760
Dr. Tenma wouldn't have done such a thing!

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,070
Calm down and listen, Mom.

174
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,090
Hurry, go to him, honey!

175
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,680
Yeah, but Petra...

176
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,740
There's no "but"!

177
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,610
Dr. Tenma's been arrested for crimes he didn't commit!

178
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,610
If not for him, I wouldn't be here right now.

179
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,380
Are you going to pretend nothing happened,
when your wife's savior is in big trouble?

180
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,370
What about the village?

181
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,850
What?

182
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,920
In this village, I'm the only doctor.

183
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,280
If I leave, what's going to happen
to the people in this village?

184
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,800
Don't make excuses!

185
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,110
You want to go, right?

186
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,280
Hurry and go save Tenma!

187
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,800
When a doctor has patients, he cannot leave them.

188
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,320
Dr. Tenma would do the same.

189
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,330
Doctor, please hurry and see me!

190
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm prepping right now, so wait there.

191
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,910
How long are you gonna make us wait?

192
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,430
Don't complain!

193
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,150
She's been going to medical school recently.

194
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,940
She still runs an unauthorized clinic for us at her own risk!

195
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,000
<i>If you stay in the darkness, you'll sink into the darkness...</i>

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,270
<i>Shine light upon it.</i>

197
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,450
<i>I'm sure, you can become a doctor.</i>

198
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,670
<i>I'm sure you'll be a good doctor.</i>

199
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,190
Dr. Tenma...

200
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,000
All right, let's begin.

201
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,500
First patient, please come in.

202
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,950
Get a lawyer.

203
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,500
Yes.

204
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,470
But we still don't know where in Germany
Tenma will be transferred.

205
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,020
Pick a lawyer for each state...

206
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,500
The best criminal lawyers out there.

207
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,890
Right.

208
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,500
Only that man...

209
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,190
I feel only that man can do it...

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,230
Only he can obliterate the monster.

211
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,280
For now, let's gather more people.

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,840
Let's call out to Dr. Tenma's former patients.

213
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,600
Alone, each of us may not have much
influence, but if we all pull together...

214
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,310
All right.

215
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,840
Let's ask Eisler Memorial for their cooperation...

216
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,150
and create a rescue association...

217
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,320
That's impossible.

218
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,530
Eisler Memorial won't help with that kind of thing.

219
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,550
I've been listening to you for a little while now.

220
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,810
What a tearjerker!

221
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,800
But think about it.

222
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,820
How are you guys going to prove Tenma's innocence?

223
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,290
Dr. Becker!

224
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,490
He had a motive, and no alibi at all.

225
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,810
I heard they also found material evidence.

226
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:17,800
Even if you get together and make a
fuss, or hire a competent lawyer...

227
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,420
it's impossible to prove Tenma's innocence either way.

228
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,690
It's unfortunate, but...

229
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,280
Such an eminent doctor...

230
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,650
It's unfortunate.

231
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,240
I'll ask you again, but...

232
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,790
what kind of relationship do you have with Tenma?

233
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,410
Ms. Eva Heinemann.

234
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,280
I don't know who you are, but...

235
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,510
I'm going to rescue Tenma.

236
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,300
If you're tagging along out of curiosity,
I'd prefer you didn't come.

237
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,920
Eva...

238
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,780
Heinemann...

239
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,490
Heinemann?!

240
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,200
Heinemann...

241
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,500
Could if be that you're...

242
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,600
related to Director Heinemann, who was
murdered at Eisler Memorial Hospital?

243
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,240
Dr. Tenma...

244
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,240
is the man who ruined my life.

245
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,520
But you know...

246
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,190
I'm the only one who can save him.

247
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,710
I saw.

248
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,460
Saw what?

249
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,720
St. Jaromir Hospital

250
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,620
<i>Kenzo Tenma, who has been taken</i>
<i>into custody in Prague...</i>

251
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,700
<i>will be deported to Germany within</i>
<i>the next couple of days to stand trial.</i>

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,400
<i>He will be transferred to Düsseldorff</i>
<i>where the string of murders began.</i>

253
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,910
<i>After an interrogation...</i>

254
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,440
<i>the police are going to inspect</i>
<i>the crime scene with Dr. Tenma.</i>

255
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
No way!

256
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,870
It can't be!

257
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,190
That man...

258
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,800
That doctor...

259
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,370
This is Dr. Tenma.

260
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,050
<i>Suk, he's the man who saved your life.</i>

261
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,480
<i>It's because of his emergency treatment that you're alive.</i>

262
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,680
<i>Dr. Tenma is also being accused</i>
<i>or crimes he did not commit.</i>

263
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,520
<i>He's in the same situation as you.</i>

264
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,390
The man who saved my life.

265
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,750
And he's also in the same situation as me...

266
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,990
<i>You're a detective, aren't you?</i>

267
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,370
<i>If you're a detective....</i>

268
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,520
<i>then you have to calmly dissect the situation.</i>

269
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,260
<i>If you don't want to be betrayed anymore...</i>

270
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,290
<i>then start doubting the person</i>
<i>you want to doubt the least</i>

271
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,830
I have to go...

272
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,240
Somehow, I have to get to Prague Station...

273
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,130
and talk with Dr. Tenma.

274
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,080
We've been looking for you, Suk.

275
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,390
Detective Blazek...

276
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,520
Detective Stransky...

277
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,440
I...

278
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,110
You don't have to run anymore.

279
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,510
Huh?

280
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,610
We've put you through quite a bit of trouble.

281
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,600
You've been cleared of all charges.

282
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,120
A letter was delivered to the station.

283
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,100
This is a copy.

284
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,130
A letter?

285
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,280
It's a confession with the kinds of details...

286
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,120
regarding the whole case that
only the killer would know.

287
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,160
All the charges against you have been dropped.

288
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,830
Who sent the letter?

289
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,480
Someone by the name of Grimmer.

290
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,170
What did you say?

291
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,830
We've already put a warrant out for
Grimmer as the prime suspect.

292
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,800
W-Wait a minute!

293
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,590
It's okay now, Suk.

294
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,970
Detective Zeman's murder, the
commissioner's poisoning...

295
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,210
and the special task force murders...

296
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,190
have now all been resolved.

297
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,420
<i>Where have you been, Lunge?!</i>

298
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,550
<i>I've been calling your number all day!</i>

299
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,190
Sorry, Chief.

300
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,560
I went out sightseeing for a bit.

301
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,030
<i>Geez! Stop playing dumb!</i>

302
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,800
Playing dumb?

303
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
What are you talking about?

304
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,520
<i>Knock it off already!</i>

305
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,650
<i>I bet you've heard the news!</i>

306
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,360
Yes...

307
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,410
About Dr. Tenma's arrest, right?

308
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,660
<i>Congratulations, Lunge.</i>

309
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,470
Huh?

310
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,110
<i>You knew, right?</i>

311
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,170
<i>That Tenma was hiding out in Prague.</i>

312
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,970
<i>Good job Lunge.</i>

313
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,770
<i>This is the result of your thorough investigation.</i>

314
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:33,460
<i>We contacted the Czech police immediately and</i>
<i>completed the deportation arrangements.</i>

315
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,330
<i>Tenma will be transferred to Düsseldorf</i>
<i>tomorrow afternoon.</i>

316
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,160
<i>Since you're in charge of this case...</i>

317
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,440
<i>I want you to personally supervise his transfer.</i>

318
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,040
<i>Anyway, you did a good job, Lunge.</i>

319
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,470
<i>Congratulations.</i>

320
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,970
Can you assign it to someone else?

321
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,160
<i>Huh?</i>

322
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,010
Prague is a nice place.

323
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,330
<i>What?</i>

324
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,060
Besides, right now...

325
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm still on vacation.

326
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,680
<i>Hey, Lunge!</i>

327
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>What are you saying?!</i>

328
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,530
<i>Hey!</i>

329
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,160
Please let me see Dr. Tenma!

330
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,090
I've been telling you, you can't see him

331
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,450
Why not?

332
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,580
Didn't this country become a democracy

333
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,560
Tenma is about to be deported back to Germany.

334
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,240
Before that happens, even if only for a little!

335
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,430
Looks like we wasted our time.

336
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,000
Even though we came all the way to Prague...

337
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,840
Please!

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,320
Even just a quick look!

339
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,800
Come out.

340
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,520
This way, come on.

341
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,090
When we interrogate someone...

342
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,490
what kind of person do you think
is the toughest to crack?

343
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,510
Someone whose expression never changes.
regardless of the question.

344
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,180
Someone who doesn't say a word.

345
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,480
That kind of person.

346
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,800
A love letter from a monster to a beauty.

347
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,610
It's like the draft for a novel.

348
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,570
<i>"I've been watching you all this time."</i>

349
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,000
<i>"To eat up every bit of you."</i>

350
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,920
<i>"But instead, everything about you has devoured me."</i>

351
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,010
<i>"I wonder what I look like to you,</i>
<i>who is collapsing into ruin."</i>

352
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,650
<i>"That which you left me, which is collapsing into ruin."</i>

353
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,120
<i>"You left me with such beautiful jewels."</i>

354
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,420
<i>"The twins, who are like eternal life itself."</i>

355
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>"The greatest sin..."</i>

356
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,590
<i>"is to take away a person's name."</i>

357
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,630
<i>"Reclaim your name."</i>

358
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,350
<i>"I return your name to you."</i>
