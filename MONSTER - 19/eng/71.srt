1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,710
I don't like doing this to such old folks,
but you're very important witnesses.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,510
I'd be in trouble if you died or ran off.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,270
I've barricaded the back door and
the windows with furniture.

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,690
But if they really wanted to, it wouldn't
be too hard for them to break through.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,860
It's better than nothing.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,400
Let's go down to the first floor.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,530
You know how to fire a gun, don't you?

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,160
Yeah, I think so.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,620
I'll go, too.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,410
I have to go.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,790
I'd hate it if anything happened to you.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,630
You have to survive and tell everyone everything.

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,730
Wim. Stay in the room.

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,690
If anything happens to you...

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,690
Don't worry.

16
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,940
A strong ally is coming to save us.

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,280
Really?

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,150
Yes.

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,370
If you're in a pinch, no matter where
you are, he'll come and save you.

20
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,200
He'll punish any wrong.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,370
He is the invincible Magnificent Steiner.

22
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,820
The Wrath of the Magnificent Steiner

23
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,240
Move! Run!

24
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,370
Go north along the road.

25
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,210
I think the children can make it out safely from here on.

26
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,340
You should go, too!

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,510
We haven't checked the center of town.

28
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,260
Leave the rest to me. You have to lead the others.

29
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,680
O-Okay.

30
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,720
Just let me ask you one thing.

31
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,690
Do you know a man named Bonaparta, no, Klaus Poppe?

32
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,600
Poppe?

33
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah, he's the owner of the Versteck Hotel.

34
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,470
What are you doing there?

35
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,850
Relax. I'm a friend.

36
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,940
I've been running.

37
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,650
There are bodies everywhere.

38
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,320
Where can I run to?

39
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,950
Where did you run from?

40
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,040
Him. He was giving orders from the hotel room.

41
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,710
I overheard him.

42
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,040
Him?

43
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,050
Roberto! I thought it was weird that he
kept on going in and out of the room.

44
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,760
Every time he came back, he took
a shower and changed clothes.

45
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,930
Where is he?

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,720
In a room on the 4th floor of the Bergbach Hotel.

47
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,310
I never would have thought he was like that.

48
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,200
There are a bunch of people hiding at the Versteck Hotel.

49
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,450
Can you get there by yourself?

50
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,620
On my own?!

51
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,330
I'm scared.

52
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,700
Come on now. Get up.

53
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm scared!

54
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,230
Dr. Tenma.

55
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,070
Inspector Lunge.

56
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,150
The illusion has finally become reality.

57
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:02,160
And now that you are here, the vacation I took to pull
the threads of that illusion together is now over.

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
As of now, I'm on duty as an officer of the law.

59
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,040
It's been a long time since I've been on duty.

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,300
Take this girl.

61
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,220
The man you're after is at the Versteck Hotel.

62
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,310
Franz Bonaparta.

63
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,980
Inspector Lunge, where are you going?

64
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,650
I told you, work.

65
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,030
If I make it back, I want to talk with you.

66
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,950
I have a lot of questions I want to ask you.

67
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,620
Dr. Tenma.

68
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,620
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,800
Are you okay, Nina?

70
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,390
My memories...

71
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,010
are running through my head.

72
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,770
The memory in the farthest recesses of my mind...

73
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,150
Your deepest memory?

74
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,570
I don't want to remember it.

75
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,030
If Johan has this memory... If he can remember it...

76
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,570
Come out.

77
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,910
D-Don't shoot.

78
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm from the town.

79
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Please don't shoot.

80
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,800
Where is the man who's giving the orders?

81
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,390
I'm asking you where Roberto is!

82
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,280
Please stand up!

83
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,910
We need to get going.

84
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,580
I can't stand it. There are bodies everywhere!

85
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,910
I'll go insane if I stay here!

86
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,120
That's why we have to get to the Versteck Hotel as soon as possible.

87
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,330
No!

88
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,010
Open your eyes, Erika.

89
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,810
Please, Erika!

90
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,680
She's your wife, right?

91
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,730
I'm sorry, but she's...

92
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm a friend.

93
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,360
It's dangerous here. Let's go somewhere safe.

94
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,900
Please let me have your gun!

95
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,450
I'm going to kill the guy who shot Erika.

96
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,540
Give me a gun!

97
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,370
The guy who ruined my life... I'm going to...!

98
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,830
Your wife wouldn't have wanted that.

99
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,090
Your wife would have wanted you to keep your child safe.

100
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,760
Am I wrong?

101
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,610
I'll show you the way.

102
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,400
There's a route by the north road
that will lead you out of here.

103
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,700
You should forget about the hotel and take the road as well.

104
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,370
No! I don't want to go anywhere.

105
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,130
Okay. I'll be back. Don't go anywhere.

106
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,920
Okay?

107
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,850
It sure is quiet.

108
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,400
So they aren't after our lotto winnings at all, are they?

109
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,950
No.

110
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,620
These last few days have been a living hell.

111
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,620
I really went crazy for a while.

112
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,420
I bought all these guns because of that money.

113
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,420
A normal life is the best.

114
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,880
Normal?

115
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,470
I have to tell my wife that this isn't our fault.

116
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,260
Can you hear me, honey?

117
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,610
Mr. Hennig!

118
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,030
Mr. Hennig!

119
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,740
My wife...

120
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,370
Mrs. Hennig!

121
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,330
It hurts.

122
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
This way.

123
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,140
They're shooting from the building across the road.

124
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,680
Is there a basement in this hotel?

125
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,640
There's a storage room under the kitchen.

126
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,940
Are you okay?

127
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,230
I should be asking you that.

128
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,320
My dad's doing this.

129
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,530
My dad ran out of alcohol and went mad.

130
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,580
No, he's not, Wim.

131
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,750
It's just like when he beats me up. He's...

132
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,380
Do you think he'd go this far?

133
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,220
It will end if I give myself up.

134
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,890
If I...

135
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,890
Don't make me say it again.

136
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,390
I won't let you die.

137
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,810
If you say that again, I'll tie you up down here.

138
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,940
Stay here.

139
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,190
I'll come up with something.

140
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,780
Mr. Grimmer.

141
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,950
Didn't I tell you?

142
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,990
When I'm in trouble, the invincible Magnificent Steiner will appear.

143
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,460
I've seen some cases of experiments like that.

144
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,620
After experiencing overwhelming rage, grief, or intense stress,

145
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,420
different personalities would appear in the children.

146
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,560
Such children tended to be extremely violent, but many of them committed suicide.

147
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,730
You've done well to live this long.

148
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,240
Look, I'm unarmed.

149
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,950
Give me a second and let's talk.

150
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,950
Why are you doing this?

151
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,950
Who's giving the orders?

152
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,710
I don't care if you were former Stasi.

153
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,880
I don't care who you are.

154
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm not from anywhere.

155
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,970
Are you listening?

156
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,260
Listen with your own ears.

157
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,970
Don't take orders. Listen to your own heart.

158
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,190
Think with your own mind about what you're doing.

159
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,560
You can do that, can't you?

160
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,480
You can.

161
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,820
What are you doing?

162
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,870
I was so scared, but I made it here by myself.

163
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,040
I'm so glad you're here.

164
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,140
Magnificent Steiner!

165
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,350
Are you gathered around the tube, kids?

166
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,940
Everyday, I watched TV intensely.

167
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,480
What adventure awaits us today?

168
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
But I have no memory of the final episode.

169
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,480
If you're in trouble, call out his name.

170
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,200
Lets go.

171
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,910
No! I don't want to!

172
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,240
No!

173
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,330
No!

174
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:57,090
Did that weak young man ever realize that he turned
into the Magnificent Steiner whenever he got angry?

175
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,680
Did that young man live happily ever after?

176
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,440
Did that young man...

177
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,450
Did that young man... live happily...

178
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,170
Just a little farther.

179
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,250
If we go just a little farther, we'll be out of these woods.

180
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,420
You're from Ruhenheim, aren't you?

181
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,090
Who are you?

182
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,590
Something's happening in the town, isn't it?

183
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,560
There are many armed men in the town.

184
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,310
The whole town has turned into a blood bath.

185
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,390
Don't tell me that you...

186
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,190
Calm down. Were friends.

187
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,650
Did you see an oriental Japanese man with long hair?

188
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,660
Do you know him?

189
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,030
You've seen him?!

190
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,660
Yes, he helped us escape.

191
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,330
He stayed behind to try and save the other people in town.

192
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,000
He was headed to the Versteck Hotel when we parted.

193
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:15,790
Hey, Nina!

194
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,380
My car is parked at the end of the woods.

195
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,390
Use it to take the injured to a hospital,

196
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,050
and contact the authorities as soon as possible.

197
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,560
Are you headed to town? You shouldn't go.

198
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,350
They'll kill you.

199
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,230
Tenma, that Asian man, is my friend.

200
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,480
I'm going to save him. Please hurry and call the authorities.

201
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,710
Versteck Hotel.

202
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,400
Mr. Grimmer.

203
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,990
Hey there.

204
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,370
I knew you'd come, Dr. Tenma.

205
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:39,920
Two in the other building, one on the floor below us, and one here.

206
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,880
I got four of them.

207
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,140
So, the Magnificent Steiner appeared.

208
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,390
No, he didn't.

209
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,270
I did it on my own.

210
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,360
I did it with my own anger.

211
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,030
Either way, those wounds...

212
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:08,030
Oh, yeah. Before I forget, take this letter.

213
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,870
I got it from Inspector Lunge.

214
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
He said he found it at the Red Rose Mansion.

215
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,920
Please go help him.

216
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,750
He's headed to the Bergbach Hotel by himself.

217
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,130
We have to take care of you first.

218
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,510
I'm fine.

219
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,720
Just let me rest for a while.

220
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,390
Let me introduce you.

221
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,690
This is Franz Bonaparta.

222
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,480
Mr. Grimmer.

223
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,900
Don't worry, Wim.

224
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,910
It's been raining for quite some time.

225
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,670
It'd be much nicer here if it cleared up.

226
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,800
Right, Dr. Tenma?

227
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,550
Yeah.

228
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,550
When it gets sunny out, let's take Wim on a picnic together.

229
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,970
Yeah.

230
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,940
We'll have good wine and good cheese.

231
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,730
Yeah.

232
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm sad.

233
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,910
I'm not sad that I'm dying.

234
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:41,370
I'm finally sad that my child died.

235
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,840
People don't lose their emotions.

236
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,680
My emotions just wandered around in an unknown place.

237
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:03,480
It's like a letter that was addressed to
me decades ago has finally arrived.

238
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,900
Is this true sadness?

239
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,870
Or is it happiness?

240
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,460
In the final episode of the Magnificent Steiner,

241
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,680
I bet he became human again.

242
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,820
Mr. Grimmer.

243
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,160
Mr. Grimmer.

244
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,820
Mr. Grimmer!

245
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,700
Mr. Grimmer!

246
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,760
I...

247
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,680
I...

248
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:43,200
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

249
00:22:44,290 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

250
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:25,680
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

251
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:34,160
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

252
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,570
A Nameless Man
