1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,690
<i>Dr. Tenma, it wasn't your fault.</i>

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,230
<i>You just did what you had to do
as a doctor... It wasn't your fault.</i>

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,110
<i>Please eat the sandwiches
and get some rest.</i>

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,010
<i>I want you to survive,
and save as many people as you can.</i>

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,380
<i>Nina Fortner.</i>

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,200
<i>Nina... What do you intend to do?</i>

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,570
<i>Do you intend to try to
kill him again?!</i>

8
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,010
<i>I brought him back to life...</i>

9
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,340
<i>I brought that monster</i>

10
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,380
<i>back to life...</i>

11
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,050
This arteriovenous malformation

12
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,560
contains many blood vessels...
Cut away all of the inflowing arteries!

13
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Treat all of the outflowing veins.

14
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,130
The removal of the nidus is complete.

15
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,240
Well... that certainly went well.

16
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,410
Yes. He did the clipping
very quickly, as usual.

17
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,780
That was a magnificent operation.

18
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,560
It was his first surgery after
an extended leave,

19
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,890
but the talent of this genius
keeps growing...

20
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,660
It's over...

21
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,130
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

22
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,700
It's nothing...

23
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,570
Pursued

24
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,540
<i>That was wonderful, Kenzo.</i>

25
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,150
That wasn't news about me,
but about your father.

26
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,680
That's true...

27
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,120
But that's because you did
such a perfect job last night,

28
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,790
as part of Father's team.
I'm sure Father is grateful to you.

29
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,630
After all, you're the one who has
raised the fame of the hospital.

30
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,990
I'm the one who is grateful.

31
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,860
It's thanks to your father that
I am able to work here in Germany.

32
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,070
Hang in there, Kenzo.

33
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,670
If you stick with Father,
your future is guaranteed.

34
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,580
It won't be long before Father
becomes Chairman of the hospital.

35
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,880
Then you'll quickly become
Chief of Surgery,

36
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,510
and in time, Hospital Director...

37
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,990
And then, I will be the Director's wife!

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,590
You must make me happy, now.
Hardships do not become me.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,190
You want to go out on a date?

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,070
Or...

41
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,960
I-I'm afraid you cannot...
The mistress is resting...

42
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,210
I won't take much of her time.
I will leave very shortly.

43
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,670
B-But, please return again
after making an appointment.

44
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,710
What's all that noise?

45
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,780
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Ma'am.
It's the police...

46
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,410
Police?

47
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,760
It's good to see you again,
Miss Eva Heinemann.

48
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,750
Who are you?

49
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,330
I thank you for the help you gave me
on your father's case, nine years ago.

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm Lunge of the Federal Police.

51
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,640
Lunge... Oh...

52
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,770
You may leave us, Horst.

53
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,070
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,010
I remember you now.

55
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,280
You were just a useless detective
who couldn't even close that case.

56
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,980
What do you want with me now?

57
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,920
You've been able to
maintain this residence

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,690
even after your father's death.
I am impressed.

59
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,900
No, I do believe all of the furnishing
is even grander than it was before.

60
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,600
Have you come to see how wealthy
I've become with

61
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,440
my inheritance from my father
and settlements from my divorces?

62
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,670
As you can see, I lack nothing.

63
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,780
If you see anything you want
please help yourself to it.

64
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,010
I'm fine, as long as I have my liquor.

65
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,860
Today...

66
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,800
I would like you to have a look at
something... This necktie...

67
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,700
Necktie?

68
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,340
Have you seen it before?

69
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,240
Perhaps you don't remember...
It's something from nine years ago.

70
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,600
It's a simple print,
but if you look at it carefully,

71
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,210
it's a wonderful piece
with a complex weave.

72
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,280
What about it?

73
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,780
This really gave me a hard time.
After all, it's been nine years...

74
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,320
But luckily, this comes from a shop
that had a limited number of these

75
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,600
made for their best customers.
And on their list...

76
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,630
I found your name...

77
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,030
As I said, what about it?

78
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,800
Didn't you purchase this
and give it to someone?

79
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,320
This plays a key role
in another murder, you see...

80
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,790
Murder?

81
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,190
Who knows?

82
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,060
I've given countless gifts to men,
so I can't remember them all.

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,870
The men who approach me
are all after my money...

84
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,230
Please think carefully.

85
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,580
I said I don't remember!
They're all after my money!

86
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,100
There isn't a single person
who truly loves me...

87
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,440
That's why I took each one
to the cleaners with each divorce.

88
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,950
All three of them. Good for them!

89
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,090
Do you want something too?
You want something? Tell me!

90
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,720
Just remember it'll cost you!

91
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,590
I'll come again.

92
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,560
If you remember anything,
please give me a call.

93
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,570
Next time you come,
be sure to bring a bottle of liquor.

94
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,650
Excuse me.

95
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,630
Eva...

96
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,130
Eva, won't you talk to
your father for me?

97
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,190
I haven't done anything wrong!

98
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,070
I just operated
on an emergency case

99
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,610
in the order in which
he was brought in!

100
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,580
That's... your engagement ring.

101
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,210
You're such a fool.

102
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,760
Huh?

103
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,930
Eva!

104
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
Why, Dr. Norden,
don't you look elegant?

105
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,730
As do you! You're more beautiful
than ever tonight, Eva.

106
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,450
Horst, have my car readied!

107
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,700
Well, Mr. Hess, you seem to be
much better. Your color is good.

108
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,690
I think you'll be able to go home
sometime this week.

109
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,670
Thank you very much, Dr. Tenma.

110
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,010
My daughter is getting
married next month.

111
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,670
Will I be able to attend her wedding?

112
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,810
Yes, that should be fine.
Just don't overdo it at the reception.

113
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,190
Thank you.

114
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,420
I had resigned myself to not going,
but thanks to you, Dr. Tenma...

115
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,020
It was due to your own efforts.

116
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,060
With you at my side,
I feel as though I can be there,

117
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,830
not only at my daughter's,
but at my grand children's weddings, too.

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,870
You are truly an excellent doctor.
Please stay here at this hospital.

119
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,780
Uh, Dr. Tenma... You have a visitor.

120
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,420
I must make my rounds now.
I'm too busy. Please turn them away.

121
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,840
B-But...

122
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,030
Eva...

123
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,310
It's been a while, Kenzo...

124
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,450
Yeah...

125
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,250
We've gone through so much,
haven't we?

126
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,920
Father... Are you asleep?

127
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm coming in.

128
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,540
Father!

129
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,780
- Eva...
- Eva...

130
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,380
I know it's hard, but you must
pull yourself together...

131
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,420
Let go of me!

132
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,760
Give me back my father!
Father!

133
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,330
Kenzo!

134
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,730
Please, I was wrong.

135
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,900
Kenzo...

136
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,770
<i>Kenzo!</i>

137
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,020
You've lost some weight, haven't you?

138
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,850
Not really...

139
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,290
I hear you were on extended leave.

140
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,450
Yes, you should rest yourself
from time to time.

141
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,760
You're such a glutton for work...

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,790
You've lost some weight too,
haven't you?

143
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,300
So much has happened...

144
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,040
You've heard the rumors,
haven't you?

145
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,710
Yeah...

146
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,520
Spring... Do you remember?
Ten years ago, in spring...

147
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,250
We often went driving together...

148
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,350
We were so young.

149
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,430
You tried to swim in the river
in that season...

150
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,070
I hurriedly stopped you...

151
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,190
And then you...

152
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm sorry, but...

153
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,500
Huh?

154
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,010
Eva, I haven't got time...

155
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,510
Kenzo?

156
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,010
I want us to start over!

157
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,580
After three failed marriages,
I finally realized...

158
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,030
the only one who truly loved me
was you, Kenzo.

159
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,170
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,430
Kenzo!

161
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,330
Please, Kenzo!

162
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,580
I appreciate your feelings,
but I just can't accept them...

163
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,210
- Good-bye.
- Wait, Kenzo! I didn't say a word!

164
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,820
When the police came
to ask about your necktie!

165
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,860
Isn't there something bad
connected with that necktie of yours?

166
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm sure that's the tie that I gave you.

167
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,190
If you do as I say,
I'll keep quiet about it!

168
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,670
I have something I must do.

169
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,790
In that case, I'll tell them everything!

170
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,520
I'll tell the police about that necktie!

171
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,470
I'll tell them everything!

172
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,500
The person who killed my father
nine years ago...

173
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,470
I'll tell them you did it!

174
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,590
I see... Bring Dr. Tenma in
as a person of interest.

175
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,680
B-But there isn't enough evidence

176
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,230
in the Fortner couple
and Maurer murders.

177
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,790
I'm talking about
the killing at Heidelberg Castle.

178
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,130
- Y-Yes, sir!
- Y-Yes, sir!

179
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,530
Thank you for your cooperation.

180
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,070
This might allow us
to solve a lot of murders.

181
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,780
Resignation?

182
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,850
What is the meaning of this,
Dr. Tenma?

183
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,550
I'm sorry if I'm acting selfishly, sir...

184
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,210
There seem to be various
strange rumors about you, recently,

185
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,130
but I don't believe any of them.
Please think this over...

186
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,730
Oh... T-Tenma!?

187
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,340
Dr. Tenma!

188
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,970
Yes! I'm me... What?! The police?!

189
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,680
Huh?

190
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,240
Dr. Tenma is a murder suspect?!

191
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,000
Close off the exits from each wing!

192
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,830
Don't forget the back exits!

193
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,040
Yes, sir!

194
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,680
Where is Dr. Tenma?!

195
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,970
I-I don't know!

196
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,490
What's going on there?
Hurry up and search the place!

197
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,050
Oh, but Inspector...

198
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,000
What is it?

199
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,060
Get out of the way!
You're interfering with the police!

200
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,400
- Dr. Tenma would never kill anyone!
- That's right!

201
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,200
We're indebted to him
for saving our lives!

202
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,080
Dr. Tenma is innocent!

203
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,210
Go away, police!

204
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,140
That's right, go away!

205
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,520
- Go away!
- Go away!

206
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,200
Something seems to be going on.

207
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,100
There's a whole bunch
of patrol cars, Dr. Tenma.

208
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,400
I-I see... I wonder what's going on...

209
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,870
Anyway, just drop me off
in front of the station.

210
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,140
Yes, sir. You're busy as always,
aren't you, Dr. Tenma?

211
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,260
<i>I... I have a surgery waiting for me.</i>

212
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,230
<i>Wait! Dr. Tenma!</i>

213
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,960
<i>Dr. Tenma!</i>

214
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,200
<i>Don't worry. Hang in there!</i>

215
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,770
<i>I'll save you...</i>

216
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,440
<i>I am not wrong!</i>

217
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,120
<i>You say there's
a flaw in my character?</i>

218
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,410
<i>What about you?!</i>

219
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,090
<i>You call yourself a doctor,
but you're just money hungry!</i>

220
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,650
<i>That bastard... That bastard...</i>

221
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,150
<i>He's better off dead...</i>

222
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,460
<i>Oh, no! The twins are
nowhere to be found!</i>

223
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,640
<i>W-What is this?</i>

224
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,600
<i>What in the world happened?</i>

225
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,580
<i>Long time no see, Doctor. It's me.</i>

226
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,570
<i>Have you already forgotten
about those twins?</i>

227
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,250
<i>Johan!</i>

228
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,980
<i>Save me, Doctor... I don't want to die!</i>

229
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,090
<i>Doctor!</i>

230
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,500
<i>I was supposed to have died that day.</i>

231
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,450
<i>You brought me back to life.</i>

232
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,530
Five Months Later

233
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,010
It looks like another scorcher today.

234
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,270
Hey, it's summer,
yet you're all bundled up.

235
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,610
Aren't you hot?

236
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,880
What's that?
That paper's three days old.

237
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,080
They say this time a middle-aged couple
in Verden was killed.

238
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,550
I hear the killer is a doctor.

239
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,130
Oh, yeah... You said you're going
to Verden, didn't you?

240
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,860
You know someone there?

241
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,330
Yeah... I don't know if
I can meet up with him or not, but...

242
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,660
I have to go there...

243
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,570
