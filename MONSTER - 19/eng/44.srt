1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,890
Oh, man.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,440
I hope we can keep this all under wraps.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,650
Man, I want a drink.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,490
I have some whiskey bon-bons if you'd like.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,570
Gee.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,610
Don't say that.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,660
I got them from that extraordinary beauty.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,000
What's wrong? You look really depressed.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,090
I can't trust anyone anymore.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,920
You can talk to me if you want.

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,970
I believed in him.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,930
I never thought Inspector Zeman would do such a thing.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,890
What happened?

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,770
I believed in him.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,410
The only thing that brings peace to my heart right now...

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,670
is you.

17
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,770
An unbelievable and brutal incident has occurred inside the Prague police station.

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Chief Hamlik, Head Detective Patera, and Detective
Janacek were poisoned and found dead.

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,200
What was the culprit's purpose in
committing such a daring crime?

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,090
Rumors talk of a connection between the Czech police
and the former Czechoslovakian secret police...

21
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,380
- Is there a possibility that larger scandals
are behind this incident?

22
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,760
- Hey!
- Is there a possibility that larger scandals
are behind this incident?

23
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,340
- Is there a possibility that larger scandals
are behind this incident?

24
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,300
Someone's coming.

25
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,090
Do you know who the culprit is?

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,600
Is it true that the poison used was
some sort of muscle relaxant?

27
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,730
Is it true that even Chief of Police Hamlik
was connected to the secret police?

28
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,320
Well, that is...

29
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,780
Is there a connection to last week's
murder of Inspector Zeman?

30
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,870
W-We are still investigating that case, so...

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,290
So the investigation department is thinking
that at all the cases are somehow connected?

32
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,960
Well, umm, we will consider all possibilities and
from that we'll continue the investigation.

33
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Excuse us, he is in charge of a different case, so...

34
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,920
Don't say anything unnecessary and get out of here.

35
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,470
Y-Yes, sir.

36
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,430
When will there be a formal press report?

37
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,230
Please wait until we have all the facts straight for you.

38
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,190
Your press report are always too late.

39
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,290
Come on.

40
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,630
You're here for data collection again?

41
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm sorry,

42
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,510
but I was ordered by the higher-ups to
investigate this case from step one.

43
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,140
I've already talked to the other children who were taken in by other nurseries.

44
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,020
Think of the boys.

45
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:52,770
They saw Mr. Petrov, a man who was like a parent to them, and his female assistant die before their eyes.

46
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,780
Some of the children are still having nightmares.

47
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,990
I want them to forget about it as soon as possible.

48
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,250
Although, it's not something you can
ever forget even in a whole lifetime.

49
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,750
Someone they loved with their whole hearts was killed.

50
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,550
Fifteen minutes per kid.

51
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,930
Don't ask any questions that are too raw for them.

52
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,680
Got it?

53
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,640
Yes, living there was fun.

54
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,770
Mr. Petrov and Miss Anna were very nice people.

55
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,850
I see.

56
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,770
I'd like to ask you about the day of the incident.

57
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,030
Did you ever see the man who came to
visit that day, Mr. Grimmer, before?

58
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,950
No, that was the first time I saw him.

59
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,030
Why did he go there?

60
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,330
I don't know.

61
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,750
Were Mr. Petrov and Mr. Grimmer
getting along well together?

62
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,750
Hmm, it didn't seem like they were that close, but...

63
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,380
But what?

64
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,050
They were talking about something serious.

65
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,050
You kids know a little German, don't you?

66
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,300
What were they talking about?

67
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,470
He said, "This place doesn't have a license,"

68
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,890
and "I'll report you to the police."

69
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,390
Something like that.

70
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,640
Mr. Grimmer said that?

71
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,480
Yeah. He also said something about
"education" and an "experiment."

72
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,900
Experiment?

73
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,740
Anything else?

74
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,400
Something else...?

75
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,740
If there are things that you don't want
to remember, it's okay, Honza.

76
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,290
The other thing was 511 Kinderheim.

77
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,960
511 Kinderheim?

78
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,500
Do you know where that is?

79
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,590
No.

80
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,710
Do you?

81
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,260
There isn't a place like that in the Czech Republic.

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,140
About Mr. Grimmer... What kind of person was he?

83
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,770
He was a really nice guy.

84
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,770
You think so too, Izzy?

85
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,310
He played soccer with us!

86
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,030
He wasn't that good, but he looked like he was having fun.

87
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,410
He was so bad at heading!

88
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,660
He fell on his butt.

89
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,830
Honza's probably the next worse.

90
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,040
And then!

91
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,580
You were the leader there, weren't you Antonin?

92
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,550
I wasn't really the leader.

93
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,840
I was just a little older than the rest of the boys.

94
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,510
I'd like to ask you about that day.

95
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,220
About Mr. Grimmer?

96
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,680
Honza and Izzy said you asked them about Mr. Grimmer.

97
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,730
Y-Yeah.

98
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,310
So you were saying?

99
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,980
He's a good person.

100
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,490
You don't suspect him do you?

101
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,950
No, that's not it.

102
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,490
Mr. Grimmer isn't the culprit.

103
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,410
We were playing soccer with him.

104
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,080
When we came back, Mr. Petrov and Anna were dead.

105
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,250
We told this to the police before.

106
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,090
We saw her.

107
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,260
We saw a pretty blonde lady leaving our house.

108
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,260
Are you going to arrest him?

109
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,260
Arrest who?

110
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,600
Mr. Grimmer.

111
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,060
No, I haven't decided to do that yet.

112
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,030
We're going to meet him.

113
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,780
We promised. We even decided on the place.

114
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,870
Will you tell me?

115
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,160
Yeah.

116
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,290
Are you sure? We might arrest him.

117
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,800
I told you, he's not a killer.

118
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
Yo!

119
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,270
It's been a long time.

120
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,270
How are you guys doing?

121
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,940
We're doing great.

122
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,650
You didn't cry, did you?

123
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,360
He wet the bed twice.

124
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,620
I wet the bed much more than you.

125
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
Huh?!

126
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,630
Antonin, do you have what I left you?

127
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,340
Thank you.

128
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,260
You did a good job holding onto it

129
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,140
It's something important that I got from your grandpa.

130
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,100
Well, I'm out of time.

131
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,860
Take care all of you.

132
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,070
Let's play soccer, Mr. Grimmer.

133
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,530
I'm sorry, I don't really have the time.

134
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,740
I'll introduce you.

135
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,410
They're our new friends.

136
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,500
Okay! I'll play, but just for a little bit.

137
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,670
Hooray!

138
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,170
Pass!

139
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,720
Go! This is our chance!

140
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
Pass the ball!

141
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,050
It got stolen?!

142
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,310
Gotta dribble better than that!

143
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,980
Hold on, Defender!

144
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,320
Oh, man.

145
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,040
Here we go! Take that!

146
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,800
You're Mr. Grimmer, aren't you?

147
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,010
Did you come to arrest me?

148
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,640
You shouldn't go waving a gun around in front of children.

149
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,520
You throw me your gun first.

150
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,560
I'm not carrying a gun.

151
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,940
You tossed it?

152
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,530
I've never carried a gun before.

153
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,540
Are you the one who murdered Inspector Zeman?

154
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,620
I don't know.

155
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,460
I was tortured and half-dead.

156
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,960
Your nails!

157
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,720
I wasn't the one who shot that man with a gun.

158
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,550
I might have killed the others.

159
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,260
I don't remember.

160
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,350
Mr. Grimmer!

161
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,440
Why are you resting?

162
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,270
Our team doesn't have enough members now.

163
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,650
Give me a break. I'm completely exhausted.

164
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,120
I was the one who told them to invite you to play soccer.

165
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,450
I've been watching you for a while.

166
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,620
So, what do you think?

167
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,250
Do you think I'm a criminal?

168
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,960
I don't know.

169
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,010
I've been betrayed by many people in the last few days.

170
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,510
I just don't know anymore.

171
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,720
I don't know what to believe.

172
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,350
In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself.

173
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,520
The last thing you can believe in, is you yourself.

174
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,270
Aren't you going to arrest me?

175
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,530
Can you promise me you won't run away?

176
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,530
Where are you staying now?

177
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,030
Pavla Hotel, Room 302.

178
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,000
If you can confirm that I'm a criminal,
come whenever you like.

179
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,710
I'll let you hold on to that.

180
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,970
I think that it's the cause of this series of events.

181
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,050
It's the key to his safe deposit box.

182
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,910
Is it this signboard?

183
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,710
This is an old one.

184
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,170
It's the sign for a bar from over 200 years ago.

185
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,010
Even though the bar's gone, the sign is still hanging there.

186
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,550
The color is fading, but it's a landmark on this street.

187
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,310
A long time ago, many misfortunes
must have befallen this place.

188
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,560
But this sign survived.

189
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,110
It even survived the fire some umpteen years ago.

190
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,730
The fire?

191
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,070
A woman with a child moved into the second floor there.

192
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,620
She was very beautiful, but she seemed pretty gloomy.

193
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,830
She didn't come out much and
I heard she used a fake name.

194
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,710
One day, a black car came out of the blue
and took the woman and child away.

195
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,220
There were rumors that she was involved
with some anti-government activities.

196
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,260
A lot of people were back then.

197
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,220
Those were the politics of fear back when
communism was coming to an end.

198
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,270
It was a horrible age.

199
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,150
It wasn't odd for people to just disappear
off the face of the Earth.

200
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,860
Were the children she had with her twins?

201
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,070
No, there was only one child.

202
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,910
And the child had such a beautiful face.

203
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,330
Was it a boy or a girl?

204
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,290
Huh? Now that you mention it, I don't really remember.

205
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,840
When they're young, you can't really tell sometimes.

206
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:48,180
Everyone said, "I can't believe that they'd take
a mother, let alone an innocent child away!"

207
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,850
And then that place caught on fire.

208
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,400
A fire started when you'd think that no one
would be there, but that child was in there.

209
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,940
They must've released the child alone.

210
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,900
The child must have been hungry and tried
to light a fire in order to make some food.

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,900
That child was...

212
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,290
After the child was rescued from the fire,
they lost track of the child's whereabouts.

213
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,160
I don't know what happened after that.

214
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,170
What if that child was one of the twins?

215
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:19,830
Huh?

216
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,670
What if one of the twins was taken away and the
other one was left alone in that apartment?

217
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,970
I see. That is a possibility.

218
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,930
But why are you so sure there were twins?

219
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,240
About the person you told me to check out, Mr. Grimmer...

220
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,950
I don't think he's a criminal.

221
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,160
I see.

222
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm sorry, Mr. Suk.

223
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,410
I wanted to help and ended up saying
something irresponsible.

224
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,410
He's not a bad person.

225
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,330
While I was chasing him, I learned many things.

226
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,550
At first, I was eager to avenge the death of Inspector Zeman.

227
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,380
But while I was conducting the investigation,

228
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,060
I learned that Inspector Zeman,
who I respected as a detective,

229
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,640
was in reality, corrupt.

230
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,860
And in the end, the chief and two
of my seniors were poisoned.

231
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,320
When I heard that they were poisoned,
I was dumbfounded.

232
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,910
I wonder how far the world of darkness
expands into this world.

233
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,410
Darkness?

234
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,540
The former secret police of Czechoslovakia are the ones
pulling the strings behind these recent events.

235
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,130
They were an organization under the direct control
of the former Ministry of Internal Affairs

236
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,300
that was the Iron Fist of the Soviet Union.

237
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,800
About ten years ago, during the democratic revolution,

238
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,430
the organization was dissolved and the officers
in the organization were put on trial, but...

239
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,640
many of them went underground.

240
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,020
Even now, many of them are plotting to regain
the great power that they once had.

241
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,400
That's all I know.

242
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,270
But why must there be so many sacrifices?

243
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,650
Are the secret police the only ones behind this?

244
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,660
I wonder how much darkness is spreading
in the world we live in.

245
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,580
I can't believe anything anymore.

246
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,080
But Mr. Grimmer said this to me,

247
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,170
"In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself."

248
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,460
When he said that, he gave me something.

249
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,930
I've only been talking about this one thing.

251
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,680
I don't even know your name yet.

252
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,690
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to tell me.

253
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,370
Until now, I didn't believe trust could be had

254
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,110
between people who didn't know each other's name and personal background.

255
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,410
But I can tell you anything.

256
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,420
My parents were both teachers.

257
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,760
But my dad was singled out by the authorities
for democratic activities.

258
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,100
My mom left him for my sake.

259
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,440
When I said I wanted to be a detective, my mom opposed it.

260
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,940
Why did you want to be a detective?

261
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,690
My friends said it at the bar before.

262
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,690
You were actually influenced that much by cop dramas?

263
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,200
It's been my dream since I was a kid.
I've always been a fan of cop dramas.

264
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Bang!

265
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,830
Don't laugh so hard!

266
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,170
But it's funny.

267
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,650
So what did he give you?

268
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,730
You said before that Grimmer gave you something.

269
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,700
A key to a bank safe-deposit box.

270
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,150
A safe deposit box?

271
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,990
It seems there's something very important in it.

272
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,050
It has something to do with the case in which the German man,

273
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,330
Mr. Petrov, was running an unlicensed orphanage.

274
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,210
Yeah?

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,050
It seems that inside that safe deposit box, there's some
data from human experiments that Mr. Petrov ran.

276
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,380
It seems to be the cause of these series of events.

277
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,300
You can't tell them.

278
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,310
You can't talk about it to the police or anyone.

279
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
But, this isn't a problem I can handle on my own.

280
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,650
Your mother is...

281
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,110
Huh?

282
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,030
Do you know why your mother didn't
approve of you being a cop?

283
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,820
She thought that something might happen to you.

284
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,410
She just had a bad feeling about it

285
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,790
So you mustn't tell anyone about this.

286
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,580
I have the same feeling as your mother.

287
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,560
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,470
My name.

289
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,350
I'll tell you my name.

290
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,560
Anna...

291
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,900
Anna Liebert.

292
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,400
Anna, what a nice name!

293
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,070
So you're German.

294
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,620
I'll be seeing you.

295
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,660
Anna...

296
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,900
Good evening, Mr. Trunka.

297
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,320
It's such a nice night, isn't it Anna?

298
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,080
Oh, my. Good Evening, Anna.

299
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,870
Good everting, Mrs. Jalka.

300
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,180
So a safe deposit box key?

301
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:43,440
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

302
00:22:44,530 --> 00:23:00,840
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

303
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:25,920
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

304
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:34,400
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

305
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,570
The Monster's Afterimage
