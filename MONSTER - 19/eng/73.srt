1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,750
Everyone's... dead.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,630
The devil...

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,890
The devil has come to this town!

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,860
Okay. I'll go in first.

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,110
You cover me from the back.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,780
Our top priority is to save Inspector Lunge.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,120
Right.

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,790
Dr. Tenma.

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,540
Wim.

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,330
Why did you come here?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,050
A woman came to see you.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,340
A woman?

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,090
She went to the vampire's house.

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,930
A woman who looked just like one
of the twins in the pictures.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,970
One of the twins in the pictures? Nina?!

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,770
Her name is Nina?

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,650
So now her name is Nina?

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,400
That girl is now known as Nina?

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,120
Yes. Nina Fortner.

20
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,120
What a nice name.

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,000
You always told me to cherish my name, Mr. Poppe.

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,060
Have you see my dad?

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,390
I can't find him anywhere.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,110
Okay. We're doing something important right now,

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,940
but once it's over, we'll look for him right away.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,990
My dad hasn't killed anyone, has he?

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,570
No, he hasn't, Wim.

28
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,910
Your dad isn't someone who would do that.

29
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:03,660
Yeah.

30
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,450
All right. Hide in that store over there.

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,270
Take Wim and find cover.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,280
We finally meet again, Dr. Tenma.

33
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,090
Let us die.

34
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,730
Let us die...

35
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,070
together.

36
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,680
Scenery for a Doomsday

37
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,170
Wait, Nina!

38
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,180
I have to find him.

39
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,890
Back then, at the Red Rose Mansion, he...

40
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,400
Listen up, got it?

41
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,400
Everyone is going to forget what they just saw.

42
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,950
Run far away.

43
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,700
As far as you can.

44
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,210
People can become anything.

45
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,220
You two are beautiful treasures.

46
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,190
That's why you mustn't become monsters.

47
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,910
That's what he said to me.

48
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,160
That's why I... That's why...

49
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,960
Mr. Poppe!

50
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,460
Mr. Poppe!

51
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,670
Mr. Poppe!

52
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,430
Franz Bonaparta.

53
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,650
Roberto!

54
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,410
Run, Wim!

55
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,230
Show me...

56
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,730
the scenery of doomsday.

57
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,740
You...

58
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,030
will never see it.

59
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,330
Wim!

60
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,630
Get away from there.

61
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,390
Dr. Tenma.

62
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,150
According to you, lives are equal.

63
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,110
That's why I live today.

64
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,070
But, you must have realized it by now.

65
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,830
The only thing people are equal in...

66
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,240
is death.

67
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,930
You can see it.

68
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,100
The scenery of doomsday.

69
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,350
Don't!

70
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,940
Dr. Tenma, you mustn't shoot.

71
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,450
Don't shoot.

72
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,130
I...

73
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,500
I forgive you.

74
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,350
Even if we were the only people on Earth, I'd forgive you.

75
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,810
That is my message to you.

76
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,810
It's no good.

77
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,900
There's something you can never get back.

78
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,860
You can't go back.

79
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,910
Dr. Tenma's going to shoot me.

80
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,660
Isn't that right, Dr. Tenma?

81
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,720
Isn't that right?

82
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,810
Stop!

83
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,350
Isn't that right?

84
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,900
Stop!

85
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
The devil...

86
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,070
The devil has come to this town.

87
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,160
He has come to kill everyone.

88
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Wim...

89
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,140
Stop...

90
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
My son.

91
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,980
Stop.

92
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,990
Who's that?

93
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,580
A ghost!

94
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,500
What is it?!

95
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,000
Stop! Let him go!

96
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,260
Get away from my son!

97
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,730
This is the D-KMIF. We've landed
on the west side of Ruhenheim.

98
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,990
We've confirmed that the east side is safe.

99
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,500
Secure any citizens that you see.

100
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,500
This is horrible.

101
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,500
Are there any survivors?

102
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:00,510
Our DNN news crew has finally made it
to town, located in the hills of the south.

103
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,300
This is a shocking incident.

104
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,680
This town has been wiped out in some sort of slaughter.

105
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,520
What happened in this quiet town in South Germany?

106
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,530
Yes. We currently have only one
person to press charges against.

107
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,530
Herbert Knaup, age 38, unemployed.

108
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,410
Dad!

109
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,250
He has confessed to a crime. He shot a young man.

110
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,250
Dad only shot him to save me!

111
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,920
It seems that he's pretty drunk

112
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:47,260
and he committed the crime because a monster
with horns and seven heads attacked his son.

113
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,220
He's been saying nothing but nonsense.

114
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,310
Dad!

115
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,140
Please respond.

116
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,440
Geez, it went out again.

117
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,280
It's just like I said.

118
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,660
It's just... I don't understand what you're saying.

119
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:14,710
A young man named Johan destroyed
this town in order to commit suicide?

120
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,790
Dr. Gillen, can you explain it so that we can understand?

121
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,420
It will take a long time to explain.

122
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,300
And even after that, you might still not understand.

123
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,820
We've secured an injured police
officer in the Versteck Hotel.

124
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,030
How is he?

125
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,320
Sir! I don't think his life is in danger,
but his sense is messed up.

126
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,200
Dammit. There's not a single officer who
can explain what happened here.

127
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
There is one.

128
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,500
I know everything.

129
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,330
Who are you?

130
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,090
I'm Inspector Lunge from the BKA.

131
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,340
I don't have my badge with me, but check with the BKA.

132
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,810
Roberto.

133
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,350
Is he dead?

134
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,850
He's the real culprit here.

135
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,570
I tried to deliver the final blow, but he lost consciousness.

136
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,410
I got away from him and headed downstairs.

137
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,030
I heard his voice from behind me.

138
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,370
In the next instant, he hit me in the back of the
head with his pistol and knocked me out.

139
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,370
He then said this,

140
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,840
"I still can't see it."

141
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,880
"The World of the End."

142
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,890
We'll talk later after you get treated.

143
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,980
Don't cry. We're safe now.

144
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,060
Excuse me. I need to confirm your identities.

145
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,940
We're the Hennigs from Erft Street.

146
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,280
This is my wife Franka.

147
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,360
Do you have any identification?

148
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,450
Yeah.

149
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,740
Huh?

150
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,450
What's wrong?

151
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,670
It's gone.

152
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,540
The lotto ticket.

153
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,040
Huh?

154
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,510
I-I put it in my pocket.

155
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm going to go look for it.

156
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,090
H-Honey.

157
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,590
I dropped it somewhere.

158
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,600
That's enough, honey.

159
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,190
We don't need it.

160
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,480
Just living here together...

161
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,570
is enough for me.

162
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,040
Um... That proof of identification...

163
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,670
I'll ask for it later.

164
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,390
Well, any more survivors?

165
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,390
There are some.

166
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,190
Excuse me.

167
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,440
I need to confirm your identities.

168
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,160
Go to every house.

169
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,950
There might still be survivors.

170
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,040
Excuse me.

171
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,290
What's wrong?

172
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:43,960
Hey, that guy...

173
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,170
What?!

174
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,390
Johan.

175
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,440
Is he alive?

176
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,020
No, with that head wound, he'll...

177
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,320
We couldn't save him even if we had
a brilliant brain surgeon here.

178
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,660
No. There is one.

179
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,910
Call him.

180
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,880
We have some questions to ask.

181
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,380
Are you...?

182
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,180
There's no doubt. He's the wanted criminal...

183
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,140
Dr. Tenma!

184
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,850
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

185
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,940
Could you come with me?

186
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,980
Hey, wait!

187
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,650
Inspector Lunge from the BKA asked for you.

188
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,370
He wanted me to tell you that there's
an important patient waiting for you.

189
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,960
My dad is not a murderer.

190
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,390
Hey, boy. We have a lot of questions for your dad.

191
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,350
My dad... My dad was just trying to save me.

192
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,970
Come on.

193
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,100
Dad!

194
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,900
I want to forgive him.

195
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,990
I want to forgive.

196
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,870
Tenma, you were not wrong...

197
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,540
in what you did back then and what you will do now.

198
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,470
My dad...

199
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,560
My dad is not a murderer!

200
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,260
Let's begin the operation.

201
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:43,220
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

202
00:22:44,310 --> 00:23:00,620
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

203
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:25,700
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

204
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:34,180
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>
