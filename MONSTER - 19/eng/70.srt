1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,460
You were abandoned by your mom.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,460
You were thrown away like trash,
just like your alcoholic dad.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,380
Next time you're at the dump, don't come back!

4
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,930
The Town Massacre

5
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,110
I'm sorry. Could you please leave?

6
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,070
If you want a drink, you're going to have to pay your tab.

7
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,990
If you want money, here it is.

8
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,280
There's at least enough for today.

9
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,620
I don't have any alcohol that you can buy with the money you got from making your kid work.

10
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,960
What?

11
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,420
Get out

12
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,800
He's so weird.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,720
You know what happened to Conrad,

14
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,180
and Mrs. Hillman's dog is dead.

15
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,270
He doesn't have the guts to fire a gun.

16
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
That's true.

17
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,850
He's just a cowardly drunk.

18
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,830
How are we supposed to conduct a search in this rain?

19
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, Merckel!

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
We should just call this off.

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Hey, Merckel!

22
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,390
I've found him!

23
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,640
Merckel!

24
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,890
Mer-

25
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,230
Merckel...

26
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,420
This is Laufer.

27
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,830
Please respond.

28
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,340
S-Someone answer!

29
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,270
I'm going to take your gun as well.

30
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,910
He doesn't have the guts to fire a gun.

31
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,910
That's true.

32
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,120
He's just a cowardly drunk.

33
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,570
There are countless bodies scattered around town.

34
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,320
It looks like a battlefield.

35
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,000
Wim!

36
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,670
What's wrong, Wim?

37
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,510
It's okay. Calm down.

38
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,390
It's me.

39
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,310
I-I...

40
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,060
Calm down.

41
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,400
Give me the gun.

42
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,820
I can't remember.

43
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,690
I shot them, didn't I?

44
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,110
They were always picking on me.

45
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,410
So I...

46
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,160
Wim, you...

47
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't worry.

48
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,550
Calm down. Everything is all right.

49
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,470
Don't be scared.

50
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,390
Calm down and gather your thoughts.

51
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,180
Who did you get this gun from?

52
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,100
Hang on!

53
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,190
You did well to make it here with that leg.

54
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,650
C-Call the station.

55
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,650
The phones don't work.

56
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,030
H-He took my gun.

57
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,280
Was it someone who lives here?

58
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,870
I didn't know him. It was an outsider
I had never seen before.

59
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,250
First things first, we have to get you treated.

60
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,340
Was he one of your friends?

61
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,840
What are you talking about?

62
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,090
How many men do you have here?

63
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,890
What are you trying to say?

64
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,350
It seems that quite a few guns were
distributed around town.

65
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,770
They even gave a gun to this kid.

66
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,020
Wim!

67
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,320
A gun! You didn't!

68
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,740
"You're not trash."

69
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,860
"Don't pay any attention to those creeps."

70
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,320
"You were put on this Earth for a reason."

71
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,830
You empowered him with those words.

72
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,120
He didn't shoot his gun.

73
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,330
All the bullets are still in it.

74
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,960
He held on to everything you taught him.

75
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,760
You're amazing, Wim.

76
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,730
It's okay.

77
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,770
Everything's all right, Wim.

78
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,690
Either way, there are dead bodies all over town.

79
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,700
How many did you hand out?

80
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,540
How many guns did you give out in this town?

81
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,620
How many people took your guns?!

82
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,630
You better not make me angrier!

83
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,170
Bad things happen when I get angry.

84
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,720
Just like our grandson.

85
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,180
What?

86
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,720
He was just like our dead grandson.

87
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,430
He?

88
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,810
Our grandson knew us so well.

89
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,440
He was just like our real grandson.

90
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,190
Who is he?

91
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,700
When you wrote a letter to your dead grandson,
you were really sending <i>him</i> information.

92
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,700
Who is he?

93
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,200
He is probably after me.

94
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,460
It's me.

95
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,630
Yeah.

96
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,470
That's right Mr. Poppe.

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,590
Or should we say, Franz Bonaparta.

98
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,580
The heavy rain in the middle of South Germany

99
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,320
continues to cause damage to Bayern and other surrounding regions.

100
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,490
You smoke too much.

101
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,910
It's fine. I need something now that I've stopped drinking.

102
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,320
You should quit smoking, too.

103
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,250
Dieter, what have you been drawing?

104
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,210
What do you think? Do you see the resemblance?

105
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,750
To whom?

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,630
It's Tenma! Tenma!

107
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,970
I'll give it to the police the next time they question me.

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,550
They never believe the important parts.

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,100
That's why I'm going to tell them.

110
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,810
"I'm telling you this is the man. This is the man who is going to kill a monster by himself."

111
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,740
Tenma's going to come back, right?

112
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,740
Here's a list of some of the damages.

113
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,830
The Elgar River has run over it's banks,
and is stopping traffic in a few areas.

114
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,290
The trains to and from those regions
have also been stopped.

115
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,750
In addition, the phone connections
are weak in all the regions.

116
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,130
I got this e-mail three days ago.

117
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,260
After talking with Dr. Gillen, we've decided that you should see it.

118
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
Please show it to me.

119
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,600
To Nina.

120
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,770
I'm waiting for you in Ruhenheim.

121
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
Johan.

122
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,820
Do you think this is it?

123
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,290
You gave a name to what Johan is trying to do.

124
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,830
"The perfect suicide."

125
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,420
Many innocent people will die.

126
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,010
Ruhenheim. There is a town in
South Germany by that name.

127
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,640
Tenma is probably headed there.

128
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,180
I have to go.

129
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,310
Please let me go there.

130
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,470
This is an odd feeling, Mr. Franz Bonaparta.

131
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,480
At first, I thought you were just
a part of a man's imagination.

132
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,980
Just like one of the characters in your picture books.

133
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,370
I've conducted investigations by gathering
objective data for many years.

134
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,000
But this time, I ignored the facts and took a
journey through that man's imagination.

135
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,920
As I put all the clues together, half for fun,

136
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,340
I met a man in the Czech Republic who made
frequent visits to the Red Rose Mansion.

137
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,510
It was your son.

138
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,760
This is a hand drawn post card you sent him,

139
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,770
signed with your real name, Klaus Poppe, KP.

140
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,190
When I found this place and found you,

141
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,730
I got an odd feeling,

142
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,400
like one of the characters from your
books had escaped from the pages.

143
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,280
But this is reality.

144
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,080
During my research, on the list of people
who assisted Czech Republic refugees,

145
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,000
there was the name, Klaus Poppe.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,790
You fled here just before the Berlin Wall came down.

147
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,300
What were you running from?

148
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,300
Someone like me?

149
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:37,100
In East Germany, at 511 Kinderheim
a place based on your design...

150
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,810
That is where I was made.

151
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,610
Did you try to run away from people like me?

152
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,030
I understand him.

153
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,780
I understand what Johan's trying to do.

154
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,750
And now it's actually happening in this town.

155
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,330
Another gunshot!

156
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,300
There were a lot of dead people when we came here.

157
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,170
What happened to this town?

158
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,220
Hurry up and take me away from here!

159
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,680
It's impossible now. All the traffic's been shut down.

160
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,690
What have you been doing? You leave and come back and then take a shower.

161
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,820
The smell of blood and gunpowder in this town makes me sick.

162
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,450
Calm down. I ordered us some hot tea at the front desk.

163
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,090
It's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.

164
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,970
It will all disappear when the rain stops.

165
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,390
What will disappear?

166
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,730
All of the memories.

167
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,610
There are some conditions to letting you go.

168
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:14,240
Dr. Gillen is coming with you, and were not letting you have a gun.

169
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,990
I don't need a gun.

170
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,450
I'm going to get ready.

171
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,290
And please do as I just told you.

172
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,750
Dieter and Eva, and you, Dr. Reichwine.

173
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,210
Mr. Schubert, Karl and Lotte.

174
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Please hide all the people that Johan knows about.

175
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,350
He's trying to erase all memories of himself.

176
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,570
You'd better go before Dieter notices.

177
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,530
Memories of Dieter.

178
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:05,790
Memories of the Fortners.

179
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,960
Memories of Tenma.

180
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,300
I have memories that I don't want to forget.

181
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,260
No matter how much I want to forget about the memories...

182
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,760
Johan... What about your memories of him?

183
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
I can't let them disappear.

184
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,990
A police officer.

185
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,620
His gun has been taken.

186
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,580
Don't move.

187
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,260
Save the town...

188
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,770
Who shot you?

189
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,770
There was gun fire all over town.

190
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:16,280
Some men came to arm the people.

191
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,950
At some point, the people of the town...

192
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,410
all got guns and started shooting each other.

193
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,290
You have to... go... get help.

194
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,620
At least save the children.

195
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,790
Save...

196
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,300
Save...

197
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,760
Johan.

198
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,430
The first time I heard that name...

199
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,560
was in 1995 from that brain surgeon's statement.

200
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,400
Dr. Tenma.

201
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,650
So you acknowledge that your logic was wrong.

202
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,910
No, he's still the prime suspect in my mind.

203
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,160
Johan is still just an imaginary person.

204
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,290
An imaginary person.

205
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,460
During this vacation, the words that
caught my attention are these,

206
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,930
"How does a real person become an imaginary one?"

207
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,470
The answer is simple.

208
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:32,190
Eliminate all those who know the person and
all those who know of that person's past.

209
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,940
In the end, he will become like the end
of your books, Franz Bonaparta.

210
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,200
"He finally had a name, but all the people who could call him by that name disappeared."

211
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,700
"And Johan was such a wonderful name, too."

212
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,920
What if that's what's happening in this town?

213
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,210
That's what I'd do if I was Johan.

214
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,840
I'm also an imaginary person.

215
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm not the man called Mr. Neumeyer,
who signed the hotel registry,

216
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,810
nor am I the man known as Wolfgang Grimmer.

217
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm not anyone.

218
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,100
So I'll disappear, as well.

219
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,780
Along with all the others whom had their
memories and names taken from them.

220
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,110
I've been waiting.

221
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,530
I've been waiting here for my judgment.

222
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,290
I'm not scared of dying.

223
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,580
But, I don't know how to pay for what I've done.

224
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,260
I've decided to just accept everything that happens here.

225
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,010
You were waiting?

226
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,510
Aren't you scared of dying?

227
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,520
Do you understand how serious your crime is?

228
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,520
Do you understand what it means to destroy
a person's sense of good and evil?

229
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,280
Do you know what happens when you
awaken the monster inside of people?

230
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,570
People need to think that food is delicious.

231
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,620
People need to enjoy a picnic on their day off.

232
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,580
People need to cherish the beer they have after work.

233
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:25,510
People... People are supposed to feel sorrow from
the bottom of their heart when a child dies.

234
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,100
I won't let you die.

235
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm going to get you out of this town and make
you tell everyone all that you know.

236
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,770
I'm going to show the world the true nature
of the monster you have awakened.

237
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,980
I'll protect you until then.

238
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,740
Where is Johan?

239
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,000
I-I don't know.

240
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,210
There has to be someone orchestrating this carnage.

241
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,960
Where is he?

242
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,420
I-I don't know.

243
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,010
Where is he?

244
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,890
Another gunshot.

245
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,230
Is there someone here?

246
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,950
See. I don't have anything.

247
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,250
It's okay. Don't be scared.

248
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,760
I've come to help.

249
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Relax.

250
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,850
It's dangerous here. Got it?

251
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,060
You have to get out of town.

252
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,310
Don't cry. I'll take you to the road.

253
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,270
You can run, can't you?

254
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,030
The man giving the orders is at the Bergbach Hotel.

255
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,160
I see.

256
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,410
But I only have one gun.

257
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,700
These two were outside.

258
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,750
We're sorry.

259
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,540
All I did was win the lotto.

260
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,680
If we had told people earlier that we found Conrad's body...

261
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,050
Before this town went mad...

262
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,810
You bought all of these?

263
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,770
I haven't shot any of them even once. I swear.

264
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,780
Let me borrow these.

265
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,280
You protect this hotel.

266
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
What are you doing?

267
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,070
The residents have guns, too.

268
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm a detective. I can tell the difference.

269
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,370
Oh, Mr. Grimmer.

270
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,790
When this job is over, buy me a beer.

271
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,300
I sure will.

272
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,470
Move, now!

273
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,970
Run!

274
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,970
Live!

275
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:43,200
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

276
00:22:44,290 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

277
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:25,680
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

278
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:34,160
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

279
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,570
The Wrath of the Magnificent Steiner
