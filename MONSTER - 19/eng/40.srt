1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,630
Go.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,550
Get out of here!

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,760
The police are coming.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,060
But...

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,770
Dresden...

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,060
wait in front of the station.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,770
Hurry, give me the message.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,690
Here.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,820
Cedok Bridge.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,570
Three frogs?

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,030
And then my father said this...

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,000
If the monster you're chasing is a twin...

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,420
Their mother is alive and is living in Prague.

14
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,630
Take that!

15
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,050
Give it back!

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,390
Hey, pass.

17
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,350
Nice one.

18
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,520
Give it back! Give it back!

19
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,540
Grimmer

20
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,820
How's it going, Mr. Grimmer?

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,570
Did you find the material you were looking for?

22
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,160
After the unification of East and West Germany,
this institutions works completely changed,

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,540
so those are the only hooks we have from before then.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm sorry for causing you so much
trouble, Director Galbreckt.

25
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,800
It's rare for this much to be left.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,340
Since the Berlin Wall was destroyed,

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,640
the dangerous material in the East has been disappearing.

28
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,730
The only thing for certain is that there were cases
of child abuse in East German orphanages.

29
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,440
Although it's still hard to find materials to even prove that.

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,570
Indeed.

31
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,030
The orphanages in East German were normally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Welfare.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,250
The problem was for the children whose parents were criminals, anarchists, spies, illegal immigrants,

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,460
and those with no influence.

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,840
Those children were cared for at Kinderheim,

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,340
which was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was known for its bad reputation.

36
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,470
I want to know exactly how far the abuse and brainwashing

37
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,600
that occurred in that special orphanage went.

38
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,980
I want to thoroughly investigate what exactly
took place inside that orphanage.

39
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,530
Thoroughly, huh?

40
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,160
I see. That's quite an investigation you're undertaking.

41
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,620
The government employees are probably covering
for each other, or at least won't rat the others out.

42
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,660
That's right.

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,130
Including a certain Mr. Schunua, who's employed here.

44
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,840
Dr. Schunua?

45
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,470
He was an educator at 62 Kinderheim.

46
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,140
I asked him for an interview, but he declined.

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,850
You should keep a lookout.

48
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,520
Before the unification, Dr. Schunua might
have participated in child abuse.

49
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,450
Is it okay if I make copies of these books?

50
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,450
Oh, go ahead.

51
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,950
Mr. Grimmer, you're a journalist
from West Germany, aren't you?

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,580
No, I'm from this side.

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,620
I worked at a paper in Leipzig.

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,630
I would never have thought that a protector of
human rights would be from the East side.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,590
Well,

56
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,260
back then I flew all over the world as a correspondent.

57
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,140
I got missions from the government.

58
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,520
Do you get it?

59
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,690
I was a spy.

60
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,570
What a large bag!

61
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,290
It's full of the papers I've collected
throughout East Germany.

62
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,710
I'll expect a great newspaper article from you.

63
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,670
Where are you off to now?

64
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,540
Prague, Czechoslovakia.

65
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,750
Thank you for your cooperation, Director.

66
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,020
They were picking on you pretty bad back there.

67
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,360
So they ended up taking your shoes?

68
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,160
Don't cry.

69
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,670
People can live without shoes.

70
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,880
We were all born barefoot anyways.

71
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,010
But,

72
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,930
those who would bully others and take away their shoes

73
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,020
are scum.

74
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,190
You shouldn't let losers like them make you cry.

75
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,610
See ya.

76
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,300
Too big for you to walk in, huh?

77
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,230
Dresden Station

78
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,690
Um,

79
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,060
excuse me.

80
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,770
Huh?

81
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,810
Do you have a second?

82
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,770
Sure.

83
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,570
What's wrong?

84
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm in a bit of trouble.

85
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,700
The bag with my passport in it was stolen.

86
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Your passport?

87
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,160
That's horrible.

88
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,040
Yes, it is.

89
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,250
I was going to see my sister in Vienna.

90
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,130
I just got word that she collapsed yesterday.

91
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,460
She collapsed?

92
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,050
You have to make it there as soon as possible.

93
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,550
We should get the police.

94
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,720
I've already tried that.

95
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,810
The truth is, my sister doesn't have
money to pay for her doctors.

96
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,190
That's awful.

97
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,980
The bag that was stolen also had my wallet in it.

98
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,110
Since I can't go to see her,

99
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,740
I thought that I could at least send her some money,

100
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,830
but I can't even do that.

101
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,950
How much do you need?

102
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,460
No, no. I don't need that much.

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,420
If I could just get enough money to see
her at the hospital, that'd be enough.

104
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,050
This is all I can give you.

105
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,380
Thank you. Danke Schoen.

106
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I promise I'll pay you back.

107
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,180
Write your address for me.

108
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,640
Don't worry about it.

109
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,480
As long as your sister gets better.

110
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,440
Thank you. God bless you.

111
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,440
Take care of your sister.

112
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,490
You gave your money to him so easily.

113
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,030
Huh?

114
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
It's obvious it was all a lie.

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,370
It was a lie?

116
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,700
They're always around this station looking for money.

117
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,710
You can't let them trick you like that.

118
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,130
I was tricked?

119
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Express line to Prague will be leaving Platform 7 at 3:15.

120
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,700
Thanks for the help.

121
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,860
You're welcome.

122
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Thanks for the help just now.

123
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,050
Do you mind if I sit here?

124
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,010
No.

125
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,650
Where are you headed?

126
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
Prague.

127
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,830
You're Japanese, aren't you?

128
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,460
Konnichiwa.

129
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,750
Heh, thanks.

130
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,300
I've been to Japan before.

131
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,300
I see.

132
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,890
How many years has it been?

133
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,640
It was 1982.

134
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,180
I went to Akihabara.

135
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,690
They had a lot of wiretaps and high-tech gadgets.

136
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,400
And this song was popular.

137
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,900
Let's see now...

138
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,870
"At the north cemetery road."

139
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,700
No, that's not it.

140
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,000
"At the north....

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,370
bar road."

142
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,040
Yeah, that's right.

143
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,010
"At the north bar road."

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,430
And then there were the robots.

145
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,510
I bought one of the plastic models for
my kid. He absolutely loved it.

146
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,060
Where's your son now?

147
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,390
He's dead.

148
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,280
We're leaving the country,

149
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,400
so I'll have to take a look at your passports.

150
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,740
Sure.

151
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,540
Danke Schoen.

152
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,220
The Elba River.

153
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,300
I wonder how the trout are doing this year.

154
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,060
It's not very good.

155
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,730
Oh, I see.

156
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,150
Last year I caught one about this big.

157
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,190
I don't think you'd be able to this year.

158
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Danke Schoen.

159
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,750
Your secret's out.

160
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,410
They know that passport's a fake.

161
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,840
You should get out of here, Dr. Tenma.

162
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,090
How do you know about me?

163
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,260
More importantly,

164
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,810
the border patrol knows about your fake passport
and they're going to come after you.

165
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,560
You need to get out of here, Dr. Tenma.

166
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,370
Huh?

167
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,660
Hey, you.

168
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,370
We need to get through.

169
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,000
Ah, excuse me.

170
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,590
My bag was so big, I got stuck.

171
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,170
I can't move at all.

172
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,130
Really? What are you doing?

173
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,840
Don't be so violent.

174
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,720
What's in here?

175
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,060
Very important things.

176
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,060
Ah, I'm loose.

177
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,840
Do you know what happened to the man who was here?

178
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,670
Huh?

179
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,630
There was an Asian man in this
room with you, wasn't there?

180
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,220
I don't know.

181
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,430
Maybe he went to the dining car.

182
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,100
You, check that car over there.

183
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes, sir.

184
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,060
We have an emergency in passenger car 2.

185
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,560
An Asian man had a fake passport!

186
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,770
What's wrong?

187
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,310
Hey!

188
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,780
Hit the emergency brakes!

189
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,550
Well done! Well done!

190
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,100
They didn't chase you this way.

191
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,230
The train stopped, so I got off.

192
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,190
I haven't introduced myself.

193
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,980
I'm Grimmer.

194
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,200
If you'd let me, can I guide you to the border, Dr. Tenma?

195
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,380
I know this area well.

196
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,420
I come here to fish often.

197
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,670
The climbing is a little difficult,

198
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,180
but the scenery is a sight to be seen.

199
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,720
Why are you helping me?

200
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:16,930
Eh?

201
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,350
Ah.

202
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,520
I worked at a newspaper back when there was a East and West Germany,

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,480
although I'm a freelance journalist now.

204
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,570
I've read all the articles about you.

205
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm very interested in you.

206
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,160
There were false charges made
all the time in East Germany.

207
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,580
This political prisoner was falsely accused.
That murderer was innocent.

208
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,880
Seeing that all the time,

209
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,840
I can identify real criminals from
the ones who are falsely accused.

210
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,680
You are innocent.

211
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,600
Isn't that right, Dr. Tenma?

212
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,430
Could I ask you to stop calling me Doctor?

213
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,640
Huh?

214
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,860
But you're an excellent brain surgeon,
aren't you, Dr. Tenma?

215
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,730
I'm not a doctor anymore!

216
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,750
How about that?

217
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,330
What a nice view!

218
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,040
From here, we can see whoever's trying to follow us.

219
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,670
Let's take a little break.

220
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,890
How about a sandwich?

221
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,260
I have wine, too,

222
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,350
and some delicious cheese.

223
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,390
I... don't have that much time.

224
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,940
The sun is still high in the sky.

225
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,230
It's better to cross the border when it's dark.

226
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,580
Picnics sure are fun.

227
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,250
It's good to have one occasionally, Dr. Tenma.

228
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,370
Having such beautiful surroundings

229
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,790
and delicious food...

230
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,210
These are the times that you feel happy to be alive.

231
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,180
I respect doctors like you.

232
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:24,020
Journalists like me might give people a
little happiness if I write a good article,

233
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,570
but you... you can give people life itself.

234
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,910
I shot a man.

235
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,500
Last month in Munich,

236
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,920
I shot someone for the first time.

237
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,340
He's probably dead.

238
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,430
Before then my hands trembled and I couldn't aim.

239
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,560
But after I shot him once,

240
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,230
my hands stopped trembling.

241
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,820
And...

242
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,530
from here on,

243
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,360
there is another person I have to shoot.

244
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,410
I'm...

245
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,410
no longer a doctor.

246
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,060
Whenever I come to the Elba River to fish, I think to myself.

247
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,140
I wish I could have come here fishing with my son.

248
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,650
Your dead son?

249
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,070
I can catch a trout this big here.

250
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,780
He died without ever knowing the joy of fishing.

251
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,120
If a doctor like you were near him back then,

252
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,040
his life would have been saved.

253
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,210
I'm telling you, I caught a fish this big.

254
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,810
After you cross that mountain,
you'll be at the Czech border.

255
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,060
When you pass through that, you'll reach a wooded road.

256
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,650
You might be able to catch a ride there.

257
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,030
I'll head back to the station now.

258
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,360
Thank you.

259
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,410
You really helped me, Mr. Grimmer.

260
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,620
I'll pray for your good fortune,

261
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,830
Dr. Tenma.

262
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,410
Bye.

263
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,170
If we ever meet again,

264
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,460
let's have another picnic.

265
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,930
Dr. Tenma.

266
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,890
Everyone is burdened with sins.

267
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,520
Those sins will never disappear,

268
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,850
but,

269
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,480
there are still things that you must do.

270
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Prague, Czechoslovakia

271
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,340
Wonderful!

272
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,140
This is absolutely beautiful.

273
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,480
This is the first time I've been here, but Prague seems
like a town right out of a fairy tale at night.

274
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,530
Do you mind if I sit here?

275
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,790
I'm totally in love with this place.

276
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,630
You're Mr. Petrov, aren't you?

277
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,050
You bought your Russian nationality and
have been living in Czechoslovakia.

278
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,550
I have something I want to ask you.

279
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,350
Will you help me, Mr. Petrov?

280
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,520
Or maybe I should call you Mr. Reinhart Biermann?

281
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,780
There was a special orphanage in East Berlin.

282
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,780
It was an experimentation ground for brainwashing
young boys and changing their personalities.

283
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,450
It was called 511 Kinderheim.

284
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,120
You were the director there.

285
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,500
You should know everything.

286
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,210
You <i>were</i> the director there.

287
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,090
What were you trying to do...

288
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,930
back there in East Berlin...

289
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,270
at 511 Kinderheim?

290
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

291
00:22:44,090 --> 00:23:00,400
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

292
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:25,480
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

293
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:33,960
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

294
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,450
The Ghost of 511
