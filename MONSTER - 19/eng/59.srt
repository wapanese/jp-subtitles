1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,220
What would you like?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,180
The usual.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,510
What was your usual again?

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,410
Why don't you remember it already, Robby?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,670
A hamburger with extra cheese...

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,000
lots of ketchup, and thick tomatoes.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,400
I'll kill you if you put pickles on it.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,770
How am I supposed to remember that?

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,120
That Chinese or Vietnamese person...

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,270
He's been sniffing around about you.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,590
That customer has been in here a lot lately.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,790
He was asking me who you were.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,230
He's not Chinese or Vietnamese.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,200
He's probably Japanese.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,940
On top of that, he's a brain surgeon.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,090
With excellent skills.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,710
Right?

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,270
Am I right, Dr. Tenma?

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,920
Answer me!

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,790
And he's the former fiancé of a
hospital director's daughter.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,300
What are you trying to make Eva do?

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,330
Eva?

23
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,470
You're being too familiar with her.

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,150
How long do you plan on playing the fiancé?

25
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,520
From what I hear...

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,220
not only aren't you a doctor anymore,
but you're a fugitive, too.

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,970
Go to where you belong and fix yourself up!

28
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,620
You might be released someday,
if you're an exemplary inmate.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,200
Release Eva!

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,750
Release her?

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,860
I'm not holding her or anything.

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,690
Not only that...

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,570
she's going to parties every day.

34
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,320
Let me see Eva.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,750
See her?

36
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,960
Hey! Hey!

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,890
Don't mess up my diner!

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,420
Stop hanging around here. Get lost.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
E-Eva...

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,880
Get lost.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,580
The Man Who Saw the Devil

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,290
You met kenzo?

43
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,740
Yeah, two days ago.

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,860
Well, I thought I should let you know.

45
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,820
He wanted to see you.

46
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,540
I hope you didn't punch him.

47
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,980
N-No.

48
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,310
I wouldn't do something like that.

49
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,590
We're leaving.

50
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,270
You're done with today's party?

51
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,720
Not just today's party...

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,680
The party's over.

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
Probably.

54
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,390
Nice work, Eva.

55
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,660
Would you like to have dinner?

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,530
I'll go.

57
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,190
So...

58
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,040
you took her to the restaurant...

59
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,920
and you're having your dinner here?

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,950
Compared to the food served at parties
or high-class restaurants...

61
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,590
the hamburgers here are much better.

62
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,800
I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult.

63
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,200
You're persistent, aren't you?

64
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,580
You want to get hurt again?

65
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,850
Didn't you get it when I told you to...

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,270
Don't move, Manager!

67
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,290
I'll shoot if you do!

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,490
What a dangerous doctor.

69
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,810
Who hired you?

70
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,760
I know you work for The Baby.

71
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,330
However, the one who ordered you to look after Eva...

72
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,210
was someone even higher in the organization.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,870
Who gave you the order?!

74
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,860
I don't know who it was.

75
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,110
But I do know his face.

76
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,790
He wears glasses.

77
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,480
A man that wears glasses?

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,150
What is he forcing Eva to do?

79
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,950
I told you already.

80
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,710
He's only making her appear at parties.

81
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,790
She drinks, eats, and then goes home.

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,510
That's all.

83
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,760
That can't be everything!

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,910
Eva must be doing something special there!

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,910
Nothing.

86
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,440
Actually, today...

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,670
Today?

88
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,060
No, it's nothing.

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,910
That woman pointed at someone.

90
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,910
Pointed at someone?

91
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,200
At a young man.

92
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,690
A young man...

93
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,680
Like this.

94
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,670
At a blond...

95
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,280
young man with a pretty face.

96
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,140
That's all she did, though.

97
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,220
Where is Eva right now?

98
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,960
She's having dinner with my glasses-wearing boss.

99
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,200
W-Where?!

100
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,350
Tell me!

101
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,570
Where are they?

102
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,960
Eva's job is probably over!

103
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,490
<i>After I've finished this job....</i>

104
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,670
<i>I'll surely be killed.</i>

105
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,860
<i>The party's over.</i>

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,310
Where is Eva?!

107
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,960
Wait!

108
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,000
W-Where is she?

109
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,290
I sent her back to her hotel.

110
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,050
Do you have a gun?

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,200
No.

112
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,710
I decided not to carry a gun with me.

113
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,040
Then use this.

114
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,460
Kill her.

115
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,710
Back then...

116
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,710
The party was going normally.

117
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,120
The smell of alcohol.

118
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,950
The fragrance of perfumes.

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,470
Meaningless laughter.

120
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,200
Everything was the same.

121
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,410
Except for that moment.

122
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,560
Eva pointed at a young man.

123
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,010
And then the glasses guy appeared...

124
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,760
bringing with him another well-dressed young man.

125
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,810
And then the two young men...

126
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,890
shook hands.

127
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,550
I didn't notice it at the time, but...

128
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,590
it appears that with that...

129
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Eva's job was over.

130
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,370
So you're the one who's assigned to kill me.

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,590
Go ahead.

132
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,150
The alcohol is starting to kick in...

133
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,110
and I don't have anything left.

134
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,450
Oh, that's right.

135
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,500
I guess you can't shoot me in this hotel.

136
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,970
You said you shot your girlfriend before...

137
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,850
and stood in a sea of blood.

138
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,120
Then take me outside and shoot me.

139
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,610
Or else you'll have to pay for making the room all dirty.

140
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,590
There is one thing left that I'm attached to...

141
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,130
Oh, well. It doesn't really matter.

142
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,710
I wonder what I did today.

143
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,610
You saw me pointing at someone, didn't you?

144
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,280
I probably did something terrible.

145
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,660
I lured someone horrible to the devil.

146
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
I lured Mephisto and Faust together.

147
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,870
It doesn't matter to me.

148
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,600
Even though I don't have to attend parties anymore...

149
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,620
I still have invitations for upcoming parties here.

150
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,610
If you'd like, after I die...

151
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,060
would you fill in for me and see what I did?

152
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,240
Now then...

153
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,360
would you please finish me off?

154
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,890
Let's run away.

155
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,830
Let's run away together.

156
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,520
You must've gotten the wrong idea or something!

157
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Run away with you?

158
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,570
You've gotta be kidding!

159
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,820
Since when did we become that close?

160
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,050
I...

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,560
can't kill people anymore.

162
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,130
You can't kill people?

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,530
Then can you kill devils?

164
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,660
I'm a devil!

165
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,040
That suit and tie I bought you...

166
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,880
looks exactly like what Kenzo used to wear!

167
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,280
Don't you get it?

168
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,640
I was just dressing you up to look like Kenzo Tenma!

169
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,160
kill me!

170
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,890
Hurry up and kill me!

171
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,690
Hurry up!

172
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,630
Hurry up and kill me.

173
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,960
If you don't hurry up and kill me...

174
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,760
you'll be killed.

175
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,490
Can I kill devils?

176
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,160
Hey, wake up!

177
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,800
It's okay.

178
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,680
I just want to sleep off this buzz a little.

179
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,840
You can't!

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,040
You'll die if you sleep in a place like this!

181
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,800
It's okay. Just leave me here.

182
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,250
You look grim.

183
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,030
I always look grim.

184
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,810
Did someone come looking for me?

185
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,240
No, no one.

186
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,920
Actually, the Japanese guy from last night left this.

187
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,210
Hellblau Hotel, room 205.

188
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,100
He said to contact him there if anything happens.

189
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,160
What'll you have?

190
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,830
The usual?

191
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,530
No thanks.

192
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,440
If I get full on shitty hamburgers...

193
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,260
I'll lose my will to go.

194
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,140
Where are you going?

195
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,640
A party.

196
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,340
It's strange.

197
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,730
I can get into anywhere with just one necktie.

198
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,940
Just one.

199
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,130
There he is.

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,550
So, is he a devil?

201
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,330
He shook so many hands...

202
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,690
that his hand should have been swollen.

203
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,570
And then he left the party hall.

204
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,170
Sixth floor, huh?

205
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,000
But which room?

206
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,650
Please come inside.

207
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,180
Please, have a seat here.

208
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,590
You don't have to be modest.

209
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,640
You want to see him as well, correct?

210
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,750
Him?

211
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm waiting for him, too.

212
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,130
He'll be here soon.

213
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,170
Let's talk about something until he arrives.

214
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,480
What should we talk about?

215
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
Oh, I know.

216
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,860
Let's talk about the world coming to an end.

217
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,890
That kid kept talking like a machine.

218
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,560
It was just like...

219
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,270
a child telling his parents all the fun things
that happened at school today.

220
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,650
That was how he talked to me.

221
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,680
The story of the world coming to an end, my ass.

222
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,410
It was just some nonsense this crazy kid was spouting.

223
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,000
That's what I thought at the time.

224
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,720
What do you think?

225
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,850
Wasn't it an interesting story?

226
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,080
Did you enjoy listening, Mr. Martin?

227
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,320
How do you know my name?

228
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,760
Oh, I know.

229
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,440
Let's talk about you next.

230
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,640
You've been working for The Baby for three years now.

231
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,430
Did you investigate me?

232
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,010
You were in prison before that.

233
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,810
Those eight years must have been tough.

234
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,680
You were a model inmate, right?

235
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,950
You were able to get out of the place,
even though you committed murder.

236
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,390
Was it fun?

237
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,740
Living with her.

238
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,700
The woman you killed, I mean.

239
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,120
Her name was Edda.

240
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,490
You sure have poor taste, kid.

241
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,870
She was a terrible drug addict.

242
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,330
You tried your best to get her off the drugs.

243
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,400
It's not something that's easy to do.

244
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Was it love?

245
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,610
Do you want to get hurt?

246
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,440
She got back on her feet.

247
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,480
She cooked dinner and waited for you to return.

248
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,120
A happy life started.

249
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm asking if you want to get beat up.

250
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,440
But on that night...

251
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,600
you saw a terrible sight when
you returned to your room.

252
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,710
Her old boyfriend was in the room.

253
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,920
She was doing drugs again.

254
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,730
She looked at you...

255
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,440
and mumbled something.

256
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,110
She kept repeating to herself.

257
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,830
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,190
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,850
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,100
But you shot and killed her, along with the man.

263
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,680
That's what was determined at the trial, wasn't it?

264
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,370
Why did you lie?

265
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,000
She killed herself, didn't she?

266
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,270
Your attorney found gunpowder on her hands...

267
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,100
so he deduced that she committed suicide.

268
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,890
However, you still confessed to killing her.

269
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,830
She begged you to kill her, didn't she?

270
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,570
I was right!

271
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,570
I was right, wasn't I?

272
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,670
I knew it!

273
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,800
You're not the one who shot her!

274
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,750
She asked you, didn't she?

275
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,310
To shoot her.

276
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,330
Shoot me.

277
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,850
Don't look at me like that!

278
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,460
kill me!

279
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,020
Martin!

280
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,450
It wasn't me!

281
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,650
She shot herself!

282
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,930
It wasn't me!

283
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,910
It wasn't me, right? Right?

284
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,340
I knew it.

285
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,140
That's amazing! I was right, wasn't I?

286
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,370
You're wrong.

287
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,210
You deserted her.

288
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,680
That's how you made her desire come true.

289
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,610
No!

290
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,640
Then what about your mother?

291
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,830
Your mother.

292
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,650
She froze to death when you were ten, correct?

293
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,410
You deserted your mother back then, too.

294
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,130
I was right again?

295
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,930
Amazing!

296
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,920
This is amazing!

297
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,890
I'm surprised I was actually right!

298
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,970
You carried your alcoholic mother home
on your back every day, right?

299
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,970
And your mother kept telling you...

300
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,170
to leave her.

301
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,210
Even so, you still carried your mother back every day.

302
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,560
However, that night...

303
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,510
You can't sleep in a place like this!

304
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,040
I'm fine, I'm fine.

305
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,700
Leave me here.

306
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,220
Wake up!

307
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,200
You left her there.

308
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,890
Am I right?

309
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,800
You left your mother there, didn't you?

310
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,360
The next morning, you were told...

311
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,350
that your mother froze to death.

312
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,590
But at the time, you thought to yourself...

313
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,830
that it wasn't your fault.

314
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,670
You only left her there because she asked you to.

315
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,640
That's exactly right.

316
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
It wasn't your fault.

317
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,030
Both your mother and your drug-addicted
girlfriend wanted to die.

318
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,560
You only let those who wanted to die, die.

319
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,430
You aren't wrong. You're right!

320
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,920
You set them free from the misery of living.

321
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,750
Eva wants to die, too.

322
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,840
Just then, the devil arrived.

323
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,250
I passed by, making sure not to look at the devil.

324
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,970
I can't look...

325
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,440
I can't look...

326
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,460
I must not look at him.

327
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,280
I recited that to myself, like a child.

328
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

329
00:22:44,240 --> 00:23:00,550
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

330
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,630
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

331
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:34,110
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

332
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,570
The Man Who Knew Too Much
