1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,790
It's over?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,090
What do you mean
by "it's over", Mr. Schubert?

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,090
It means the investigation
I hired you for is now over.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,260
Wait a minute...

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,230
It's true that the investigation
on Karl Neuman is over.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,190
He was your son.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,770
I thank you for your work.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,280
W-Wait a minute, that doesn't mean
that the matter is settled.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,240
It's still possible that Edmond Fahren's
death was not a suicide.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,290
We also don't know the identity of the
person who was behind Fahren either.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,080
Everything has been settled.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,880
The tea is ready, Dad.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,860
Oh, is that so?

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,380
Hello.

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,220
Would you like to join us?

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,230
No. I'm fine, thanks.

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,230
Well, thank you for your work.
Please send us your bill.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,730
It's nice weather outside, isn't it?

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,400
Yes...

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,400
Johan is here, too.

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,330
Is that so? Johan is here, too?

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:31,880
How can that icy man, who's never trusted
anyone or let anyone get close, become
such a softy because of his son?

23
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,970
That smile...

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,510
I can't believe that's the same man that
was called "the Vampire of Bayern."

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,450
"Is that so? Johan is here, too?", huh?

26
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,120
So you're currently trying to
find this puppy, right?

27
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,930
Just One Case

28
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,490
Yes.

29
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
It seems that my client's ex-husband
took it away after the divorce.

30
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,640
That's a difficult situation...
a custody battle over a puppy.

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
Indeed.

32
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,640
Excuse me, but I'll be having some wine.

33
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,060
It's fine, go ahead.

34
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,370
I'm okay with just water.

35
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,060
Even though you say that you're
free from your job,

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,610
it doesn't seem like you're
interested in drinking.

37
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,380
That's right. I'm fine in that respect.

38
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,030
"In that respect"?

39
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,390
Is there something else that
you're worried about?

40
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,370
Well, because I've got some free time,

41
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,210
I'm doing some silly things.

42
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,080
Oh?

43
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:16,400
I've been flipping though a scrapbook I made when
I was a detective. It's full of all my unsolved cases.

44
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,970
I see.

45
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,140
And when you look at that, what do you feel?

46
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,970
Frustrated...

47
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,310
That homicide, this homicide...

48
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,850
When I think about how the perpetrators
are living comfortably outside of prison,

49
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,520
I just can't take it...

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,020
I feel frustrated at my lack of ability.

51
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,940
You had the ability.

52
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,200
Richard, you tried so hard and became
too attached to your cases.

53
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,130
You became frustrated at your inability
to read the perpetrator's mind and...

54
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,910
And I turned to alcohol...

55
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

56
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,460
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

57
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh, the food's here.

58
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,930
But I don't necessarily think
that that's a bad thing.

59
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,620
I mean, the fact that you're flipping through
your scrapbook of past cases.

60
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,480
I'll just get frustrated again.

61
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,190
No, you should be fine now.

62
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,650
I'd like you to tell me what you think of
the cases when you look over them now.

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,450
You got drunk and killed that young
boy who was a serial killer.

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,750
You are now prepared to face
that fact head on,

65
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,750
yet you're still trying not to remember what went
through your mind when you pulled the trigger.

66
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,990
You still see that young boy's
ghost, don't you?

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,550
Yes...

68
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,680
When everything is clear,

69
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,500
and when it comes into broad daylight,

70
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,440
that ghost will go away too.

71
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,390
When everything comes into
broad daylight, huh?

72
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,480
The homicide of Holmar the accountant...

73
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,990
The victim, Joakim Holmar, had been
steadily building up his career.

74
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,720
He wasn't the type of person
who people would resent.

75
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,290
There was no indication that
it was a robbery.

76
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,830
The "Voice of God" homicide.

77
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,200
The victims were an
ex-housekeeper and a driver...

78
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,130
At both crime scenes,

79
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,220
a mysterious message proclaiming that the killer had
heard the voice of God was written on the wall.

80
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,890
The homicide of the Dornah Company CEO...

81
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,390
One of the leading investigators in Bayern, Ruto Gakushi, was found dead in the Hartoholtz forest.

82
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,360
The Spiras homicide...

83
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,820
A middle-aged couple drowned and was
found upstream in the Izar River.

84
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,460
The case was grouped with the serial
homicides of middle-aged couples.

85
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,000
The primary suspect, a Japanese doctor, is still on the run.

86
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,960
Man...

87
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,550
I started drinking more as the number
of unsolved cases rose.

88
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,390
But now, things are different.

89
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,720
I see.

90
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,810
It's just like the doctor said.

91
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,480
So this is what it's like to think while sober...

92
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,440
What?

93
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,190
W-Wait a minute.

94
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,190
Think.

95
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,440
Thi...

96
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,060
And?

97
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,150
What were you thinking about at that time?

98
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,570
Well, the thing is...

99
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,370
I was thinking about something but...

100
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,410
Your flash of insight disappeared when
you saw that young boy's ghost?

101
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,320
Yes...

102
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,790
There's no need to be impatient.

103
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,890
Your flash of insight will
come back to you someday.

104
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,420
What was my realization?

105
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,140
I felt as though it was an important key
to solving one of those unsolved cases...

106
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,730
Must have been my imagination.

107
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,050
Who is it?

108
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,020
Who is it?

109
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,200
Who's following me?

110
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,590
It's just like that one time...

111
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,750
That time, I was also...

112
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,430
I was also running through this hallway...

113
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,670
Chasing him...

114
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,360
Sorry for bothering you this
late at night, doctor.

115
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,200
It's fine. It seems like you finally feel
like telling me the entire story.

116
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,960
I'll listen to it.

117
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,290
That time, I saw it in the young boy.

118
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,040
I realized that it did exist in this world,

119
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,670
that true evil existed.

120
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,800
That's why...

121
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,920
That's why I...

122
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,510
shot the young boy dead.

123
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,180
Good. Good job telling me that.

124
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,060
You've finally been able to
get back on your feet.

125
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,190
There's more...

126
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
I see now...

127
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,730
That flash of insight I had...

128
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,150
Out of the many unsolved
cases that bothered me...

129
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,900
Really...

130
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,740
There was one case.

131
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,980
Dear Dr. Gillen,

132
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,740
I had the pleasure of reading your
work that you sent to me,

133
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,280
"A Summary of
Transcendental Criminal Psychology."

134
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,280
I'm pleased that one of my students...

135
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,540
from my days of teaching at the
University of DÃ¼sseldorf...

136
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,790
is having such success.

137
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,760
By the way, Dr. Gillen,

138
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:36,390
you told me before that during your interview
with the serial killer Peter Jurgens,

139
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,560
he told you that he'd committed the murders
because one of his friends had ordered him to.

140
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,190
Since my memory isn't certain,
could you tell me again...

141
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,530
what the name of Jurgen's friend was...?

142
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:07,500
P.S. You were a very good student in college,

143
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,540
but there was another who could compete
with you for the top rank.

144
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,640
He chose the path of neurosurgery,

145
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,560
but he is now the primary suspect
in a serial homicide case.

146
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,310
If you know anything about him,
please let me know.

147
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,310
What kind of man was he,

148
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,280
and where is he now...?

149
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,800
The man called Dr. Tenma...

150
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,300
Ah, you're that detective.

151
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,410
Now I'm just a private investigator
who barely scrapes by.

152
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,620
Forgive me for bringing up a hard subject,

153
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,770
but may I ask you questions regarding
the "Voice of God" homicide...

154
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,020
in which your mother was a victim?

155
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,670
Of course.

156
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,470
After four years, the police no longer
put any effort into the investigation.

157
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,310
Schubert?

158
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,400
If I remember correctly, your mother
was a housekeeper, right?

159
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,400
Yes, but that was over 20 years ago.

160
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,150
What was the reason that she
stopped working for him?

161
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,950
Her health had declined,

162
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,280
so she stuck to working
around the neighborhood.

163
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,280
Could it be possible that she didn't
get along with Mr. Schubert?

164
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,380
No! On the contrary,

165
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,170
my mother loved poetry, and while Mr.
Schubert could still see, she and he...

166
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,690
used to read poetry to each other.

167
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,260
Oh, yes...

168
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,390
Please come this way.

169
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,600
Here, take a look.

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,180
I've kept these through the years because
mother thought much of them.

171
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,780
All these poetry books were presents
from Mr. Schubert to my mother.

172
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,700
Who would have thought that the detective who
investigated the Dornah CEO homicide...

173
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,040
would now be a private investigator...?

174
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,500
As the CEO's secretary, I'd like to
ask you some questions again...

175
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,300
regarding the people who hated the CEO.

176
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,880
The CEO's enemies?

177
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,760
I told you before that there was
an endless number of them.

178
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:28,430
The police should have finished the analysis
of the list of companies that went
bankrupt because of CEO Gauk.

179
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,980
There is another notable
investigator in Bayern, right?

180
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,150
What was his relationship with him?

181
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,860
You're talking about Mr. Schubert, right?

182
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,160
Well, those two were lifelong rivals.

183
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,280
Did you know about that?

184
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,120
Huh?

185
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,460
Schubert went bankrupt twice in the past.

186
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,770
His second bankruptcy was a direct result
of fierce competition with CEO Gauk.

187
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,930
In other words, Schubert was
crushed because of the CEO.

188
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,760
But the CEO had also been
hit by Mr. Schubert.

189
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,680
They hated each other?

190
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,270
Of course.

191
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,400
Whenever they met at a party, there
would always be a big ruckus.

192
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,570
They would argue passionately.

193
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,030
Those two would?

194
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,700
Yes, those two cold people would.

195
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,240
They were the only ones who could
argue with each other on par.

196
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,640
Rather than being rivals,

197
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,160
They were actually friends.

198
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,830
Hey! Watch it!

199
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh, Hans? I knew him well.

200
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,210
He was one of the two victims in
the "Voice of God" homicides.

201
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,720
It's too bad. He was a good guy.

202
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,050
Was Mr. Hans really such a good person?

203
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,590
Yeah, he would often buy me drinks.

204
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,850
He was Mr. Schubert's driver, right?

205
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,390
I think so,

206
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,670
but that was over 30 years ago.

207
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,520
Do you know why he was fired?

208
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,070
It's because Mr. Schubert went
bankrupt around then.

209
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,440
Oh, I see.

210
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,490
So it wasn't because of any trouble...

211
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,410
Listen up!

212
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,920
I'm telling you this to defend Hans's honor.

213
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,290
He was a good guy who could
get along with everyone,

214
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,800
be they rich people or poor people like us.

215
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,090
He used to often say...

216
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,940
that he taught the rich guy
how to enjoy bird watching.

217
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,050
Bird watching?

218
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,720
Yeah, he said that when he
took him to the forests,

219
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,060
that vampire would be as happy as a little kid.

220
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,900
It's already been two years,

221
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,980
but I still remember my husband.

222
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,150
My husband was a very serious man,

223
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,950
and no one had any real
reason to dislike him.

224
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,580
I still can't believe someone would
want to murder him.

225
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,160
My sympathies.

226
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,080
Pardon me, but your husband was a...

227
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,940
Yes.

228
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,000
He spent his childhood in an orphanage...

229
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,460
and lived with several foster parents.

230
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,050
After much difficulty,
he became an accountant.

231
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,610
Your husband was asked by Mr. Schubert
to be his personal accountant, right?

232
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,510
Yes, many times.

233
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,600
He refused him every time, though.

234
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,480
There was the fact that he was busy
with what was then his job,

235
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,320
but he said that their philosophies
on money were different.

236
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,400
My husband was very strict
with money, so...

237
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,490
Thank you for your cooperation.

238
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,470
Do you think the perpetrator
will be caught?

239
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,080
I'll work hard on it.

240
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,710
He will definitely be caught.

241
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,710
Goodbye.

242
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,420
Oh,

243
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,540
by the way...

244
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,680
Do you know how your husband
and Mr. Schubert met?

245
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,690
Oh, he said they met in the forest.

246
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,290
In the forest?

247
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,890
It was back when Mr. Schubert could still see.

248
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,890
They happened to run across
each other in the forest.

249
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,770
Why in a place like that?

250
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,060
They were bird watching.

251
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,300
After that, he would go with
Mr. Schubert many times.

252
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,580
Bird watching...

253
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,460
Happy like a kid...

254
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,170
Read poetry to each other...

255
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
Friends...

256
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,350
A-Are you okay?

257
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,100
Y-Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

258
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,520
What a horrible driver.

259
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,860
Or rather, it seemed as though
he was targeting you.

260
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,650
Dr. Reichwein,

261
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,150
I've done my research.

262
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,780
It was just like I told you the other day.

263
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,160
The unsolved cases that bothered
me when I was a detective...

264
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,530
were all pointing in the same direction.

265
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,050
The "Voice of God" homicides,

266
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,800
the Dornah CEO homicide,

267
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,220
the accountant homicide...

268
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,930
At first glance, they seem totally unrelated.

269
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,720
The modus operandi of each murder
was completely different.

270
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,520
The victims were not related to each other.

271
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,270
In addition, there was no cash flow
linking them to each other...

272
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,230
Their connections did not go
into the records at all.

273
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,570
Even so, they were all connected
by one point.

274
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,030
All of these murders...

275
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,540
were committed to isolate Mr. Schubert.

276
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,500
Also, there's another curious common point.

277
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,640
In the Dornah CEO homicide,

278
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,420
CEO Gauk left right before the crime,

279
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,090
saying that he had an important meeting.

280
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,340
The name of the person he went to see...

281
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,770
The name of the "God" that was written on
the wall in the "Voice of God" homicide...

282
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,690
And in the only one of my cases
that seemed unrelated,

283
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:52,900
the serial murder of the middle-aged couples in
which the prime suspect was that Japanese doctor,

284
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,070
the name that he mentioned
during his interrogation...

285
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,240
All of the names are the same.

286
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,490
"Johan."

287
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,290
A former student of mine,
a criminal psychologist,

288
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,460
researched a killer who murdered
because a friend ordered him to...

289
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,960
He told me by mail.

290
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,420
The name of the friend was also...

291
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,650
Johan.

292
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,810
It is a common name.

293
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,190
The connection between the cases
could just be coincidental.

294
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,560
However, if this were true,

295
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,650
then it means that someone named Johan
has committed these murders...

296
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,820
in the span of four years to
completely isolate Mr. Schubert.

297
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,790
And the prostitute,

298
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,210
Margot Langer, who gave birth to Mr. Schubert's
son, also conveniently died.

299
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,630
Fahren, the student who claimed
he was Mr. Schubert's son...

300
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,550
also conveniently committed suicide
once the real son appeared.

301
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,720
If this man, Johan, does exist...

302
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,930
Where is he now?

303
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,470
This Johan...

304
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,430
Is that so?

305
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,730
Johan is here, too?

306
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,350
Hello, Johan.

307
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,530
It's nice weather outside, isn't it?

308
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,820
Yes, very.

309
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,040
He's right beside Mr. Schubert.

310
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,530
Execution
