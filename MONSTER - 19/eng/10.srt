1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,220
Here you go... your Manhattan.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,690
Hey, what about my red cherry?

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,930
Huh?

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,400
There should be a red cherry in it,
or it isn't a Manhattan!

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,690
S-Sorry about that.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,700
Humph! You'd better watch it.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,880
My business goes well
when I have this in my mouth.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,220
Huh?

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,920
It's a jinx, a jinx!

10
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,600
Verden, (Germany)
Springer Estate

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
A Past Erased

12
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,810
Please...

13
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,320
Let there still be something
of value left!

14
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,660
Okay, okay... It's just as I thought...

15
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,530
Everything's right here;
like a candy store.

16
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,980
Is there anything
valuable enough for me?

17
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,540
Life is fleeting. He may have been
touted as a candidate for governor,

18
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,750
but when he and his wife
were gunned down together like this...

19
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,520
Oops, I'd better get down
to business...

20
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,790
I figure the safe must be
in this room...

21
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,970
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's with this chill?!

22
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,330
It's the first time
I've felt anything so repulsive...

23
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,710
Someone's in this room...

24
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,140
No way! What am I so scared about?
It's not like me...

25
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,190
Don't move!

26
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,550
Raise your hands over your head!

27
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,320
Oh, no... He was behind me. Crap...

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,720
It's all because that bartender
forgot the cherry...

29
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,360
Hurry up and raise your hands!

30
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,630
All right, all right...

31
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,470
Give me a break, officer.
I haven't taken anything yet.

32
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,070
I'm not the police.

33
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,580
Huh? What the? You're one of us?

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,250
In that case, why don't you
put that scary thing away and...

35
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,510
Put your hands on your head!!

36
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,110
What's with this guy?

37
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,380
He seems harder to deal with
than the police.

38
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,250
I-It's the cops!
You fouled up, didn't you?!

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,450
I'm getting outta here!

40
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,360
Don't follow me!

41
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,390
Somebody like you
will just slow me down!

42
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,030
Damn you!

43
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,160
Don't follow me, I said!

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,830
Damn! This is just not my day!

45
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,240
That's right...
I thought you looked familiar...

46
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,570
You're the guy in the newspaper...

47
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,340
You're the doctor who's
the "person of interest"

48
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,710
in the Councilman Springer
murder case.

49
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,910
And you're a thief?

50
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,320
Exactly! Unlike you, I wouldn't do
anything senseless like killing.

51
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,250
Do you know anything about the killing
that took place in that house?

52
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,160
No idea. Hurry up and get out
of my face, will you? So long.

53
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,430
Hey, Doctor!

54
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,240
You're supposed to be
a top-notch surgeon, aren't you?

55
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,510
My brilliant brain just came up
with an idea.

56
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,550
Do you think that meetings
happen by chance, Doctor?

57
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,110
They don't, you know.

58
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,380
All meetings between people
are determined beforehand...

59
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,880
You and I were destined
to become a team.

60
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,060
Huh?

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,150
The underworld is full of people
who need someone like you;

62
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,530
people who want to call a doctor,

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,190
but die because
the danger is too great.

64
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,530
Leave the management
to me... Heckel!

65
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,800
I'll make you into the best doctor
of the underworld.

66
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,300
You'd make a whole lot more
in the underworld.

67
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,740
You'll be a billionaire
before you know it...

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
H-Hey, Doctor! Where are you going?

69
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,980
There's something I have to do.

70
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
Wait a minute!

71
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,350
You want to know about the murders
in that house, don't you?

72
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,560
Huh?

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,230
Well, I saw the killer, you see...

74
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,590
What's that?!

75
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,600
What are you talking about?!

76
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,720
You want to know?

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,440
Wasn't he blond
and about 20 years old?

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,900
What do you mean?

79
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,640
Anyway, just tell me about that killer!

80
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,440
I'll tell you if you'll team up with me.

81
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,080
He's on the third floor
of this cheap apartment house.

82
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,620
How do you know this?

83
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,310
After I set my sights
on that councilman's house,

84
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,180
I spent about a month researching it.

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,250
Just when I was set to go,
that guy showed up.

86
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,090
When I looked in the window,

87
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,220
the councilman
and his wife were dead.

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,030
I figured I could squeeze some money
out of the killer, so I followed him.

89
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,930
Well, this proves that
you're innocent in this case.

90
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,330
Go phone it in to the police
if that's what you want.

91
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,230
Then you and I can go somewhere

92
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,010
and sit and talk over a drink
about our dream-like future...

93
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,210
H-Hey!

94
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,680
What do you want to see him for?

95
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,180
He's a murderer, you know!
You'll get yourself killed!

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,590
What is he thinking?!
I can't keep up with him!

97
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,860
But it's not often I'll find
a source of revenue like him.

98
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,540
I make it a rule not to
stick my neck out, but...

99
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,590
Hey...

100
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,030
It's another hot day, isn't it?

101
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,300
Actually, I'm looking for
a certain person...

102
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,210
Hey, Doctor, are you alive?

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,050
Doctor...

104
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,110
You fool! He's got a gun!

105
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,350
I often used to go walking
with my mother...

106
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Huh?

107
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,850
...along the sunflower field...
on summer days like this.

108
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,020
Of course, she died a long time ago.

109
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,630
Didn't you use that gun
at someone's request? Some man...

110
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,340
Man? Oh... One day,
he approached in a bar.

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,010
A blond man, about 20 years old?

112
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,210
Huh?

113
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,450
That's right. He had a beautiful smile,
that Erich.

114
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,180
So he's Erich, now...

115
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,480
We met a few times
and became good friends.

116
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,030
He invited me to his home...
to Councilman Springer's home.

117
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,690
He lived in that mansion
until recently?

118
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,670
Yes. He said they took good care of him,
like a son, since about a year ago.

119
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,140
Hey, I had my eye on that home
for a month,

120
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,470
but I never saw anybody like that.

121
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,610
They were a wonderful family.
Here's a picture...

122
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,980
That's me and the Councilman
and his wife.

123
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,690
But there was something
I just couldn't forgive them for.

124
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,220
There was a bed of sunflowers
on their property,

125
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,230
but he tore it up in order to
build a parking area.

126
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,100
When I said that was
an awful thing to do, Erich agreed.

127
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,930
Y-You don't mean
you killed them over that!

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,480
Besides, Erich told me...

129
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,110
that Councilman Springer
had a mistress.

130
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,320
He also said this.

131
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,120
"I no longer want to be
a member of the Springers' family.

132
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,030
I'm not a member of that family."
Then he asked me to...

133
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,390
"Please eliminate that family."

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,900
He's terrible to have a mistress...

135
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,070
My mother was
someone's mistress, too.

136
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,110
L-Listen... never mind that.

137
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,510
Do you know where the safe is,
in that house?

138
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,140
I believe it's in the back of the study
on the 2nd floor.

139
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
O-Okay!

140
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,980
Doctor, you'd better get out
of here fast, too!

141
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,200
Did you know?
You can erase the past.

142
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,800
If you don't like it,
you can erase everything...

143
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,170
You can reset your life.

144
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,710
I don't think so. You may try to forget,
but you cannot erase your past!

145
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,370
That's right...

146
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,450
I wonder why I thought that...

147
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,450
Why did I think at that time that

148
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,080
I could erase the past
by pulling this trigger?

149
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,520
I wonder why I listened
to his request...

150
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,770
That's all I have to say. Please leave.

151
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, yes...

152
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,640
You're Dr. Tenma, aren't you?

153
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,150
Please look at the message.
It's a message for you, from him...

154
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,650
You'll find it in the study of that house.

155
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,790
What?!

156
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,580
He knew that you would come here.

157
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,460
Erich said,
"Your destiny is already determined."

158
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,790
Good-bye...

159
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,140
Doctor!

160
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,540
I told you, didn't I? Oh...

161
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,070
D-Don't tell me you...

162
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,810
Oh, this is a suicide.

163
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,990
What the hell?!

164
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,750
What's the use in dying?

165
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,920
It's all over when you die.

166
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,300
There's nothing like living,
right, Doctor?

167
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,300
Yeah... You sometimes say
something worthwhile, don't you?

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
What do you mean, sometimes?!

169
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,880
And so... you're after that unbelievable
serial killer named Johan?

170
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,710
Why don't you forget about doing
something so stupid,

171
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,940
and team up with me.

172
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,790
Oh... By the way, when I tried to open
this door earlier, I got the chills...

173
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,770
What's this?

174
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,270
What are you shivering for, Doctor?

175
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,750
"Look at me! Look at me!

176
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,590
"See how big the monster inside of me
has grown, Dr. Tenma..."

177
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,260
Johan is... He is enjoying himself.

178
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,430
Hey, Doctor!!

179
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,800
Wait a minute! Listen to me!!
Hey, Doctor!

180
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,370
I offered you a great deal.
You should be grateful.

181
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,680
You promised to team up
with me, right?

182
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,680
Who said I'd team up with you?!

183
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,290
Hey! You need money in order
to run from the cops, right?

184
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,150
Get in the car!

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,330
This is your client.
He'll take you to your patient.

186
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,100
I'll hold on to your things.

187
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,910
If you want them back,
you'd better do your job, get paid,

188
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,140
and come to Frank's place
on Grasten Street.

189
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,110
So long. You'd better earn all you can!

190
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,890
This is a really profitable business.

191
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,860
Now, then... Since I got an advance,
I guess I'll have a drink.

192
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,970
Counselor... I brought you a doctor.

193
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,010
Thank goodness, Doctor... Hurry...
Please stop the bleeding.

194
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,780
Your axillary artery
has been damaged.

195
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Did you get hit by a shotgun?

196
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,380
Yeah... Hey, Doctor,
you're empty-handed.

197
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,720
Did you get the surgical equipment?

198
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,890
No. It was too dangerous in the city...
I didn't get that far...

199
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,630
I couldn't operate on you here
even if I had the equipment.

200
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,400
You'd better get him to
a proper doctor as soon as possible.

201
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,460
I would have done that if I could!
Hurry up and fix him!

202
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,540
How long ago was he shot?

203
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,430
Never mind the questions!

204
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,910
Four hours ago?

205
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,180
Were you responsible for
the terrorist attack this morning?!

206
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,620
What if we are?

207
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,090
I refuse!

208
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,130
Wha?!

209
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,950
What did you say?!

210
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,620
I have no desire
to treat anyone responsible

211
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,690
for indiscriminate terrorist attacks!

212
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,470
Don't get funny! Do you realize
the situation you're in now?

213
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,470
Wait a minute.

214
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,710
Listen, Doc... Our friends will be
coming to help us soon.

215
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,440
Just stop the bleeding by then,
will you?

216
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,650
What's with that attitude?!
Do you want to die?

217
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,550
I told you to wait up.

218
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,290
B-But... Counselor...

219
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,150
This doctor has my life
in his hands now...

220
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,430
If I should die...
I want you to shoot him.

221
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,170
We're not running a charity here,
you know.

222
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,210
Pay us back the 250,000 marks
we lent you, will you, Heckel?

223
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,110
Mr. Gross... I do intend
to pay you back...

224
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,020
That's nice. I'm glad you feel that way.

225
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,410
Just break both his arms for now.

226
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,790
I understand! I'll pay you back! I will!

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,020
Good boy...

228
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,460
- So, please wait another month...
- <i>In the random automatic rifle shooting</i>

229
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,860
- Break both legs, too.
- <i>by terrorists this morning</i>

230
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,130
<i>in Erfurt Station, witness accounts
have helped police identify</i>

231
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,800
<i>the suspects as Max Steindorf
and Karl Blunt.</i>

232
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,930
- Please wait... Huh?!
- <i>The GWE has announced</i>

233
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,340
<i>that it will give anyone
with promising leads on these two</i>

234
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,970
<i>a reward of 300,000 marks.</i>

235
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,780
So, they were the ones...

236
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,140
Huh?
I can pay you back that money.

237
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,150
I know where those guys are!

238
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,820
That'll cancel out my debt to you!

239
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,620
That had better be the truth.
Otherwise, I'll break your neck.

240
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,590
It's true! It's true! It's absolutely true!

241
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,970
Oh, but Tenma's there right now...
Oh well...

242
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,240
You said what I did was

243
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,110
an indiscriminate terrorist attack,
didn't you?

244
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,640
That's ridiculous! There was
a good reason for what I did...

245
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,190
Now that I've killed
the president of GWE,

246
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,060
I could die tomorrow and I wouldn't mind.
I feel so good.

247
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,660
Counselor...

248
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,030
I was a lawyer in East Germany...
This guy was secretary to a politician.

249
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,510
When the Wall came down,
we all lost our jobs.

250
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,000
Doctor... Can you understand
how we feel?

251
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,570
After the Wall fell, the GWE
used the power of money

252
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,310
to infiltrate into East Germany...

253
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,890
They aggressively built factories
on our land... one after another...

254
00:17:51,860 --> 00:18:00,460
That is our country... I took pride
in shooting him. I took pride...

255
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,360
Oh! Counselor!

256
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,800
It's cold... so cold...

257
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,970
H-Hang on!
Our friends will be here soon!

258
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,810
They won't come.

259
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,540
Our friends won't come.
I have a feeling...

260
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,690
Stop the bleeding!

261
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,620
Stop it now! Or I'll shoot you dead!

262
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,060
I'll... kill you!

263
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,530
I don't want to die...

264
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,740
Huh?

265
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,600
I don't want to die...
I don't want to die...

266
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,280
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid to die?!?

267
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,710
That's how they all died.
The twelve people you killed.

268
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,080
That's how they!

269
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,560
That's what it means, to kill someone!

270
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,860
Get me some disinfectant
and a pair of scissors.

271
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,070
What?

272
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,230
You have that much, don't you?!

273
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,100
Arterial bleeding... He's gone into
hypotensive shock.

274
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,210
I will use finger pressure on
the damaged artery

275
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,250
to stop the bleeding.

276
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,120
I will suture the open flesh.
Needle and thread...

277
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,690
W-We haven't got anything like that.

278
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,180
Then a stapler will do!

279
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,720
A stapler?!

280
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,090
Hurry up and get it!

281
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
Yes, sir!

282
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,210
Okay!

283
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,810
Huh?

284
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,330
What are you going to do?

285
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,310
I applied first aid.
I'm taking him to a hospital.

286
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,750
A-A hospital?!

287
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,190
What are you thinking?!
If you don't put him down, I'll kill you!

288
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,420
Shoot me if you want!

289
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,800
If you're going to shoot me,
then you take this guy to the hospital.

290
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,990
Put me down here...
You get out of here...

291
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,890
I remembered a while ago... I thought
I'd seen your face somewhere before.

292
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,790
You're that doctor who's wanted
in those serial killings, aren't you?

293
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,990
Hurry up and put me down!

294
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,630
What I did was not
an indiscriminate terrorist attack.

295
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,940
The guys I killed were the president
of GWE, his lackeys,

296
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,110
and his bodyguards.

297
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,540
So you're saying that there were
no unintended victims?

298
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,420
You mean the girl
who was at the newsstand?

299
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,190
So, you did know about it...
That you had shot her.

300
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,470
Why did you save a man like me?

301
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,730
Not because you were afraid you
were going to be killed, right?

302
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,640
Your eyes tell me you weren't afraid
of being killed.

303
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,080
Why did you save
this indiscriminate terrorist... this killer?

304
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,950
Because I believed you...
That you were a human being.

305
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,750
Hurry up and go!
The police will be here...

306
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,130
You have to live...

307
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,300
You...

308
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,800
You're a brilliant doctor...

309
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,000
So what happened to the money?!

310
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,210
Hey, Doctor!

311
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,750
- Don't tell me you fixed him and just left!
- <i>The perpetrators of the terrorist attack</i>

312
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,510
<i>this morning at Erfurt Station
have been captured.</i>

313
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,590
- Say something, will you?!
- <i>Police anticipated strong resistance.</i>

314
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,760
<i>But it seems they surrendered
without a fight.</i>

315
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,530
We're not running
a charity here, you... Hey...!

316
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,530
