1
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,670
Ruhenheim.

2
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,170
This is it.

3
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,930
Hey, Ludwig.

4
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,720
What are you barking at?

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,060
Ruhenheim

6
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,980
Is your bike broken again?

7
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,980
Yeah. The chain keeps slipping off.

8
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,610
I should have known this piece of trash was in the dump for a reason.

9
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,370
It doesn't look like trash to me.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,790
When I'm riding it, everybody says,

11
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,620
"Look at that piece of trash. He's riding that piece of trash."

12
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,330
"That trash is riding a piece of trash."

13
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,710
Don't pay any attention to them.

14
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,800
It's an outstanding 5-speed super-cycle!

15
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,600
Let's try fixing it again.

16
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,520
Hey. It looks like a guest.

17
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,440
Oh, I had a call.

18
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,740
Do you have reservations?

19
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,740
Yes. I'm Lunge.

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,120
Oh, Mr. Lunge. Welcome!

21
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,910
I'm so glad you had a room for me on such short notice.

22
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,380
No, I have nothing but free rooms.

23
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,130
Well, it's still the off-season.

24
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,800
It feels like the whole year is the off-season.

25
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,010
The only people staying here right
now are that old couple there.

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,520
The old man has trouble walking, so it looks
like it's tough for them to go on vacation.

27
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,440
I'll take your luggage.

28
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,730
Thank you, Wim.

29
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,070
It's room 303.

30
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,700
How's the view from that room?

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,580
I got you the room with the best view.

32
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,420
I'm going to leave your luggage right here.

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not trash.

34
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,800
Huh?

35
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,970
It looks like a pretty outstanding bike to me.

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,930
Inspector Lunge from the BKA?

37
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,980
Why is there a BKA inspector in
such a small town like this?

38
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,230
Actually, I was wondering how much backup I could call here.

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,570
Backup?

40
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,740
If we contact the state police, we could
have backup in less than an hour.

41
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,330
Although I don't think a situation that requires that would happen in such a simple, laid back town like this.

42
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,040
You should check everyone who comes
to this town from now on...

43
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,790
Huh?

44
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,250
before something terrible happens.

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Awesome!

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,760
It's working pretty well.

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,050
I'm having a pretty good run.

48
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,430
Time to accelerate. Gear change!

49
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,930
Ouch!

50
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,070
So, the piece of trash is out riding again.

51
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,740
Stop! Stop it!

52
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,990
Trash!

53
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,500
Are you okay?

54
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,010
Are you alone?

55
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,850
Are you traveling alone?

56
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,720
Yes.

57
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,350
For work?

58
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,310
No, for private business.

59
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,810
Are you lonely by yourself?

60
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,940
No, I'm used to it.

61
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,570
Do you have family?

62
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,700
Yes. My daughter has a son.

63
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,830
Oh, you have a grandchild.

64
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,330
Grandchildren are great.

65
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,870
Our grandchild knows us so well.

66
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,590
See, I was just writing our grandchild a postcard.

67
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,670
I love letters.

68
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,930
If you can't say something to someone in person,
at least you can always write them a letter.

69
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,560
Why don't you write one?

70
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,930
A letter to my grandson?

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
I don't even know what to write.

72
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,730
Whatever you feel like.

73
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,480
Maybe I could just draw a picture.

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,370
Excuse me. Do you have a room for the night?

75
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,660
Oh, of course.

76
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,620
Thank you.

77
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,080
I love wandering around and having picnics,

78
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,710
but this time I got lost.

79
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,300
So I just headed toward town and
by the time I got here, it got late....

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,970
You're a real lifesaver.

81
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,860
So no one ever comes to this town.

82
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,780
A gunshot?

83
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,290
I didn't hear any damn gunshot.

84
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,920
I swear. I heard a gunshot.

85
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,840
No one in this town even owns a gun.

86
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,960
If anyone did own a gun, it'd probably be that drunk out back.

87
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,260
If he was shooting out back, the sound would have been louder.

88
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,010
Besides, if he did have a gun, I bet he couldn't
even hit the broadside of a barn.

89
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,730
I lost again!

90
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,020
I lost again because you jinxed me.

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,980
Geez.

92
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,030
Shut up! It's not my fault.

93
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,030
You gotta stop playing the lotto.

94
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,490
Ludwig!

95
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,080
Ludwig!

96
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,660
Ludwig!

97
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,870
My Ludwig is nowhere to be found!

98
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,880
You heard that thing that sounded
like a gunshot earlier, didn't you?

99
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,220
If my Ludwig was shot, I wouldn't know what to do!

100
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,390
Calm down, Mrs. Hillman.

101
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,390
There wasn't a gunshot. Calm down.

102
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,600
What's wrong?

103
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,190
Her dog is missing.

104
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,900
That's too bad.

105
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,730
Let's notify the police.

106
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,900
I already have!

107
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,160
But that man is useless. You can't
count on him for anything,

108
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,530
and he hates dogs.

109
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,790
Should I go look for him?

110
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,370
Are you sure you're okay with that, Mr. Neumeyer?

111
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,380
I was just about to wander around town anyways.

112
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,220
Yeah, I've seen Mrs. Hillman's dog before.

113
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,220
It's that stupid mutt that won't stop barking, right?

114
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,770
He's missing. Have you seen him recently?

115
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,930
No, I haven't.

116
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,690
I see. Thank you.

117
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,030
I have another question. Have you seen
anyone you've never seen before?

118
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,730
Yes, I have.

119
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,740
Oh?

120
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,740
You!

121
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,500
A dog? I thought you were going to stay here.

122
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,210
Sorry, I'm already staying at the Versteck Hotel.

123
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,210
He takes all my customers.

124
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,590
So that means that there aren't any guests here.

125
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,130
Not a single one!

126
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,350
It's dead silent here thanks to him.

127
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,970
So if a barking dog was here, I'd know right away.

128
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,270
Did you hear any barking?

129
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,440
No, I didn't.

130
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,730
But I did hear something that sounded like a gunshot.

131
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,610
Maybe some degenerate couldn't take the barking
anymore and shot the damn thing somewhere.

132
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,250
Hello, umm...

133
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm Lunge, Mr. Neumeyer.

134
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,420
Mr. Lunge.

135
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,130
Where are you headed?

136
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm looking for the dog.

137
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,800
Oh, I see.

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,970
Have you found any clues?

139
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,890
No.

140
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,020
Then the search continues.

141
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,200
Alcohol! Get me more alcohol!

142
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,790
No, Dad! If you drink any more...

143
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,160
Go buy some right now!

144
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,790
I don't have any money.

145
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,920
You have money from your job at the hotel, don't you?!

146
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,810
I don't think I even have enough for one drink.

147
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:07,320
Wim, don't worry about it.

148
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,570
He beat you up pretty good again.

149
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,320
Come to my hotel.

150
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,130
This is delicious!

151
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,430
It's pretty rare to see customers so happy with their food.

152
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
Really?

153
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,220
Hey, good food is good food.

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,810
It's just a sausage.

155
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,560
This is the face I make when I'm eating something good.

156
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,100
Huh?

157
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,270
This is such a nice town. It's quiet and there's good food.

158
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,990
Really? I want out of this town.

159
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,280
I hope some wonderful man will come
and take me away with him.

160
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,870
So no wonderful guys came by here?

161
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,620
No one comes here.

162
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm sick of seeing the same faces every day.

163
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,090
By the way, do you know about the dog?

164
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,220
I've taken that dog for a walk before.

165
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,590
A walk?

166
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,720
I took the dog for a walk for Mrs. Hillman
when she was sick one time.

167
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,850
I gave him one of our deli's Eisbein bones,
and he just wouldn't let go of it.

168
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,650
He just kept pulling on it.

169
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,820
Where did you go?

170
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,320
Inspector Lunge.

171
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,660
Something terrible happened, just like you said.

172
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,830
The dog. The missing dog.

173
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,170
So there wasn't a gunshot?

174
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,540
No, it wasn't a gunshot.

175
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,170
My car broke down on the highway.

176
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,880
It was probably the sound of the engine backfiring.

177
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,680
There's no way there was a gunshot in this town.

178
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,010
Bye.

179
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,950
Trust me. You don't want to scare me.

180
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,870
There he is.

181
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,380
Ludwig.

182
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,590
You've been causing problems, you know.

183
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,340
So you remembered where you buried that bone.

184
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,060
Hey there, Mr. Lunge.

185
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,400
It seems that we arrived at the same
place with different clues.

186
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,030
What are you doing in this town?

187
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,030
What are you up to? You're an inspector, aren't you?

188
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,160
I figured it out. You smell like a cop.

189
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,290
I'm on vacation.

190
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,500
I don't think so. I can tell by your eyes.

191
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,500
I was in Prague just a while back.

192
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,840
I heard some information about a man
who was involved in an incident there.

193
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,010
A tall man who carried a big bag.

194
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,520
He had a friendly smile.

195
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,520
His hair color was...

196
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,110
You completely match all the data I have on that man,

197
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,400
Mr. Neumeyer.

198
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,200
Or should I say, Mr. Grimmer?

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,990
What did you come here for?

200
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:56,210
It really does seem like we arrived at
the same place with different clues.

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,460
Am I wrong?

202
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,680
Do you think you can stop it?

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,510
The incredible massacre...

204
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,310
that's about to happen in this town.

205
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Are you playing the lotto again?

206
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,000
Your husband is about to go to work and sweat for you.

207
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,330
Don't act so high and mighty when you don't
even make that much money to begin with.

208
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,170
What?

209
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,750
If I don't win the lottery, our future is pretty bleak.

210
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,250
Make some more money!

211
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,800
Honey.

212
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,630
What do you want now?

213
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,640
Honey.

214
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,510
What is it?!

215
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,930
I won it.

216
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,350
What?

217
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,480
The lotto!

218
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,150
Give it back!

219
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,480
Where did you put my bike?

220
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,900
Give it back!

221
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,820
Shut up!

222
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,320
I don't know what happened to your bike.

223
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,360
But we just got back from throwing away some trash.

224
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,370
Throwing away some trash?

225
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,790
We just left it out west by the vampire's house.

226
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,500
The vampire?

227
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,710
If you want it back, go out there by yourself.

228
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,380
We're not responsible for whatever happens to you.

229
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,150
Honey.

230
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,860
So no one came to visit?

231
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,030
Use the chain.

232
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,450
So...

233
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,240
Yes?

234
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,620
Are you sure you have the right numbers?

235
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,660
I've checked them over and over again.

236
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,000
I really won the lotto.

237
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,300
20 million marks.

238
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,050
What are we going to do, honey?

239
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,090
I went to the next town.

240
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,180
Eh?

241
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,850
Honey, those are...!

242
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,020
Just in case.

243
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,640
It's dangerous to just carry around that kind of money.

244
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,810
As long as no one knows we have it, we won't need these.

245
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,490
What's wrong?

246
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,360
No one knows the numbers you used, do they?

247
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,870
Well, the truth is when I bought the ticket...

248
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,750
like always...

249
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,580
Here you go.

250
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,090
You never win, do you, Mrs. Hennig?

251
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,210
I think I will this time though.

252
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,590
You know your husband doesn't
approve of your lotto fever.

253
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,850
You should use my birthday as your numbers.

254
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,230
1945, March 2nd.

255
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,810
I bet you'll win then.

256
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,730
I hit it big at the races twice with those numbers.

257
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,240
Sure, thanks.

258
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,700
D-Don't tell me Conrad's birthday is what won.

259
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,330
If he looked at the numbers in the newspaper...

260
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,090
He doesn't know if you used his numbers or not though.

261
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,710
I don't know.

262
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,430
There might be rumors going around town.

263
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,720
N-Now that you mention it...

264
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,430
Wh-What?

265
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,350
When I was coming home, I stopped
at the store for some cigarettes.

266
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,600
The girl from the sausage stand was staring at me.

267
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,860
Ah! They all know!

268
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,320
When I went to take out the trash,

269
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,820
the drunk out back...

270
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,320
was staring at me intensely!

271
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,950
If that alcoholic heard that we have
money, I don't know what he'll do!

272
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,790
Calm down.

273
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,330
But...

274
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,120
We have to protect ourselves.

275
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,770
The vampire's house.

276
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,580
It's dead.

277
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,100
Is someone here?

278
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,520
It looks like...

279
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,530
he hasn't been here for a while.

280
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,700
It's all incomplete.

281
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,490
Did he just stop painting?

282
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,330
Or can he not paint anymore?

283
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,790
Hey, it's Wim.

284
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,300
Mr. Neumeyer. Mr. Lunge.

285
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,380
What are you doing there?

286
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,630
I came looking for my bike.

287
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,800
My friends left my bike here.

288
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,470
So your friends pulled a prank on you.

289
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,350
I saw your bike in a bush near the
entrance of the mountain pass.

290
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,530
It looks like that cat was shot with a submachine-gun.

291
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,320
So they're already here.

292
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,580
Yes, they're close.

293
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,960
Look.

294
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,880
A picture of the twins.

295
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,090
And this one...

296
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,430
And this one...

297
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,050
And this one...

298
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,140
And this one...

299
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,390
And this one...

300
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,100
And this one...

301
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,360
They're about 10 years old.

302
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,910
When I was on Tenma's case, they were about 10 years old.

303
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,530
So were these painted back then?

304
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,040
How many of these are there?

305
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,170
No matter how many he drew,

306
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,210
it was never enough.

307
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,260
My, my.

308
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,130
There are quite a lot of vines this year.

309
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,850
I'm worried about this year's lingonberries.

310
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,570
I haven't seen you before.

311
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:43,170
<i>Yes... Gazing at what is known now in this world...</i>

312
00:22:44,260 --> 00:23:00,570
<i>Yes... Your eyes believe in kindness...</i>

313
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,650
<i>Make it home... to your land of harmony...</i>

314
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:34,130
<i>Make it home... to your land of purity...</i>

315
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,570
The Peaceful House
