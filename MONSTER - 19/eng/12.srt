1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,770
Those two were really alone
before they came here...

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,040
When they were taken into custody
near the border of Czechoslovakia,

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,710
they were holding hands
as they walked.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,570
They both were shivering in the cold...

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,720
I heard that the conditions of the
orphanages in the east side were horrible...

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,920
We're not like 511 Kinderheim.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,990
Huh...?

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,970
Inge, the bathroom isn't that way...

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,470
Okay? See?

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,110
Mommy...

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,580
It's all right. It's all right...
There's nothing to be afraid of.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,450
Now... you can go to the bathroom
by yourself, can't you?

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,960
Those kids really did not know
a parent's love.

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,970
You only need love in order to
develop as a person...

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,310
As you say, the orphanages
of the east side were quite horrible.

16
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,250
Even this place was once referred to
as Orphanage 47.

17
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,820
But we did what we could so
we wouldn't be controlled

18
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,050
by the government,
even just a little,

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,090
in order to avoid
becoming like 511 Kinderheim.

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,990
It was a special orphanage
run by both

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,620
the Ministry of Health and Welfare
and the Ministry of the Interior.

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,770
But you know what that means?

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,200
No...

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,140
The real state of affairs
were being managed by

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,470
the Ministry of the Interior.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,310
That place was... Old East Germany's
experimental laboratory...

27
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,980
A Little Experiment

28
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,920
Experimental laboratory?!

29
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,760
They were running a project
that would turn the children

30
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,200
into perfect soldiers...

31
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,330
Psychological reconstruction...

32
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,570
Research on modifying humans...

33
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,040
They made the orphans
join factions and

34
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,020
observed as they fought each other...

35
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,720
It was an experiment to create cold,
merciless humans...

36
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,460
Can you imagine what these children
would be like when they grew up?

37
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,800
But right now, there's no way to prove
that was happening...

38
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,370
All the data was burned
right before the Wall came down...

39
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,280
The people from
the Ministry of the Interior

40
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,250
who were involved with
the Project escaped.

41
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:35,080
But I heard there is one person
who was able to gloss his record

42
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,590
and remain in this country...

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
He was the person
who was overseeing

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,930
the devilish project
that was 511 Kinderheim.

45
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,400
He was actually
a pediatric psychiatrist

46
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,840
affiliated with
the Ministry of the Interior...

47
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,380
Officially, he was a district official from
the Ministry of Health and Welfare...

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,510
District official from
the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

49
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,450
Inge, are you done
using the bathroom?

50
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,730
- Yeah.
- Sweet dreams. Now then...

51
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,600
Good night...

52
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,130
Good night.

53
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,200
But all of that was covered up
by that incident...

54
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,740
That... incident?

55
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,480
What happened at 511 Kinderheim?!

56
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,440
It seems like I've talked
a little too much...

57
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,550
It made me remember
such awful things.

58
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,450
Please! Please tell me what
happened there!

59
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,890
Where's my soccer ball?

60
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,530
Huh?

61
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,860
Where's my...
Where's my soccer ball?

62
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,540
Oh...

63
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,270
Here you go.
It's right here.

64
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,610
But hold off on soccer
until your wounds have healed.

65
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,680
That man said he was going to come
to pick you up soon, so rest until then.

66
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know what really happened...

67
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,230
The East German government at
the time placed a strict gag order on it.

68
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,840
It all began with the mysterious death
of the director of 511 Kinderheim.

69
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,480
Soon after, there was
a power struggle among

70
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,950
the instructors over
the director's position...

71
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,510
The orphanage was
thrown into anarchy...

72
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,350
The children's internal strife
couldn't be controlled...

73
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,020
It's amazing that Johan
made it out of there.

74
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,020
And?! What happened to
511 Kinderheim?!

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,860
Everyone died...

76
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,230
Wha...?

77
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,060
All the members of the orphanage,
including the instructors

78
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,200
killed each other off in there.

79
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,450
<i>It's a big lie that the world is dark.</i>

80
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,880
<i>Tomorrow will be a good day.</i>

81
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,790
Dieter.

82
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,030
You're going home.

83
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,150
Say...

84
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,450
Mr. Hartmann, aren't we going home?

85
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,480
No... let's take a detour...

86
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,650
I-I don't want to go there...

87
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,470
No! No!

88
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,510
Dieter...

89
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,070
Dieter, you're a good boy, aren't you?

90
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,310
What?!

91
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,120
I told you not to hand over Dieter
until I returned!

92
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,790
B-But...

93
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,030
That person
was that child's foster parent...

94
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,260
He was also quite the gentleman...

95
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,200
Much more of a gentleman
than you are.

96
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,710
Uhh...

97
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,240
Well...

98
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,010
But that man...

99
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,220
Besides, that boy
wanted to go with him.

100
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,980
Dieter!

101
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,840
Dieter!

102
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,520
Dieter?

103
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,020
They haven't returned?

104
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,820
Hartmann's study?

105
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,270
It seems that they were
taken at different times,

106
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,070
but were all taken at the same place.

107
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,270
Where is this place?

108
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,490
Johan...

109
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,020
Who's the man in the photo with him?

110
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,070
I see... All the photographs
were taken at 511 Kinderheim...

111
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,200
About ten years ago up until now...

112
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,750
<i>All the members of the orphanage,
including the instructors,</i>

113
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,680
<i>killed each other off in there.</i>

114
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,340
Dieter...

115
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,320
Could it be...?!

116
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,760
Dieter!

117
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,290
Dieter, hold on! I'm coming!

118
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,940
It seems that this boy can't see it...

119
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,810
Hartmann!

120
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:05,480
This boy can't see what Johan saw
from here back then...

121
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,780
It's no good... It's no good again...

122
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,950
This boy isn't Johan either.

123
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,770
Everyone... Everyone died...

124
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,000
Ten years ago...

125
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,210
The instructors and the orphans...

126
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,050
All fifty of them died...

127
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,660
Johan... watched it...

128
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,060
He watched it from here.

129
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,170
Johan... just watched it.

130
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,410
I asked Johan...

131
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,110
"What...

132
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,090
What did you do?"

133
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,230
He replied...

134
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,500
"I just dropped
a piece of oil-soaked cloth

135
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,300
in into the fire like this..."

136
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,080
What do you think?

137
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Do you know what this means?

138
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,580
"Hatred is created
when people gather.

139
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,280
I just poured a little oil on it..."

140
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,120
That's what he said.

141
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,830
A boy, just 10 years old.

142
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,290
And he pulled it off!

143
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,170
He had fifty people kill each other
without moving a finger.

144
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,210
Your...

145
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,000
Your experiments turned him into
that kind of person!

146
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,940
We did?

147
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,880
No...

148
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,680
Not at all...

149
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,740
Not at all...

150
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,120
Huh?

151
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,080
511 Kinderheim was indeed
an experimental ground.

152
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,520
It was a project to raise orphans
to become perfect soldiers.

153
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,090
Thinking back on it now,
it was such a small experiment...

154
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,440
And what about Johan?
Him, a soldier?

155
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,630
Not at all...

156
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,340
He was a born leader!

157
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,740
He was someone who was
meant to stand at the top.

158
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
There's no way we could create
such a work of art!

159
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,090
He was superhuman
from the beginning...

160
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,890
He was a monstrous being!

161
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:07,460
He foretold that everyone would
end up hating and killing each other.

162
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,400
What do you think Johan's goal was?

163
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,460
He said...

164
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,800
"To be the last person remaining
in this world..."

165
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,520
Dieter... The future is dark...

166
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,130
You've got to become even just
a little more like Johan...

167
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,770
But...

168
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,410
Why is it no good?

169
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,550
Why can't you be like Johan?!

170
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,280
Stop, Hartmann!

171
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,880
I'll shoot you if you
harm him any more!

172
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,590
Get out!

173
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,260
This is our problem.

174
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,100
Get out.

175
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,130
Dieter!

176
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,530
Come down from there!

177
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,290
Dr. Tenma!

178
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,570
You want to know about Johan,
don't you?

179
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,950
What are you going to do
once you do?

180
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,620
I think it's impossible to
find and kill him.

181
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,790
Fine...

182
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,760
I'll tell you one piece of information.

183
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,560
In exchange, once you hear it,
leave us alone.

184
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,250
Look for General Wolf. He's the one
who first discovered Johan's skill.

185
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,310
He should be alive somewhere.

186
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,980
Is he the man from the photograph
in your study?

187
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
Is he the man in the photograph
with Johan?

188
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,220
He's the one who brought Johan to us.

189
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,990
He should know something.

190
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,930
Now... get going.

191
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,070
Dieter!

192
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,210
Decide for yourself if you're
coming down from there!

193
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,140
There's nothing to worry about!

194
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,780
I'll shoot Hartmann if he puts
his finger on the rifle's trigger!

195
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,620
Dieter!

196
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,390
Decide for yourself!
Make your own decision!

197
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,430
There's no way you'd leave me,
would you... Dieter?

198
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,970
Because you're my child...

199
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,610
That's how it is, Dr. Tenma.

200
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,480
Now leave.

201
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,550
Dieter...

202
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,870
That's right... it's all right...

203
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,540
That's good... Slowly... Slowly...

204
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,920
Dieter... come back.

205
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,080
My dear Dieter...

206
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,590
Dieter!

207
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,390
Do you think that you can live
without me, Dieter?!

208
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,300
Stop, Hartmann! If you move,
I'll shoot!

209
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,130
I love you!

210
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,800
Dieter!

211
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,770
The world is dark!

212
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,170
Tomorrow is dark!

213
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,380
Tenma told me that tomorrow
will be a good day.

214
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,780
Dieter!

215
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,830
Be strong!

216
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,290
Don't be afraid!

217
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,470
Dieter!

218
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,110
Dieter!

219
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,000
Dieter...

220
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,980
Dieter...

221
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,690
Dieter...

222
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,070
Now did you get that?

223
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Get on the bus here and get off
at Keunen Street...

224
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,840
The orphanage is right there.

225
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,940
Give this to Elna Tyce...
She's an instructor there.

226
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,610
She looks scary,
but she's a very nice lady.

227
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,650
Take care...

228
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,490
I can't stay in this town.

229
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,420
We part ways here.

230
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,390
A bus will come
in two or three minutes...

231
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,130
See you later.

232
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,260
Good luck with soccer.

233
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,450
No, you can't come with me...

234
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
Here.

235
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,160
Dieter.

236
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,220
I'm telling you that you
can't come with me!

237
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,260
You can't... come with me...

238
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,530
Petra and Schumann
