1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,250
Is this it, the bandits' fortress?

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,060
That's right.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,560
Our first major mission as the Jaegers 
is to bring this place down.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,940
What's our strategy?

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,900
Justice should boldly launch

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,480
an up-front attack!

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,150
Um, why am I here, too?

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,630
You're a backup Jaeger member.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,850
Observing their operation will be good for you.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>The one who killed Sheele!</i>

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,670
<i>I have to control myself.</i>

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,690
<i>Just like Bro said...</i>

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,300
<i>Simply being hot-headed won't help.</i>

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,400
<i>I have to get myself out of here,</i>

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,980
<i>and relay this information to everyone.</i>

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,990
<i>Wait a second...</i>

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,690
<i>Isn't this a perfect chance to escape?</i>

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>There's no way I can get away!</i>

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,830
You have some nerve, attacking the front entrance!

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,290
Coro, number five.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,270
Kill them!

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,880
<i>Judgment of the Ten Kings...</i>

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,010
<i>Enma's Spear of Justice!</i>

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,340
Next!

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,970
Number seven!

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,850
<i>Mount Taizan Cannon of Justice!</i>

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,100
Heh, I created those weapons, you know?

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,640
God's Hands: the Perfector...

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,900
They increase my speed and 
precision by a hundredfold.

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,860
They are the most stylish of the Imperial Arms!

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,840
After we're done, I'll reassemble and play with you,

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,890
my little dolls.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,310
Hey, no need to thank me.

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,550
We're a team, aren't we?

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,380
I knew he was there.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,590
Seriously?

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,260
The Imperial Arms flamethrower,

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,020
Purgatory's Invitation: Rubicante.

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,190
This, too, is part of the job.

40
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,770
What?

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,070
An angel?

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,410
The winged Imperial Arms,

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,700
Thousand-Mile Flight: Mastema.

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,580
I won't let any of you escape.

45
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,720
Kill the Temptation

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Kill the Temptation

47
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,420
Incredible.

48
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,060
Tatsumi...

49
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,730
I shall train you myself.

50
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,100
Eventually, you'll be able to do that much.

51
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,680
You're rather kind.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,820
Am I different than what you expected?

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,460
To be honest, this is my first time 
experiencing these feelings...

54
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,270
Being in love.

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,370
But it isn't bad.

56
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,230
<i>Could it be possible</i>

57
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,540
<i>that I could convince her to be our ally?</i>

58
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,590
<i>This person...</i>

59
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,860
<i>Her previous actions can't be forgiven.</i>

60
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,900
<i>But she could devote herself to overthrowing 
the capital as an act of contrition.</i>

61
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,150
<i>A-All right...</i>

62
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,390
<i>I'll try to persuade her tonight!</i>

63
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,400
<i>It's time I stepped up as a man!</i>

64
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,470
<i>How did I end up in this situation again?</i>

65
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,370
<i>No good, no good!</i>

66
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,620
<i>If I'm nervous, what good am I?</i>

67
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,220
<i>I have to convince her to be our ally.</i>

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,350
<i>Just do it...</i>

69
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,980
<i>I am a ferocious man!</i>

70
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,930
<i>I won't be overpowered!</i>

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,240
Sorry for making you wait.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,350
N-Not at all!

73
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,490
Would you like a drink?

74
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,830
Uh, no... I'm fine, yeah.

75
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,170
Hmm? Are you nervous?

76
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,400
No!

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,080
You really are a cute one.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,200
Well, I'm not quite sure what to 
do in this situation, either.

79
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,540
But I'm sure we'll figure it out, 
as long as we know what we want.

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,050
Uh, um...

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,790
I'd like to ask you something.

82
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,900
Well...

83
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,080
Esdeath, you like me, don't you?

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,550
If I didn't like you, I wouldn't be doing this.

85
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,640
Th-Then I'd like for you to hear my request!

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,720
Oh? What is it? Tell me.

87
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,390
Say it clearly, so I can hear you.

88
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,380
As it is now, I hate the capital.

89
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,030
It's natural that many people to feel that way.

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,900
What of it?

91
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,200
If I'm to fight, I don't want to fight for it.

92
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,480
In fact, I've considered joining 
the Revolutionary Army.

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,570
Will you come to fight beside me, 
in the Revolutionary Army?

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,670
That way, the casualties and 
harm done would decrease.

95
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,540
Tatsumi...

96
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,340
What the hell are you thinking, saying that 
to a general of the capital's army?

97
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,020
I realize my words sound irrational...

98
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,050
But if we continue like this, 
we might end up as enemies.

99
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,620
You don't have to worry about that.

100
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,560
All you have to do is stay here with me.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,380
I understand that you've endured a lot in the past.

102
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,980
But from now on, I won't let anything harm you.

103
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,220
And I won't take any other lovers.

104
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,170
I consider you my only man.

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,320
And I won't ever let you feel lonely.

106
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,890
I'm happy you feel that way about me,

107
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,290
but it's no good.

108
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,400
It isn't just about my happiness.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,040
Is it your family?

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,230
I'll have them placed under my protection.

111
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,760
It isn't that...

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,220
I want a kingdom where everyone can 
live their lives as they see fit.

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,560
And when the capital is as rotten as 
it is here, that can't happen.

114
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,770
Tatsumi...

115
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,140
Y-You understand, don't you?

116
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,440
I do not understand.

117
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,770
I cannot understand how the weak feel.

118
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,920
The universal law is survival of the fittest.

119
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,570
The weak are eliminated by natural selection.

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,630
Those who die are weak.

121
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,740
Th-There's no way I could possibly love 
someone who thinks that way!

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,100
If you truly have feelings for me,

123
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,290
I beg you to change your principles!

124
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,910
<i>Even that expression is nice.</i>

125
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,960
However...

126
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,000
That won't happen.

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,530
Don't misunderstand our situation!

128
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,460
You aren't the one who will change me.

129
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,620
You are the one I shall change.

130
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,840
That is the only outcome!

131
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,350
Just because you want me to, 
it isn't as if I can change, either!

132
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,810
Even if you torture me.

133
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,300
Heh, so stubborn.

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,640
<i>Perhaps that's exactly why</i>

135
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,150
<i>he can smile like that.</i>

136
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,570
<i>I want to see that smile again.</i>

137
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,780
<i>And those feelings...</i>

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,780
<i>I want to possess all of him.</i>

139
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,450
<i>In that case...</i>

140
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,410
Well, I'm sure you're tired after today.

141
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,140
We'll discuss this again later.

142
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,100
For now, let's rest.

143
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,000
Huh?

144
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,580
Then, I'll take that sofa over there and—

145
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,670
I won't do anything tonight, so just 
sleep in the bed with me.

146
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,630
O-Oh, yeah...

147
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,050
I'm gonna go take a shower!

148
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,170
This goes without saying.

149
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,260
If you cause a scene within these walls 
or try to run, it will mean your death.

150
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
So don't try anything silly.

151
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,660
I understand.

152
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,940
<i>Everyone in Night Raid also warned me</i>

153
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,440
<i>that the palace was extremely dangerous.</i>

154
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,650
Maybe we should have showered together.

155
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,970
<i>Well, there's no need to rush...</i>

156
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,920
That said, Tatsumi will not only 
be a backup for the Jaegers,

157
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,910
but my lover, as well.

158
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,640
Among the members here,

159
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,750
do any of you have a spouse or significant other?

160
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,380
Huh?!

161
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,920
Is that true, Mr. Bols?

162
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,110
Yep, I've been married for six years.

163
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,470
She's so perfect, I can't believe she's with me!

164
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,160
Then I must ask, Bols...

165
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,550
What should I do in order to 
capture Tatsumi's heart?

166
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,420
The trick to capturing your beloved's heart...

167
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,660
Never give up!

168
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,350
I, myself, was rejected twice...

169
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,520
But I got another chance, and that's 
when she finally became mine!

170
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Bear in mind that it does take some time.

171
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,840
Hmm... I see.

172
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,990
<i>Bols did say that...</i>

173
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,370
<i>You'll fall for me, Tatsumi.</i>

174
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,320
<i>This kind of plan is new and fun.</i>

175
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,450
Hey!

176
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,110
Did you get some rest last night...

177
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,620
Guess not, huh?

178
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,930
I was so nervous, I couldn't 
sleep through the night.

179
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,170
She said she wouldn't do anything,

180
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,430
but when I opened my eyes, 
she was using me as a body pillow.

181
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,410
Isn't it a bit early for snacks, Kurome?

182
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,030
Mind your own business.

183
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,650
If you had more seafood, it'd be better for you.

184
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,820
Then I'd stink like the ocean. Like you.

185
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,610
Huh? Seriously?

186
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,570
Do I smell?

187
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,700
No... Not really, I think.

188
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,860
<i>What is this?</i>

189
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,480
<i>The way she looks...</i>

190
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,900
<i>And even her name, Kurome...</i>

191
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,910
<i>I have a feeling of intense déjà vu.</i>

192
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,520
You can't have any.

193
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,330
<i>A-And this gluttony...</i>

194
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,940
<i>There's no mistake, she's just like Akame!</i>

195
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,380
<i>She has something to do with Akame!</i>

196
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,320
What?

197
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Uh, this may be rude,

198
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,820
but you look a lot like that girl, Akame, 
from the wanted posters.

199
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,760
Oh, I was thinking the same thing.

200
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,640
Yeah. She was my relative and an 
honored member of society.

201
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,520
But then she betrayed the capital.

202
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,540
I really want to see her again...

203
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,150
So that

204
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,210
I can kill her with my own hands.

205
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,110
After all, she is my beloved older sister.

206
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,240
Tatsumi, we're heading to Mount Fake.

207
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,240
We'll be hunting for the next few days.

208
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,710
What's Mount Fake?

209
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,670
Mount Fake is Fake Mountain, of course.

210
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,630
<i>We're going to the outskirts. 
This is my chance to escape!</i>

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,790
Wave and Kurome, you'll be joining us.

212
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,180
We'll hunt Danger Beasts, while keeping 
an eye out for enemies.

213
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,880
Roger.

214
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,650
Kurome and I will take the east side until dusk.

215
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,060
Wave and Tatsumi will scout the west side.

216
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,790
In the evening, we'll switch.

217
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,100
And Tatsumi will be with me.

218
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,480
<i>Upper-level Danger Beasts appear at night.</i>

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,360
<i>It will be a good chance to impress him.</i>

220
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,740
I couldn't say this back at the palace,

221
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,450
but you sure have it rough.

222
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,210
If you ever wanna talk, I'll listen.

223
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,960
Thanks.

224
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,710
But I should be okay.

225
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,120
I'm used to this treatment and taking orders.

226
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,370
I know sort of what you mean.

227
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,290
Actually, I feel we're pretty similar.

228
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,970
Similar?

229
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,770
How so?

230
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,330
Huh?

231
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,980
Well, uh... How should I put this?

232
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,650
I feel that we've encountered 
the same kinds of problems.

233
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,980
Or that maybe we're going to encounter 
the same kinds of issues...

234
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,210
Uh, yeah, I understand.

235
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,360
I pretty much get it, so you don't have to explain.

236
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,950
Anyway, since we're so similar, 
I'm sure we'll get along—

237
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
Tatsumi?

238
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,170
Huh?

239
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,400
Watch out!

240
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,710
Thanks, I owe you one!

241
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,540
Don't mention it!

242
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,670
<i>Huh?</i>

243
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,550
<i>I instinctively moved and saved him,</i>

244
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,340
<i>but this is my chance to escape.</i>

245
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,180
So you're all showing up now, huh?

246
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,410
Unlike sea beasts, it seems you aren't edible.

247
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,310
We'll take care of this in no time!

248
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,980
Heh, that's it?

249
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,860
Looks like you're done over there, too.

250
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,820
Tatsumi?

251
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,320
Hmm? Huh?

252
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,690
<i>Normally, it'd be impossible to get 
away from an Imperial Arms user.</i>

253
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,540
<i>However...</i>

254
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,660
<i>Since I have an Imperial Arms 
myself, it's a different story.</i>

255
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,250
Tatsumi!

256
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,250
Where'd you go?

257
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,500
<i>Don't tell me he ran away!</i>

258
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,950
This is bad!

259
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,570
I get how you feel, but I can't let you do that!

260
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,350
I don't wanna die, either! You know?

261
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,310
I guess I have no choice...

262
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,980
<i>Grand Chariot!</i>

263
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,940
<i>I should be fine this far away.</i>

264
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,320
<i>There's no way he could come after me.</i>

265
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,760
<i>Wh-What?</i>

266
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,710
<i>The same type?</i>

267
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,070
<i>An armored Imperial Arms?</i>

268
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,870
Hey, you...

269
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,580
Seems I've run into a big catch.

270
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,040
I know that Imperial Arms, Incursio.

271
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,690
It's the prototype for my Grand Chariot.

272
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,400
And above all,

273
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,430
that you wear it means that 
you're part of Night Raid!

274
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,900
<i>Change of plans...</i>

275
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,090
<i>The Night Raid member before me takes 
precedence over finding Tatsumi.</i>

276
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,400
<i>He's strong...</i>

277
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,040
<i>I was told that mine was an enhanced 
version of his Incursio.</i>

278
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,570
<i>But I can't lower my guard.</i>

279
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,790
<i>This guy... Is it Wave?</i>

280
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,790
<i>Or a different pursuer?</i>

281
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,580
<i>Regardless...</i>

282
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,490
Huh?

283
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,850
<i>If Esdeath shows up, it'd be really bad!</i>

284
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,120
<i>I have to get out of here fast.</i>

285
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,490
I won't let you get away.

286
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,190
Accept your fate, and face me!

287
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,390
Stop!

288
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,050
I have no reason to fight you!

289
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,470
Even if you don't...

290
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,220
I have my reason, Night Raid member!

291
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,310
I've read up on you.

292
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,620
Indiscriminately carrying out assassinations...

293
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,640
You're the evil that threatens the 
capital's safety and peace.

294
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,400
On top of that, I hear you're 
related to the rebel army.

295
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,820
I can't forgive your very existence!

296
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,020
You're wrong.

297
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,040
It's true that we commit murder.

298
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,040
However, I'm...

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,740
No, we're...

300
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,540
not evil!

301
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,920
<i>He's coming.</i>

302
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,870
Being fired-up won't keep you alive!

303
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,370
<i>That's right...</i>

304
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,970
<i>I have to get out of here, no matter what.</i>

305
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,260
<i>And return with this information.</i>

306
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,350
If you refuse to fight, this battle 
will be rather one-sided!

307
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,060
<i>This isn't good!</i>

308
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,890
<i>Grand Fall!</i>

309
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>A perfect hit.</i>

310
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,150
<i>It's too bad that I kicked him into the river.</i>

311
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,760
<i>But I won't lose sight of—</i>

312
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,110
<i>He isn't there?</i>

313
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,620
<i>Where is he?</i>

314
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,700
<i>He rode the current and swam away?</i>

315
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,660
<i>That won't work against a man of the sea!</i>

316
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,610
<i>I got away without having to fight...</i>

317
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,290
<i>And it appears he can't turn invisible.</i>

318
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,080
<i>That last kick was really powerful.</i>

319
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,910
<i>If I hadn't absorbed it, I would have died.</i>

320
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,740
<i>But now, I can finally return...</i>

321
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,950
<i>A Danger Beast?</i>

322
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,450
<i>What bad timing!</i>

323
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,920
<i>It's no use.</i>

324
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,200
<i>I've taken too much damage... I can't fight.</i>

325
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,630
<i>It's gonna kill me!</i>

326
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,880
A-Akame?

327
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,840
Tatsumi, are you all right?

328
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,440
Why are you here?

329
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,350
We've been watching you from a distance.

330
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,220
I see...

331
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,340
All that just for me.

332
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,010
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,760
You had to come to my rescue again...

334
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,190
I'll always come to save you.

335
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,240
After all, we're friends.

336
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,560
Thanks.

337
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,350
What's wrong?

338
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,340
I just felt so relieved, seeing your face.

339
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,410
Welcome back, Tatsumi.

340
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah, I'm back.

341
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,550
Bam!

342
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,980
We should get outta here first, right?

343
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,390
Come on, this way!

344
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,890
Lubbock, thanks for coming.

345
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,200
Yeah, well...

346
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,070
It was kinda my fault for suggesting 
you enter the tournament...

347
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,150
And with you gone, I'd have been the only man.

348
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,900
I would've had a harem, so it 
wouldn't have been too bad...

349
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,410
That's harsh.

350
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,270
He says stuff like that, but he was really worried.

351
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,870
Yeah, I know.

352
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,550
<i>Night Raid...</i>

353
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,180
<i>This is truly where I belong.</i>

354
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,300
Um, how do I say this?

355
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm deeply sorry.

356
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,550
I've reflected on my actions!

357
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,800
Being distracted and letting Tatsumi 
escape was bad enough.

358
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,840
But furthermore... Letting Night 
Raid escape was deplorable.

359
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,440
Kurome, stone.

360
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,240
Wave, you are skilled, but your mind is weak.

361
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,310
Own up to your mistakes.

362
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,320
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,450
If you fail again,

364
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,910
I shall personally administer your punishment.

365
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,780
Keep that in mind.

366
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,870
Yes, ma'am.

367
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,780
Captain!

368
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,240
My apologies!

369
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,090
Even Coro couldn't track either one!

370
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,650
Hecatoncheir is mainly for battle.

371
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,970
Don't worry about it.

372
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,930
And what about Stylish?

373
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,270
He still hasn't contacted me.

374
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,240
That wasn't much of a hope.

375
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,850
Captain, regarding Tatsumi...

376
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,790
If he were to resurface as our enemy,

377
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,690
how should we handle him?

378
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,860
To be honest, I love Tatsumi, even now.

379
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,820
Perhaps the feeling is intensified because 
he's no longer within my reach.

380
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,300
However, my subordinates' lives take priority.

381
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,390
Capturing him alive would be ideal.

382
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,210
But life or death shouldn't be in question.

383
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,820
Understood.

384
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,840
If he's tainted by evil, we have no choice.

385
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,840
<i>If you are killed, that's as far 
as you could grow as a man.</i>

386
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
<i>But you aren't that weak.</i>

387
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,640
<i>You have the will to survive.</i>

388
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,780
<i>It's quite strange.</i>

389
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,730
<i>I truly feel I'll see you again, Tatsumi...</i>

390
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,570
<i>No, I shall make it so we meet again.</i>

391
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,870
<i>And when that time comes, you won't 
be able to resist these feelings.</i>

392
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,080
<i>Brace yourself, Tatsumi.</i>

393
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,660
And that's what I saw of the Jaegers' strength.

394
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,280
Damn, so they really are all Imperial Arms users!

395
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,380
This is gonna be tough...

396
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,840
And for Kurome to be a member...

397
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,160
Why didn't you escape the capital together?

398
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,590
I invited her, of course.

399
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,270
But my sister chose to stay.

400
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,110
From her perspective,

401
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,770
I am the traitor.

402
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,230
<i>So that time with Zank, 
her hallucination was of Kurome.</i>

403
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,330
And? How strong were they individually?

404
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,120
Individually, the Jaegers are 
about as strong as we are.

405
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,040
However...

406
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,950
Esdeath... She's on a different level.

407
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,750
Honestly, if I faced her now, I doubt I'd win.

408
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,750
Esdeath is indeed powerful.

409
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,880
But she has a weakness.

410
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,250
And that is?

411
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,430
That she's alive.

412
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,260
She has a heart and a pulse.

413
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,010
Given that,

414
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,950
I'll slay her.

415
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,270
Even if she is the most powerful in the capital!

416
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,450
I'll respect the fact that you tried to erase 
your scent to prevent being tracked,

417
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,520
but those efforts are useless against 
the enhanced soldiers I've created.

418
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,510
From the start, I knew he was suspicious.

419
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,240
For a simple blacksmith, he was far too 
good at adapting to that environment.

420
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,240
Bingo!

421
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,790
Totally found Night Raid's hideout.

422
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill the Mad Scientist
