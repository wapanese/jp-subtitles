1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,680
Even after thorough searching,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,430
how are we still unable to find their hideout?

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,340
Well, Kyoroch is a pretty big place.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,480
And people here are religious and peaceful,

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,200
so we can't easily force 
them out into the open.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,700
Here.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,790
They're so cute...

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,790
These children have yet to be tainted by evil!

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,500
I see, so she has another side.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,970
She's been tense for a while.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,220
The captain told her to loosen up a bit.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,850
Hold up, you're hanging out, 
like you're one of us...

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,800
But are you?

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,330
Hmm, more like a helping hand?

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,610
And it's a chance for me to be ordered 
around by General Esdeath.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,330
<i>What am I sensing?</i>

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,740
<i>It's the same feeling I got from Stylish.</i>

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,700
Everyone, play fair, be decent, 
and get along with one another.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,090
Okay!

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,500
The joy of a child choosing the path of justice!

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,630
This morality, this justice...

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,180
I have to protect it.

23
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,980
And that's all the information from our spies.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,980
Kill the Fate

25
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,480
Kill the Fate

26
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,020
We're executing our plans during the religious 
organization's anniversary festival.

27
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,210
Ah, how flashy.

28
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,190
We'll slip into the festival crowds, 
sneak into the palace,

29
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,230
and take down Borick.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,120
<i>It's finally time.</i>

31
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,330
This will signal the Revolutionary Army to rise up.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,740
Failure is not an option!

33
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,250
Everyone, it's time to eat.

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,830
Today, I gave it all I had.

35
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,840
I hope you're all prepared!

36
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah!

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,510
Salt ramen for Najenda. With al dente noodles

38
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,060
and umami from the chicken 
and salt, I'm confident.

39
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,760
Whoa...

40
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,250
Strawberry parfait for Mine.

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,680
I've even added some secret ingredients.

42
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,640
Oh, my.

43
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,970
The super fresh pandalid shrimp 
is for you, Lubbock.

44
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,600
Wow.

45
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,210
Oden with chilled, high-end, 
local sake for Leone.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,660
An assortment of all the meat 
I could get, for Akame.

47
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,840
It's marinated in my special sauce.

48
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,990
Tatsumi said he'd be fine with anything,

49
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,850
so here's my ultra-special Susanoo lunch plate.

50
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,580
Huh?

51
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,520
This is a kid's plate.

52
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,940
I had Susanoo make all your favorites.

53
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,750
Eat your fill, so you can maintain your energy.

54
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,670
And you're all already eating...

55
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,380
It's good that you're full of energy.

56
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,360
Yum. It's so sweet.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,460
Delicious.

58
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,010
Tatsumi, wanna try some?

59
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,560
Tatsumi, what do we do when 
my sake cup is empty?

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Okay, okay. I'll pour some more.

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,980
Good, good... That's a good boy, Tatsumi!

62
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,730
Huh? Done already?

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,870
The food was incredible, as always, Su.

64
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,650
Yeah... We couldn't live 
without you anymore, Su.

65
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,290
That is nice to hear.

66
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,950
However, Tatsumi...

67
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,370
You left a grain of rice!

68
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,210
It's distracting me.

69
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,420
If he weren't this anal retentive, 
he'd be perfect.

70
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,040
If Night Raid were to attack, it will be today.

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,940
That's obvious, right, Seryu?

72
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,990
Miss Suzuka, please do not let any rebels enter.

73
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,730
Right, right.

74
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,410
Oh?

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,560
That walk and that gleam in her eye...

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,700
Seems you couldn't conceal yourself completely.

77
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,200
Damn, they're already looking for us.

78
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,060
It doesn't seem like they'd 
follow us all the way here.

79
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,090
But now we're farther from the city.

80
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,540
I wonder if that served as a diversion.

81
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,780
Now we just have to believe all the 
other bosses will do their part.

82
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,090
I feel like my face is still a mess...

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,180
Did all that makeup come off?

84
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,980
It's off...

85
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,600
Why are you all bashful?

86
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,480
Don't tell me you took that whole 
"red string of fate" thing seriously.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,410
No way...

88
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,710
The fact you'd bring that up means you're 
the one who took it seriously!

89
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,440
Huh? That's not funny.

90
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,850
And if the red string of fate were to tie us,

91
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,750
you should have helped when 
that frog swallowed me.

92
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,100
When you're needed most, you're useless!

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,120
Shut up...

94
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
I was completely tied up, too!

95
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,310
That woman... She's from Night Raid.

96
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,280
And worse, the person next to her is Tatsumi.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,420
He's been tainted by evil.

98
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,900
Coro, number nine!

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,860
<i>City Justice Detector.</i>

100
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,360
There are no civilians in the area.

101
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,100
Finally...

102
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,890
We meet again, Night Raid.

103
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,060
Coro and I will annihilate evil,

104
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,980
and bring down the hammer of justice!

105
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,000
Coro!

106
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,630
From the Judgement of the Ten Kings,

107
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,050
I’ll combine two, seven, and eight and 
shoot them with this annihilation device.

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,350
Tatsumi has fallen to evil, even though 
he was adored by our great captain.

109
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,560
And the little villain who took 
both my arms that night...

110
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,520
Repent in the blazing fire!

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,050
It smells like gunpowder.

112
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,200
<i>Justice...</i>

113
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,280
<i>Simultaneous Fire!</i>

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,460
So, you're still alive.

115
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,670
What a stubborn evil!

116
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,340
What's with this reckless attack?

117
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,620
Hmm...

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,930
This must mean we were drawn out 
to the city's edge on purpose.

119
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,960
How audacious.

120
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,010
There are more, Tatsumi.

121
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,110
They stopped.

122
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,650
Are we out of range?

123
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,370
I saw who it was.

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,320
It's Seryu Ubiquitous.

125
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,830
Seryu Ubiquitous...

126
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,000
Where did she shoot from?

127
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,040
The last member of the Four Rakshasa Demons!

128
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,970
I'm Suzuka.

129
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,760
But I guess there's no reason to introduce 
myself to those about to perish...

130
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,010
I'll deal with this one!

131
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,790
Get out of here, Mine!

132
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,180
Don't be stupid.

133
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,350
After being mocked like that, I can't run.

134
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,350
Ah, Tatsumi!

135
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,890
I won't let you lay a finger on Mine.

136
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,100
I'm your opponent!

137
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,150
How cool...

138
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,190
And that's fine. I'll kill you first.

139
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,650
Tatsumi!

140
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,910
Idiot...

141
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,510
I'll leave her to you.

142
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,250
I'll take on Seryu.

143
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,250
I'll finish her off, and make my way to you!

144
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,440
Coro, number six!

145
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,020
What is that?

146
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,390
That's a weapon, too?

147
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,150
How dare you rebels disrupt the system?

148
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,120
One who doesn't fight for 
justice cannot possibly win!

149
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,650
Heh, what a huge target!

150
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,260
You took down the strongest 
weapon in one shot?

151
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,130
Well, then...

152
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,790
Coro, number one!

153
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,830
I've come to personally deliver 
judgment, Night Raid.

154
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,140
Seryu Ubiquitous...

155
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,640
I'll have you eaten, just like your friends.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,600
"Friends"?

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,230
That woman whose head was put on a stake 
in Romary was your friend, right?

158
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,030
Coro ate the rest of her body.

159
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,600
Just like that woman in glasses.

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,030
They both ended up being snacks.

161
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,000
And you will, too.

162
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,540
You...

163
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,530
For someone who always talks about justice,

164
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,770
you blindly trusted Ogre and Stylish.

165
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,170
You couldn't see that they were evil.

166
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,640
And that twisted laugh of yours...

167
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,480
It's no different from those evil men.

168
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,140
You're broken.

169
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,040
I can kill you without hesitation.

170
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,650
I'll shoot you down, no matter what!

171
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,550
Feel better, now that you 
let all that nonsense out?

172
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,820
Coro, number five.

173
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,630
And your arm!

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,740
You just gave Coro time to recover.

175
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,490
Evil sure is stupid.

176
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,160
Let's go, Coro!

177
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,670
What's with this power?

178
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,460
I've been waiting for this...

179
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,840
For this battle to really become two-against-one.

180
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,540
The greater a pinch I'm in, 
the stronger my Pumpkin rifle is.

181
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,140
Coro, endure it.

182
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,680
There's no way she can keep 
up this attack for long.

183
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,470
That's true.

184
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,540
But since we fought before, 
I know where the weak spot is.

185
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,560
I won't need long.

186
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
Crap.

187
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,940
Coro, hidden ability.

188
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,950
I was waiting for that.

189
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,160
I already know all the moves 
of your Imperial Arms!

190
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,000
<i>Enma's Spear of Justice!</i>

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,040
<i>Her body is more troublesome than last time.</i>

192
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,180
<i>That artillery...</i>

193
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,100
<i>It's powerful, even though 
it isn't an Imperial Arms.</i>

194
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,400
You bitch!

195
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,940
As punishment, I'll beat you to death!

196
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,560
Because of the damage to my body...

197
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,580
Damn it. I couldn't finish her.

198
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,640
So this is the rumored shocking body, huh?

199
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,440
Your strike was too close.

200
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,730
You...

201
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,690
I was surprised to hear someone 
defeated Ibara, let alone Mez.

202
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,400
But it seems that it wasn't you.

203
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,700
I can tell how inexperienced 
you are in actual combat.

204
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,160
<i>Still too weak...</i>

205
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,480
<i>I've had so many regrets...</i>

206
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,120
<i>So many!</i>

207
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,420
<i>Even if there is a strength differential, 
I have to overcome it!</i>

208
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,140
Are you done recovering, Coro?

209
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,450
Good.

210
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,150
We'll attack from both sides simultaneously.

211
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,660
Natala... Doya!

212
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,120
Hey, Su. How's it going?

213
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,040
Smoothly.

214
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,020
We're taking care of the enemies here, as ordered.

215
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,550
I don't have time to play with you.

216
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,800
Where's my big sis?

217
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,310
Before that, allow me to rip off your 
left arm, like you did mine.

218
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,100
<i>I'm still wounded from when 
that woman tried to kill me.</i>

219
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,170
Brace yourself!

220
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,320
Your opponent

221
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,530
is me.

222
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,660
Sorry for running late, Kurome.

223
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,370
Heh, you wanna get blown away by Su again?

224
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,800
Come at me, lowly assassins.

225
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,330
I won't allow you to hurt any more of my friends.

226
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,170
<i>Grand Chariot!</i>

227
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,760
G-General Esdeath...

228
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,390
What are the Jaegers doing?

229
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,600
Shut your mouth.

230
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,680
This is happening because you 
underestimated Night Raid

231
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,820
and let the Four Rakshasa Demons play around.

232
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,510
P-Protect me.

233
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,090
That's an order from the minister—

234
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,820
Well, an order is an order.

235
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,960
I will protect you.

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,360
So don't step out of this room.

237
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,870
Y-Yes...

238
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,070
Hiding in the ruins won't do you any good.

239
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,560
Eventually, you'll run out of strength.

240
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,540
That's right, which is why I'm sorry,

241
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,170
but I'll be taking you down with brute force!

242
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,630
Rakshasa Demon...

243
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,850
Wait...

244
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,720
Th-This is too much.

245
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,670
I'll tear this place down

246
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,100
before you can escape.

247
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,330
<i>This reminds me of when,</i>

248
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,350
<i>as a half foreigner, 
I was discriminated against.</i>

249
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,300
<i>I would just stare up into the sky.</i>

250
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,710
<i>No one would help me.</i>

251
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,110
<i>And that's when I understood...</i>

252
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,700
<i>That only I could help myself.</i>

253
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,890
<i>And that all my misfortunes were necessary.</i>

254
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,950
<i>Because I'm going to change this unfair world.</i>

255
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,230
<i>Which is why...</i>

256
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,520
<i>There's no way I can die here!</i>

257
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,170
<i>Don't underestimate my Pumpkin!</i>

258
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,090
Coro!

259
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,880
<i>My Ten Kings are all out of ammo,</i>

260
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,050
<i>but I still have this.</i>

261
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,680
<i>Justice is served!</i>

262
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,820
<i>This is the moment.</i>

263
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,650
Blow through!

264
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,490
Sh-She sliced through me.

265
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,250
Pumpkin runs on my emotional energy.

266
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,710
The more intense my emotions, 
the stronger it makes me.

267
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,140
You made me snap.

268
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,970
So you lose.

269
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,880
Justice can't lose...

270
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,110
No matter what the circumstances, evil will perish.

271
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,340
<i>Judgment of the Ten Kings: Final Move...</i>

272
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,830
<i>Chakravartin Furnace of Five Hells.</i>

273
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,870
One minute left.

274
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,790
Don't tell me... A suicide bomb?

275
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,220
This is the ultimate evil-purging weapon 
I received from the doctor.

276
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,820
So long as I have this in my head,

277
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,800
I can't lose.

278
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,130
You...

279
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,850
<i>It's overheated... It's no use.</i>

280
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,380
With those injuries, running is futile.

281
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,330
It's already decided that this 
explosion will execute you.

282
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,940
Die in fear!

283
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,980
I see...

284
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,500
You can't regenerate anymore.

285
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,410
But we haven't finished purging all of the evil.

286
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,490
I don't want to...

287
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,460
In a place like this...

288
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,890
Crap... My leg...

289
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,230
You've got to be kidding.

290
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,960
I have to survive, no matter what, 
and stand on the winning side.

291
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,100
And I was finally able to avenge those two...

292
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,840
Why are you appearing in my head?

293
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,070
You still need me to be reliable...

294
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,610
<i>Damn it all!</i>

295
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,690
I wasn't strong enough for Bro...

296
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,930
And I couldn't make it in time for Chelsea.

297
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,650
But this time, I won't let anyone die.

298
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,980
Tatsumi...

299
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,030
Seems you're okay.

300
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,890
But I did it.

301
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,500
You told me earlier, remember?

302
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,760
That when I'm needed most, I should help.

303
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,950
I did it.

304
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,310
How's that?

305
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,550
I was thinking of you.

306
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,960
You're making it sound like I owe you.

307
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,020
Even if you helped, it was at the last second.

308
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,230
But...

309
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,550
You really saved me.

310
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,390
Thank you.

311
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,690
S-Sure.

312
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,320
Borick...

313
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,810
Where did he go?

314
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,400
Borick already ran away.

315
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,120
Najenda...

316
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,360
He ignored your warning.

317
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,460
He's probably being finished 
off by my subordinates.

318
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,920
Th-That was close.

319
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Holimaca!

320
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,130
It was just a scratch.

321
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,210
A sneaky strategy like that... 
You haven't changed.

322
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,900
That's right.

323
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,480
I know your strength better than anyone.

324
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,110
Which is why I wouldn't dream of a frontal assault.

325
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,350
Looks like we're done for now.

326
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,290
Yeah.

327
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,340
Hey, Tatsumi?

328
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,330
What?

329
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,080
After this battle's over, I want to 
talk to you about something.

330
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,090
Can't you talk about it now?

331
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,560
Nope.

332
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,840
Huh?

333
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,630
<i>I'm surprised at myself.</i>

334
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,760
<i>To think I'd become the type that wants 
to survive for someone else...</i>

335
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,840
Promise me.

336
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,800
That you'll survive, no matter what.

337
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,310
Of course I will.

338
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,490
<i>Moving forward, we'll face even harsher battles.</i>

339
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,460
<i>But as long as I have these feelings...</i>

340
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,860
<i>I'll be able to fight with even 
more than I have before.</i>

341
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Carnage
