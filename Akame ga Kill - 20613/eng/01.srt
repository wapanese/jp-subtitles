1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,400
Whoa!

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,610
I-It's an earth dragon!

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,330
First-class Danger Beast, earth dragon...

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,640
A worthy opponent.

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,550
You're angry, huh?

6
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,680
It's over.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,070
That was amazing!

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,410
You actually took a Danger 
Beast down single-handedly!

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,260
Of course!

10
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,270
For me, that was nothing.

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,330
Defeating him was a piece of cake!

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,660
By the way, I'm Tatsumi...

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,920
A name that'll be famous 
throughout the imperial capital.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,750
You should remember it.

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,400
You're saying you want to make 
it big in the imperial capital?

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,440
Yeah!

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,510
Win success and fame in the imperial capital... 
It's every country boy's dream!

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,220
The imperial capital isn't the place of hopes 
and dreams that you think.

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,250
It's definitely lively,

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,480
but there are monsters even 
worse than that earth dragon.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,450
What?

22
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,650
You mean there are Danger 
Beasts in the city, too?

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,070
It's the people...

24
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,030
Humans, but their hearts are those of monsters.

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,820
The capital's full of people like that.

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,450
I appreciate your advice,

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,080
but I can't turn back now.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,420
I...

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,740
No, we...

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,970
We're going to make it in the imperial 
capital, and save our village!

31
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,490
Just as humans eventually rot away,

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,850
countries collapse, as well.

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,350
Even the imperial capital, which has 
prospered for a thousand years,

34
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,110
is now a living hell of corruption.

35
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,950
Evil spirits take human form and run amok,

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,220
claiming everything as their own.

37
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,590
Those evils which heaven cannot judge...

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,070
They will be dealt with in the darkness.

39
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,140
By us...

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,990
the assassins.

41
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,790
Kill the Darkness

42
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,630
Kill the Darkness

43
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,220
Wow!

44
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,770
Awesome!

45
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,920
So this is the imperial capital...

46
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,300
If I make good money here, 
I could buy the entire village!

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,310
I should head for the barracks!

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,740
Oh...

49
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,770
You're an applicant, too, huh?

50
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,440
Fill out this form and bring it back to me.

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,980
This means...

52
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,760
I'll be starting out in the infantry?

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,690
Obviously.

54
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,990
Who has time for that?!

55
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,910
Look at my technique...

56
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,160
If I show promise, would you start 
me out as a commanding officer?

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,490
Get out!

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,690
What was that about?

59
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,830
Why not test me out?

60
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,930
Don't be ridiculous!

61
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,870
Due to the recession, 
we're flooded with applicants...

62
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,750
There are limits as to how many we can hire!

63
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,080
Oh, really?

64
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,870
If you get it, scram, you damned brat!

65
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,900
<i>Do I cause a scene and make 
a reputation for myself?</i>

66
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,760
<i>But I might get caught...</i>

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,230
Hi!

68
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,890
Hmm?

69
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,880
Something seems to be troubling you, young man.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,730
Want a lady to lend a hand?

71
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,890
S-So this is the imperial capital...

72
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,860
What's wrong with you?

73
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,940
Drawn by dreams of making it in the capital, 
you came all the way from the country?

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,170
How did you know that?

75
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,830
I knew at once.

76
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,500
If you've lived in the capital long enough, 
you can identify outsiders.

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,580
Anyway...

78
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,910
I know a quick way to get hired 
for government services.

79
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,940
Seriously?

80
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,050
Want to know how?

81
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,090
Yes, yes!

82
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,050
Then treat a lady to a meal!

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,220
Drinking during the day sure is fantastic!

84
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,590
Have a drink, young man!

85
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,420
Let's have some fun!

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,940
Just tell me how to get hired by the government!

87
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,690
Well, that's simply...

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,900
Having connections and money.

89
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,980
M-Money?

90
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,440
I know a guy in the military...

91
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,360
If you give him cash, it'll be real quick!

92
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,910
I get it.

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,870
Then...

94
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,290
Would this be enough?

95
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,080
Oh, absolutely!

96
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,590
On my way here, I collected some 
rewards for slaying Danger Beasts.

97
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,050
So you're strong.

98
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,380
You'll be a commanding officer in no time!

99
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,010
That's right! I'll leave it to you!

100
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,170
I think your encounter with me will 
serve as a valuable lesson, kid.

101
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,060
I'm gonna go take care of this, 
so wait there for me, okay?

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,110
Okay!

103
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,950
Sir, we're closing soon.

104
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,330
Oh, I'm waiting for someone...

105
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,600
Sorry to break it to you, 
but you've been swindled.

106
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,080
Eh?

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,960
Huh?!

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,090
To think you'd be so trusting in the 
imperial capital at a time like this...

109
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,830
Th-That's fraud!

110
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,680
I'm reporting her!

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,630
It's no use...

112
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,590
The one who got swindled is at fault.

113
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,110
Damn it...

114
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,480
After paying for that meal, 
I'm completely broke...

115
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,790
Those boobs...

116
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,800
I mean, that woman!

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,190
Is this the valuable lesson 
you were talking about?

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,170
Damn...

119
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,010
No one from the country would lie like that...

120
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,870
Oh, well...

121
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,720
Guess I'm sleeping outside.

122
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,240
I can sleep anywhere.

123
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,750
Stop.

124
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,630
Again, my lady?

125
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,080
You know I can't help it.

126
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,550
It's my nature.

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,640
If you have nowhere to sleep, 
would you like to stay at my home?

128
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Now Skeptical 
of Everything

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,730
I don't have any money...

130
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,060
You wouldn't be sleeping 
here if you did, would you?

131
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,650
Lady Aria can't ignore people like you.

132
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,610
You should accept her generosity.

133
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,570
What would you like to do?

134
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,240
Well...

135
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,320
I guess it's better than sleeping outside...

136
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,280
It's settled, then!

137
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,110
Oh...

138
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,240
Aria's brought someone home again.

139
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
My...

140
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,310
It's simply her habit.

141
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,580
I wonder how many there have been.

142
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,940
Mother!

143
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,170
Th-Thank you...

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,100
<i>Those guys over there are really strong...</i>

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,100
There's no need to be nervous.

146
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,840
<i>Maybe it's because of those guys</i>

147
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I bet you're hungry.

148
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,030
<i>that they don't feel threatened, 
being kind to a stranger...</i>

149
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,880
<i>It's nice to know there are kind people like these...</i>

150
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,850
<i>Even in the imperial capital.</i>

151
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,310
Thank you very much for taking me in!

152
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,190
I see...

153
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,600
You want to gain military success, 
and save your village.

154
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,400
Yes, sir.

155
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,110
But you know...

156
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,020
Within the imperial capital, it is peaceful.

157
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,660
However, this country is surrounded 
by three different races...

158
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,940
You could be assigned to the 
international border to fight.

159
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,880
I've prepared myself for that.

160
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,420
I see.

161
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,960
What impressive spirit!

162
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,090
This is exactly how the young should be.

163
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,380
Did you come from the village 
all by yourself, Tatsumi?

164
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,840
No, with three others.

165
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,750
The thing is...

166
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,100
All right! We'll be on our way, Chief!

167
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,050
Right.

168
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,240
You've had the ability to fortify 
one another's strengths

169
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,070
Take that ability, and grab 
your chance for success.

170
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,390
Leave it to us.

171
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,110
We'll bring wealth to the village.

172
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,980
That way, we won't starve to death!

173
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,580
Well, it'll probably take ten years for 
Master Ieyasu's name to become known.

174
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,910
Ieyasu will probably get the guillotine 
for breaking the law.

175
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,080
Hey, Sayo!

176
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,920
Stop saying things that might actually happen!

177
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,470
It seems you all have enough spirit.

178
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,310
Now, Tatsumi...

179
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,070
Here's my last parting gift.

180
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,470
Take this with you.

181
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,620
When in need...

182
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,300
Sell it, right?

183
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,260
No!

184
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Keep it close to you.

185
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,620
And God will surely help you.

186
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,490
Yeah.

187
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,110
Thank you, Chief!

188
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,980
And we left with high spirits...

189
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,340
But soon after, bandits attacked us.

190
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,020
And we've been separated ever since.

191
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,860
Oh, dear...

192
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,870
They're strong, so I'm not 
necessarily worried, but...

193
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,870
But Ieyasu is unbelievably bad with directions...

194
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,400
<i>What did you say?!</i>

195
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,870
I wonder if he'll even be able to find 
where we're supposed to meet...

196
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,920
Very well, then.

197
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,460
Hmm?

198
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll put in a good word with 
a military acquaintance.

199
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,040
And I'll request a search for those two, as well.

200
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,640
Really?

201
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,970
Thank you so much!

202
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,790
My intuitions are usually spot on.

203
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,600
I think you'll see the two of them soon.

204
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,560
Miss Aria...

205
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,100
<i>I'm lucky.</i>

206
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,790
<i>In the end, I was saved by kind people.</i>

207
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,820
<i>Now it's just Sayo and Ieyasu...</i>

208
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,270
<i>I hope they both got to the capital safely.</i>

209
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,870
Next, we're going to that store!

210
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,790
Please wait, my lady!

211
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,590
Her shopping is pretty intense, isn't it?

212
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,460
The sheer amount is getting silly.

213
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,550
It's not just the lady...

214
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,510
All women are like this.

215
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,240
Really?

216
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,060
Those I know choose what to wear right away.

217
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,640
<i>Because there's nothing else to wear!</i>

218
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,050
But anyway, Tatsumi.

219
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,700
Yes?

220
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,720
Take a look at that.

221
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,360
Huh?

222
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,350
Over there, you can see in the distance

223
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,720
the imperial capital's center, the palace.

224
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,320
It's huge!

225
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,240
Is that where the great emperor is, 
the one who can change a country?

226
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,320
No...

227
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
It's a little different than that.

228
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,960
There's an emperor, but he's only a child.

229
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,820
The prime minister controls the 
emperor from the shadows.

230
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,840
And he's the reason why this country rots.

231
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,390
The min—

232
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,240
Don't say anything suspicious.

233
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,060
If anyone hears us, they'll have our heads.

234
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,890
Then...

235
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,450
My village also suffers from 
heavy taxation because...

236
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,770
In the capital, it's an accepted practice.

237
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,650
And there are others like those over there.

238
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,070
Night Raid?

239
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,270
They're a group of assassins that's 
terrifying the imperial capital.

240
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,570
As the name suggests, they attack 
their victims at night.

241
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,540
They mainly target high-ranking executives 
and the capital's upper class.

242
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,800
Prepare yourself, just in case.

243
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,780
Yes, sir.

244
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,180
Also, could you do something about that?

245
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,000
Huh?

246
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,710
What kind of training is this?!

247
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,120
Now, then...

248
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,050
Maybe I'll write in my diary today.

249
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,810
I just can't stop this hobby.

250
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,360
Eh?

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,700
My apologies.

252
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,250
What's going on?

253
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,000
Murderous intent?

254
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,420
<i>It can't be...</i>

255
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,550
<i>That's...</i>

256
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,030
<i>Night Raid!</i>

257
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,440
Night Raid...

258
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,190
Just because they're wealthy, 
you'll target this place, too?

259
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,210
<i>What do I do?</i>

260
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,620
<i>Do I back them up?</i>

261
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,080
<i>Or should I guard?</i>

262
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,090
Our targets are three guards, Akame.

263
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,830
They will be eliminated.

264
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,930
Listen, don't touch that sword.

265
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,800
A fitting end for someone like me,

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,740
whose true nature is rotten...

267
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,230
What's with these guys?

268
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,410
They're monsters!

269
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,320
How pathetic...

270
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,010
Running when facing the enemy.

271
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,620
Though who wouldn't run 
in those circumstances?

272
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,270
<i>Completely annihilated in an instant...</i>

273
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,880
<i>I must at least protect Miss Aria!</i>

274
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,220
H-Help...

275
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,460
I have a daughter...

276
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,920
Calm down.

277
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,350
You'll be with her on the other side.

278
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,340
Even my daughter...

279
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,600
Have you no mercy?

280
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,860
Mercy?

281
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,940
What's that?

282
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,160
Hurry, my lady! This way!

283
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,580
What's going on?

284
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,820
We must get to the storehouse!

285
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,200
It'll be safe there!

286
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Found you!

287
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,130
Tatsumi?

288
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,370
You came at a good time...

289
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,430
We're going into the storehouse, 
and waiting for the authorities.

290
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,960
In the meantime, you fend them off.

291
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,150
That's impossible—

292
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,220
I guess I have no choice!

293
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,050
Not a target.

294
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,850
Damn!

295
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,270
Target.

296
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,530
<i>Eliminate.</i>

297
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,150
Eliminate.

298
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,330
Hold it!

299
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,520
You aren't a target.

300
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,670
There's no need to kill you.

301
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,180
But you plan to kill this girl, don't you?

302
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,920
Yep.

303
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,010
"Yep"?!

304
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,870
If you get in my way, I'll kill you.

305
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,630
That doesn't mean I can just run!

306
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,560
Is that so?

307
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,020
Then I shall eliminate you.

308
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,190
So dirty! Dirty!

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,090
<i>How unusual... Akame hasn't 
finished them off yet?</i>

310
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,110
Huh? Wait!

311
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,930
Jeez...

312
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,860
How unlucky can one guy be?

313
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,990
<i>This isn't someone I can defeat 
in my current state...</i>

314
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,960
<i>But I can't worry about that.</i>

315
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,700
<i>If I can't even save this one girl,</i>

316
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,460
<i>how will I save an entire village?</i>

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,270
Oh, crap!

318
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,970
Tatsumi!

319
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,800
You won't even lower your 
guard and come near me?

320
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,140
I didn't feel any flesh.

321
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,820
Everyone from my village protected me.

322
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,040
<i>To survive after taking one of Akame's hits...</i>

323
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,710
<i>That kid's pretty good.</i>

324
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,420
Eliminate.

325
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,580
Wait a second...

326
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,050
Aren't you guys after money?

327
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,630
Let her go!

328
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,160
It isn't like we're at war...

329
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,220
Yet you're willing to kill an innocent girl?

330
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,050
<i>It's no use... She isn't listening 
to anything I say!</i>

331
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,680
Hold on.

332
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,640
What are you doing?

333
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,520
We still have time, right?

334
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,780
I owe this kid a favor.

335
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,610
I figured I'd repay it.

336
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,790
You're those boobs from earlier!

337
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,780
That's right! The beautiful lady!

338
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,310
Young man...

339
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,080
You said something about 
killing the innocent, didn't you?

340
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,500
Will you be able to say the 
same thing after seeing this?

341
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,750
Take a good look. 
This is the imperial capital's darkness.

342
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,220
Wh-What the hell is this?

343
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,290
They lure people from the countryside 
with sweet words,

344
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,020
torturing them and playing with 
them until they're dead.

345
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,730
That is what this household really is.

346
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,370
Sayo...

347
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,360
Hey, Sayo?

348
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Is that you, Sayo?

349
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,190
Is it someone you knew?

350
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,870
Hold on...

351
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,590
Aren't you asking for a bit much, 
trying to run away like that?

352
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,460
The people of this household did this?

353
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,880
That's right.

354
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,390
Since the guards kept quiet, 
they were just as guilty.

355
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,150
That's a lie!

356
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,710
I didn't even know this place existed!

357
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,530
Will you believe the one who 
saved you or these people?

358
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,700
Tatsumi...

359
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,060
It's you, right, Tatsumi?

360
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,340
It's me...

361
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,770
I-Ieyasu?

362
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,500
That girl invited Sayo and me to her home.

363
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,890
And after we ate, we lost consciousness...

364
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,030
And when we came to, we were here...

365
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:01,220
Th-That girl tortured Sayo to death!

366
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,050
What's so wrong with that?!

367
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,270
You're all worthless hicks from the country!

368
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,380
The same as cattle!

369
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,280
I'm free to do whatever I want to them, aren't I?

370
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,260
And that woman...

371
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,110
Even though she was just cattle, 
her hair was smooth!

372
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,820
Who does she think she is?

373
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,910
When I struggle with my unruly hair!

374
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,600
That's why I made sure she 
suffered as much as possible!

375
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,510
She should be grateful anyone paid 
that much attention to her!

376
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,510
A family of sadists, disguised as Good Samaritans!

377
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,380
Sorry for getting in your way.

378
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,300
Eliminate.

379
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,190
Wait.

380
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,770
Don't tell me...

381
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,940
You still want to defend her?

382
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,400
No...

383
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,110
I'll kill her!

384
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,500
<i>I know that he despised her now,</i>

385
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,960
<i>but he killed her without hesitation.</i>

386
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,460
That's Tatsumi for you...

387
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,680
That felt great!

388
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,310
Ieyasu!

389
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,610
Ieyasu...

390
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,270
It's the final stages of Lubora.

391
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,520
The mother of the house enjoyed 
drugging her victims.

392
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,650
And she wrote about it in detail in her diary.

393
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,060
He cannot be saved.

394
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,400
Tatsumi...

395
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,070
Ieyasu!

396
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,580
Sayo... She never gave into that bitch.

397
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,210
Even to the very end,

398
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,310
she was so cool...

399
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,120
So Master Ieyasu has to have

400
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,710
a cool end...

401
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,160
It seems he kept himself alive by will alone.

402
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,300
What's going on in the capital?

403
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,850
Let's go.

404
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,780
Hey...

405
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,930
Why don't we bring the kid with us?

406
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,180
Our secret base is always short-handed!

407
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,690
What are you doing? Release me!

408
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,190
He has luck, courage, and even 
skill! Wouldn't you agree?

409
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,540
I have to dig a grave for those two!

410
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,990
Oh, I'll bring their bodies 
to our secret base later,

411
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,800
so don't worry!

412
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,410
Huh?

413
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,240
Let go of me!

414
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
You're late!

415
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,740
What were you doing?

416
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,590
And what is that thing?

417
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,570
Our new friend!

418
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,330
Huh?

419
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,210
Oh? Did I not tell you?

420
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,290
From now on, you're one of us.

421
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,750
Congratulations on becoming 
a member of Night Raid!

422
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,140
Why is this happening?!

423
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,090
Give up.

424
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,390
Once she's made up her mind, 
Leone won't give up.

425
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,130
As expected, you know me so well...

426
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,270
Bulatcchi, I'll leave him to you!

427
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,250
Let go of me...

428
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,020
I have no intention of becoming an assassin!

429
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,730
It'll be okay...

430
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,400
I promise it'll get better.

431
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,480
Wh-What will?

432
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,980
Mission complete. Time to return.

433
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,890
What's up with this turn of events?!

434
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,080
What's going to happen to me?

435
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,940
Kill the Authority

436
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
