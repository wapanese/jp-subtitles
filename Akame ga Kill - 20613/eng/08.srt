1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,350
Looks like I can get some great experience!

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,150
Bro!

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,070
<i>He killed the big one,</i>

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,030
<i>and still dealt with the other two.</i>

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,240
<i>All...</i>

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,710
<i>All in a single moment!</i>

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,170
That Imperial Arms, that strength.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,000
So it is you, Bulat.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,450
You are

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,960
General Liver.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,560
I am no longer a general.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,060
After Lady Esdeath saved me,

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,770
I became her servant.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,820
<i>Huh?</i>

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,150
<i>Could this be the guy from Bro's story?</i>

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,180
If we'd been on the same side, we could've 
had a drink to celebrate the reunion.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,960
But since you've resurfaced as my enemy,

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,130
I must kill you.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,550
I must complete the mission!

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,370
That is my line.

21
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,270
The mission must be carried out...

22
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,100
With this Imperial Arms

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,930
my master bestowed upon me!

24
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,360
Kill the Three 
— Part Two —

25
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,990
Kill the Three 
— Part Two —

26
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,200
The Imperial Arms Black Marlin!

27
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,010
Created from the organ of an aquatic 
Danger Beast that controls water.

28
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,840
Thus, its user can freely manipulate 
any liquid surrounding them.

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,000
It's immensely fortunate that my battle 
with you two takes place here!

30
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,980
A water-controller, huh?

31
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,230
Appropriate for the servant 
of one who controls ice.

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,320
Lady Esdeath can create ice from nothing.

33
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,190
She is on a completely different level.

34
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,700
It's awe-inspiring!

35
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>Water Spirit Cannon!</i>

36
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,950
How brazen!

37
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,020
Ow, ow, ow...

38
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,040
That guy's strength is roughly 
second to Lady Esdeath's...

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,500
But since we're on water, Liver can defeat him.

40
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,310
I should back him up, too.

41
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,420
Hold it!

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,300
I won't just sit back and let him protect me!

43
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,220
This guy...

44
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,600
You're in the way!

45
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,210
Night Raid...

46
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,480
You're getting cocky!

47
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,080
<i>Damn, he's ridiculously fast...</i>

48
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,790
<i>However...</i>

49
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,010
Akame is faster!

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,850
Hmph! Don't compare me to a mere assassin!

51
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,770
<i>If I hadn't been hit earlier, 
this guy would be nothing.</i>

52
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,670
<i>Considering his wounds, his speed is absurd.</i>

53
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,510
<i>The Three Beasts...</i>

54
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,490
<i>Compared to their strength, Ogre was nothing.</i>

55
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Whoa, something crazy is happening over there.

56
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,490
As long as there's a lot of water, Liver will win!

57
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,910
Heh, it's pretty obvious that Bro's gonna win.

58
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,360
No, Liver will!

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,310
It's gonna be Bro!

60
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,280
Succumb to the water pressure, Bulat!

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,860
<i>Ravine Serpent!</i>

62
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,840
I expected that you'd go straight for 
the serpent rather than dodge it.

63
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,980
Given the casualties if it had hit the boat.

64
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,720
However, now that you're off 
the deck and in the air...

65
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,930
There's no way you can dodge this!

66
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,980
<i>Dark Stream Spear!</i>

67
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,820
Splashing some water around

68
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,960
won't be enough to quench my resolve!

69
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,370
That's right.

70
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,790
This won't suffice to defeat you.

71
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,460
I am well aware of that.

72
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,800
We have been through countless battles together.

73
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,880
Your strength and your determination...

74
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,530
I understand them better than anyone.

75
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,050
And that's precisely why

76
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,800
I'll have you feast on my greatest technique!

77
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,640
<i>Water Dragon's Divine Conquest!</i>

78
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,450
Is he dead?

79
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,230
If it's ever in question,

80
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,670
you haven't defeated your enemy!

81
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,000
He survived it!

82
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,830
That's too bad...

83
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,640
You missed your chance to defeat Liver.

84
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,290
B-Bro...

85
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,410
Tatsumi?

86
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,940
Forgive me, Bro...

87
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,200
I wasn't able to... hold him off long enough.

88
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,650
Oh?

89
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,360
You can still move?

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,330
I told you if you kept still, I'd play with you later.

91
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,940
Don't worry about it.

92
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,300
Your survival, after fighting without an 
Imperial Arms, is impressive enough.

93
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,020
Bro...

94
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,910
<i>He was even injured within that armor.</i>

95
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,760
After sustaining sufficient damage, 
your Imperial Arms appears to release.

96
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,940
We're almost finished.

97
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,870
Heh, don't act tough.

98
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,400
You're bleeding from your ears, Liver.

99
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,590
After pulling off those tremendous moves,

100
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,570
your body must be worn out.

101
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,580
You're in no condition to use 
your Imperial Arms, either.

102
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,930
If that's revealed, there's no help for it.

103
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,110
I wanted to negotiate from a higher vantage point,

104
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,050
but I'll simply ask.

105
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,630
Bulat, do you have any interest 
in joining Lady Esdeath's army?

106
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,840
Since it's you, a second-in-command 
rank would be conceivable.

107
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,510
I have no interest in serving the empire anymore.

108
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,880
Not the empire.

109
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Think of it as serving Lady Esdeath.

110
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,210
That was the way I was saved...

111
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,940
You could do as you please,

112
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,280
and be feared by all.

113
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,380
That's right.

114
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,630
Even those filthy political officials, spreading their tainted philosophy,

115
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,780
would bow down to you!

116
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,300
Come with me, Bulat!

117
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,290
Lady Esdeath can expunge your crimes!

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,040
I refuse.

119
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,250
You may be comfortable 
with your current position,

120
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,840
considering how you feel 
about political officials.

121
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,230
But I am a defender of the people.

122
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,100
If I were to join the Esdeath Army that's working with the minister...

123
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,600
I wouldn't be able to say that anymore.

124
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,260
"Defender of the people"?

125
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,310
Not something I'd expect to hear from an assassin.

126
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,150
That's why I tried to say it with humility.

127
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,860
<i>He's already at his limit, too.</i>

128
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,320
<i>But we still have our trump card.</i>

129
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,580
<i>And we'll win with that!</i>

130
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,700
<i>Bro...</i>

131
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,800
<i>If two Imperial Arms users battle one another,</i>

132
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,870
<i>it's certain that only one will survive.</i>

133
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
Since neither of us can use our Imperial Arms...

134
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,380
...We'll settle this with our swords.

135
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,460
I'll be enhancing my strength.

136
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,890
Since you're my opponent, after all.

137
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,400
Ah, Bro!

138
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,990
This guy's dangerous!

139
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm well prepared to face 
a formidable opponent.

140
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,030
Here I come!

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,090
These can't be an injured person's movements...

142
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,610
Yes!

143
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,970
<i>Hidden Technique: Blade of Blood!</i>

144
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,830
So you had something up your sleeve!

145
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,330
Bro!

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,690
A-Are you all right, Bro?

147
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,110
These wounds aren't fatal...

148
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,430
Don't worry...

149
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,510
An attack that uses your own life force...

150
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,690
<i>To think he withstood it...</i>

151
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,060
<i>Impressive.</i>

152
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,420
If I'd misjudged even a second,

153
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,210
I would've lost.

154
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,290
The moment I saw him spewing blood,

155
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,730
I realized that was a form of liquid.

156
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,870
Good thinking, Bro!

157
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,060
<i>I may have just held him back...</i>

158
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,330
<i>But to think we both survived 
such powerful opponents!</i>

159
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,190
<i>I'm so relieved.</i>

160
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,420
Bulat...

161
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,930
There's one last thing.

162
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,340
The real reason I decided to 
join Lady Esdeath's army.

163
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,390
Disappearing like this would be 
a complete waste for you.

164
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,840
I've been searching for a competent assistant.

165
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,310
Join my army.

166
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,750
Even if I wanted to, I'm still a criminal.

167
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,200
I cannot return to the army.

168
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,830
Stop being so hesitant.

169
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
Of course you can return.

170
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,010
Because it is what I wish.

171
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,340
Which means I won't let anyone oppose it.

172
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,950
But the minister wouldn't allow that.

173
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,050
The minister is safe because of my army and me.

174
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,240
If it is to fortify that army, 
more power will be gladly received.

175
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,360
Come to my side, Liver.

176
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,440
If there's anything else troubling you

177
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,190
I will make it all disappear.

178
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,130
Simply put, I idolized her.

179
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,070
That's all.

180
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,410
Liver...

181
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,190
Therefore...

182
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,760
As someone who exists solely 
to serve Lady Esdeath,

183
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,630
I will take your life!

184
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,710
Bro!

185
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,850
That vial before wasn't merely 
to enhance his strength...

186
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,900
It was also a deadly poison!

187
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,060
The poison will course through someone 
like you, one with no resistance.

188
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,890
You cannot be saved.

189
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,120
I will...

190
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,150
be going... ahead.

191
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,590
As expected of my former superior...

192
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,240
A draw, huh?

193
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
We have to hurry and get you help!

194
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,730
Tatsumi...

195
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,250
The battle isn't over yet...

196
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,050
Did you think the Blade of Blood was our trump?

197
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,100
Wrong.

198
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,150
I am the real trump card.

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,440
<i>Secret Technique: Demon Summon.</i>

200
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,630
My Imperial Arms Scream's purpose 
isn't only to affect others.

201
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,880
It can also be used to affect my own body.

202
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,380
He increased his strength... 
So this is his secret technique.

203
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,600
Ah, it's been a while since I've 
changed into this form.

204
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,170
<i>This is bad.</i>

205
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,890
<i>He beat me earlier...</i>

206
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,550
<i>What can I do alone?</i>

207
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,440
Tatsumi...

208
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,610
Tatsumi, I'm entrusting this to you.

209
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,020
That's...

210
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,830
It's Incursio's key.

211
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,830
The armor will come to the 
one who possesses it.

212
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Y-You want me to use your Imperial Arms?

213
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,050
That's impossible... Simply impossible!

214
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,660
Incursio places an immense 
strain upon its user.

215
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,050
It's enough to immediately kill someone 
random who's using it, right?

216
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,400
If I were you, I wouldn't put that on.

217
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,590
You'll be dead before you even fight.

218
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,060
Let's just fight normally.

219
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,930
Don't get caught up in your 
enemy's words, dumbass!

220
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,260
Think about your training and 
all you've been through!

221
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,490
You're more than qualified to use this, Tatsumi!

222
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,660
Bro!

223
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,470
<i>Since I'm avenging the other two, 
I want to slice them into pieces.</i>

224
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,970
<i>But if they died instantly, it would be boring.</i>

225
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,530
There's the matter of compatibility 
with Imperial Arms.

226
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,010
If you aren't compatible, you'll die instantly!

227
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,070
Compatibility between the Imperial Arms and you

228
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,340
is mostly determined by first impressions, 
like your reaction to its appearance.

229
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,270
And whether you liked it or not.

230
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,900
Whoa, amazing!

231
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,170
You can do it.

232
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,450
Go, Tatsumi!

233
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,430
Bro...

234
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,580
Someone I respect is saying all of this...

235
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,590
If I don't live up to that, 
what kind of a man would I be?

236
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,380
Ah, then you're putting it on?

237
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,040
Well, then...

238
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,810
I'll kill you before you can kill yourself!

239
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,240
Shout it out, Tatsumi!

240
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,220
With your raging spirit!

241
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,160
<i>Incursio!</i>

242
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,150
<i>The armor...</i>

243
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,000
<i>It's changing form to suit Tatsumi's body!</i>

244
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,780
What's with that armor?

245
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,800
Don't tell me... Its raw form is still alive!

246
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,280
Incursio was created by purifying 
raw materials taken from Tyrant,

247
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,840
a dragon-type Danger Beast whose life 
force exceeds that of any other.

248
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,020
That dragon could wander any land, 
whether burning desert or freezing tundra.

249
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,600
It could survive any environment 
by evolving itself and adapting.

250
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,310
Even after being used in an Imperial Arms,

251
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,740
the dragon's flesh is still alive!

252
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,450
Wh-What an incredible Imperial Arms...

253
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,950
Tatsumi...

254
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,880
I see...

255
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,460
Your passion

256
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,710
has caused Incursio to evolve once more!

257
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,590
Esdeath's army... You've committed multiple 
assassinations in Night Raid's name!

258
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,930
It's time to accept your punishment!

259
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,890
You're suddenly full of yourself.

260
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,230
I can feel it...

261
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,400
This armor is vigorously increasing my strength!

262
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,440
I will defeat you!

263
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,320
Go ahead and try!

264
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,470
Amazing.

265
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,250
If you're this powerful now,

266
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,530
it's clear that eventually,

267
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,610
you will surpass me.

268
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,270
<i>Keep moving forward...</i>

269
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,280
<i>I'll be watching over you.</i>

270
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,340
Bro...

271
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,010
I won, thanks to you.

272
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,560
I'm sorry.

273
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,520
Even till the end, I did dumb 
things that you hit me for.

274
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,450
I'll become stronger...

275
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,750
And I'll learn to use Incursio properly.

276
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,840
S-So... So...

277
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,440
It's okay if I cry now, right...

278
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,340
Bro?

279
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,790
Human bodies really are fun!

280
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,750
We have to thoroughly dispose 
of the remains with fire.

281
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,220
Putting the goods we've taken from 
them on the black market

282
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,640
is a major crime, isn't it?

283
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,840
Kurome, we have a message!

284
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,060
You've been summoned to an 
assembly in the capital.

285
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,680
Kurome's Snacks

286
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,680
Just me?

287
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,730
Yeah.

288
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,160
You're the only one chosen as one of the six.

289
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,440
Six?

290
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,840
Apparently, it's to form a new organization.

291
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,660
The capital, huh?

292
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,720
Maybe I'll get to see you...

293
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,220
Sister.

294
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:41,060
Kill the Battle Fanatic
