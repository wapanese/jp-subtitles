1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,120
So this is the capital's red-light district?

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,340
It makes my heart race.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,370
Oh? Your straightforward 
reaction is pretty cute.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,350
Now, then...

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,380
Time to get to work, and repay those debts.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,560
<i>Transform: Lionel!</i>

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,980
All right.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,950
Changing into this always gets me pumped!

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,730
Wow!

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,730
Now, let's sneak in and kill them.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:46,980
Huh?

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,790
W-Wait.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,280
W-W-Wait! Wh-What?

14
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,840
Kill the Absolute Justice

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,920
Kill the Absolute Justice

16
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,010
Hmm?

17
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,000
Whew!

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,350
Made it.

19
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,190
You call that "sneaking in"?

20
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,770
Take a look.

21
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,970
Oh, nice... Very nice.

22
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,340
Girls, if you keep earning, 
I'll bring more drugs, okay?

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,340
Okay.

24
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,590
Huh?

25
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,220
Hey, boss...

26
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,250
Take a look at this one.

27
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,570
Well, this is no good.

28
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,560
She smells like fish, and she's broken.

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,970
Get rid of her.

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,330
Replace her with a new one.

31
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,020
Please, more drugs!

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,020
All right...

33
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,910
Let's get some dumb slum broads again.

34
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,730
Yeah.

35
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,530
Those good-for-nothings will 
do anything for money.

36
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,360
As the request said, they're awful bastards.

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,700
Unforgivable!

38
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,720
The girl that just got hit...

39
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,420
I knew her from the slums.

40
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,510
They piss me off.

41
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,790
Let's hurry up and kill these targets.

42
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,800
Roger that.

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
Boss...

44
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,260
It's about time we expanded our 
drug territory, don't you think?

45
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,760
You're right...

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,180
Maybe we should pay Tybil a visit to discuss it.

47
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,060
The only place you two are going

48
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,560
is hell!

49
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,760
I-Intruders!

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,160
Get rid of them!

51
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,920
Our target is the drug-smuggling gang.

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,450
But you're just as guilty,

53
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,580
so you can all die together.

54
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,830
Kill them!

55
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,390
Y-You've gotta be kidding...

56
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,680
I don't deserve this!

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,650
Beg the devil for mercy!

58
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,930
What is it you want?

59
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,980
Money?

60
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,240
Drugs?

61
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,410
I'll give you anything, so release me...

62
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,060
No thanks.

63
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,170
All I want is to take your life.

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,170
Wh-Who the hell are you two?

65
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,590
Just some good-for-nothings.

66
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,850
Which is precisely why ridding the 
world of trash suits us fine.

67
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,680
Hey...

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,460
What's going to happen to all those girls?

69
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,780
That isn't our responsibility, is it?

70
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,180
But...

71
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,630
In the slums, there's an old, retired doctor.

72
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,670
And he's still pretty skilled.

73
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,330
I'll explain the situation, 
and have him take a look.

74
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,440
He loves young girls, so I'm sure he'll do it.

75
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,540
Sis!

76
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,380
When all is said and done, you're pretty nice.

77
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,060
It's only because I knew one of them.

78
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,310
There's no other reason!

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,580
The reason doesn't matter.

80
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,400
As long as a tiny bit of hope exists, 
that's all that matters.

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,850
Tatsumi...

82
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,100
I've thought this from the start,

83
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,230
but that expression you make is really cute.

84
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
Huh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What?

85
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,920
I was marking you, literally.

86
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,710
If you grow up to be a 
good-looking man, you're mine.

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,470
Anyway, I wonder if the others are okay.

88
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,500
That Tybil guy was almost too vigilant.

89
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,640
But we still finished him without problem.

90
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,990
An enemy?

91
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,010
What's with her?

92
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,010
I didn't feel her presence at all.

93
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,870
She's different from the other imperial police, 
who don't hide their presences.

94
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,830
<i>As I thought.</i>

95
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,810
<i>Her face matches the wanted poster.</i>

96
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,010
<i>Night Raid's Sheele, confirmed.</i>

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,380
<i>And judging by the Imperial Arms,</i>

98
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,890
<i>the other girl is also a Night Raid member.</i>

99
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,020
<i>Hiding night after night was worth it...</i>

100
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,430
Finally...

101
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,440
We finally meet, Night Raid!

102
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,860
I'm Seryu Ubiquitous, of the imperial police.

103
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,290
In the name of absolute justice,

104
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,780
I shall make evil pay, here and now!

105
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,080
Given that you recognize us,

106
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,670
we have to take you with us or kill you.

107
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,570
"Wanted dead or alive."

108
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,800
Then I shall execute them!

109
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,720
Father died in the line of duty, 
fighting villains like you!

110
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,520
And you killed my mentor, General Ogre!

111
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,480
I will never forgive you!

112
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,980
She seems ready to go...

113
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,030
Very well.

114
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,530
Advantage favors whoever strikes first!

115
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,950
Did I get her?

116
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,010
Mine, that's an Imperial Arms.

117
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,540
Seems like it.

118
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,430
And it's organism-based.

119
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,720
<i>Tonfa Gun!</i>

120
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,470
<i>Even if I hit them from this distance, 
it won't be very effective.</i>

121
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,650
Coro, prey!

122
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,160
Forgive me.

123
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,740
Don't you remember the documents, Sheele?

124
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,800
Organism-based Imperial Arms 
have a core in their bodies.

125
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,070
If you don't destroy it, they'll keep regenerating.

126
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,330
And Akame's Murasame won't 
work without a heart, either.

127
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,600
Quite a troublesome opponent, isn't it?

128
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,660
Coro, arms.

129
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,090
Ew... Gross...

130
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,350
Pulverize!

131
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,010
Mine, get behind me.

132
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,690
<i>Heavy!</i>

133
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,200
<i>A tempest of attacks.</i>

134
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,020
<i>And she's called for backup.</i>

135
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,160
That's what I'd call

136
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,190
a pinch!

137
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,450
So, now... Go!

138
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,500
Its power increased?

139
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,470
Damn it...

140
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,000
It's already started regenerating.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,780
What energy...

142
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,220
Don't underestimate the 
stamina of Imperial Arms.

143
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,890
Imperial Arms are tools.

144
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,040
It will stop once its user is killed.

145
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>She was aiming for me from the start!</i>

146
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,560
<i>I'll get her with my secret move.</i>

147
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,820
<i>Extase!</i>

148
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,030
<i>Light-generating metal? 
How can such a move exist?</i>

149
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,680
This is the end.

150
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,060
<i>She's strong!</i>

151
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,810
Stop right there.

152
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,370
I'm your opponent, remember?

153
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,510
I won't let you go.

154
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,150
<i>As the threat lessens, its power weakens.</i>

155
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,220
<i>But it's enough to keep it busy.</i>

156
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,770
<i>And by process of elimination,</i>

157
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,190
<i>I'm starting to figure out where its core is.</i>

158
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,400
<i>Crap!</i>

159
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,390
<i>She sacrificed her arms to stop a fatal blow.</i>

160
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,790
Justice will always prevail!

161
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,250
<i>Body modification?</i>

162
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,680
This is the trump card General Ogre gave me.

163
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,090
Take this!

164
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,690
<i>She blocked it?</i>

165
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,280
<i>Not done yet...</i>

166
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,930
<i>If I use it, Coro will overheat and 
be temporarily immobile.</i>

167
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,250
<i>But I have no choice!</i>

168
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,460
Coro, last resort!

169
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,290
Berserker!

170
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,520
<i>So they have a secret skill, too.</i>

171
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,690
Oh, no—

172
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,900
Mine!

173
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,240
Crush her to death!

174
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
Sheele!

175
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,180
I made it just in time!

176
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,140
<i>My body...</i>

177
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,430
<i>won't move.</i>

178
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,950
Justice is served!

179
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,390
She—

180
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,050
Sheele!

181
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,770
How dare you...

182
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,000
How dare you do that to Sheele?

183
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,200
This broken arm won't stop me!

184
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,380
What?

185
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,300
What is this?

186
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,840
Be careful! We don't know what might happen!

187
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,950
<i>Extase...</i>

188
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,970
Sheele!

189
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,180
That woman...

190
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,790
She's still fighting in that state?

191
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,750
Please get out of here, Mine!

192
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,460
B-But...

193
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,070
<i>Mine...</i>

194
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,020
<i>I'm glad...</i>

195
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,530
<i>I was useful in the end.</i>

196
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,950
Coro!

197
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,950
Hurry up and finish her!

198
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,210
<i>Night Raid...</i>

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,710
<i>The place where I belonged.</i>

200
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,490
Congratulations on Getting Your Own Imperial Arms

201
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,100
<i>I loved all of you...</i>

202
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,790
<i>It was so much fun.</i>

203
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,610
<i>My apologies, Tatsumi...</i>

204
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,490
<i>I won't</i>

205
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,430
<i>be able to hold you any longer.</i>

206
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,460
Wh-What was that light just now?

207
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,690
Hey, are you okay, Seryu?

208
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,660
I did it!

209
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,280
If she abandoned her friend like evil-doers do, 
it would have been a great fight.

210
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,040
What a halfhearted person.

211
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,640
Daddy, I defeated one of the villains.

212
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,420
The light of justice shone upon the world!

213
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,240
Wh-Who did this?

214
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,260
Mine?

215
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,390
Hey, Mine!

216
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,220
Mine!

217
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,820
Wait, Tatsumi.

218
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,470
What will you do with that information?

219
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,870
Isn't it obvious?

220
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,980
Revenge!

221
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,520
Stop.

222
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,230
Jumping in without a plan will 
only increase the body count.

223
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,770
Our friend was just killed! You know?

224
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,730
I can't sit here and—

225
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,290
You're embarrassing yourself, Tatsumi!

226
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,280
Don't lose control!

227
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,060
Didn't we say that anyone 
could die at any moment?

228
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,010
You knew this when you agreed to join us!

229
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,160
<i>You were only doing your duty.</i>

230
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,010
<i>This is retribution.</i>

231
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,260
<i>I know all of this.</i>

232
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,970
<i>But you killed Sheele...</i>

233
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,660
<i>And you'll continue to hunt us down.</i>

234
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,480
<i>In that case...</i>

235
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,360
<i>Seryu Ubiquitous!</i>

236
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,590
<i>I will be the one to take you down!</i>

237
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,310
Sheele's death was not in vain.

238
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,290
The Capital should now understand.

239
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,300
It takes Imperial Arms to fight Imperial Arms!

240
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,800
Battles with Imperial Arms users will increase.

241
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,720
But that means more chances to collect them.

242
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,530
There will be more mortal struggles, Tatsumi.

243
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,780
Capital, I'm home.

244
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:40,940
Kill the Three 
— Part One —
