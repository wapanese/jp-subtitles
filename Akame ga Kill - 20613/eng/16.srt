1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,310
Now, then...

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,830
The battle between Imperial 
Arms users is about to begin.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,020
I wonder how many will die.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,330
Controlling eight dead bodies 
is tough, so she'll be sluggish.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,990
I won't waste this opportunity!

6
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,720
N-Natala...

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,560
Return him to the ground!

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,810
Isn't he a friend you grew up with?

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,230
What do you mean, Sis?

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,170
Because he's my friend,

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,540
I want to always be with him.

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,070
I'll add you to my collection, as well, Sis.

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,240
That way, we can be together, like long ago.

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,540
Don't be a fool!

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,760
Too bad.

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Magma Drive!</i>

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,630
<i>That Imperial Arms also 
has a long-ranged attack?</i>

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,060
Don't rush in alone!

19
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,970
This isn't like you, Akame!

20
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,810
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,770
They don't seem like an enemy 
we can easily defeat.

22
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,500
Kill the Puppets

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,330
Kill the Puppets

24
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,910
Sis...

25
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,540
You betrayed us and joined the likes of them.

26
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,740
Get them, Destaghoul!

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,730
So this is a mega-class Danger Beast's strength...

28
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,230
This is crazy!

29
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,190
The landscape's changed.

30
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,480
However,

31
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,840
I have to hand it to the notorious Night Raid.

32
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,910
You all dodged it.

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
<i>The battle's begun, huh?</i>

34
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,450
<i>I've got to do my part, too.</i>

35
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,640
<i>Najenda...</i>

36
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,300
<i>After this is over, maybe I'll 
confess my feelings to her.</i>

37
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,990
<i>If I don't act soon, 
Su might take her from me.</i>

38
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,020
What destructive power...

39
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,700
All right, we'll stop him together!

40
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,760
That command is a mistake, Najenda.

41
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,650
He is certainly powerful.

42
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,300
However...

43
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,340
I can deal with him myself.

44
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,280
Have everyone else go after the others.

45
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,910
As expected of my Imperial Arms...

46
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,080
If I could only take down Kurome...

47
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,310
This time, I'll snipe you for sure!

48
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,750
A gun user, huh?

49
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,720
Bring it!

50
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,080
<i>So this is a Danger Beast's carcass, too.</i>

51
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
<i>It's a type I've never seen before.</i>

52
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,400
<i>Another enemy?</i>

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,420
Unskilled... Skilled... Skilled...

54
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,390
<i>If my armor hadn't protected 
me, he would've gotten me.</i>

55
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,740
<i>What the hell is that thing?</i>

56
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,130
I failed... Failed...

57
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,630
That fire is dangerous.

58
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,210
I will finish him.

59
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,300
To come straight at me...

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,100
<i>Murasame is useless 
against a corpse puppet!</i>

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,030
Akame!

62
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,400
Huh?

63
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,000
Old man, you've sure done it now.

64
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,490
I can see through moves like...

65
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,450
I can't!

66
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,860
<i>My kinetic perception can't keep up!</i>

67
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,720
<i>He isn't even using an Imperial Arms!</i>

68
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,310
<i>This guy...</i>

69
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,760
Wow, it's a battle royal!

70
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,810
How fun!

71
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,060
Kurome...

72
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,730
See? Aren't my toys great?

73
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,780
Doya is an assassin from 
the northern tribes.

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,900
<i>She's super confident. 
You can tell by the expression on her face.</i>

75
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,420
Wall was a famous guardsman, 
but he was protecting my target,

76
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,790
so I killed him.

77
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,530
Ape-man is a meat-head, but he's easy 
to use, so he's one of my favorites.

78
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,290
Henter was a survivor from the savage tribes!

79
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,090
His moves are tricky, so I had 
a tough time killing him

80
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,430
He's my pride and joy.

81
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,530
Rokugoh was a former general for the capital.

82
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,850
He's a traitor, who tried to join the 
Revolutionary Army, so I assassinated him.

83
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,130
I found Destaghoul while he was hibernating.

84
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,350
I sure was lucky!

85
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,440
And...

86
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,030
Natala is a childhood friend of mine!

87
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,700
While I use Yatsufusa, he protects me flawlessly.

88
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,570
Actually, I have another, but you'll 
have to wait a bit for the debut.

89
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,830
<i>There's another one we haven't even seen yet?</i>

90
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,420
<i>Damn it!</i>

91
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,780
<i>What?</i>

92
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,830
It's no use.

93
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,090
They're puppets.

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,260
Even if you pierce his heart, he'll keep moving.

95
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,720
That is, of course, unless you defeat me.

96
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,650
You're certainly strong, old man.

97
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,910
But...

98
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,840
I've adjusted to it now!

99
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,600
Using the same move, over and 
over, won't work on me!

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't let go, Leone!

101
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,410
General Rokugoh...

102
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,390
As my former colleague...

103
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,980
I will free you from this spell 
as quickly as possible.

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,920
I-It's been a while since 
I've seen the boss fight.

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,090
All right, my turn!

106
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,020
It isn't good to take your eyes off me.

107
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,350
If I see an opportunity, 
I'll mercilessly attack.

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,850
You've done it now.

109
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,190
You...

110
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,970
As far as opportunistic attacks,

111
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,490
it's the same for us.

112
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,170
Wow! Stopping the bleeding 
by yourself is impressive!

113
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,260
I'll show you what happens
 when you enrage a lion!

114
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,340
Don't rush in, Leone!

115
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,040
Kurome has guards.

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,350
First, support Akame.

117
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,140
After that, go after Kurome together.

118
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,610
This battle is between former generals.

119
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,660
He doesn't even have an 
Imperial Arms. I'll be fine.

120
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,670
Understood.

121
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,980
<i>Just you wait...</i>

122
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,820
<i>I'll get you later.</i>

123
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,490
I'm starting to want you in my collection.

124
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,170
We should have caught up to them 
by now. There's something off.

125
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,080
It is, indeed, strange.

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,480
Could this be a setup?

127
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,390
Perhaps their main target 
was Kurome and the rest.

128
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,560
So this territory is overrun by a gang of thieves...

129
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,440
It doesn't appear to be a coincidence.

130
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,900
They came, exactly as planned!

131
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,330
It's General Esdeath.

132
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,360
She's irresistible!

133
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,440
Then they must be cohorts of Night Raid.

134
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,180
Seryu, Run...

135
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,800
We're going to trample them.

136
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,630
Leave two or three alive but unable to move.

137
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
There's something I would like to ask.

138
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,190
<i>I can't jump in carelessly.</i>

139
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,300
<i>However...</i>

140
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,220
<i>She's seeking a gap to strike while moving.</i>

141
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,180
<i>I'll create that gap for you!</i>

142
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,690
<i>I can do it!</i>

143
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,770
<i>He's even armored there!</i>

144
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,030
<i>It's specifically designed for Murasame.</i>

145
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,950
What an insane way to dodge!

146
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,960
May I ask one thing?

147
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,480
Akame, why did you join
 the Revolutionary Army?

148
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,780
If we had remained as allies,
 it would have been reassuring.

149
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,350
Because my heart decided 
that this was the right path.

150
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
I merely chose to walk the path I believe in.

151
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,260
That's easy to understand.

152
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,590
Thank you.

153
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,080
However...

154
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,130
Incinerating you, along 
with that belief, is my job!

155
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,110
Let me in on this, too!

156
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,470
Now it's two against two.

157
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,090
Leone!

158
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,300
Don't mind this.

159
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,760
Focus on the battle for now!

160
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,030
They're strong. Be careful.

161
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,060
Right...

162
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,660
Let's defeat Bols, 
and head straight for Kurome.

163
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,400
<i>Because of the wound Esdeath gave me,</i>

164
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,320
<i>my strength is only about forty 
percent of the normal amount.</i>

165
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,780
<i>I can move more than I expected!</i>

166
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,290
That's Earth Shaker!

167
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm well aware of your moves...

168
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,380
They've been ingrained in me from training!

169
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,890
<i>Reel Assault!</i>

170
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,650
Let's go for a drink, Naje!

171
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,870
J-Just how grossly does this Imperial Arms 
attempt to desecrate people?!

172
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,920
Looks like we're both pretty tenacious.

173
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,540
Although it's rotting, it's still a mega-class.

174
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,870
As expected, it's tough.

175
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,650
That's true, but also...

176
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,460
Take a look, Najenda.

177
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,710
That protrusion bothers me very much.

178
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,710
That area is asymmetrical.

179
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,600
Just now, I was hit because I was 
paying too much attention to it.

180
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,590
You...

181
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,380
How can you be so impressive, 
but simultaneously, so bizarre?

182
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,700
<i>Regardless, if someone doesn't 
reach Kurome soon,</i>

183
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,270
<i>there may actually be a casualty.</i>

184
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,200
Susanoo! As your master, 
I authorize the use of your secret ability.

185
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,060
Affirmative.

186
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,070
<i>Their coordinated attacks are dangerous!</i>

187
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,410
<i>If one of them slowed down, for even a second...</i>

188
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,290
A...

189
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,510
A...

190
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,770
Ally...

191
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,520
It's exactly as Akame said.

192
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,960
The dead bodies that Yatsufusa controls

193
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,780
don't have their own will.

194
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,150
But deep-seated habits and 
strong emotions remain.

195
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,990
Unfortunately for you, I'm not one 
of your allies that has perished.

196
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,700
Nice.

197
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,380
He shouldn't be able to move further.

198
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,650
You saved me, Chelsea!

199
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,830
I'm leaving the monkey to you, Tatsumi!

200
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,920
<i>That plan was pretty bold, even for me.</i>

201
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,100
<i>I don't think I can call Sheele 
or Bulat failures anymore.</i>

202
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,930
<i>Later, I'll have the one who made me feel 
this way take responsibility for it.</i>

203
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,150
<i>If it's only you, this'll be simple. 
I already know your moves.</i>

204
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,280
<i>Using dead people as your toys...</i>

205
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,950
<i>What a repulsive Imperial Arms!</i>

206
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,260
Rest in peace!

207
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,970
<i>Lately, it feels like my snack 
time has been shortened.</i>

208
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,680
<i>I wonder if Wave is okay.</i>

209
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,190
<i>He's pretty stubborn, so I'm sure he's still alive.</i>

210
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,250
<i>Huh?</i>

211
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,790
<i>Rokugoh and Henter aren't moving.</i>

212
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,150
<i>Ape-man, too!</i>

213
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,270
<i>I have no choice.</i>

214
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,650
<i>The eighth should soon start to move, anyway.</i>

215
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,570
<i>I'll go again, as well.</i>

216
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,900
<i>What an intense attack...</i>

217
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,630
<i>If I hadn't blocked it with Grand Chariot, 
I'd have died instantly.</i>

218
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,990
<i>If I don't hurry, Bols and Kurome will be in danger.</i>

219
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,260
<i>She's strong but there's something 
spontaneous about her.</i>

220
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,000
<i>Almost childlike...</i>

221
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,260
<i>I have to do my part.</i>

222
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,600
Damn it.

223
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,010
Just how far was I launched?

224
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,110
You were pretty skilled.

225
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,110
But you're up against the wrong girl.

226
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,240
I'm a genius marksman.

227
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,000
Huh?

228
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,320
Wh-What the hell is this?!

229
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,040
Oh, you're already being attacked!

230
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,200
That's Kaiser Frog. He's new.

231
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,230
He's a dangerous frog whose stomach 
acid can disintegrate anything.

232
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,630
Stop—

233
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,650
I heard from Seryu that Coro ate your friend.

234
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,640
Then that means you'll die a similar death.

235
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,400
L-Like hell, I'm going to die

236
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,350
this way!

237
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,790
The end of life is always brief.

238
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,400
Bye-bye.

239
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,270
Now, then. We'll move on to—

240
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,570
I found you.

241
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,060
Just because you're Akame's sister,

242
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,460
it doesn't mean I'll go easy on you, Kurome!

243
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,810
Hey, not bad.

244
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,670
But Natala is ten times 
stronger than that ape.

245
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,180
<i>Chaos Soul Manifestation!</i>

246
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,180
<i>Susanoo's hidden ability is "Madman."</i>

247
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,750
<i>With his chest, he sucks the 
life force from his master,</i>

248
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,770
<i>and manifests that power.</i>

249
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,880
<i>If used three times, it will certainly</i>

250
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,730
<i>be the death of the master,</i>

251
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,080
<i>but the power he gains is tremendous.</i>

252
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,540
<i>Mirror of Yata!</i>

253
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,270
<i>Gathering Clouds of Heaven!</i>

254
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,440
<i>Even in Incursio, he's as strong as I am!</i>

255
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,820
<i>No, maybe even stronger!</i>

256
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,950
Everything seems to be going well.

257
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,670
What's wrong?

258
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,410
She's struggling inside.

259
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,490
But the potent stomach acid...

260
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,590
Aw, he's leaking.

261
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,170
There's no point, then.

262
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,240
That was the worst experience ever.

263
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,050
Huh? What are you doing?

264
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,300
I was in trouble!

265
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,460
Help me, damn it! For crying out loud...

266
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,870
And don't look this way, you pervert!

267
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,250
You're being unreasonable!

268
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,000
Leave it at that, you two.

269
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,420
The battle isn't over yet!

270
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,540
Boss!

271
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,060
What is that? Su, you look awesome!

272
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,130
You wondered how many would die.

273
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,510
This is it, Kurome.

274
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,560
I get it.

275
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,080
If that's the case,

276
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,150
I'll kill you all, here and now.

277
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,450
And maybe I'll have you all become my puppets.

278
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,420
Here we go!

279
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,080
Right!

280
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,990
But they can't escape by air.

281
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,880
Go!

282
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,220
What?

283
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,910
<i>Regardless of whether 
the guard gets in my way,</i>

284
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,640
<i>we'll outsmart them, 
and get rid of him first!</i>

285
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,010
Wall!

286
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
You're paying too much 
attention to Akame!

287
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,850
That guard can't move anymore.

288
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,090
You're mine!

289
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,570
What?

290
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,490
<i>A hidden lance?</i>

291
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,030
<i>My arm...</i>

292
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,800
As expected, I can't eat it.

293
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,510
She bit off my Imperial Arms.

294
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,840
Wall!

295
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,220
You can't use your Imperial 
Arms anymore, can you?

296
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,850
<i>She's right, it's useless.</i>

297
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,230
<i>Then...</i>

298
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,470
<i>I'll destroy everything.</i>

299
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,860
Wait, don't tell me...

300
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Curse
