1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,190
Tatsumi died because he was weak.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,440
That's all there is to it.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,830
But what is this feeling?

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,920
It's General Esdeath!

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,130
She's the only one left.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:24,870
Get her!

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,200
A pathetic kingdom like this...

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,590
Don't!

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,460
...should be eradicated!

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,630
So you're Akame...

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,530
You've lost.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,630
The empire has lost.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,910
But my hunt continues.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,190
Your hunt?

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,290
The war's over.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll move on to the next battlefield.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,420
And if I don't find it, I'll simply create one.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,510
For the sake of peace in the new world,

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,420
I can't let someone like you live.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,140
I don't need your tedious speech.

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,220
If you want to stop me,

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,220
show me your strength!

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,500
<i>Esdeath...</i>

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,570
<i>Just as I predicted, you're the 
last one standing in the way.</i>

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Akame,

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,310
kill Esdeath!

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,980
Eliminate.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,900
I'll crush you.

29
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,690
Freeze.

30
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,260
As expected of the infamous Akame...

31
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,070
This is fantastic!

32
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,260
Esdeath,

33
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,980
why continue to create and kill enemies?

34
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,010
What will be left in the end?

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,970
The winner.

36
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,400
That's just a butcher, standing on 
a mound of corpses.

37
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,300
Those words don't offend me in the least.

38
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,780
If you value your life,

39
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,930
drop your sword and become my subordinate.

40
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,330
No.

41
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,530
If you cannot, you'll die.

42
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,990
That's how this world works, right?

43
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,950
You're wrong!

44
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,970
Everyone wants to live...

45
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,330
Everyone wanted to live...

46
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
Lives aren't meant to be trampled on!

47
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,590
I cannot comprehend what you're saying!

48
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,350
Pierce through.

49
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,410
What's wrong?

50
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,740
Is this all you have?

51
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,390
The weak have no right to stand before me.

52
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,240
Those without strength should 
not have hopes and dreams.

53
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,690
Lie down and die before me, 
like a pig should.

54
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,810
What do you think people are?

55
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,270
I have no interest in the weak.

56
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,320
Esdeath!

57
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,320
Oh?

58
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,360
You'll finally show me what you're made of.

59
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,260
So this is your trump card.

60
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,350
I've killed countless people...

61
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,490
Grief, sorrow, rage, resentment.

62
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,860
The Murasame remembers

63
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,200
all the lives I've taken.

64
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,160
I accept responsibility for all of them.

65
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,490
This is the turning point.

66
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,660
You are no longer human.

67
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,500
A trump card worthy of a demonic sword.

68
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,360
Even if this consumes me,

69
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,050
I'll defeat you.

70
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,070
Why, you...

71
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,710
How amusing.

72
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,360
This is indeed amusing!

73
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,240
This is worth the sacrifice of an arm.

74
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,090
Let's do this.

75
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,660
Let's fight each other to the death!

76
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,450
<i>This form won't last much longer.</i>

77
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,000
<i>I must finish this</i>

78
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,830
<i>with my next move!</i>

79
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,500
You have my full attention...

80
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,800
Come.

81
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,580
<i>Makahadoma!</i>

82
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,320
This is the second time I've been 
forced to use my trump.

83
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,050
I applaud you.

84
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,170
This was fun.

85
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,800
An afterimage?

86
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,520
Where did you go?

87
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,270
Aboveâ€”

88
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,070
Eliminate.

89
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,600
How...

90
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,570
could you break through the Makahadoma?

91
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,330
Your trump card that took Susanoo's life...

92
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,690
I was waiting for you to use it.

93
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,540
That was part of your plan.

94
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,150
The afterimage you saw was your bloodlust.

95
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,170
I stabbed your inflated ideal of hunting.

96
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,960
Mission accomplished.

97
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,510
You really are interesting...

98
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,880
Where does such strength derive?

99
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,230
From all the lives for which I am responsible.

100
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,190
Those are what gave me strength.

101
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,750
You plan to continue being dragged 
down by others' souls?

102
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,790
That's right.

103
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,530
I cannot possibly understand.

104
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,310
However, a loss is a loss.

105
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,200
I suppose it is time to die.

106
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,020
Tatsumi...

107
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,100
Esdeath!

108
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,130
Tatsumi,

109
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,490
I wish that you had been beside me.

110
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,270
<i>Those feelings you have for Tatsumi</i>

111
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,310
<i>are exactly what you said you 
couldn't possibly understand.</i>

112
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,750
Captain...

113
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,070
Rest in peace.

114
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,340
The wise are those who win in the end.

115
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,850
As long as I'm alive,

116
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,270
I can try again and again.

117
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,120
Found you.

118
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,490
I won't let a piece of crap like you escape.

119
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,390
Someone...

120
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,310
Isn't anyone there?

121
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,730
You're the one who avoided detection.

122
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,940
I need you to die now.

123
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,270
Don't come any closer.

124
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,920
What?

125
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,620
Huh?

126
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,470
Fool!

127
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,000
This is the power of my Imperial Arms.

128
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,710
Concealing your trump card is critical.

129
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,840
Now, since you're guilty of scaring me,

130
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,510
you get the death penalty.

131
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,200
Well, well...

132
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,030
I said this about the emperor, too,

133
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,310
but dealing with fools is tiring.

134
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,860
H-How do you have

135
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,820
so much strength...

136
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,920
I grew up in the slums, so my body's tough.

137
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,170
You can't imagine what that's like, can you?

138
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,140
Even if you stop my Imperial Arms,

139
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,940
my soul is stronger...

140
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,110
than whatever rotten thing you have for one!

141
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,920
Ah, it's finally over!

142
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,680
Night Raid's done, huh?

143
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,920
Yeah.

144
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,470
Goodbye, my friend.

145
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,750
Leone, you...

146
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,560
Don't give me that look.

147
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,940
I'll be able to see everyone now.

148
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,250
There... That's a nice smile.

149
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,740
See ya.

150
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,410
See you, Leone.

151
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,770
Cheers to the revolution!

152
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,610
I'm not gonna live in poverty anymore!

153
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,820
But if you keep messing around, 
you're just gonna stay poor.

154
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,750
Good point!

155
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,030
Hey, Leone...

156
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,200
Have a drink with us.

157
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,030
Hey, old man!

158
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,030
Get Leone a drink, too, will ya?

159
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,440
Come on, Leone...

160
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,030
Huh?

161
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,880
The guillotine, I see.

162
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,270
That's what must be done 
to set things straight.

163
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,380
Yes.

164
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,100
I failed as an emperor...

165
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,240
But I have one last task.

166
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,430
Yes.

167
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,640
If I cry now, I'd be a laughingstock.

168
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,910
I would, at least, like to die with honor.

169
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,080
Please build a peaceful kingdom 
without any more bloodshed.

170
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,820
<i>You have my vow.</i>

171
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,790
<i>This will be the last drop of blood shed.</i>

172
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,650
Kurome,

173
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm going to do my best to protect 
the new kingdom's peace.

174
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
For your sake, as well.

175
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,980
And I shall do my best from 
within the government

176
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,440
for everyone's future.

177
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,380
I wish you could give us some 
of your strength, Captain.

178
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,280
I wonder if she was able to meet Tatsumi.

179
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,580
I bet he's running away from her again...

180
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,020
Now, shall we go?

181
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,540
There is much to do.

182
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,350
It's more than we've ever gotten.

183
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,850
Thanks to Tatsumi and the others, 
no one else has starved...

184
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,990
Since there's a new kingdom,

185
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,980
maybe Tatsumi, Sayo, and Ieyasu 
will be coming back.

186
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
Yeah.

187
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,270
Our heroes are returning.

188
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,140
We'll welcome them home with 
an extravagant celebration.

189
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,890
People really are strong.

190
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
The city is already restoring itself.

191
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,720
Boss,

192
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,300
are you all right?

193
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,420
Yeah.

194
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,580
My lifespan was merely shortened.

195
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,410
While I don't know how long I'll live...

196
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,300
I'll gladly use the rest of my life to help 
build the kingdom's foundation.

197
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,510
As a survivor, that's the best I can do.

198
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,510
I believe in you.

199
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,030
Do your best.

200
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,470
Are you going to leave, Akame?

201
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,980
Yeah.

202
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,020
You can place all the Revolutionary 
Army's wrongdoings on me.

203
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,770
Thanks and I'm sorry.

204
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,860
That's a difficult role.

205
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,820
Your role in helping build the new 
kingdom is far more difficult.

206
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,790
There was a lot of heartache.

207
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,190
But I'm glad you invited me into Night Raid,

208
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,010
Najenda.

209
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah.

210
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,220
It's been fun.

211
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,630
Farewell.

212
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,450
<i>Survive, Akame.</i>

213
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,540
Night Raid.

214
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,320
The end of the Imperial Era.

215
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,560
They were known as the criminal organization 
that caused an uproar in the capital.

216
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,570
However, no trace of them remains

217
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,240
in the new kingdom's historical records.

218
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,600
Where there is life, there is darkness.

219
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,570
Where there is darkness, there is evil.

220
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,680
To protect those who are unarmed, 
and to punish the evildoers

221
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,260
that heaven cannot judge in the shadows...

222
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,520
We are all assassins.

223
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,920
<i>I survived...</i>

224
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,750
<i>So I must continue to bear on my shoulders</i>

225
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,720
<i>the feelings of those who've passed.</i>

226
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,980
<i>I can only kill.</i>

227
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,750
<i>However, that doesn't mean I have no future.</i>

228
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,210
<i>I have faith.</i>

229
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,510
<i>That's why...</i>

230
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,540
<i>I will continue to walk this path.</i>

231
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,880
Eliminate.
