1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,360
Lately, I've heard that

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,610
the new breed of Danger Beasts have 
been appearing around here quite often.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,560
Make sure you don't go out alone.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,820
Yes, I know.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,030
Wha—

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,800
No... Please don't...

7
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,690
Kill the Nuisances

8
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,620
Due to the Jaegers,

9
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,520
most of the rebels around the 
capital have been purged.

10
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,150
Kill the Nuisances

11
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
Perhaps it's because they cower in your presence,

12
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,990
but Night Raid has also stayed hidden.

13
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,210
Splendid.

14
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,260
Yes, my lord.

15
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,240
As soon as Night Raid shows themselves, 
we shall take care of them swiftly.

16
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,320
Very well.

17
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,390
That's fine and all,

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,730
but we can't seem to find a guy 
who meets all your standards.

19
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,000
If you don't like the minister, 
then how about his son?

20
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,210
He has a really promising future.

21
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,640
My lord,

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,340
as previously reported, I have 
found someone on my own.

23
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,720
There's no need to worry.

24
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,060
But he disappeared, right?

25
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,060
Then you guys can't fall in love.

26
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,050
I am passionate about getting him back.

27
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,440
I believe that is a part of love.

28
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,580
That's deep!

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,280
I don't think that's actually deep.

30
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,290
Seems like the emperor been
 affected by you, as well,

31
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,970
and has become interested in love himself.

32
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,640
A few more years, and I'll give him women,

33
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,300
alcohol, and the most delicious foods, 
sending him into depravity.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,210
I'll ensure he makes many sweet memories.

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,090
Don't let him get any adult diseases.

36
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,000
So, I have another request for you, General.

37
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,390
Speak.

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,690
The new kind of Danger Beast that's 
appeared around the capital...

39
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,730
I'd like you to capture and suppress them.

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,290
Ah, that.

41
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,440
I've been looking into that matter myself.

42
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,740
At first, they appeared in dense forests and mines...

43
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,970
But the other day,

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,210
they evidently forced their way into 
a house and attacked the owners.

45
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,450
Then ate them.

46
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,020
Exactly.

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,950
I heard they resemble humans pretty closely.

48
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,090
Don't you think they sound like amusing toys?

49
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,350
Commander-in-Chief Budou has 
given the order to crush them,

50
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,510
but I'd definitely like to study them.

51
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,260
Very well.

52
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,850
I heard they were ferocious Danger 
Beasts, so I wanted to hunt them.

53
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,790
I'll bring back two or three alive.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,110
Send the reward to the troops I left up north.

55
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,300
I see you're kind to your subordinates, as usual.

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,260
The more devoted, the more likely soldiers 
are to risk their lives to fight for me.

57
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,750
That's one of the reasons my army is so powerful.

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,330
How promising...

59
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,520
Make sure you bring back a lively one.

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,050
Let's hurry up and enter the 
capital while it's still light.

61
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,340
I know.

62
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,890
Let's get the hell out of this dangerous area.

63
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,600
Th-There they are!

64
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,440
I made it in time.

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,860
This should finish you.

66
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,830
Everyone, there's nothing to fear anymore.

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,090
Um, I defeated the Danger Beasts, so...

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,210
You don't have to quiver in fear like that...

69
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,210
It's all right now.

70
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,480
The flames of justice burned through evil!

71
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,860
You must be soldiers from the capital.

72
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,810
We're saved...

73
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,970
Um... Well, you know...

74
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,150
Don't take it personally, Bols.

75
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,320
Those people...

76
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,280
seem to have calmed down! Thank goodness!

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,030
As planned,

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,010
those that ran away were frozen and 
have been successfully captured.

79
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,470
I see... This is definitely a type I've never seen.

80
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,200
Don't eat them.

81
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,450
Wave, Kurome... The tea's ready.

82
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,070
Thanks.

83
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,120
Oh, thank you, as always.

84
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,910
No problem at all. 
I do this because I enjoy it.

85
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,960
What's the matter, Wave?

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
It just makes me angry.

87
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,550
You're a nice person, Bols.

88
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,920
And yet, those merchants you saved back there...

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,930
Everyone judges you by appearances!

90
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,910
Like you can talk?

91
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,430
Eh?

92
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,810
That's right!

93
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,480
Wave, I've said this before, 
but I'm not a nice person.

94
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,100
I've burned and killed a whole village's population

95
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,340
because they were infected with a disease.

96
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,500
And even burned someone who was proclaiming 
their innocence because I was ordered to.

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,740
So...

98
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm hated by countless numbers of people.

99
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,140
But as a soldier, you were just ordered to...

100
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,880
I know that someone has to do it, and it's my job.

101
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,020
I believe getting that kind of 
reaction from those I save

102
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,590
is my recompense.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,790
Bols, that's too harsh!

104
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,000
If you want, I'd be more than happy to listen—

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,680
Honey!

106
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,480
Papa!

107
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,770
What's this?

108
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,470
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,570
Well, you forgot the lunch we made together!

110
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,410
Oh, how could I?

111
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,790
Papa, you're silly!

112
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,240
Since your job is so demanding,

113
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,370
you need to be sure to keep up your strength.

114
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,710
Right! I'll be more careful.

115
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,170
Papa, pick me up!

116
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,000
There, there. What a good girl.

117
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,680
Thank you, Wave.

118
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,580
My wife and daughter know everything I've done,

119
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,850
and they still cheer me on.

120
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,600
That's why,

121
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,090
no matter how hard things are, I'm perfectly fine.

122
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,070
S-So bright... Is this love?

123
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,000
Or rather, I'm useless again.

124
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,680
Oh, you...

125
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,010
Don't merely use your entire body.

126
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,670
No matter how sturdy something appears,

127
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,030
it should have some weakness.

128
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,030
Wow...

129
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,840
If you can discover that in battle, 
it'll be very effective.

130
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,040
True.

131
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,110
But I wonder if I'll be able to find 
someone's weakness while fighting.

132
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,970
If I'm unable to, it bothers me.

133
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,550
You must be a natural, Su.

134
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,440
Of course. I'm an Imperial Arms, 
made to look after my master.

135
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,760
I would never let a change in those 
who serve my master go unnoticed.

136
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,840
I understand. But it's really reassuring.

137
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,400
With you around, I think we won't have 
to lose another one of us eight!

138
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm an Imperial Arms.

139
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,210
You do not have to count me as a person.

140
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,810
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,530
You're definitely one of us!

142
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,330
One of you, huh?

143
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,610
I don't really understand.

144
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,180
To be one of you means to 
fight alongside you, right?

145
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,340
Eh? Well, yeah, but...

146
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,670
We also help each other out.

147
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,550
I know!

148
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,100
Su, you're really good-looking,

149
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,970
so you should help Lubba and me 
when we go look for hot chicks.

150
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,390
I don't really understand, but...

151
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,890
If that is what you wish, I shall 
do whatever I can to help.

152
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,810
Okay!

153
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,140
Su! Tatsumi!

154
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,780
We got an emergency summons. Hurry back.

155
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,620
Emergency? Why?

156
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,230
Evidently, Danger Beasts have 
appeared around the capital,

157
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,660
causing a lot of trouble.

158
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,120
We're to eradicate them, while we 
head to our new hideout.

159
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
The capital, huh?

160
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,010
You know...

161
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,510
This doesn't really feel like a new hideout.

162
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,980
If you think about how hard it is to 
find, and how easy it is to flee,

163
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,270
of course it seems like our old hideout.

164
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,390
Well, it's nice to have a hot spring again.

165
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,430
When we're done with work, 
let's have a drink there.

166
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,610
Sounds good!

167
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,290
Miss Najenda,

168
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,170
I've finished erecting a barrier around the base.

169
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,970
Good.

170
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,040
I've finished digging an emergency 
escape tunnel, as well.

171
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,710
Oh, that was fast. Well done, Susanoo.

172
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,360
Don't think you've won just yet.

173
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,880
What are you talking about?

174
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,750
I know we just got here,

175
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,760
but our enemy this time is the new Danger Beast.

176
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,640
They tend to act in packs, and seem 
to possess some intelligence.

177
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,690
Physically, they are quite strong,

178
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,270
and most of the fighters who have 
challenged them have lost.

179
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,850
People and livestock around the

180
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,160
dense forests and mines south of 
the capital have been attacked.

181
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,280
Apparently, the Jaegers and the capital soldiers 
have been exterminating them daily.

182
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,790
But their numbers aren't dropping, 
and casualties have become great.

183
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,670
Considering the trouble the capital 
seems to be having with this,

184
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,880
it doesn't seem to be a trap.

185
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,760
Simply put, we're going to end 
up helping the capital.

186
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,140
Got it?

187
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,280
Of course!

188
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,320
This time, it can't be helped.

189
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,640
Considering what we just heard, 
they should be taken care of at once.

190
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,150
But I'd like to avoid bumping 
heads with the soldiers.

191
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,010
We are Night Raid.

192
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,570
We can simply move at night, 
when the capital's side rests.

193
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,270
Oh, right.

194
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,450
Putting ourselves in danger and 
exterminating some monsters...

195
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,270
We should just leave this to the Jaegers.

196
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,790
You guys really are naïve.

197
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,500
I understand what you're saying.

198
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,550
But even now, those things might
 be attacking more people.

199
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,690
We're assassins, but I believe 
we're on the people's side!

200
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,370
I want to annihilate them as soon as possible, 
so we can save even more people!

201
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,790
Well, I thought you'd say that.

202
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,570
Got it, got it.

203
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,680
Tatsumi...

204
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,220
There's one thing I'd like to say to you.

205
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,060
Su?

206
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,450
Your fly is down! It's bothering me, 
so please close it.

207
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,580
And you almost looked cool! How lame!

208
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,510
Hey, how do you feel right now?

209
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,510
Well?

210
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,800
That's what you get for trying to act cool.

211
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,350
Shut up!

212
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,850
I'm sorry, Tatsumi.

213
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,790
I noticed it, but I thought it was 
some sort of fashion statement.

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,690
I'm not someone that free and open!

215
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,800
From now on, I'll be more careful, 
and take a look now and then.

216
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,320
No, please don't!

217
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,200
"We're on the people's side." 
And your fly was totally down.

218
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,450
Don't make me take you down, Lubba!

219
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,050
Don't worry about it.

220
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,730
Your fly was open for the people's sake, right?

221
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,830
Sis, not you, too!

222
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,560
This is how we are.

223
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,960
I apologize for any trouble we cause you, Chelsea.

224
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,840
That's fine and all, but I'm worried.

225
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,880
From what I saw in Sheele and Bulat's records,

226
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,950
that kindness seems like it 
will take Tatsumi's life.

227
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,200
Run, I'll tell you this...

228
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,150
According to the minister's findings, 
those Danger Beasts were once human.

229
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,690
As I suspected.

230
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,500
I thought their physical appearance was quite similar.

231
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,810
Turning humans into Danger Beasts...

232
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,240
The only one who'd be able to do 
that is an Imperial Arms user.

233
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,320
Those Danger Beasts may have been 
the Doctor's experiments.

234
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,880
Right after he disappeared, they started to appear.

235
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,510
Have you any other proof?

236
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,750
When we examined his lab, it looked pretty plain.

237
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,710
He should have been doing all sorts of experiments,

238
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,520
but it was a bit quiet.

239
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,990
So he might have had a separate secret lab?

240
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,230
Yes, perhaps those he was holding 
there escaped into the open.

241
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,310
It could be someone totally unrelated 
and their Imperial Arms,

242
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,620
but that seems like too much coincidence.

243
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,850
Meaning, it's possible it wasn't

244
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,860
that the Doctor was trying to find 
Tatsumi and ran into the enemy,

245
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,270
but that, after finding the enemy hideout, 
he tried to capture them as test subjects

246
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,540
and was eliminated instead.

247
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,760
Apparently, that man might have been 
much further gone than we thought.

248
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,110
If those Danger Beasts are a product 
of the Doctor's experiments,

249
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,800
their numbers should be limited.

250
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,750
So this problem should resolve itself eventually.

251
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,010
That doesn't end this problem.

252
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,630
Did those things escape on their own?

253
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,530
Or did someone release them?

254
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,950
I understand.

255
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,500
I shall look into various things 
regarding this matter.

256
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,140
I'm counting on you.

257
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,540
This could be a deep-rooted problem.

258
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,360
But it's rather rare for you to be admiring flowers.

259
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,810
Right...

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,420
If you rub these flowers into wounds, 
it causes intense pain.

261
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,520
They're great for light torture.

262
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,310
I shall keep that in mind.

263
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,110
You evildoers that threaten the lives 
of those who live around the capital!

264
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,110
Coro, number one!

265
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,520
<i>Shinko's Ball of Justice!</i>

266
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,790
Coro, eat the weakened evil!

267
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,500
<i>So those are the Jaegers I've been hearing about.</i>

268
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,880
<i>I see, they're rather strong.</i>

269
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,880
There, there. Are you full now?

270
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,550
<i>I'll have you play with my toys a while longer.</i>

271
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,360
I'm paired with a guy?

272
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,810
You don't have to sound so depressed about it.

273
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,300
There aren't any capital soldiers 
hiding out here, are there?

274
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,940
You don't have to be so freaked out.

275
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,070
You know...

276
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Cowardice is extremely important 
for an assassin's survival.

277
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,870
Miss Najenda said that, too. Don't forget it.

278
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,460
By the way, I was thinking 
about this earlier, but...

279
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,910
What?

280
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,160
You call the boss "Miss Najenda."

281
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,640
Well... Well, you know...

282
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,020
We've known each other since 
she was in the Imperial Army.

283
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,770
Out in the country, I was the fourth 
son of a wealthy merchant.

284
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,780
Ever since I was a kid,

285
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,310
I had whatever I wanted, and could 
do effectively anything.

286
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,570
So I was rather bored with the world.

287
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,020
Man, you're an ass.

288
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,160
This is the sad part! Listen up!

289
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,140
That was when Miss Najenda was 
assigned to the city where I lived.

290
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,290
It was love at first sight.

291
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,360
So I enlisted as a soldier,

292
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,030
and used my skills to become one of 
the soldiers working beside her.

293
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,360
Then the reason that you're in Night Raid...

294
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,230
You could say that it's my love for her.

295
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,290
When I left the capital,

296
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,650
I made sure the records said I was dead.

297
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,450
Isn't it tragic?

298
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,800
And I'll never be rewarded...

299
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,330
It's sad. Makes you cry, doesn't it?

300
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,900
Lubba...

301
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,280
First off, then don't try to peep 
at other women in the bath!

302
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,160
Huh?

303
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,210
Having someone you love is different 
than the need to look at cute girls!

304
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,400
What the hell are you talking about?

305
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,890
That's why you'll never be rewarded!

306
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,160
Just wait... One day, I'll make her fall for me.

307
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,850
And when that happens, I'll treat 
you to whatever you want.

308
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,180
But it doesn't look like any Danger 
Beasts are around here.

309
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,650
Maybe the ones in the mountains 
have all been hunted.

310
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,490
I've got my wires laid out, but nothing's 
been caught on them yet.

311
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,280
All right.

312
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,910
If it's safe over here, I'm gonna 
go take a look at the summit.

313
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,040
If you spot something, run. 
We'll attack together.

314
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,410
Got it.

315
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,010
<i>I don't see anything that resembles what 
we're seeking. Or anything alive.</i>

316
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,140
I wonder if they're sleeping...

317
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,460
Despite being on night patrol,

318
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,510
I'm out here, taking a moonlit 
stroll because it's pretty.

319
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,910
That isn't like me at all.

320
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,240
<i>The reason I've become this strange...</i>

321
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,250
<i>It's all your fault, Tatsumi.</i>

322
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,890
<i>Someone's shadow?</i>

323
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,020
<i>A Danger Beast?</i>

324
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,340
<i>If it is, it's rather unlucky.</i>

325
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,870
<i>I was just in a rather bad mood.</i>

326
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,220
Wh-What?

327
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,440
You'll have to deal with me.

328
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,190
I'll test out my new torture method—

329
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,690
Eh?

330
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,970
Tatsumi...

331
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,850
<i>Wh-Why is Esdeath here?</i>

332
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,740
<i>Is it coincidence?</i>

333
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,910
<i>It isn't like I could have predicted that 
she'd suddenly fall from the sky!</i>

334
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,230
<i>What should I do? What should I do? 
What should I do? What should I do?</i>

335
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,460
<i>Now they come out?!</i>

336
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,250
<i>Wait a sec. They look really strong.</i>

337
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,800
<i>I could use them as a distraction and escape.</i>

338
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,930
Apparently, that moment's passed, 
and now I can't escape...

339
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,060
Don't get in my way.

340
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,990
So this isn't a dream...

341
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,770
I've been looking forward to the 
day we'd be reunited, Tatsumi.

342
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,290
<i>Seriously, I wish it were a dream...</i>

343
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,850
<i>Also, why not put that thing out of its misery?</i>

344
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Giant Danger Beast

345
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
