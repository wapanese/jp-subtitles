1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,970
General Esdeath,

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,390
your victory over the northern 
region was outstanding.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,230
We have prepared ten thousand 
gold as your reward.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,400
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,850
I shall send it to the soldiers I left in the North.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,950
They will rejoice.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>Esdeath has no interest in authority 
or politics whatsoever.</i>

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,290
<i>To her, fighting and conquering 
the enemy is everything.</i>

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,730
<i>She is free to do as she pleases,</i>

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,620
<i>as I continue to control the kingdom.</i>

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,300
<i>Everyone wins...</i>

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,510
<i>What a perfect hand to play.</i>

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,320
As I have returned to the capital,

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,260
I shall be sure to annihilate Night Raid,

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,180
which has hindered my lord.

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,900
The task will be daunting.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,850
I'd like to offer the general 
more than simply gold.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,320
Is there anything you desire?

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,570
Let me see.

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,520
If I may...

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,610
Yes?

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,950
I was thinking I'd like to fall in love.

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,150
O-Oh, is that so?

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,400
You are, indeed, of age and still unmarried.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,580
Then let me offer some options.

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,110
What do you think of the minister?

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,420
My lord!

28
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,710
As much I appreciate it,

29
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,160
given the minister's high blood pressure, 
he may not live to see tomorrow.

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,030
How rude!

31
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,600
I am in perfect health.

32
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,550
Very well, then. What type 
would interest you, General?

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,060
I have very specific standards.

34
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,640
I don't believe there are many who fit my criteria.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,510
I shall have my preferences written down 
and eventually presented to you.

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,830
Kill the Three 
— Part One —

37
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,120
Kill the Three 
— Part One —

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,710
Mine...

39
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,170
I can eat on my own.

40
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,800
It will get cold.

41
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,590
Fine, then.

42
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,490
<i>Even though Sheele was killed,</i>

43
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,350
<i>Akame is so calm.</i>

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,770
<i>And to think the one who killed her</i>

45
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,150
<i>was that girl...</i>

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,210
<i>I'm starting to truly realize</i>

47
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,340
<i>how painful this line of work is.</i>

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,480
Indeed, it is strange

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,880
that I would find interest in something 
other than conflict and slaughter.

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,540
Ah, is this about love?

51
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,900
Even I am perplexed.

52
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,290
However, I cannot stop how I feel.

53
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,860
As a living being,

54
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,260
it's normal to be interested in the opposite sex.

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,720
<i>Though the word "love" doesn't suit you at all.</i>

56
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,340
I understand.

57
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,300
Then this is an animal instinct, too.

58
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,730
Well, for now, I'll simply take 
joy in hunting Night Raid.

59
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,420
About that...

60
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,210
I have quite a good idea.

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,070
I have a new directive for the three of you.

62
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,200
Give us any order, Lady Esdeath.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,950
We three are your loyal servants.

64
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,460
We'll accept any order, at any time!

65
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,780
Very well.

66
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,560
Jeez, it's cold.

67
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,090
I can't sleep...

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,950
Maybe some water.

69
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,260
Akame?

70
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,390
A midnight snack?

71
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,160
No.

72
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,890
This was one of Sheele's favorites.

73
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,770
<i>An offering for the deceased.</i>

74
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Since we work in shadows,

75
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,010
Sheele's name will probably never appear 
in the Revolutionary Army's records.

76
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,490
That's why I will remember as 
much as I can about her.

77
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,990
She may have been clumsy,

78
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,190
but she was the kindest among us.

79
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,170
I know.

80
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,910
She used to bring flowers to 
Sayo and Ieyasu's graves.

81
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,540
Yeah.

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,520
But...

83
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,590
You're amazing, Akame.

84
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,160
You're so composed, even though 
one of our friends died.

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,010
I guess you're used to it... I can't even—

86
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,790
Composed?

87
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,490
Used to it?

88
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,520
A-Akame?

89
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,450
It's true...

90
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,860
I've seen many lives fall before me.

91
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,030
However...

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,520
My precious friend just died!

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
This pain... No one can get used to this!

94
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,940
But these emotions would affect our next mission.

95
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,110
That's why I act like I'm fine!

96
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,450
We work in the shadows.

97
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,750
If I couldn't switch gears, what good would I be?

98
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,180
This... This is what you call composed?

99
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,630
E-Even I...

100
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,640
Since Sheele died, the pain I feel is...

101
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,140
is...

102
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,260
<i>To think that Akame would react like this.</i>

103
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,320
<i>That's right...</i>

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,360
<i>During my first mission, she was 
even worried about me.</i>

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

106
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>I can't lose my nerve...</i>

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,330
<i>Being miserable won't bring Sheele back!</i>

108
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,370
<i>I have to face forward like a man!</i>

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,840
<i>And this job may be dirty, but money is money.</i>

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,760
<i>At least I can keep them from 
starving until the revolution.</i>

111
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,990
<i>I have people that I want to make happy.</i>

112
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,580
Wh-What was that?

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,130
Are you all right, Tatsumi?

114
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,280
That was me switching gears.

115
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,550
Don't worry about me.

116
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,100
Anyway, I'm sorry, Akame.

117
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,590
I was inconsiderate.

118
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,480
I'll make you a promise.

119
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,360
I will not die!

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I won't make you sad!

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,440
Tatsumi...

122
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,350
We'll welcome in a new kingdom,

123
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,280
with smiles on everyone's faces.

124
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,630
Yeah... You're right.

125
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,310
Damn it!

126
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,140
O-One more time, Akame!

127
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,660
Maybe you should rest a while.

128
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,690
At a time like this, who can rest?

129
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,880
Didn't I tell you?

130
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,280
Come at me, as though this were real.

131
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Here I come!

132
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,120
What are you doing, Bro?

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,940
If you're treating this as if it were real, 
shouldn't you mind your surroundings?

134
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,600
You never know where an enemy might be hiding.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,130
You're more fired-up than usual.

136
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,370
What's going on?

137
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,880
It's nothing.

138
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,100
I just want to get stronger.

139
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,430
I made a promise to Akame...

140
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,310
That I'd survive, no matter what!

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,640
Tatsumi...

142
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,240
You've learned quite a lot, haven't you?

143
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,270
You've grown.

144
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,640
All right, then!

145
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
Starting now, I'll be your opponent.

146
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,900
I'll train the hell out of you!

147
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,240
Bro...

148
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,350
My spear takes no prisoners!

149
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,410
What's wrong, Tatsumi?

150
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,370
Being fired-up won't keep you alive!

151
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,930
Right!

152
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,210
Okay, come!

153
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,970
Good luck.

154
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,010
This village is pretty bad, as well.

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,920
A nation is supposed to be made of its people.

156
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
The fact that you feel for these people

157
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,030
is why you're returning to that 
snake's nest of a capital.

158
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,230
I commend you, Father.

159
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,980
I can't stay in retirement while 
the people suffer like this.

160
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,160
I intend to fight that minister to the very end.

161
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,230
I will protect you, Father!

162
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,140
You've grown into a fine woman.

163
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,360
Perhaps you've grown too valiant to find a suitor.

164
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Th-That has nothing to do with anything!

165
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,440
Wh-What was that?

166
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,620
Bandits again?

167
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,750
How much has society crumbled?

168
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,170
I'll handle them as I did the others!

169
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,750
Don't lower your guard!

170
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,720
Daidara?

171
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,510
Yeah.

172
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,430
Here we go!

173
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,130
<i>He's too powerful!</i>

174
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,900
Not bad, lady...

175
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,610
But considering what's going to happen next,

176
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,120
it would've been better if you'd just died.

177
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,330
Y-You're soldiers from the capital.

178
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,290
Yes.

179
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,540
I deeply admired your political efforts.

180
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,420
Th-Then why are you after me?

181
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,130
Our master's orders...

182
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,390
...are, above all, absolute.

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,090
We defeated fifteen people, eh?

184
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay! The more experience I gain, 
the stronger I'll become.

185
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
Spread the flyers.

186
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,350
What an annoying way for 
the minister to handle this.

187
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,430
If it's getting rid of political opponents, 
why not frame them as usual?

188
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,840
That approach won't work for civil officials 
under General Budou's protection.

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,450
That sure was fun!

190
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,680
Nyau, stop playing around!

191
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,670
You've delivered the final blow, haven't you?

192
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,550
The girl died from shock 
while I was still skinning her.

193
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,780
What a creepy hobby.

194
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,900
Mission complete.

195
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,050
Time to return.

196
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,140
You're all here.

197
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,440
I have some bad news.

198
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,450
Esdeath has conquered the North, 
and has returned to the capital.

199
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,510
Leone,

200
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,760
go to the capital and observe her actions.

201
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Roger!

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,960
I've always wanted to know 
what kind of person she is.

203
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,680
She's a dangerous sadist who enjoys massacre.

204
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,740
Be on your guard.

205
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,170
All right, all right.

206
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,880
<i>Which means...</i>

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>She's someone I can take out 
if I get the chance, huh?</i>

208
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,660
<i>The highly sadistic general 
known as the capital's best.</i>

209
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,890
<i>Taking her out will be as good 
as taking out the minister.</i>

210
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,730
Also,

211
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,780
starting about the time of Esdeath's reappearance,

212
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,270
there have been a series of murders 
involving political officials.

213
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,440
The victims are four political officials 
and sixty-one of their guards.

214
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,930
The problem is that flyers, 
which claim to be from Night Raid,

215
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,700
were found at the crime scenes.

216
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,470
So they're trying to frame us...

217
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,930
But isn't that too obvious?

218
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,650
For us to start declaring our acts would be bizarre.

219
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,020
At first, that was my reaction.

220
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,550
But now, the crimes are thought to be our doing.

221
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,210
Why?

222
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,500
Those that were murdered 
all had top-notch guards.

223
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,970
As rebels, our killing them would make sense.

224
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,390
That means they're deliberately 
targeting powerful opponents.

225
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,600
The only ones capable of that are...

226
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,850
Those as powerful as we are.

227
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,770
In other words, Imperial Arms users.

228
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,110
I strongly believe they're among 
Esdeath's close subordinates.

229
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,090
Why would they do this?

230
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,690
It's an invitation.

231
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,700
They're trying to lure us into a trap.

232
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,980
Since we know it's a trap,

233
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,590
I'd like to tell you something.

234
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,950
The victims that were killed 
were not only intelligent,

235
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,830
but also opposed the minister.

236
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,880
They cared about their nation.

237
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,920
When the new kingdom rises, 
officials like those will be pivotal.

238
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,710
We cannot afford

239
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,980
to lose any more valuable people.

240
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,560
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

241
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,100
I...

242
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,180
I don't know much about politics, but...

243
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,570
Just knowing they used Night Raid's name 
to commit these crimes sickens me!

244
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,420
You're right...

245
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,110
That's exactly right, Tatsumi!

246
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,420
Bro!

247
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,450
Very well. Then it's decided.

248
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,380
Show them what we do to 
those who use our name.

249
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,410
Teach them the principles of an assassin.

250
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,120
There are two groups of political officials 
thought to be targeted next.

251
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,380
Akame and Lubbock...

252
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,230
Tatsumi and Bulat, guard them.

253
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,420
Where is the official we're guarding headed?

254
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,060
The capital's outskirts.

255
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,930
Anchored at the marina of the grand 
canal is a massive luxury liner,

256
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,170
the <i>Ryuusen</i>.

257
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,750
I-It's huge!

258
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,690
<i>This ship is like a fortress.</i>

259
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,630
<i>So this is where we'll wait for the impostors.</i>

260
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,240
Reserved rice, huh?

261
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,910
As expected from the good guys.

262
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,880
That amount should lift the people's spirits.

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
Watching this made me hungry.

264
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,130
I'll give you this, but I'm counting 
on you when the enemy comes.

265
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,960
No reaction...

266
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,520
Looks like we're coming up empty.

267
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,420
Don't let your guard down.

268
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,560
I know.

269
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>Tatsumi... Bulat...</i>

270
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,510
<i>If the enemy is on your side...</i>

271
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,930
<i>Please...</i>

272
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,570
<i>Make it through alive!</i>

273
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,080
The old man I'm supposed to protect 
is surrounded by people.

274
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,700
Assassinating him would be impossible.

275
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,040
Looks like we're coming up empty—

276
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,070
Huh, wh-what?

277
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,920
That's a tough call to make on your own, Tatsumi.

278
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,860
Eh? Bro?

279
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,000
My invisibility gives me the upper hand.

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,050
After all, you never know what the enemy plans.

281
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,130
That's true.

282
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm sorry, Bro.

283
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,690
How many times have you hit me?

284
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,600
Well, consider it tough love.

285
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Love.

286
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,060
Love.

287
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,020
You don't have to say it three times!

288
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,230
At any rate, this armor sure is useful.

289
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,860
Thanks to it, we were able to board the ship.

290
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,140
Yeah!

291
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,320
In the war against the South, I fought with this.

292
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
It's like my partner.

293
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,110
However...

294
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,370
In the end, no matter how hard I fought...

295
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,350
This doesn't make sense!

296
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,370
Why would the capital dismiss you, General?

297
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,520
I wouldn't accept the new minister's bribe.

298
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,580
So he determined your status 
based on bribes, not merit?

299
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,100
That's ridiculous!

300
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,970
Bulat,

301
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,230
I will return to the capital 
and openly defend myself.

302
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,610
I may be in this situation now, 
but I've done nothing wrong.

303
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,950
I'm sure they'll understand.

304
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,990
General...

305
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,020
I'm sorry you had me as your superior.

306
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,370
Forgive me, Bulat.

307
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,460
No, sir.

308
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,850
You are a great general.

309
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,230
But when the general returned to the 
capital, they wouldn't even listen.

310
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,200
Apparently there was some
 jealousy towards me, as well,

311
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,460
so they set me up as a criminal.

312
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,230
Before they could do anything, I made 
my escape using this Imperial Arms.

313
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,670
Unbelievable...

314
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,100
The invisibility is at its limit.

315
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,240
I have to take the armor off for a while.

316
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,490
Don't they know your face, Bro?

317
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,230
Leave this area to me!

318
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,010
All right!

319
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,150
I'll go investigate inside the ship.

320
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,160
If I see anyone suspicious, 
I won't let them get away.

321
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,040
Well, I'm pretty suspicious-looking myself...

322
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,320
A flute?

323
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,710
Sweets Amaenbou

324
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,930
Bring your best sweets.

325
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,710
Y-Yes, ma'am. Right away!

326
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,130
<i>Because I'm in this form, I know</i>

327
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,730
<i>that her being alone is a trap for me.</i>

328
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,360
<i>As evidenced by the evil I can smell</i>

329
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,600
<i>radiating from her body!</i>

330
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,220
<i>Thinking I could kill her if I had an opening...</i>

331
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,610
<i>Naïve.</i>

332
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,940
<i>This is frustrating,</i>

333
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,440
<i>but I must follow my instincts and retreat!</i>

334
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,200
Meshiya Cafeteria

335
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,960
<i>Hmm?</i>

336
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,200
<i>The presence is gone.</i>

337
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,570
<i>They didn't take the bait, huh?</i>

338
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,870
<i>A pity.</i>

339
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,580
<i>I wanted to test some new torture techniques.</i>

340
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,310
This is pretty delicious.

341
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,560
After the mission is finished,

342
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,640
maybe I'll get some for them.

343
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,330
An exquisite tone, as always.

344
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,520
The ship has passed the urban areas, 
and is no longer visible from shore.

345
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,310
The timing is probably just right.

346
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,170
I've played for a long time, so even if I stop,

347
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,690
everyone should be debilitated for a while.

348
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,410
There may be those that weren't 
listening to the flute's beauty.

349
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,750
Don't relax your guard.

350
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,780
Okay!

351
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,230
What the hell is happening?

352
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,490
Is it the music?

353
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,020
Have to get outside!

354
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,120
Even outside, I can hear the flute.

355
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,460
This must be an Imperial Arms.

356
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,590
Oh! Looks like someone's still struggling.

357
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,720
If you'd fallen asleep, I'd have left you alone.

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,590
Then you must be the Night Raid imposter.

359
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,150
So you're a real one, eh?

360
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,930
This is great.

361
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
Here you go.

362
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,060
What are you doing?

363
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,640
Well...

364
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,310
I want to fight to gain experience,

365
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,070
in order to become the strongest.

366
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,650
Come at me!

367
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,030
Ah, I see.

368
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,950
Then I'll give you some good experience...

369
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,910
And send you to hell!

370
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,070
Excellent!

371
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,410
How vigorous!

372
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,540
Destroying you will be well worth it!

373
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,380
Given what the music did to your body, 
I'm impressed that you dodged!

374
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,920
In that case...

375
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,210
How's this?

376
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,730
So that's your Imperial Arms!

377
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,680
The Imperial Arms Great Double Axe: Belvark.

378
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,440
Not just anyone can wield this weapon!

379
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,650
If that's how it is...

380
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,610
I'll make it hit you!

381
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,740
Destroy yourself!

382
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,920
Are you stupid?!

383
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,650
The opponent was clearly ready for your attack!

384
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,500
No matter how you look at it, he would've won!

385
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,780
What were you doing, plunging in like that?!

386
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,320
You...

387
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,710
You're awfully chipper.

388
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,030
The debilitating music should 
have affected the entire ship.

389
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,300
Oh, that's what it was...

390
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,380
Then it wouldn't work on me.

391
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,930
Huh?

392
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,900
The hot blood that courses through my body

393
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,890
isn't something that others can calm!

394
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,020
<i>This guy...</i>

395
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,710
What an interesting guy!

396
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,490
You physically injured yourself to stop 
the brainwashing effect, huh?

397
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,630
I am Bulat, of Night Raid.

398
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,200
But you can call me "Handsome."

399
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,320
I am Lady Esdeath's servant,

400
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,950
Daidara, of the Three Beasts.

401
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,360
Tatsumi,

402
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,510
pay close attention to how I fight,

403
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,210
and burn it into your memory.

404
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,690
Bro...

405
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,510
<i>Incursio!</i>

406
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,080
Looks like I can get some great experience!

407
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,150
Bro!

408
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,190
<i>I've got this!</i>

409
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,400
<i>I'll bash his head in—</i>

410
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,030
Tatsumi,

411
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,800
this is what I meant before.

412
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,290
About being aware of your surroundings.

413
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,180
<i>He killed the big one,</i>

414
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,580
<i>and still dealt with the other two.</i>

415
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,500
<i>All...</i>

416
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,610
<i>All in a single moment!</i>

417
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Bro, I knew you were strong,

418
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,730
but you're incredible!

419
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,340
That's right!

420
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,510
Back when I was a soldier, my nickname was

421
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,330
"Hundred-Man Slayer Bulat."

422
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,690
To be accurate, it was one hundred, 
twenty-eight people.

423
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,220
You were up against the special forces,

424
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,020
and you did that well.

425
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,180
That Imperial Arms, that strength.

426
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,360
So it is you, Bulat.

427
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,910
You are

428
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,340
General Liver.

429
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,940
Kill the Three 
— Part Two —
