1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,980
Wait, don't tell me...

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,990
What is this explosion?

3
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,710
<i>Kurome isn't here.</i>

4
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,400
That intense explosion earlier...

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,090
It was the Rubicante's self-destruct.

6
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,530
If Bols has been taken out,

7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,690
it will be tough to stay there.

8
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,260
I wonder what's happened to Sis...

9
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,310
<i>It's already wearing off!</i>

10
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,830
Leone, are you all right?

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,340
I'm totally fine...

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,210
I'm gonna need you to work 
extra hard now, Akame.

13
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,030
Leone...

14
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,320
Since, you know...

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,140
I'm confident in my regenerative abilities...

16
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,380
Leone?

17
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,770
Leone!

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,740
Leone!

19
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,530
Kill the Curse

20
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,320
Kill the Curse

21
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,220
<i>Looks like I got away.</i>

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,210
<i>I did such a horrible thing to Wall...</i>

23
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,320
<i>I hope Kurome is okay, as well.</i>

24
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,880
Hey, Bols...

25
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,600
Why do you always cook for us, 
but never join us for meals?

26
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,380
If I partook, the meal would taste unpleasant.

27
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,770
I see, you don't want to show your face.

28
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,400
That makes me want to see it even more.

29
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Wait, Captain!

30
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,190
No!

31
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,230
What? That's nothing.

32
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,390
I'm disappointed, Bols.

33
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,720
Huh?

34
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,210
No one would even be concerned by your face.

35
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,790
We're all going to eat together.

36
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,980
You're late, Bols!

37
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,340
Coro, stop that!

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,470
Come on,

39
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,140
Bols.

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,840
<i>I want to eat with everyone again.</i>

41
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,850
Oh, my... How terrible!

42
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,900
What's wrong, little one?

43
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,490
It's dangerous here.

44
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,580
It's a ghost!

45
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,460
I'm not a ghost. It's okay, it's okay.

46
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,790
Look, you're hurt...

47
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,170
Stay still, okay?

48
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,360
Just calm down now.

49
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,330
He's gonna curse me!

50
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,120
Curse?

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,260
What does that even mean?

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,470
There you go.

53
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,690
The pain will go away, too

54
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,600
And you'll be better in no time.

55
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,400
Thank you so much, mister!

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,850
Don't mention it.

57
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,460
But the places you've burned...

58
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,030
...won't ever be better.

59
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,250
That girl just now was from 
a village you burned down.

60
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,870
You burned it down on suspicion of treason,

61
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,400
for helping the Revolutionary Army.

62
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,260
Since you burned them in groups, 
I'm sure you can't remember the faces.

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
<i>I always knew...</i>

64
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,570
<i>That one day, I'd have to face retribution.</i>

65
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,990
<i>But...</i>

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,950
<i>Even so,</i>

67
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,560
<i>I must get home.</i>

68
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,350
<i>They're both waiting for me...</i>

69
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,520
<i>I have to</i>

70
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,690
<i>get home...</i>

71
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,300
A battle between those who work in the shadows

72
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,570
really is painful.

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,750
Finishing off an enemy before they get away...

74
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,310
Perfect as expected, Chelsea.

75
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,990
Lubba!

76
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,250
Let's rendezvous with the others.

77
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,210
I'm going to go after Kurome.

78
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,490
I'll finish her before she can meet 
up with Esdeath and the rest.

79
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,120
Kurome's already out of my range, 
but I know which direction she went.

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,130
You can go after her, but...

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,250
You know it's dangerous.

82
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,350
You aren't the type to go rogue like this!

83
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,590
It'll be too late, otherwise.

84
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,110
If we don't get her now, she'll find eight 
more puppets, and come at us full-force.

85
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,720
That's far more dangerous, isn't it?

86
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,220
So, Lubba, you go back 
and relay this information.

87
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,990
Have them dispatch two more 
battle-ready reinforcements.

88
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,500
Fine.

89
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,640
Just don't be reckless.

90
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,010
I won't...

91
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,840
If she's already with Esdeath, 
I'll come right back.

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,790
I'll have reinforcements to 
you as soon as possible.

93
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,240
Counting on ya!

94
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,780
You know it's dangerous.

95
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,500
You aren't the type to go rogue like this!

96
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,720
It's true, I've softened or something...

97
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,050
Anyway, on to big task two!

98
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,810
Let's do this with some enthusiasm!

99
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,230
<i>Kurome's next.</i>

100
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,400
<i>I'll finish her off, no matter what.</i>

101
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,490
The medicine wore off.

102
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,840
We were supposed to train a hundred kids

103
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,590
we bought from various areas
 into becoming assassins...

104
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,290
But no matter how you look, 
there are definitely more than a hundred.

105
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,880
It's fine...

106
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,320
There has to be this many to start.

107
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,510
A few dozen will die during
 the skill test, anyway.

108
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,810
So the weak ones will just die off on their own.

109
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,630
Right.

110
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,190
I'll train seven of the most elite.

111
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,590
Understood.

112
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,120
Then we'll take the rest of them.

113
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,750
Now, then... I wonder which kid will 
make it through this forest first.

114
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,290
S-Sis...

115
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,290
I can't run anymore.

116
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,840
The goal is just up ahead.

117
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,800
You can do it, Kurome.

118
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,890
Th-They're being eaten!

119
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,360
We can't go this way!

120
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,390
Let's go that way.

121
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,700
It'll be okay.

122
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,930
Your sister's here with you.

123
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Okay.

124
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,800
Kurome!

125
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,020
D-Don't touch my sister!

126
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,560
<i>Protect Kurome!</i>

127
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,530
<i>Help Sis...</i>

128
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,980
You pass.

129
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,860
We did it. We passed, Kurome.

130
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,650
Yeah... Thank you, Sis.

131
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,110
Those sisters are among the seven, huh?

132
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,830
No, we don't allow siblings 
on the same team.

133
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,010
If they relied on each other,
 it'd be problematic.

134
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,090
You two will train separately, 
in different locations.

135
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,990
Akame, you're coming with me.

136
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,050
Kurome, you're going to the capital.

137
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,760
No! I'm staying with Kurome!

138
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,930
Sis!

139
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,720
Kurome...

140
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,970
Sis...

141
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,640
Kurome!

142
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,660
Sis!

143
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,740
We'll begin the experiment.

144
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,500
You're the ones that didn't measure 
up to the elite seven.

145
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,250
But with this drug, it won't be an issue.

146
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,270
Soon, it will be complete,

147
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,750
a fearsome band of assassins.

148
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,750
I want to see you, Sis...

149
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,310
I'm tired.

150
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,570
I want to hurry and change into my other clothes!

151
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,440
After I treat your injuries.

152
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,320
Leone, are your wounds okay?

153
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,910
Yeah! I've recovered a lot, haven't I?

154
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,320
Now we just have to wait for Lubba to 
return and sew my arm back on.

155
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,580
Eh? Your arm can go back to normal?

156
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,450
It's a special combo method, 
unique to Lubba and me.

157
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,940
It wouldn't usually heal on its own.

158
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,010
This healing ability is Lionel's secret ability,

159
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,550
Regenerator (Lions Never Die)

160
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,550
Regenerator!

161
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,730
That's impressive.

162
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,760
But my Susanoo's regenerative 
abilities heal in an instant.

163
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,060
Yeah, yeah. We know.

164
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,960
But it's great that your arm's gonna heal!

165
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,680
Right, Akame?

166
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,270
Yeah.

167
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,120
I guess having regenerative abilities

168
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,220
as your trump card suits you.

169
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,070
What? Are you jealous of my secret ability?

170
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,740
Pumpkin has no need for such things.

171
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,270
The more dangerous the situation, 
the stronger my shots.

172
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,280
It enables me to get out of the worst of—

173
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,960
I'm going to apply medicinal herbs.

174
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,120
It may sting a little.

175
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,300
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

176
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,020
It's rough being so lame, 
while trying to say something cool.

177
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,000
I know the feeling.

178
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,080
Why are you pitying me, you open-fly loser?!

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,380
Don't bring me down to your level!

180
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,970
Hey, Lubba...

181
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,970
I know you just got back, but—

182
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,970
Chelsea's...

183
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,580
Besides Natala and Doya, all of 
my toys have been destroyed.

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,990
It's probably impossible to gather 
that kind of strength again.

185
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,290
These snacks are yummy.

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
I knew it! It's Kurome!

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,330
You're safe, thank goodness!

188
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,340
You, too, Bols.

189
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,830
It was such a huge explosion.

190
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,900
During my time with the Incineration Force, 
I was trained in heat resistance.

191
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,340
Oh, right.

192
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm so glad.

193
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,930
But I must apologize.

194
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,810
I've lost my Imperial Arms.

195
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,180
That's okay...

196
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,590
<i>I've learned each of the</i>

197
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,780
<i>Jaeger's personalities and tone 
of voice from Tatsumi.</i>

198
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,810
<i>It seems I won't have a problem.</i>

199
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,520
<i>Even Yatsufusa's deactivated.</i>

200
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,160
<i>But I won't attack yet.</i>

201
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,950
<i>According to Akame, Kurome is on a drug.</i>

202
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,590
<i>So I have no idea what kind of move 
she'll make when I attack.</i>

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,380
<i>I'll take it slow, and wait 
for the right opportunity!</i>

204
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,370
I see.

205
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,380
So Bols was taken care of.

206
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,090
And Chelsea's going after Kurome alone.

207
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,090
Boss, when Kurome dodged my shot earlier,

208
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,970
I felt like it was more than just 
the drugs we've heard about.

209
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,300
Maybe there's something about Kurome 
that even Akame doesn't know.

210
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,270
We don't know if Chelsea 
will be able to land a hit.

211
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,100
We should hurry with the reinforcements.

212
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,410
Akame, Tatsumi, you heard what's going on.

213
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,400
I know you haven't fully recovered,

214
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,530
but go after Chelsea, and back her up!

215
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,840
Roger that.

216
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,990
We'll head there now.

217
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,230
We'll soon arrive in the city.

218
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,740
They may be waiting to ambush us.

219
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,950
<i>Hmm, what is this?</i>

220
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,170
<i>This unnerving feeling I can't 
quite put my finger on?</i>

221
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,950
<i>And there's no real attack opening, either.</i>

222
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,050
<i>Maybe I'll retreat for now, 
and finish her later.</i>

223
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,540
The captain will probably be returning soon.

224
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,010
Let's be careful until she—

225
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,930
A-Are you okay, Kurome?

226
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,430
<i>It's because I didn't eat all my snacks.</i>

227
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,750
A-Are you hurt somewhere?

228
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,750
I'll be fine...

229
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,280
Kurome's Snacks

230
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,280
As long as I eat my snacks.

231
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,520
You look like you're in pain,

232
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,360
poor thing.

233
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,780
I know!

234
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
I'll say a charm that'll help with the pain.

235
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,300
There.

236
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,260
Now you won't be in pain anymore.

237
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,980
Goodbye.

238
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,620
S-Sis...

239
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,980
Both targets assassinated. 
Mission accomplished.

240
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,110
<i>This girl...</i>

241
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,000
<i>Her final word was "Sis."</i>

242
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,410
<i>I know this was unfortunate, 
but consider it the fate of a killer.</i>

243
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,450
Your test scores are among the highest.

244
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,950
I expect much from you.

245
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,780
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,650
I'll do my best.

247
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,460
I'm counting on you.

248
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,390
<i>I'll go with the flow, 
climb the corporate ladder,</i>

249
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>and marry into a family of rank.</i>

250
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,140
Huh?

251
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,600
Then, Your Excellency,

252
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,490
this is yours.

253
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,350
Just leave it over there somewhere.

254
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,160
A bribe?

255
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,110
No one's seen anything.

256
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,110
How rotten...

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,100
Run! Run away!

258
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,870
<i>He's hunting people...</i>

259
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,520
<i>He's insane.</i>

260
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,330
<i>But that said, what can I possibly do?</i>

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,860
<i>What's this?</i>

262
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,630
Oh, in the basement?

263
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,100
That's an Imperial Arms called Gaia Foundation.

264
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,880
No one can use it, so it's stored down there.

265
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,230
Hmm, an Imperial Arms, huh?

266
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,190
<i>The Imperial Arms is calling me.</i>

267
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,610
<i>It's telling me to use it...</i>

268
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,010
The viceroy has been killed!

269
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,510
<i>Everyone's relieved.</i>

270
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,370
<i>They're happy.</i>

271
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,850
<i>I helped rehabilitate a part of the world.</i>

272
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,480
<i>If I use this ability,</i>

273
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,960
<i>maybe I can even help restore the 
rest of this depraved world.</i>

274
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,740
I'll help make it a peaceful place soon.

275
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,650
And you can be reborn into that world.

276
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,320
Say...

277
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,320
Say...

278
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,030
When did you—

279
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,490
That charm didn't work...

280
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,410
It hurts a lot, and I'm suffering a lot.

281
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm certain I pierced the vital spot!

282
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,480
After Sis left, they created a new drug,

283
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,000
a powerful drug that strengthened 
the body even more.

284
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,960
It's terribly exhausting,

285
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,760
and it's full of surprises...

286
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,840
If you want to kill me,

287
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,880
you'll have to either

288
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,100
pulverize my heart or behead me, 
or else I won't die.

289
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,150
<i>I never imagined she gave 
up part of her humanity.</i>

290
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,110
<i>I'll transform and get away!</i>

291
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,250
Damn it...

292
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,210
I can't move...

293
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,130
Maybe I won't make it.

294
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,610
<i>But...</i>

295
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,720
<i>If that's the case, while I'm still conscious, 
I'll at least kill that woman.</i>

296
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,520
<i>She said, "Both targets assassinated. 
Mission accomplished," just now.</i>

297
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,830
<i>I'll avenge you, Bols.</i>

298
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,480
Slice her up!

299
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,690
Natala! Doya!

300
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,990
<i>I see.</i>

301
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,950
<i>I'm actually the one facing retribution.</i>

302
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,170
<i>I wanted to be praised when I returned...</i>

303
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,910
<i>"What do you think, Tatsumi? 
Didn't I do great?"</i>

304
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,250
<i>And...</i>

305
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,440
It won't stop raining.

306
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,210
I'm gonna turn invisible and take a look around.

307
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,010
Be careful.

308
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,770
Just see what's going on first.

309
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,650
Right.

310
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,640
<i>The blood on the road led 
all the way into the city.</i>

311
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,350
<i>If Chelsea's been captured, 
we have to rescue her.</i>

312
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,700
<i>But she really knows what she's doing.</i>

313
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,910
<i>Maybe she already made it back to the 
boss, and we just didn't cross paths.</i>

314
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,600
<i>Yeah, she wouldn't do anything reckless!</i>

315
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,410
<i>That blood was probably the enemy's.</i>

316
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,500
<i>A crowd...</i>

317
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill the Demon
