1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,520
Kurome...

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,670
Unlike you, I joined the military 
because I admired them.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,300
I owe my life to a naval officer.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,530
I idolized him.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,220
With weapon in hand,

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,020
a soldier's duty is to protect 
the kingdom and its people.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,180
I was able to become a soldier.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,280
But what, exactly, am I protecting?

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,520
Kurome's Snacks

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,290
So only four of us are left...

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,550
Yeah.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,190
This place has gotten a lot bigger.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,620
You're right.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,000
What do we do, Tatsumi?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,200
After this is over, we'll be on the streets.

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,770
You're the one who forced 
me here in the first place!

17
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,950
And before I knew it, it'd become this huge ordeal.

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,040
Was that how it was?

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,070
Then maybe I should take responsibility for it?

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,540
G-Get off!

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,830
And moreover, assassins being 
useless is a good thing!

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,270
That's true...

23
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,350
How about we join a traveling circus together?

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,100
Sounds good.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,520
Never!

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,150
Thank you all for your hard work.

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,650
Hey, don't say it like it's the last goodbye, boss.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,990
Whether we reunite in the future

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,660
is up to all of you.

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,510
Well said.

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,520
It'll take a whole lot to kill us.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,230
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,330
Tatsumi, too.

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,290
Yeah, of course.

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,580
Very well.

36
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,830
This is Night Raid's final mission.

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,310
Destroy the root of the problem.

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,290
Take down Minister Onest.

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,410
You'd better survive.

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,260
Yeah. It's a promise.

41
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,810
Kill the Emperor

42
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,400
Kill the Emperor

43
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,030
<i>Tatsumi,</i>

44
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,880
<i>the time you have depends on how 
long we can keep them occupied.</i>

45
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,510
<i>You have to kill the minister within that time.</i>

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,600
Comrades!

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,020
Today, we revolt and start a new kingdom.

48
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,960
We will overthrow the corrupt 
government with our own hands,

49
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,340
and create a kingdom where 
citizens can live peacefully!

50
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,300
Yeah!

51
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,740
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

52
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,740
Bingo!

53
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,690
This area is poorly constructed, just like we thought.

54
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,330
It's exactly how Lubba mapped it.

55
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,690
Good work.

56
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,700
Night Raid!

57
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,630
We don't wish to kill any more than necessary.

58
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,790
Those of you who aren't ready to die, leave.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,370
That isn't an option!

60
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,750
As expected, the guards protecting 
the interior are more determined.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,250
We have no choice but to kill them.

62
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,170
You won't be able to handle this.

63
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,690
Please stand back.

64
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,400
Jaegers...

65
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,560
Run!

66
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,980
It's been a while.

67
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,060
You remember me, Tatsumi?

68
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,360
There's no way you'd let us through,

69
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,060
right?

70
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,380
No.

71
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,280
Finishing a job I've started is in my nature.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,840
Even if it's wrong?

73
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,120
Future historians will retrospectively 
determine what is right.

74
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,290
There's no need for you to lose your lives.

75
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,290
Please leave.

76
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,950
Eh?

77
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,170
It's fine.

78
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,930
In fact,

79
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,840
you'd be in the way.

80
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,010
He's coming!

81
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,720
So that's his Imperial Arms.

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,890
What you say is true.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,160
The capital is completely degenerate.

84
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,900
The current regime will surely collapse.

85
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,400
If you know that, why do you stand in our way?

86
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,650
Your methods involve too much bloodshed.

87
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,280
What did you say, you stubborn bastard?!

88
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,570
Well, I was formerly a teacher.

89
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,160
Huh?

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,370
Why would someone like that join the Jaegers?

91
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,080
Back in my hometown, bandits abducted 
my students, killing them.

92
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,430
However, the capital didn't deem it a crime.

93
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,100
After all, it was a very poor village.

94
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,010
They were abandoned

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,800
by their capital.

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,640
I never knew you had such a past.

97
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,890
Yes, which is why I bear a 
grudge against the capital.

98
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,720
Then,

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,640
you should be

100
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,700
on our side!

101
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,680
I wanted to do it my own way,

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,300
to change the capital from within.

103
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,530
But you went and started a violent rebellion!

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,800
How annoying.

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,910
I'll let my fists do the talking!

106
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,880
Akame! Tatsumi!

107
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,210
I'll take this guy!

108
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,130
Sis!

109
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,130
We can't all be held up here, right?

110
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,660
It's okay, go!

111
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,930
Sis, don't you dare die.

112
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,270
Hey, before you kill the minister, 
let me get a punch in, okay?

113
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,690
That said, I'll finish you off now!

114
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,610
It's nothing personal, but your fate 
was decided once you chose that side!

115
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,530
Say your prayers, teacher!

116
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,620
Are you serious?

117
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,460
Trump card... God's Wings.

118
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,280
It seems you grossly underestimated 
my close-quarters combat skill.

119
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,370
<i>Crap...</i>

120
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,060
Minister, how's the war progressing?

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,760
It isn't favorable.

122
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,510
Against the pompous rebel army, 
our soldiers are withering.

123
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,270
A rebellion...

124
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,140
Have I governed them poorly?

125
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,150
Not at all.

126
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,250
Even after your parents passed,

127
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,770
you've upheld your position as emperor splendidly.

128
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,250
And I've been with you this whole time.

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,780
Assuredly, you've made no mistakes.

130
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,320
Th-That's true.

131
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,410
You've always been by my side.

132
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,540
Your Excellency, the citizens are 
being swayed by nonsense,

133
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,850
a nonsense they call rebellion.

134
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,630
You must make an example of these traitors.

135
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,490
Blood will be spilled.

136
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,460
But as emperor, you must be fierce!

137
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,500
This pointless rebellion will settle down

138
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,850
once you demonstrate your authority.

139
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,350
Now, let's be on our way.

140
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,070
<i>Somehow, I made it.</i>

141
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,560
A rebel!

142
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,700
Night Raid...

143
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,290
What were the palace guards doing?

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,710
There don't seem to be any other bodyguards.

145
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,730
The target is Minister Onest.

146
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,880
Eliminate!

147
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,310
The supreme Imperial Arms is already in motion!

148
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,220
Take thatâ€”

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,680
Uh, ahem.

150
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,480
What you've begun has thrown 
the kingdom into chaos!

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
No, listen to us!

152
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,110
For a long time, the capital 
has been under tyranny.

153
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,600
And this whole time, the weak have suffered.

154
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,950
No matter how much they hoped or prayed,

155
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,110
no one ever came to help.

156
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,120
<i>Even Sayo and Ieyasu...</i>

157
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,620
<i>They... They all died!</i>

158
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,770
A kingdom like that needs to change, doesn't it?

159
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,330
Your Excellency,

160
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,530
you mustn't be deceived by these words.

161
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,560
Minister Onest,

162
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,430
you're the one who's been manipulating him.

163
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,920
Oh?

164
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,720
I don't appreciate these false accusations 
in front of the emperor.

165
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,060
I say this out of love... Love.

166
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,320
Quit babbling.

167
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,530
Can't you hear what they're saying outside?

168
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,610
This empire is finished!

169
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,120
You brat,

170
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,130
shut your mouth.

171
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,420
Now, Your Excellency...

172
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,580
Bring down the iron hammer 
on these foolish rebels!

173
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,410
I am the emperor of this realm!

174
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,040
Wh-What's going on?

175
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,170
The empire's trump card, Shikoutazer.

176
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,300
Its strength is comparable to that of God.

177
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,320
No, it is God...

178
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,460
Those who've betrayed the empire

179
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,310
will be judged by God!

180
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,940
Whoa, what's that?

181
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,870
What the hell is that?

182
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,290
That is the legendary Imperial Armsâ€”

183
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,250
Shikoutazer? It truly exists?

184
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,550
That minister...

185
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,470
So this is why he hasn't admitted defeat.

186
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,280
The empire that's persisted for 
generations is God's will.

187
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,190
To defy God is preposterous!

188
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,130
Stop!

189
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,360
My, Your Excellency...

190
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,930
You look absolutely heroic and elegant.

191
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,680
Your late parents who died in an unfortunate 
accident are certainly proud, as well.

192
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,140
Yeah.

193
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:57,940
Shikoutazer can only be used by 
those of the royal bloodline.

194
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,810
That said, you are, without doubt, 
the true emperor!

195
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,370
That's right.

196
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,410
I am the true heir.

197
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,750
Now, Your Excellency...

198
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,370
Now, now, now!

199
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,050
Then this is what Stylish meant.

200
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,730
The first and supreme Imperial Arms.

201
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,340
This... This is the right thing to do.

202
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,440
How splendid!

203
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,950
As long as we have this power, 
no one can disobey.

204
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,400
Everything will be ours.

205
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,480
<i>We'll turn a blind eye toward the 
destruction about to occur.</i>

206
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,570
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

207
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,260
<i>We'll just have the ignorant 
citizens rebuild it again</i>

208
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,270
<i>for the emperor and me!</i>

209
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,440
<i>They're strong...</i>

210
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,220
<i>As expected of the emperor's guards.</i>

211
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,060
<i>Tatsumi!</i>

212
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,510
Stop!

213
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,560
What are you doing to your own kingdom?

214
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,330
Night Raid,

215
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,610
this is retribution for what you've begun!

216
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,420
You're dragging civilians into this.

217
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,900
How dare you call yourself an emperor?

218
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,070
What the hell do you think you're protecting?!

219
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,380
Shut up!

220
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,720
The empire's lasted for a thousand years.

221
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,410
I can't let it end with me!

222
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, yes! That's exactly right, Your Excellency!

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,460
What does a thousand years 
have to do with anything?

224
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,390
I was born into the empire and 
given this heavy responsibility.

225
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,170
How could you know how I feel?!

226
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,640
I could never understand how you feel.

227
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,190
Because of you, many people are suffering!

228
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,910
Look down and see what you're doing!

229
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,930
Your Excellency!

230
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,730
You cannot listen to him.

231
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,450
If you let him sway you now,

232
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,320
all we've done will be for nothing!

233
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,970
You must harden your heart!

234
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,600
H-He must be right...

235
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,350
Don't look away from me, you fool!

236
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,300
Your Excellency!

237
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,700
If you can do all this,

238
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,910
fight the real evil.

239
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,830
Shut up...

240
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,330
Are you okay with being a puppet?!

241
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,290
Shut the hell up!

242
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,880
Wave!

243
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,090
I am the empire's soldier.

244
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,850
I fight to protect the people.

245
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,470
Yeah, exactly!

246
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,980
A-And I owe you one.

247
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,060
Huh? When was that?

248
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,650
Uh, never mind.

249
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,180
Emperor, please calm down!

250
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,820
This is now a holy war.

251
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,450
There is no stopping this!

252
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,130
We'll stop him, no matter what.

253
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,680
We're the only ones who can.

254
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,170
Yeah, you don't have to tell me twice.

255
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,360
You...

256
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,300
You dare disobey the empire and emperor?

257
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,830
Don't misunderstand!

258
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,630
I haven't joined the rebel army.

259
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,720
Protecting the powerless is simply a soldier's duty!

260
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,670
What a troublesome guy.

261
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,090
True.

262
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,940
However...

263
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,690
He is necessary.

264
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,060
Winged guy,

265
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,200
we'll settle this later.

266
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,990
No, we won't.

267
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,290
<i>It's too tough.</i>

268
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,750
<i>Even Grand Chariot can't break through.</i>

269
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,820
<i>We can still fight.</i>

270
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,380
<i>If we give up,</i>

271
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,220
<i>it'll be over!</i>

272
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,650
Wh-What was that?

273
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,360
Tatsumi!

274
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,860
<i>What was that just now?</i>

275
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,040
No matter how sturdy something appears,

276
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,280
it should have some weakness.

277
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,790
If you can discover that in battle, 
it'll be very effective.

278
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,330
<i>Su...</i>

279
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,530
Wave!

280
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,790
Create a gap!

281
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,630
Okay!

282
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,130
Your Excellency, kill the traitors!

283
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,800
Th-Those who betray the empire

284
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,550
receive the death penalty!

285
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,560
<i>This one area's worn out.</i>

286
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,160
<i>Controlling such a large thing is a burden.</i>

287
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,220
<i>There's bound to be some damage somewhere!</i>

288
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,120
<i>Right, Su?</i>

289
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,450
How dare you?!

290
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,790
Tatsumiâ€”

291
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,050
Give up.

292
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,420
Why are you going this far?

293
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,970
I'm begging you... Give up!

294
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,870
Don't underestimate me.

295
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,860
Up till today, I've dealt with countless tragedies.

296
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,480
I carry them all with me,

297
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,400
all my fallen comrades!

298
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,950
I won't

299
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,910
let them down!

300
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,020
You'll have some painful, 
despair-ridden experiences.

301
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,130
In fact, most of them will be tragic.

302
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,530
But we chose to walk this path.

303
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,120
<i>Bro...</i>

304
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,060
We'll take on the dirty work.

305
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,020
And change the world.

306
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,090
After we finish, we can disappear.

307
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,380
<i>Bro...</i>

308
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
Shout it out, Tatsumi!

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,350
With your raging spirit!

310
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,980
<i>Incursio!</i>

311
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,360
Made in ancient times,

312
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,360
the evolving armor...

313
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,960
Don't come any closer...

314
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,840
Don't come any closer!

315
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,580
Fall!

316
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,030
Tatsumi, you'll die!

317
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,710
Like hell I will!

318
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,530
I made a promise.

319
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm going to survive!

320
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,500
Tatsumi!

321
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,140
Tatsumi!

322
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,990
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,040
Looks like I couldn't keep my promise.

324
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,790
You promised me!

325
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,310
You said you'd survive!

326
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,480
Tatsumi...

327
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,600
Is it over?

328
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,320
Did we lose?

329
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,530
Did the empire...

330
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,440
Did I...

331
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,070
lose?

332
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,260
Tatsumi died.

333
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:40,940
Akame ga Kill!
