1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,610
We three swear that when 
we die, we'll die together!

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,520
Yeah...

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,480
We'll succeed in the capital and earn money!

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,110
We're gonna save our village!

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,480
<i>We said that stuff.</i>

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,660
<i>And now, I'm alone...</i>

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,580
What are you doing, all of a sudden?!

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,630
Have you decided if you want to join us?

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,550
I told you, Iâ€”

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,990
But I think you have talent for killing...

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,180
Talent isn't the issue...

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,890
It's the killing.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,560
Anyway, I'll introduce you to the others today!

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,960
My neck...

15
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,820
Kill the Authority

16
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,660
Kill the Authority

17
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,870
Eh?

18
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,330
You're still undecided about joining?

19
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,130
That's right...

20
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,760
Sheele, give him some words 
of encouragement, will you?

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Hmm...

22
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,590
Now that you know our base's location...

23
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,220
If you don't join us, you'll be killed.

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,180
The encouragement's moving me to tears...

25
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,320
You should consider this very carefully.

26
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,810
One Hundred Ways to Cure 
Being an Airhead

27
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,830
<i>It really is an assembly of weirdos...</i>

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,100
Hey!

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,930
Wait a second, Leone.

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,820
Why are you letting him into the hideout?

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,220
Because he's one of us.

32
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,820
I haven't approved him yet...

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,660
<i>Wh-What is this?</i>

34
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,630
Fail.

35
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,420
You don't seem like you'd be able to 
fight with us professionals at all...

36
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,850
Based on your face.

37
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,070
What did you say, you...

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,470
Don't take it to heart.

39
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,580
Mine treats everyone this way.

40
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,220
The training grounds here 
are good for stress relief.

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,060
And over there, the one who looks 
like he reeks of sweat...

42
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,010
That's Bulat.

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,350
<i>Amazing...</i>

44
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,220
<i>What great form!</i>

45
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,450
Oh!

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,220
You must be the kid from the other day...

47
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,790
How do you know who I am?

48
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,890
Huh?

49
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,260
Ah, this is your first time seeing me this way...

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,540
I'm the guy who was covered in armor.

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,050
I'm Bulat... Nice to meet you.

52
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,050
L-Likewise.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
He's gay.

54
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,290
Hey, now...

55
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,300
He'll get the wrong idea, right?

56
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,340
<i>He isn't denying it!</i>

57
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,900
It's almost time for Miss Leone's bath...

58
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,030
I won't be fazed by danger, if it's 
for a sight of those breasts!

59
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,670
Then...

60
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,260
How about I break two fingers?

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
You never learn, Lubbock.

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,950
Damn it! I can still make it...

63
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,060
Then your arm's next.

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,870
That aside, this idiot's Lubbock.

65
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,090
And next is...

66
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,000
I've already had enough.

67
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,470
Well, next up is a pretty lady, 
so look forward to it.

68
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,720
See? Over there's Akame.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,970
Isn't she cute?

70
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,760
How...

71
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,400
Is she eating an evil-bird?

72
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,480
She killed it alone?

73
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,130
Despite Akame's looks, she grew up in the wild.

74
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,480
You should also eat, Leone.

75
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh!

76
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,530
Thanks!

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,440
Have you decided to join us?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,580
Not yet...

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,450
Then I can't give you some of this meat.

80
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,950
<i>That's all right!</i>

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,170
<i>She's tried to kill me twice now...</i>

82
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,790
<i>I don't like her.</i>

83
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,170
Hey, you look dressed up tonight.

84
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,550
The boss has come back.

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,420
B-Boss?

86
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,630
Oh! Boss!

87
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,260
Yo.

88
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,440
Welcome back!

89
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,930
Did you bring any presents?

90
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,300
Before that, Leone...

91
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,480
Three days ago, it seems you exceeded 
the time limit on the job.

92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,610
<i>Crap!</i>

93
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,000
It isn't good to enjoy fighting 
your enemies too much.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,870
You should fix that habit.

95
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,830
I get it, so please do something 
about that creaking!

96
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,950
Anyway, who's this young man?

97
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,060
Boss, his talent is notable!

98
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,460
Hey, stop that!

99
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,000
He's promising?

100
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,210
He is.

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
Well, just give it a try...

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,570
Okay?

103
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,600
What is this? A part-time job?!

104
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,350
Akame, gather the others.

105
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,810
I want your report, along with more 
details on this young man.

106
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
I see...

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,690
I understand the situation.

108
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,940
Tatsumi...

109
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,900
Would you like to join Night Raid?

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,370
If I decline, I'm dead, right?

111
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,920
No, that isn't this case.

112
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,730
But that doesn't mean we can let you go.

113
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,910
We'll employ you in our workshop...

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,650
Regardless, you won't be killed if you decline.

115
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,300
With that in mind, what do you say?

116
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,630
I...

117
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,100
I was supposed to go to the imperial capital,

118
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,220
and make my name, so I could save 
my village from destitution.

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,140
But the capital was...

120
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,010
Tatsumi...

121
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,860
This country is impoverished and suffers 
because the center is venal.

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,040
Don't you want to attack 
the problem at the root?

123
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,800
As a man!

124
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Originally, Bulat was a skilled imperial soldier.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,270
But then he discovered the corruption, 
and became one of us.

126
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,420
Our job is to eliminate the evil in the capital...

127
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,040
This is far better than working for the debased!

128
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,750
But...

129
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,480
Just killing bad guys won't 
change the world, will it?

130
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,430
At this rate,

131
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,310
other places like my village won't ever be saved.

132
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,450
I see.

133
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,330
Then you fit even more perfectly with Night Raid.

134
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,180
Wh-Why would that be?

135
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,740
Far to the south of the capital is a camp of the 
Revolutionary Army, an anti-imperial force.

136
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,350
Revolutionary Army?

137
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,390
The Revolutionary Army started small, 
but has grown into a large organization.

138
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,910
They needed to create a group 
to carry out covert operations,

139
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,820
such as assassination and gathering information.

140
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,570
That is us, Night Raid.

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,270
Right now, we're merely exterminating 
the capital's ticks...

142
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,300
Once we mobilize, we'll use the ensuing confusion

143
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,250
to reach the corruption's source, the prime 
minister, and kill him with these hands.

144
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,720
Kill him with these hands...

145
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,140
When that moment comes, 
this country will change.

146
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,100
Will this new country

147
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,590
treat its citizens well?

148
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,850
Of course.

149
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,020
I see... Amazing.

150
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,820
So the killing you do now

151
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,730
is basically finding the bad guys, 
and taking out the trash...

152
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,870
In other words, you're assassins of justice!

153
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,750
Wh-What is it?

154
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,160
What's so funny?

155
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,210
Tatsumi...

156
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,120
No matter how you spin it, we commit murder.

157
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,000
There's no justice in something like that.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,010
Everyone here could die at any moment, 
as retribution for our actions.

159
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,360
Ah, how naÃ¯ve.

160
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,140
Even in a century, he wouldn't 
be ready to join us.

161
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,360
Wait a second.

162
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,220
Huh?

163
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,580
I'm...

164
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,710
Each of us has a reason to fight.

165
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,850
But we're all prepared.

166
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,590
Do you have the same resolve?

167
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,820
I will be compensated, won't I?

168
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,830
You will.

169
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,320
If you work hard, I'm sure you'll 
be able to save your village.

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,910
Then I'll do it!

171
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,580
Let me join Night Raid!

172
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,700
You know, you might not be able 
to return to your village.

173
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,670
That's fine.

174
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,360
As long as everyone in the 
village can live happily...

175
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,380
It's decided, then.

176
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,420
Welcome to the life of carnage...

177
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Tatsumi.

178
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
This meeting is adjourned for tonight.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,820
Akame...

180
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,910
You'll be in charge of training Tatsumi.

181
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,510
If he becomes a burden, you're free to kill him.

182
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,350
Okay, got it.

183
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,770
<i>What do you mean, "Got it"?</i>

184
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,900
Work hard, so you don't die!

185
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,260
<i>I'm gonna be teamed up with her?</i>

186
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,700
Let's learn as many skills as possible,

187
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,780
so we can rise in the army's ranks.

188
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,700
If we're knowledgeable about food, 
we can avoid shortfalls of provisions.

189
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,350
<i>Sayo...</i>

190
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,450
<i>Ieyasu...</i>

191
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,240
<i>I'm so grateful that I know how to cook.</i>

192
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,000
Aren't you done with my seconds?

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,020
Oh! Me, too!

194
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,800
And me.

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,960
Please!

196
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,260
<i>It's like I'm only here to cook!</i>

197
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,970
Damn it!

198
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm supposed to be an assassin, 
but day after day, I'm cooking!

199
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,840
It can't be helped.

200
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,390
After all, I'm in charge of the food.

201
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,730
You're in charge of the food so you 
can snack on everything, huh?

202
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,020
That isn't true.

203
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,680
That's not remotely convincing.

204
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,440
That outfit really suits a newbie like you.

205
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,690
What did you say?!

206
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,980
Hey, Tatsumi!

207
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,950
Bulat...

208
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,110
Huh?

209
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,580
Are you all going somewhere?

210
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,910
Yeah, we're on an emergency assignment.

211
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,760
An assignment?

212
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,410
What about me?

213
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,980
The newbie can stay home!

214
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,420
Just keep chopping those cucumbers or whatever!

215
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,050
<i>Why does she mess with me so much?</i>

216
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,740
Bye, now!

217
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,250
Wow...

218
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,590
It's nice here.

219
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,360
Today, we'll gather our prey from this lake.

220
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,790
Why are you panicking?

221
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,690
Huh?

222
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,750
Oh, you're in a swimsuit...

223
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,170
Our objective today is Koga tuna.

224
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,700
This is the best location.

225
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,910
Aren't those the mysterious, 
rare, and vigilant fish?

226
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,000
S-Super fishing?

227
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,780
Dive into the depths of the lake, 
and mask your presence.

228
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,240
The moment your prey comes by, attack.

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,140
Commitment is the key.

230
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,770
Can you do it?

231
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,080
Bring it on!

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,940
So...

233
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,950
In the end, Tatsumi only caught two fish...

234
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,720
I heard you tore your clothes 
off and yelled, "Bring it on!"

235
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,030
You're still far too naÃ¯ve.

236
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,920
<i>Damn it...</i>

237
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,030
<i>I never know what she's thinking...</i>

238
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,370
<i>I still don't like her!</i>

239
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,030
Then, Leone, let's hear your job.

240
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,870
Here we go.

241
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,390
The targets this time are Ogre, of the imperial 
police, and Gamal, an oil merchant.

242
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,920
According to our client...

243
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,680
Gamal, the oil merchant has been paying 
Ogre a huge amount in bribes.

244
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,420
Every time Gamal commits a crime,

245
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,640
Ogre fabricates lies so he can frame another.

246
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,310
My fiancÃ© was also framed 
and sentenced to death.

247
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,400
Somehow...

248
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,480
Somehow rectify this wrongdoing!

249
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,870
Understood.

250
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,740
I'll send them both to hell.

251
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,340
Thank you so much... Thank you so much!

252
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,080
This is the payment.

253
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,620
That's quite a lot.

254
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,790
I sensed pain...

255
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,710
She probably sold her body 
many times to earn this.

256
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
No way...

257
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
Have you verified the case?

258
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,620
I checked with my own eyes and ears.

259
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,800
They're guilty.

260
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,180
All right.

261
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,460
The Night Raid accepts this case.

262
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,240
We won't need any abhorrent 
garbage in the new country.

263
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,150
We shall bestow divine punishment.

264
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,430
The merchant, Gamal, should be easy.

265
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,530
But Ogre will be a formidable opponent.

266
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,860
Ogre... The Demon.

267
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,770
He's a highly skilled swordsman 
that even criminals fear.

268
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,040
Normally, he's surrounded by 
lackeys, and is rarely alone.

269
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,470
Additionally, he's cautious.

270
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,380
When accepting the hush money, 
he invites Gamal into his room.

271
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,250
When he's off duty, he drinks on Main Street.

272
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,180
It seems when he's off duty is 
the only time to strike.

273
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,400
But the police are strict in 
the vicinity of the palace.

274
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,110
It would be dangerous for someone like 
Akame, whose face is publicly known.

275
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,390
Hey, hey!

276
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,070
I'm not on any wanted posters!

277
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,190
Can you do it?

278
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,400
The stronger the enemy, the more I'm up for it!

279
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,320
Why not wait for Mine and the rest?

280
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,660
But we don't know when they'll return, right?

281
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,360
Yeah.

282
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,300
Then, let's just do it ourselves!

283
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,640
Oh?

284
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,880
Are you saying you'll defeat Ogre?

285
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,350
Eh?

286
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,780
Yeah, that was some big talk...

287
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,890
You'd better take responsibility for those words!

288
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,860
Huh?

289
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,900
Right now, this job is beyond you.

290
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,270
I'm also skilled with a sword.

291
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,890
I'm saying that you won't be able to kill.

292
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
But I've experienced...

293
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,760
You swung your sword out of hatred.

294
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,600
Are you saying you can kill without 
hesitation, at any time?

295
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,390
Even while we sit here...

296
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,830
Others may get framed, right?

297
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,690
If that's so, I'll do it!

298
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,940
Beloved people, taken away 
for ludicrous reasons...

299
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,570
I don't want anyone else to feel this way!

300
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,990
Then it's decided.

301
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,120
Tatsumi, actualize your determination...

302
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,830
Eliminate Ogre.

303
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,500
Nicely said, Tatsumi!

304
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,780
You show great resolve!

305
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,410
Leone and Akame, deal with the oil merchant.

306
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,600
Got it!

307
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,980
Roger that.

308
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,440
How's that, Akame?

309
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,850
When I take a stand, I do it seriously!

310
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,450
After completing your task and making your 
report, you'll be considered legitimate.

311
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,180
At this point, arrogance will only result in

312
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,390
death.

313
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,670
<i>Damn it...</i>

314
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,320
<i>No matter what, I'll succeed...</i>

315
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,090
<i>And win their respect.</i>

316
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,280
This is Main Street.

317
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,750
You have the map memorized, right?

318
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,240
Yeah, I know it.

319
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,660
At this point, arrogance will only result in death.

320
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,550
Tatsumi, about Akame's past...

321
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,940
When Akame was a child,

322
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,510
the capital bought her sister and her.

323
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,300
She and other children, in similar circumstances,

324
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,480
were forced into a program for assassins,

325
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,110
and were trained to kill.

326
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,520
She survived that cruel experience.

327
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:11,070
And she emerged as an assassin who 
could fully carry out the capital's orders.

328
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,800
However, as Akame continued to fulfill missions, 
she began to sense the capital's darkness.

329
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,120
And her target at the time, our boss, ended up persuading her to

330
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,370
defect and join the Revolutionary 
Army, which truly fought for citizens.

331
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,210
But by this time, most of her comrades 
that grew up with her had died...

332
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,760
I'm sure you understand.

333
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,550
Basically, you're saying that I'm too 
complacent, for a professional killer.

334
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,210
Well, if you're successful today, you'll understand.

335
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,090
Whew!

336
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,360
Now that I feel refreshed from the bathroom,

337
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,920
perhaps I'll ask to have another go...

338
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,570
Yeah.

339
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,490
I'll give you another go, Gamal!

340
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,170
Two girls at once, you lucky dog.

341
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,820
Now, then...

342
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,730
I wonder how Tatsumi's doing 
with the other target.

343
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,740
Phew...

344
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,760
After an intense interrogation, 
a drink sure hits the spot.

345
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,510
Um... Ogre, sir?

346
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,520
Huh?

347
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,070
There's something I'd like you to hear.

348
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,760
What is it? Say it.

349
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,840
I shouldn't in public...

350
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,690
Hmm?

351
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,210
<i>I don't sense any other presences.</i>

352
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,630
Hey, kid!

353
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,040
This place should be fine.

354
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,400
Right, yes...

355
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,220
<i>Sayo, Ieyasu...</i>

356
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,660
<i>Lend me your strength.</i>

357
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,340
I beg you!

358
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,570
Please recruit me into the Imperial Army!

359
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,540
I have to earn money to send back to my village...

360
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,670
I figured it was something like that.

361
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,880
Go through the normal application process, idiot!

362
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,510
But...

363
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,800
In this recession, the acceptance 
rate is too competitive.

364
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,720
It can't be helped...

365
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,810
You don't have enough strength!

366
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,320
<i>What speed...</i>

367
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,110
<i>And the strength that knows no fear.</i>

368
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,760
<i>To think, there's someone who 
would defy me like this...</i>

369
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,540
I did it!

370
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,330
After completing your task and making your 
report, you'll be considered legitimate.

371
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,310
Oh, that's right.

372
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,110
I have to report this at once.

373
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
To think that I,

374
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,770
the great Ogre,

375
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,340
could possibly be defeated by a measly twerp!

376
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,500
I bet you're part of the organization 
that opposes the authorities.

377
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,440
You're a member of Night Raid, aren't you?

378
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,010
A weakling's concerns don't matter.

379
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,660
In this city, only the strong prevail.

380
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,170
I'm the one that determines others' fates!

381
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,420
I won't tolerate being judged!

382
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,130
Stop spewing nonsense!

383
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,050
Exactly who is your client?

384
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,880
If it's recent, it must be the fiancÃ©e 
of the guy I just took out.

385
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm right, huh?

386
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,360
I knew I should have taken 
care of her then, too...

387
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,310
No, it wouldn't be too late even now.

388
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,100
First, I'll find that woman.

389
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,080
Then I'll frame her entire family,

390
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
and murder them, one by one, 
in front of her eyes...

391
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,910
After I kill you, of course!

392
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,490
<i>These guys are all the same.</i>

393
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,080
<i>They take power, gained by authority,</i>

394
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,770
<i>and exploit it for personal gain.</i>

395
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,380
<i>I will eradicate</i>

396
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,380
<i>trash like you</i>

397
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,000
<i>from this world!</i>

398
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,770
I commend you for successfully 
eliminating the target.

399
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,710
Very good.

400
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,440
Thanks!

401
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,920
What do you think, Akame?

402
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,570
Completed the report, and finished the task.

403
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,990
I made it through without a scratch...

404
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,830
Come, let me hear your approval!

405
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,870
Huh?

406
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,720
What is this?

407
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,670
What are you doing?!

408
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,080
Leone... Boss... Hold him down.

409
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,130
No!

410
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,850
What? What is it?

411
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,500
Thank goodness.

412
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,030
A friend once died because he was too proud

413
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,350
to report his wounds, and they were poisoned.

414
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,060
I'm glad to see you weren't wounded.

415
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,880
First missions have a high mortality rate...

416
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,320
You've done well!

417
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,210
Th-Thanks...

418
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Akame was hard on you because 
she didn't want you to die.

419
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,080
Cooking is all about communication.

420
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,680
The art of assassination is 
learned by hunting prey.

421
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,920
Haven't you realized that all of 
it was part of your training?

422
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,000
Eh? Ah, r-really?

423
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,030
I'm sorry, Akame.

424
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,270
I misunderstood.

425
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,680
It's fine.

426
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,220
Just keep coming back alive, Tatsumi.

427
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,680
Right... From now on, I hope we 
can work together, Akame.

428
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,520
What, exactly, are you working 
on together undressed?

429
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,970
You guys are the ones who stripped me!

430
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,820
Okay...

431
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,980
Next, you'll be trained by Mine.

432
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,820
Do your best.

433
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,320
Eh?

434
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,070
It's one thing after another, isn't it?

435
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,470
With her?!

436
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,830
I just got a chill...

437
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill Your Cares
