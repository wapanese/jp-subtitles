1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,900
Livestock...

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,020
Livestock...

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,150
Livestock.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,110
Everyone has a splendid look on their faces.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,070
Feeble pigs, simply existing to be exploited.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,040
Wine bought with citizen taxes sure is delicious.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,850
Master, it's time for your massage.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,580
Oh!

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,920
Today, I'd like the refreshing,
 full-body rubdown.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,270
The job's done.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,300
What the hell kind of massage did he even want?

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,140
We're the Jaegers!

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,350
Due to an emergency, we'll be 
inspecting your quarters!

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,060
Wave...

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,460
We were too late...

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,190
So our information was leaked, 
and I almost ran into the Jaegers.

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,280
And you still managed to safely escape.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,610
You're pretty tough.

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,740
He owned a few cats,

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,780
so I transformed into one and snuck out.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,840
I would have had difficulty getting out.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,290
I hate to admit it, but your 
Imperial Arms is actually pretty useful.

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,580
For someone like you, with a recognizable 
face, the situation's pretty tough.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,510
From now on, you can just 
leave everything to me.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,010
Chelsea...

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,010
So while I'm out, babysit the hideout, okay?

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,470
Miss Substitute.

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,190
How dare you insult your comrade like that?

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,110
You're unforgivable!

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,520
Even though you've said similar things before...

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,690
Bearing this incident in mind,

32
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,360
the Jaegers seem to be targeting us directly now.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,320
All the new Danger Beasts have been exterminated,

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,450
so Night Raid's the only thing left in their way.

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,790
Maybe they'd leave us alone 
if we gave them Tatsumi,

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,090
who's been vacationing on the southern islands.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,460
I told you that I was forced into that!

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,460


39
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,470
Najenda

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,210
On a southern island, with only a beautiful woman...

41
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,470
It isn't like I'm jealous or anything.

42
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:05,470
Najenda

43
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,220
But why didn't you just leave her there?

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,970
After all, she's the enemy.

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,470
And it isn't like anyone's jealous or anything.

46
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,940
No, seriously...

47
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,740
Wipe your tears, Lubba...

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,230
Here, I'll overwrite your memories of that sadist!

49
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,570
There! There!

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,030
As long as I've known her, she's always been tough...

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,950
Even if you'd left her, she'd have found a way back.

52
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,080
So clearing your debts to her was better.

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,250
This way, when you fight her as an 
enemy, you can give it your all.

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,980
As long as you've known her...

55
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,370
Speaking of which, how old are you, boss?

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,900
I'm in my mid-twenties,

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,380
but Esdeath is younger.

58
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,780
Boss, I didn't know you were that young!

59
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,590
So unexpected!

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,470
Asking a woman about her 
age is rude, Tatsumi.

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,230
But at one point, you even discussed her weight...

62
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,480
What are you talking about?

63
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,320
The meal is ready.

64
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,070
It's a bit sudden, but we'll discuss 
our strategy after the meal.

65
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,580
The time is near.

66
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,470
We, the Revolutionary Army,

67
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,970
will take our first step to overthrow 
the corrupt government!

68
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,590
Kill the Religious Organization

69
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,300
Kill the Religious Organization

70
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,020
W-We don't belong to Night Raid!

71
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,740
We're stealing because we're 
having trouble finding food!

72
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,270
We haven't even killed anyone!

73
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,630
You admit to theft?

74
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,410
Once evil has tainted you, 
death is the only solution.

75
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,740
Coro, eat!

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,910
P-Please wait!

77
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,320
They threatened me, and forced me to help!

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,130
I can prove it to you!

79
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,290
Please give me a fair trial!

80
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,600
Even still, you helped.

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,480
A sin is a sin.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,300
You aren't worth troubling the 
captain or her superiors.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,190
I shall pass judgment on evil,
 here and now!

84
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,510
Justice is served.

85
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,600
Hey, Seryu!

86
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,780
What happened to the bandits we captured?

87
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,690
They aren't here anymore!

88
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,320
Wait.

89
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,060
You killed those bandits, didn't you?

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,220
As Jaegers, we may have special privileges,

91
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,870
but there are things we can and can't doâ€”

92
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,170
Those guys didn't belong to Night Raid.

93
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,290
But since they were evil,
 it wasn't a waste!

94
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,470
Let's continue to destroy evil at this pace!

95
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,130
<i>Seryu...</i>

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,790
<i>I had a hunch...</i>

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
<i>But the capital's worse than I'd thought.</i>

98
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,350
<i>To be that distorted...</i>

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,110
<i>But I must repay my debt.</i>

100
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,990
<i>I'm simply going to carry out 
my duties as a soldier.</i>

101
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,570
The time has come for the 
Revolutionary Army to rise.

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,530
That said, I'll explain the first 
mission we've been assigned.

103
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,950
Are you all aware of

104
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,750
the religious group, Path of Peace, 
that's popular among the people?

105
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,710
The one that believes

106
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,250
good deeds contribute to
 happiness and longevity?

107
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,860
Oh! They even came to my village!

108
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,760
The icon that my chief gave 
me was from that religion.

109
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,080
Over the past decade, Path of Peace 
has gained many followers.

110
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,770
And they've become highly influential 
in the capital's east side.

111
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,750
Soon, they will cause an armed uprising.

112
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,150
Meaning, they'll incite religious insurrection.

113
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,400
We shall use this to our advantage.

114
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,820
W-Wait a second!

115
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,420
If an uprising like that occurs, 
how many people will die?

116
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,830
In fact, shouldn't we stop an 
uprising, in the first place?

117
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,270
The corrupt government has oppressed 
the citizens excessively.

118
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,500
Even if we prevent Path 
of Peace's insurrection,

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,210
the populace's rage will still 
explode at some point.

120
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,310
This country is that close to demise already.

121
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,810
I see...

122
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,890
We should listen to the whole thing at least.

123
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,080
Remember when I told you about 
the revolt of the savage tribes?

124
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,350
And also about the northern hero?

125
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,910
Those were both stopped by Esdeath, right?

126
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,200
Their flaw was that they tried to rebel 
against the capital by themselves.

127
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,120
The capital is still incredibly powerful.

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,900
Even if Path of Peace revolts, 
they'll be suppressed eventually.

129
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,620
And there'll be a lot of bloodshed.

130
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,080
Therefore it's finally the 
Revolutionary Army's turn.

131
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,630
The moment Path of Peace 
begins their armed uprising,

132
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,260
we'll have a western allied 
tribe begin an invasion.

133
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,760
That way, the capital will have enemies 
on both the inside and outside.

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,910
But they'll probably be able to tough that out.

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,250
So for the clincher,

136
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,850
the Revolutionary Army will begin 
their rebellion from the south.

137
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,310
They'll advance toward the capital,

138
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,970
and overthrow it.

139
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,760
I get it...

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
A three-pronged attack, huh?

141
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,460
The capital underestimates 
the Revolutionary Army.

142
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,330
Since we're gathering the infection 
called the rebellion in one location,

143
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,040
you could even say they're grateful.

144
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,320
The Revolutionary Army base 
is at the capital's border.

145
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,270
In order to get to the capital,

146
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,290
they'll have to break through 
several forts and castles.

147
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,840
However, we've arranged for several castle 
viceroys to betray their positions.

148
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,290
Since there were so many demoted simply 
for taking their jobs seriously,

149
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,870
convincing them was easy.

150
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,850
The capital will be surprised

151
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,360
since the Revolutionary Army 
will advance at daunting speed

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,270
without bloodshed, 
and with repeated surrenders.

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,770
But even then, the capital's trump card, Commander-in-Chief Budou,

154
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,260
and his guards will intercept them.

155
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,280
But this will mean the palace's security 
will be gravely compromised.

156
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,950
When that happens, it will create the perfect 
opportunity to assassinate the minister.

157
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,710
We'll invade the palace,

158
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,080
and eliminate the minister.

159
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,920
We'll destroy the capital from the inside.

160
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,070
But in the end, sneaky bastards 
like those generally run away.

161
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,420
I won't let that happen.

162
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,050
He's the ringleader.

163
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,310
He needs to die.

164
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,100
To compensate the western tribe for helping us,

165
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,460
we've agreed to restore their original 
territory to its natural state.

166
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,520
Restore?

167
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,900
Originally, the western region of the 
capital belonged to the tribes.

168
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,400
And having it restored is their fondest wish.

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,920
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

170
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,280
<i>Mine is partly descended from the western tribes.</i>

171
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,790
If the capital and its corrupt laws collapse, 
the citizens' rage will dissipate.

172
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,090
As long as we move swiftly 
forward with our plans,

173
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,290
bloodshed should be minimal.

174
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,160
Are you satisfied with this, Tatsumi?

175
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,540
Yeah.

176
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,800
I apologize for getting hung up.

177
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,960
However, Path of Peace, 
the crucial key to this plan

178
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,300
seems to be unstable now.

179
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,750
Lord! Lord! Lord!

180
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,370
The religion's founder is intensely charismatic.

181
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,320
But it turns out that his advisor, Borick, 
is actually a spy sent by the minister.

182
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,720
Borick's mission was to usurp the founder's position,

183
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,780
and stop the armed uprising.

184
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,530
Now, here's the mission.

185
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,870
We go to Path of Peace headquarters, 
and take down Borick.

186
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,080
He's a villain that's mixing drugs 
into some of the followers' food,

187
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,660
and turning them into his obedient puppets.

188
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,880
No need for restraint.

189
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,630
He's probably going from girl to girl, 
and having his way with them.

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,510
Mixing drugs into food is a crime against food!

191
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,400
I'll never forgive him!

192
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,980
You two... Don't you think you're missing 
the mark as to what should anger you?

193
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,480
If they're left alone,
 more followers will be drugged...

194
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,150
We must put a stop to that.

195
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,320
Finally, regarding the Jaegers...

196
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,990
As long as Esdeath leads them, they're still 
part of the minister's private army.

197
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,600
That said, in order for our plan to go smoothly,

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,280
dealing with them first would be best.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,620
At this point, they're giving 
their all to hunt us down.

200
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,880
Since that's the case, we'll lure 
them outside the capital.

201
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,710
And then we'll attack.

202
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,960
So it's finally time for an all-out showdown!

203
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,260
Headquarters has also sent a specific request to 
take out Kurome and Bols if given the chance.

204
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,720
You can fight them without objection,

205
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,470
even though you became acquainted 
with them, right, Tatsumi?

206
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,390
<i>Wave was a good guy.</i>

207
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,930
<i>He wasn't even listed as a target.</i>

208
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,350
<i>There's no reason to fight him.</i>

209
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,390
<i>But even he's prepared to do 
his best for his comrades.</i>

210
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,780
<i>He isn't someone I can take lightly.</i>

211
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,810
<i>And above all things, I'm a killer.</i>

212
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,080
<i>I've made up my own mind.</i>

213
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,690
<i>I've braced myself for the worst, 
and became a part of this.</i>

214
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,000
I can do it.

215
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,820
I'll give it all I've got, even if 
they aren't our main targets.

216
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,750
I have no doubts!

217
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,210
Good.

218
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,980
<i>His eyes are great.</i>

219
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,250
<i>I can feel his resolve.</i>

220
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,940
<i>Seems like we won't sustain any casualties 
by showing mercy to the enemy.</i>

221
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,060
<i>Wait...</i>

222
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,730
<i>Why am I looking at Tatsumi like this?</i>

223
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,570
Showing off again... I bet 
your fly's open again, too!

224
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,610
<i>It seems I just can't ignore him...</i>

225
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,680
No, it's not!

226
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,460
Captain...

227
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,510
There's been word that 
Night Raid's Akame and Mine

228
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,640
were spotted near the 
eastern side of Romary Street.

229
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,190
Gather all the Jaegers.

230
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,540
As human beings slowly decay,

231
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,470
kingdoms also fall eventually.

232
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,810
Those who seek the birth of a new kingdom...

233
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,260
And those who defend their kingdom...

234
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,120
With their differing ideologies, 
principles, and goals,

235
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,410
and due to their unavoidable destiny,

236
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,200
they near their collision.

237
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,410
Arming themselves with their deadly weapons,

238
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,790
carrying their determination in their hearts,

239
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,440
they close in on their ultimate battle.

240
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,320
It's the Jaegers!

241
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,930
All six are headed east!

242
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,890
It's all going according to Najenda's plan!

243
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm counting on you, margue falcon...

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,980
Take this message to Night Raid!

245
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,300
<i>Assassinating a religious leader, 
and fighting a battle with the Jaegers...</i>

246
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,810
<i>Regardless of their manpower, 
it's a treacherous mission.</i>

247
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,710
<i>But you must survive, Night Raid!</i>

248
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,450
<i>We need your power, 
to destroy this depraved world.</i>

249
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,260
Six, huh?

250
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,380
So all the Jaegers are on the move.

251
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,790
Judging by Esdeath's speed,

252
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,020
even if they had our location information,

253
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,390
they'd arrive sometime past noon tomorrow.

254
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,180
All right.

255
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,430
I received information from the 
Revolutionary Army's spies.

256
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,790
You two, casually attract attention as planned.

257
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,770
Roger that.

258
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,400
Well...

259
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,180
It's sure nice to be able to see girls, 
in swimsuits, in a place like this!

260
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,720
Stop drooling.

261
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,780
You know this is also part of the plan, right?

262
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,410
Huh? Are you dumb?

263
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,420
Are you gay?

264
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm not!

265
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,270
Tatsumi...

266
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,920
Tatsumi, which bikini do you 
prefer, Chelsea's or mine?

267
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,800
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer to that.

268
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,360
So?

269
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,130
Which one?

270
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,390
Uh... I, well...

271
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,840
Wow, Su, you're buff! Just as I expected!

272
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,310
Aw, he got away.

273
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,000
If you'd just ask me,

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,400
I'd be glad to answer that I 
love them both equally!

275
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,080
Then, I'd dive into your breasts 
and sing the national anthem!

276
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,520
So why ask Tatsumi?!

277
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,050
Because you're precisely that kind of guy.

278
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,900
Exactly! And that's no fun.

279
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,390
Why?

280
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,790
Why Tatsumi and not me?

281
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,310
I don't understand!

282
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,870
Just stay confused forever!

283
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,640
Team Anonymous down there is pretty rowdy.

284
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,050
Damn it! I wanted to play a bit more, too!

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,070
What's wrong, Akame?

286
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,760
Oh, nothing.

287
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,890
You're thinking about your sister, aren't you?

288
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,100
Yeah.

289
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,380
She's coming after me as a target, after all.

290
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,020
I can't help but think about it.

291
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,180
Even if your sister dies,

292
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,800
don't you dare say you're alone.

293
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,380
You have us. Be grateful for that!

294
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,300
Yeah.

295
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,840
Najenda is continuing east.

296
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,750
Akame is headed south.

297
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,270
After coming here, they were seen 
splitting into two groups.

298
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,270
No, this is mine! I'll feed you meat later!

299
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,310
If we go east, we'll end up in Kyoroch, 
the Path of Peace's headquarters.

300
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,940
If we go south, we'll run into 
cities friendly to the rebels.

301
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,280
In any case, this is suspicious.

302
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,400
If we hurry, we can catch up to them.

303
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,760
Let's go.

304
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,950
Well, wait...

305
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,480
Night Raid's members are the capital's traitors.

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,790
The wanted posters haven't circulated 
among the outer districts,

307
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,290
so they lowered their guard, 
and that's how they were tracked.

308
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,170
They were even seen splitting into two groups.

309
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,230
Isn't it a little too convenient?

310
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,100
I agree.

311
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,800
I highly suspect it's a trap.

312
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,360
Perhaps they wanted to be witnessed.

313
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,050
Was it to lure us away from 
the capital and defeat us?

314
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,030
That's like Najenda.

315
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,060
She fights calmly, with a burning heart.

316
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,170
Which means following them will be dangerous.

317
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,480
No, we can't waste this chance.

318
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,520
Night Raid's been carefully concealing themselves.

319
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,050
And now, they're practically flaunting 
themselves in the open.

320
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,840
Not only will we be prepared for the trap,

321
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,370
but we'll crush them.

322
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,090
Seryu, Ran, and I will pursue Najenda.

323
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,700
Kurome, Wave, Bols will go after Akame.

324
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,050
Be aware of your surroundings at all times.

325
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,390
If you're completely outnumbered, 
it's fine to retreat.

326
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,090
I want you to give it all you're worth, 
but this isn't a suicide mission.

327
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,660
They're the last rats to defy the capital.

328
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,890
Chase them down, and take them out!

329
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,350
Roger that!

330
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,040
So our opponents are the 
capital's strongest, Night Raid.

331
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080
I wonder if someone like me can win.

332
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,400
It'll be fine...

333
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,780
When I faced a Night Raid member before,

334
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,680
he didn't accept my challenge.

335
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,780
But I could tell he was about as strong as I am.

336
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,890
If we fight together, we'll definitely win.

337
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,340
Bols, your Imperial Arms is optimal 
for taking on multiple opponents.

338
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,850
It's reassuring.

339
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,580
You think so?

340
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,250
You say slick things like that,

341
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,220
but you'll probably hold us back the most, Wave.

342
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,090
How dare you?

343
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,020
Are you saying you don't trust my skill?!

344
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,800
Right. I feel when we need 
you most, you'll be weak.

345
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,260
If I equip Grand Chariotâ€”

346
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,890
Then show me how strong you are.

347
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,050
Bring it on!

348
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,900
Stop fighting, you two.

349
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,770
Hey, there's something ahead of us.

350
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,790
A scarecrow?

351
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,100
It's true.

352
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,240
Hot Guy

353
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,240
This is the most suspicious thing ever.

354
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,170
If it's a trap, it'll be trouble.

355
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,280
Let's be careful checking it out.

356
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,040
<i>Target acquired.</i>

357
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,110
<i>Judging by the numbers,
 it seems they've split up,</i>

358
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,290
<i>and Esdeath headed east, after our boss.</i>

359
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
<i>Exactly as planned.</i>

360
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,760
<i>They look so similar...</i>

361
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,160
<i>They are sisters, after all.</i>

362
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,890
<i>But that's exactly why I don't want 
to leave this for Akame.</i>

363
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,060
<i>I'll take care of this!</i>

364
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,650
<i>I'll do it quickly and painlessly, in one shot.</i>

365
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,030
<i>She dodged it!</i>

366
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,910
<i>What was that superhuman reaction time?</i>

367
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,120
Kurome, watch out!

368
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,170
Wave!

369
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,570
We failed to snipe you.

370
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,800
But in terms of war,

371
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,220
the fact that we blew away one, 
who wasn't even a target, is a good start.

372
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,680
<i>Night Raid...</i>

373
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,870
<i>And this is all of them?</i>

374
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,930
<i>So going east was a complete decoy.</i>

375
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,010
Kurome and Bols...

376
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,650
You're our targets among the Jaegers.

377
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,230
Brace yourselves!

378
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,820
<i>Targets...</i>

379
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,090
<i>In the past, I've incinerated countless people,</i>

380
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,570
<i>so being targeted by assassins can't be helped.</i>

381
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,040
<i>However...</i>

382
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>I can't die!</i>

383
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,130
Sis...

384
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,670
Kurome.

385
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,530
I really wanted to see you. I'm so glad...

386
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,840
Because if I'm the one to kill you,

387
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,640
I can add you to Yatsufusa's collection.

388
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,740
Wh-What is this? An earthquake?

389
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,860
Unlike the me of the past,

390
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,470
I can turn any dead body into a puppet now...

391
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,090
Sis.

392
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,270
Even if it's a mega-class Danger 
Beast, like the destaghoul.

393
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,220
<i>Whether Esdeath would split her 
group into two was a gamble.</i>

394
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,300
<i>But I see now that,
 if Yatsufusa's this powerful,</i>

395
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,690
<i>a little trap won't mean anything to them.</i>

396
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,650
Now, then... The battle between 
Imperial Arms is about to unfold.

397
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,410
I wonder how many are going to die?

398
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Puppets
