1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,450
Please... Don't kill me!

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,490
Oh, but I must.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,880
It's your own fault for walking 
around so late at night.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,750
Your parents taught you that, didn't they?

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,080
That scary monsters come out late at night?

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,230
I-If you let me live, I'll d-do anything...

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,230
Really?

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,650
I like to talk a lot, so will you talk with me?

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,590
Yes, I will! I really will!

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,470
Then... How does it feel when your head 
gets separated from your body?

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,470
Is it a bit lonely?

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,480
Eh?

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,560
Splendid... Splendid.

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,900
I could never quit this!

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
Kill the Imperial Arms Users

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,960
Kill the Imperial Arms Users

17
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,680
I can't do this anymore, Bro. My arms...

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,970
Hmm?

19
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,120
What?

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,480
Looks like your muscles still move unnecessarily.

21
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,080
Concentrate... Strengthen your will.

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,570
If you can lose all the unnecessary 
motion, you'll last twice as long.

23
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,320
B-Bro...

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,450
You can become stronger.

25
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,110
Leave it to me.

26
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,380
R-Right!

27
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,330
Tatsumi...

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,910
Time to prepare breakfast.

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,130
What are we making today?

30
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,010
Croquette bowls.

31
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,240
<i>Croquette bowls in the morning?</i>

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,260
<i>Nothing less from assassins... Damn.</i>

33
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,800
Thanks for the food!

34
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,690
My stomach's not great.

35
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,100
Huh?

36
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,490
Mine and Sheele aren't awake yet?

37
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,560
Yeah, but it's always that way.

38
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,450
You ate that super-fast, didn't you? Damn...

39
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
Tatsumi, we're making tuna bowls for lunch.

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,950
Akame is dangerous.

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,500
Huh? Where's my breakfast?

42
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,670
Well done. Where are the others?

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,270
I'm the only one who made it here.

44
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,930
I see...

45
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,210
These are the names of supporters who've 
offered assistance when the revolt starts.

46
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,820
I will take good care of it.

47
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,180
Leave the rest to me.

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,400
Please... Ensure the revolution...

49
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,360
Yes, no matter what.

50
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,070
This time, our target is the slasher we 
keep hearing about in the capital.

51
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,100
He appears late at night, and takes 
people's heads indiscriminately.

52
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,200
It's uncertain how many he's killed.

53
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,400
And a third of those killed were guards, right?

54
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,530
He must be strong.

55
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,950
Without a doubt, it's gotta be Zank the Executioner.

56
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,460
Who the heck is that?

57
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,230
You've never heard of him?

58
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,300
You must have really lived in the sticks.

59
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,540
My apologies. I don't know who that is, either.

60
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,430
I think you just forgot, Sheele...

61
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,480
So, what kind of bad guy is he?

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,850
Zank the Executioner...

63
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,030
Originally, he was apparently the executioner 
in the largest prison in the capital.

64
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,030
Because of the cabinet minister, the number 
of people for execution increased.

65
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,050
Day after day, he kept cutting off

66
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,550
the heads of people who were begging for mercy.

67
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,980
After doing this for so many years,

68
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,760
it seems cutting off heads became a habit.

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,340
I guess that would mess someone up.

70
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,510
So, since beheading at the prison wasn't 
enough, he began to kill at random.

71
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Once a punitive squad was formed, he disappeared.

72
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,640
To think he'd reappear in the capital...

73
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,750
What a dangerous guy.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,520
Let's find and defeat him!

75
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,150
Well, wait a sec, Tatsumi.

76
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,240
Bro?

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,490
Zank stole the warden's Imperial Arms, 
and started his random attacks.

78
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,660
We should travel in pairs,

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,490
or you'll be in danger.

80
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,830
<i>Right now, I think I'm in danger for 
a completely different reason.</i>

81
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,460
Hey, boss...

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,870
Did we ever find out what 
Imperial Arms Zank has?

83
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,080
Sadly, we're still looking into that.

84
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,960
Then he won't reveal things so easily...

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
That's troublesome.

86
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,650
Um, what are Imperial Arms, anyway?

87
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,950
Something like this.

88
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,800
I d-don't understand...

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,670
This is a good opportunity.

90
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,520
Let's explain it to Tatsumi.

91
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,540
Around a thousand years ago,

92
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,430
the emperor who founded the 
empire was deep in thought.

93
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,120
I want to protect this kingdom forever,

94
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,990
but someday, I will die.

95
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,490
However, weapons and armor can 
be passed down, into the future.

96
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,950
To make this kingdom everlasting,

97
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,450
create weapons of utmost intelligence!

98
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,460
Materials from legendary super-leveled Danger Beasts.

99
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,460
And rare metals like orichalcum.

100
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,460
The best of the best were summoned 
from around the world.

101
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,210
The first emperor's power and assets

102
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,880
produced forty-eight weapons that could not be reproduced today,

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,470
and they were called Imperial Arms.

104
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,600
Imperial Arms are all powerful.

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,020
And among them are said to be some 
that have the power of a thousand men.

106
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,020
The retainers that received the Imperial Arms

107
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,800
were able to achieve even greater military gains.

108
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,690
However, due to the great civil 
war five hundred years ago,

109
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,490
about half those weapons 
disappeared throughout the land.

110
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,030
And that's that.

111
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,390
Then that's

112
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,590
one of the forty-eight weapons?

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,350
Ichizan Hissatsu: Murasame.

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,520
If you are cut by this enchanted sword,

115
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,070
cursed poison enters the wound, leading to death.

116
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,600
There is no antidote for the poison.

117
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,860
Hundred Beast King Transformation: Lionel.

118
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,240
An Imperial Arms shaped like a belt.

119
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,070
Users turn themselves into a beast,

120
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,080
increasing their physical abilities.

121
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,940
Sense of smell is also heightened, 
enabling them to track enemies.

122
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,450
Adventurous Spirit Battery: Pumpkin.

123
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,920
An Imperial Arms that takes spiritual 
energy and expels it as shock wave.

124
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,700
The more the wielder is in a pinch,

125
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,620
the more destructive its powers.

126
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,010
Demon Binding: Incursio.

127
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,340
An Imperial Arms armor with impregnable defense.

128
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,780
Because the bearer is at great risk wearing this,

129
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,460
normal people die if they try to don it.

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,980
Infinite Variety: Cross Tail.

131
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,930
An Imperial Arms consisting of stiff strings.

132
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,690
He can spread them, creating a barrier 
that can find traps and enemies.

133
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,950
It also has the ability to bind and sever.

134
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,770
It lives up to the name "Infinite Variety."

135
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,910
Creation Bisector: Extase.

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
Imperial Arms in the form of giant scissors.

137
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,470
It possesses the power to bisect 
anything in the world.

138
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,070
Because of its hardness, it can 
also be used for defense.

139
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,840
There are also Imperial Arms 
that have trump cards.

140
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,730
Incursio can take advantage of the 
materials it was constructed of

141
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,960
and make itself invisible for a short while.

142
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,250
Because the Imperial Arms have such potential, 
including such trump cards,

143
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,970
one rule has been inviolable through the ages.

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,390
Using these weapons with murderous 
intent, without exception,

145
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,530
will ultimately result in a victim.

146
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,640
Meaning, if Imperial Arms wielders 
were to fight one another,

147
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,620
one is guaranteed to die.

148
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,240
The target, Zank, is an Imperial Arms user.

149
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,610
Even if the battle ends in a draw, 
both wielders cannot live.

150
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,570
Th-That's amazing.

151
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,040
And now...

152
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,050
You know all our secrets,

153
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
so we share a common destiny.

154
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,250
R-Right.

155
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,500
Don't be scared, Tatsumi.

156
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,130
This just means the boss trusts you now.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,420
Our Night Raid may be few in 
numbers, but as you can see,

158
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,610
our combat potential is vast.

159
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,140
We are the ones who will make 
this revolution happen.

160
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,740
B-Boss, what about me?

161
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,640
Huh?

162
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,670
You think you get an Imperial Arms, too?

163
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,290
Huh? I don't?

164
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,860
If it's meant to be, you may obtain one someday.

165
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
That's all I have to say.

166
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,900
Go hunt down the prey that 
the heavens cannot judge.

167
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,580
Roger.

168
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,460
We're in charge of this section.

169
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,540
The capital's citizens are so scared 
of the slasher, they're staying in.

170
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,130
Actually, that makes things easi—

171
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,070
The Imperial Capital Guard.

172
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,840
Say, Akame... Can I ask you something?

173
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,340
Don't worry.

174
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,180
I've brought emergency rations.

175
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,560
That isn't what I meant.

176
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,360
Even with a scratch, that blade will 
inflict a mortal wound, right?

177
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,270
Yes.

178
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,150
I'm surprised I survived...

179
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,890
I've had this blade for a while,

180
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,110
but it's become famous as the one slice, 
certain death enchanted sword.

181
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,030
You aren't supposed to get well known, are you?

182
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,930
But regardless, that just means you're invincible.

183
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,010
No, this blade has a weakness.

184
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,180
For example?

185
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,960
Maintaining it is nerve-racking.

186
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,590
If you accidentally cut your finger, you die instantly.

187
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,910
Ah...

188
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,390
In battle, if you don't directly 
cut your opponent's skin,

189
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,720
the curse won't be executed.

190
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,140
Facing someone like Bro, with armor 
like that, seems it might be tough.

191
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,380
This is a one slice, certain death 
world to begin with.

192
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,480
I try not to overestimate the abilities 
of the Imperial Arms.

193
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,810
<i>I'm sure she's around my age.</i>

194
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,390
<i>I wonder how many battles Akame 
has faced up till now.</i>

195
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,530
It seems assassins have now arrived, 
in addition to the slasher.

196
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,360
Talk about a violent city...

197
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
Splendid... Splendid.

198
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,830
Night Raid...

199
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,360
Now, I wonder whose head I'll take first.

200
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,250
Ah, eyes filled with such 
passion and sense of duty.

201
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,630
Admirable... Admirable.

202
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,010
I've decided!

203
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,430
I'll have the most delicious one first.

204
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,980
Seems they won't come out so easily.

205
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,300
I guess we'll just have to be patient.

206
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,650
Excuse me a sec.

207
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,270
You're going to the bathroom?

208
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,860
<i>I'm totally tense.</i>

209
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,740
Sayo...

210
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,370
W-Wait!

211
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,370
You're late, Tatsumi.

212
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,600
There's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,590
That's Sayo...

214
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,310
What the heck? So you were alive.

215
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,560
Anyway, I'm just happy.

216
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,770
So passionate...

217
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,150
Looks like I showed you something rather special.

218
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,860
Good evening.

219
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,400
Sayo turned into a suspicious old man!

220
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
Rather than "old man," call me this...

221
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,280
Affectionately...

222
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,450
Zank the Executioner.

223
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,320
You are

224
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,250
Zank the Executioner!

225
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,920
Hmm...

226
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,430
If you wait for the partner 
you were separated from...

227
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,530
But do you have that kind of a chance?

228
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,720
That's what you thought, isn't it?

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>What? Did he read my thoughts?</i>

230
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,020
<i>Is that eye an Imperial Arms?</i>

231
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,270
Bingo! The Imperial Arms Spected.

232
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,570
One of its five visionary 
powers, Perceptive Sight.

233
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,680
I can tell my opponent's thoughts, 
just by looking at their expression.

234
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,130
My observations are sharp to the ultimate degree.

235
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,650
Want a shrunken head as a reward?

236
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,580
Like hell! But man, you sure talk a lot.

237
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,470
Well, my hobby is to talk...

238
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,880
By the way, I found you with 
the power of my Far Sight.

239
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,490
Even at night or in fog,

240
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,630
I can see through things extremely far away!

241
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,840
This is splendid!

242
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,910
You thought if you attacked while I was talking,

243
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,090
something would come of it?

244
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,980
Impossible... Impossible.

245
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,310
I can see everything within your heart.

246
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,140
You'll take a huge step, then swing from above...

247
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,310
Then strike up,

248
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,470
which was a fake, to aim for my throat!

249
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,740
That's what you thought, wasn't it?

250
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,910
<i>He's far stronger than others I've fought.</i>

251
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,230
The expression on the person's face 
when you chop their head off

252
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,910
is irresistibly amazing!

253
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,470
The most common is the blank stare.

254
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,170
And they always say, "Eh?"

255
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,390
I wonder what kind of expression you'll have.

256
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,510
Splendid... Splendid.

257
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,510
My neck isn't so weak that 
you'll be able to cut it!

258
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,440
Tatsumi...

259
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,860
Wonderful. Youths are so straightforward.

260
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm liking you even more.

261
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,070
I'll add you to my shrunken heads collection!

262
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Splendid... Splendid.

263
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,430
A magnificent wound I've inflicted 
upon you, if I do say so myself.

264
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,990
What?

265
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,720
When people with wonderful eyes 
like yours beg for their lives,

266
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,290
it's very comforting.

267
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,000
So I'm taking my time.

268
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,400
Now, beg...

269
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,760
If you do, it might buy some time 
for your friends to arrive.

270
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,050
Don't be ridiculous.

271
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,520
I would never beg for my life 
from a rotten rat like you

272
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,380
who only knows how to behead people!

273
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,850
<i>He's looking into my heart, so I'll keep it simple...</i>

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,650
<i>I'm putting everything on the line...</i>

275
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,570
<i>With this one strike!</i>

276
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,940
Well, that's very valiant of you.

277
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,100
I'm sure your wounds hurt...

278
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,120
I, the master of executions, 
shall relieve you from that.

279
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,500
Here I go!

280
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,010
<i>His attack was much faster than I anticipated.</i>

281
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,180
<i>He's...</i>

282
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,960
I got a strike in.

283
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,690
Master of executions, my ass.

284
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,420
You totally missed my neck.

285
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,350
Don't make me laugh, you dumbass.

286
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,310
Silence!

287
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,520
Well done on the insults.

288
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,080
Mentally, you've won this fight.

289
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Akame!

290
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,180
I've finally found you.

291
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,570
Just wait.

292
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,460
I'll end this quickly and tend to your wounds.

293
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,030
The infamous Akame and her 
enchanted sword, Murasame.

294
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
Splendid... Splendid.

295
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,300
I've been wanting to meet you.

296
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,560
I wanted to meet you, as well. 
Because it's my mission.

297
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,390
<i>Transparent Sight!</i>

298
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,350
Results... No sign of hidden weapons.

299
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,750
Be careful, Akame...

300
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,860
He can read your thoughts with that eye!

301
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,170
I see.

302
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,170
So that's the power of that Imperial Arms.

303
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,530
But even if you can read thoughts, 
if you can't counter the actions,

304
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,910
there's no point.

305
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,500
<i>He's used to this. He's seen quite a few battles.</i>

306
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,460
<i>She doesn't only have speed. 
She has arm strength, as well.</i>

307
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,390
<i>F-Fast!</i>

308
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,490
<i>So this is a fight between Imperial Arms users?</i>

309
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,730
<i>With him reading my heart, 
we're evenly matched.</i>

310
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,480
<i>Then...</i>

311
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,900
Oh? You've arrived at a state of nothingness.

312
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,490
But this Spected has the Future Sight.

313
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,760
Judging by your muscles,

314
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,740
your next move will be—

315
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,320
I see it!

316
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,830
<i>The fact that Akame took an attack...</i>

317
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,390
Good grief.

318
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,120
It's rather unfair that sword is so unforgiving

319
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,140
with even the slightest scratch, right?

320
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,750
My moves and thoughts are being read,

321
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,620
so I think we're even.

322
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,920
Say, Akame...

323
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,100
How do you deal with the voices?

324
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,850
Voices?

325
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,970
You know, the ones you hear 
when you get really quiet.

326
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,820
The voices of everyone you've killed, 
groaning from the depths of hell.

327
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,700
They hold a grudge against me,

328
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,660
and they tell me to hurry and join them...

329
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,900
When I was cutting off heads every day 
at the jail, I started hearing them.

330
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,830
But lately, it's gotten worse.

331
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,960
I talk to deal with it, but how do you—

332
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,250
I don't hear them.

333
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,630
I don't hear voices like that.

334
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,220
This is surprising...

335
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,380
I thought I'd be able to discuss this 
with an assassin of your caliber.

336
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,100
How depressing!

337
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,650
Kurome...

338
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,070
Wh-What's wrong? Akame! Akame!

339
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,830
Illusion Sight...

340
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,280
The person she values most appeared before her.

341
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,100
She's in her memories right now,

342
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,290
reunited with the one most precious to her.

343
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,090
So that's what that Sayo was.

344
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,250
Akame,

345
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,430
you're seeing an illusion!

346
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,710
Don't be fooled!

347
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,040
It's no use.

348
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,460
It only works on one at a time, 
but the hypnosis is strong.

349
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,680
And no matter how experienced one may be,

350
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,850
it is impossible for one to kill 
those they love most.

351
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,520
Die, looking at the illusion of 
the one you love, Akame!

352
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,400
<i>She...</i>

353
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,360
<i>She didn't even falter.</i>

354
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,480
Why?!

355
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,660
You should have seen the one you love most!

356
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,080
It's because I loved her most

357
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,540
that I wanted to kill her as swiftly as possible.

358
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,560
<i>What did she...</i>

359
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,100
This settles the battle.

360
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,260
<i>No good... It's going to break.</i>

361
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,590
First, I'll destroy your weapon!

362
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,640
I won't die!

363
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,940
<i>I'll kill you first!</i>

364
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,710
<i>I have the advantage because 
I can see your future motion!</i>

365
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,200
<i>She can't kill me immediately.</i>

366
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,570
<i>Before you strike, my sword will—</i>

367
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,580
Eliminate.

368
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,040
We did it!

369
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,590
<i>She saved me this time, but...</i>

370
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,460
<i>I need to become stronger.</i>

371
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,180
Zank, I'm sure you can't hear the groaning anymore.

372
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,050
The noises

373
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,460
have stopped.

374
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,480
S-Splendid... Splendid.

375
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,410
Thank you, Akame...

376
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,360
Sayo...

377
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,980
What are you doing?

378
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,410
It's time to prepare dinner.

379
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,760
Even wounded, there are things you can do.

380
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,760
Say, Akame, who did you see back there?

381
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,100
When the time comes, I'll tell you.

382
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,180
However, I can say this much.

383
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,270
Right now, everyone in Night 
Raid is precious to me.

384
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,030
Including you.

385
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,990
What?

386
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,910
Let's go.

387
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,910
Ah, hey... Wait!

388
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,490
Tonight, we're having all of the meat.

389
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,590
We just ate meat yesterday!

390
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,930
Are you thinking about nutrition?

391
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,350
We need to eat vegetables, too!

392
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill the Dream
