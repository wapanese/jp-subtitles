1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,560
Don't try and stop me.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,320
I'm going.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,070
This is a trap.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,150
You don't have to tell me!

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,120
But there's no way I can just 
leave Tatsumi like that.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,570
You've changed quite a bit, Mine.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,620
In the past, you'd have been 
the one stopping me.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,040
You'd better not say something stupid 
like you're gonna go help, Akame.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,860
To me, he's different now.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm going, too.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,470
There's no point in endangering yourself, also!

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,500
Are you dumb?

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,390
You're the one being dumb.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,040
If we work together, our chances 
of returning alive are greater.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,520
You've gotten a lot mushier, as well, you know?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't want to hear that from you.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,960
Wha—

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,590
Hmph! Fine!

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,930
If you're going that far...

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,110
Then it's decided.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,520
Leone?

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,730
After all, I was the one who 
scouted and recruited him.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,960
If I let him be executed, 
 it'd cost me my reputation.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,490
Huh? You wanna come, too?

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,030
That said, boss... Don't try to stop us.

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,200
Who said I was going to stop you?

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,810
Boss?

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,770
If this public execution is meant to lower 
the Revolutionary Army's morale,

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,970
it's our duty to obstruct it.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,990
And Tatsumi's Incursio will be 
critical to the final battle.

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,480
Jeez, boss, you're not being honest...

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,320
Heh, it's nothing.

33
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,950
This is an emergency Night Raid mission.

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,200
We're going to rescue Tatsumi!

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,450
Tatsumi...

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,330
Kill the Despair

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,930
It's been a while, Tatsumi.

38
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,810
Kill the Despair

39
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,700
So you're with Night Raid.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,860
There was a lot I wanted to say to you,

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,940
but that all disappeared after seeing your face.

42
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,060
Aren't you miserable?

43
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,950
Come and join me instead.

44
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,250
That way, I can absolve you 
of everything you've done.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,410
I have no intention of joining you.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,290
If you refuse, death is the only alternative.

47
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,170
I'm prepared to die!

48
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm not asking you to betray your allies.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,350
Simply being close would be enough.

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,770
Why do you feel so strongly about me?

51
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,980
Because you have stolen my heart.

52
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,530
Tatsumi, be with me.

53
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,480
No!

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,700
I don't want to be with someone 
who spreads destruction!

55
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,870
I see. Then I suppose there's no choice.

56
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,690
I, myself, will perform the execution.

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,630
The rest will be wagered on your will to live.

58
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,380
Isn't the captain in love with Tatsumi?

59
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,380
So why?

60
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,760
Perhaps you could say that it's out of love.

61
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,660
We've been given our orders.

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,100
During tomorrow's public execution, 
the palace will be short-handed.

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,730
We're tasked with standing guard.

64
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,110
To kill the one you love...

65
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,440
What does that even mean?

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,500
I just can't understand.

67
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,030
I do.

68
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,900
If someone else will do it anyway,

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,800
I'd rather do it myself.

70
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,530
Just like how I want to be the one to kill my sister.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,820
Because I love her.

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,970
But now...

73
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,300
I don't have enough time.

74
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,390
I don't have enough time...

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,890
We’ve received word that, along with Esdeath,

76
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,690
Commander-in-Chief Budou will 
guard the public execution.

77
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,370
By "Budou," do you mean...

78
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,580
The Commander-in-Chief who holds sole 
leadership over the imperial guard.

79
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,580
A formidable enemy whose Imperial 
Arms is the Adramelech.

80
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,740
Jeez.

81
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,250
Susanoo, are you prepared with our trump card?

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,550
Yes.

83
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,120
Whenever you give the order, I can invoke it.

84
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,400
Right.

85
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,470
For the sake of our fallen brethren, 
we must succeed.

86
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,470
Rest in peace,

87
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,470
Lubbock.

88
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,580
Citizens of the empire...

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,300
As of late, there seem to be those who 
would instill fear into your hearts

90
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,740
by spreading preposterous rumors 
about taking down the capital.

91
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,500
However, there is no need to lend 
your ears to such rabble-raising!

92
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,670
Here, today, we will execute a member 
of an insurgency known as Night Raid,

93
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,960
which have terrorized the public time and again!

94
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,160
These conspirators are the rebel army's vanguard. 
The rebel army that is responsible

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,080
for our current state of chaos.

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,350
Deceiving innocent citizens for their own 
self-interest, they are villainous assassins.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,910
No one has the right to infringe upon the 
peaceful lives of the empire's citizenry.

98
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,990
The empire... This capital is indestructible!

99
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,020
Was that all right, minister?

100
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,650
You did wonderfully, Your Excellency.

101
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,290
General Esdeath,

102
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,800
I will leave that one's head to you.

103
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,970
Minister, where are you going?

104
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,340
Well, it's lunchtime.

105
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,310
Now, now, Your Excellency.

106
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,570
Hmm? Really?

107
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,190
I'll leave the rest to you, Budou.

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,130
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,970
I'm hungry...

110
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,120
<i>So the minister's running away.</i>

111
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,260
<i>Whether it be to kill or spare a person, 
I know exactly where to strike.</i>

112
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,730
You said you were ready to die 
for your cause, Tatsumi.

113
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,990
If you are truly the man I thought,

114
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,570
you'll show me your will to live.

115
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,710
Dumbass Tatsumi...

116
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,280
What are you doing getting captured?

117
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,040
Mine, why did you come?

118
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,440
After making me worry, 
how dare you say such a thing?

119
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,630
Idiot, where are you aiming?!

120
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,250
Najenda?

121
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,430
So you finally show yourself.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,180
The circumstances necessitated it.

123
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,940
Hmph... The empire's traitor.

124
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,070
It's been a while, so why not chat a bit?

125
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,500
In the torture chamber.

126
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't have much to say to you.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,150
So I'll pass.

128
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,330
Lubbock, these are the explosives you planted.

129
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,660
Even though it isn't as planned, 
I'll put them to good use.

130
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,880
I knew you wouldn't come without a plan...

131
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,090
How interesting.

132
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,340
So you've come to save your friends, Night Raid!

133
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,710
Here we go!

134
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,620
Right.

135
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,410
Then you're Commander-in-Chief Budou.

136
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm not really interested in straight-laced guys.

137
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,810
People like you don't belong 
in a sacred place like this.

138
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,320
Fall before my Imperial Arms!

139
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,660
If we must fight,

140
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,520
I will eliminate you.

141
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,840
So this is your Imperial Arms.

142
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,740
Yeah, its name is...

143
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,110
Susanoo.

144
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,920
No need to tell me your name.

145
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,760
Before I can memorize it, I'll destroy you.

146
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,050
Take this!

147
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,010
Not bad...

148
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,770
More!

149
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,060
Jeez, you're so tiny, you're hard to catch.

150
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,520
Say anything else about my size, and I'll kill you.

151
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
Watch out.

152
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,580
Ouch...

153
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,410
So you're in charge of close-quarters combat, eh?

154
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,670
Now! Shoot!

155
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,000
Then you'll die, too.

156
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,010
I'm confident in my healing abilities.

157
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,880
I believe in you.

158
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,660
Damn it.

159
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,810
I'm paralyzed from the shock...

160
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,450
Not bad at all.

161
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,030
It's unfortunate that you all, 
including the boy being executed,

162
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,070
have chosen the wrong path.

163
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,000
That's none of your concern.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,330
Wrong or not, I'll follow my own path.

165
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,240
Mine...

166
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,850
What's wrong?

167
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,960
Are you already done?

168
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,380
You may not know this,

169
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,670
but Pumpkin, my Imperial Arms, 
becomes stronger when I'm in a pinch.

170
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,930
That's why I deliberately put myself in danger.

171
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,390
That's my strength.

172
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,070
It wasn't enough.

173
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,460
We shall not let you pass.

174
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,950
There it is.

175
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,290
Tatsumi, I'm coming.

176
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,040
Freeze.

177
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,260
Susanoo!

178
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,700
I respected you as a general,

179
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,390
but is this all?

180
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,020
<i>With Esdeath as my opponent, 
there's no time to conserve energy.</i>

181
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,600
<i>Magatama Manifestation!</i>

182
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,570
What are you doing?

183
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,080
We've survived this long because we're tenacious.

184
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,700
Even if you did have him stuck in ice, 
you shouldn't lower your guard.

185
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,330
Go, Susanoo.

186
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,250
Defeat Esdeath!

187
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,380
Then this is your trump card. How fun.

188
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,090
However, you still cannot defeat me.

189
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,340
I'll pulverize you to your core.

190
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,930
<i>Mirror of Yata!</i>

191
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,980
As expected.

192
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,110
You old lightning man...

193
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,280
Mine, get some distance.

194
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,220
It's fine, Tatsumi.

195
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,990
I'll counter the biggest pinch 
yet, and come save you!

196
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,190
I see...

197
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,950
You can control that Imperial Arms 
due to your personality.

198
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,330
And your Imperial Arms is living 
up to your expectations.

199
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,590
Take this!

200
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,710
But you cannot win against me.

201
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,970
That's my line.

202
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,010
Mine!

203
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,770
I'm all right, Tatsumi.

204
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,580
Did you forget?

205
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,520
I told you I'd be standing on the 
winning side, no matter what.

206
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,900
My power... Pumpkin's power...

207
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,040
is about to be unleashed.

208
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
I'll finish you.

209
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,830
Out of pity.

210
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,290
There's no need for pity.

211
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,340
We're all going to leave this place together,

212
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,930
no matter what.

213
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,560
Feel the wrath of my Imperial Arms 
Adramelech's secret ability!

214
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,980
<i>Solid Shooter!</i>

215
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,190
This is bad.

216
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,700
Mine!

217
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,050
<i>Pumpkin, I'm begging you.</i>

218
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,910
<i>Respond to me.</i>

219
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,620
This is the end.

220
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,880
<i>Tatsumi...</i>

221
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,270
Like hell I'll lose!

222
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,890
What?

223
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,460
I won...

224
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,140
Mine!

225
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,930
Tatsumi!

226
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,980
Mine!

227
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,110
Mine...

228
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,850
Mine!

229
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,780
Mine...

230
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,080
Mission accomplished.

231
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,040
Retreat now!

232
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,950
Tatsumi...

233
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,430
I won't let you go.

234
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,420
<i>Ameno Murakumo!</i>

235
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,640
I've got you!

236
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,020
All will freeze before me.

237
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,520
<i>Makahadoma.</i>

238
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,180
This exhaustion.

239
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,530
Once a day is my limit, but...

240
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,990
Don't you think it's more than enough?

241
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,330
Wh-What?

242
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,210
What happened?

243
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,230
I literally froze time and space.

244
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,480
I developed this, not only so Tatsumi 
would never again escape,

245
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,900
but also to ensure my enemy's defeat.

246
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,340
This is my trump card.

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,100
Susanoo, escape!

248
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,310
I'll commend you for making me play my trump.

249
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,060
<i>Susanoo's core...</i>

250
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,490
This is the end.

251
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,410
Let's escort you all to the torture chamber.

252
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,870
Wh-What's this?

253
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,710
He's fully regenerating himself.

254
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,230
A third Magatama Manifestation.

255
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,940
Using it repetitively shouldn't be possible,

256
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,720
but if I can supplement 
the power with my life...

257
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,430
<i>Since Commander-in-Chief Budou's been 
defeated, more enemies will come.</i>

258
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,610
<i>My life force is depleted.</i>

259
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,190
<i>I'm leaving the rest to you, Susanoo.</i>

260
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,940
Najenda! You...

261
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,990
<i>Yasakani no Magatama.</i>

262
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,080
His power has increased.

263
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,240
Su, I'll go, too.

264
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,570
Run away, Tatsumi.

265
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,890
But Su can probably...

266
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,130
This is the result of his passing the limit.

267
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,980
Susanoo's strength hasn't actually doubled.

268
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,840
In this state, he won't even come 
close to defeating Esdeath.

269
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,680
Su!

270
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,850
It seems you've increased in strength, 
but you're still no match for me.

271
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,110
You cannot even scratch me.

272
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,190
Su!

273
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,650
You must understand why we've come this far.

274
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,280
Go, Tatsumi.

275
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,820
Su...

276
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,280
A thousand years have passed since my creation.

277
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,200
And the joy I've experienced in the 
recent past has been unparalleled.

278
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,360
I have no regrets.

279
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,330
Susanoo...

280
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,450
This is goodbye.

281
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,490
I won't let you escape.

282
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,340
I won't let you interfere.

283
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,470
<i>A reflective mirror.</i>

284
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,180
I won't let you pursue them.

285
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,040
You're buying time by sacrificing 
yourself, to help them escape.

286
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,320
All of Najenda's subordinates 
are too compassionate.

287
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,430
I'm a human-based Imperial Arms.

288
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,700
I've already used my trump.

289
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,580
As a pawn, this is all I can do.

290
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,300
You... You said your name was Susanoo.

291
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,710
Then you remembered.

292
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,080
I will remember your name.

293
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,590
Not as an Imperial Arms, but as a warrior.

294
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,300
Celebrate your last moment 
of life with this duel.

295
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,050
Show me what you've got!

296
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm taking you to the hideout right now.

297
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,820
Your wounds will heal quickly, okay?

298
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,850
Put me down.

299
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,020
What are you saying?

300
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,000
We have to hurry and treat your injuries.

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,690
Just put me down...

302
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,620
Tatsumi...

303
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,290
I'm right here.

304
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,380
You saved me in Kyoroch,

305
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,050
so I was thinking I had to return the favor.

306
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,830
That's not...

307
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,100
We're even now, right?

308
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,930
Yeah, so hold yourself together.

309
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,850
You're a fool.

310
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,790
I can't heal like Leone.

311
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,080
I wanted to fight together till the end, but...

312
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,440
What are you saying?

313
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,440
We're still going to

314
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,350
fight together...

315
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,480
You're a bad liar, Tatsumi.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,410
You're as mushy as usual.

317
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,800
This can't... You idiot.

318
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,540
Why did you have to come save me?

319
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,780
Stop crying. You're a man, aren't you?

320
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,040
Hey...

321
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,440
I'm glad I fell in love with you.

322
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,010
Mine...

323
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,780
Don't die. Don't you dare die.

324
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,880
You're gonna stand on the 
winning side, aren't you?

325
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,450
What are you saying?

326
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,020
I'm already on the winning side.

327
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,870
I love you.

328
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,640
Mine... Mine...

329
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,350
Mine!

330
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,890
Kill the Little Sister

331
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,890
