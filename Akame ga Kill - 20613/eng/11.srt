1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,700
<i>Oh, yeah... We were up all night 
with Tatsumi's homecoming party.</i>

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,620
<i>And we passed out on the spot...</i>

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,460
<i>I'm still sleepy.</i>

4
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,850
<i>I did it, Lord Stylish.</i>

5
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,220
I took one down!

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,280
"I'm continuing the mission,"

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,440
so he says, Lord Stylish.

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,970
Excellent. You indeed have the knight's role.

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,110
You flew right into enemy territory.

10
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,510
Now attack, Team Stylish, 
with passion and intensity!

11
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,280
The troops have entered the base.

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,460
Kill the Mad Scientist

13
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,130
Kill the Mad Scientist

14
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,610
And the show begins...

15
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,510
I'm getting tingles down my spine.

16
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,470
Damn it... All of a sudden, 
there are a lot of enemies!

17
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,180
And so closeâ€”

18
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
<i>They're inside...</i>

19
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,850
Enemy. Kill.

20
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,110
<i>Crap, I have to meet up with the others.</i>

21
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,930
One down.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,830
My enhanced soldiers are rugged and durable.

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,490
You can't treat them like normal humans.

24
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,210
What's the matter?

25
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,830
They seem to be durable, as well.

26
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,970
Here's another way to use strings.

27
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,890
And...

28
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,290
Tie them together, and see what you can do!

29
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,360
What ingenuity...

30
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm a book-lender.

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,990
There's a ton of info on using string 
in the shop's manga selection.

32
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,410
Here they come...

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,430
again...

34
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,720
M-My apologies...

35
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,090
I don't deal well with groups...

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,790
They're fast!

37
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,860
Get behind me.

38
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,690
Akame!

39
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,530
I'd expect no less.

40
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
A new one!

41
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
My compliments, though we are enemies.

42
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,250
<i>He's strong.</i>

43
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,430
My name is Toby.

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,500
I request a duel with Akame!

45
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,390
<i>This Imperial Arms user</i>

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,310
<i>feels different than the rest, like a machine.</i>

47
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,450
Akame!

48
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,940
You bastards, get out of the way.

49
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,400
There you are.

50
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,960
Hey, armored guy...

51
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,220
Seems you're up against me, Kakusan.

52
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,780
That Imperial Arms...

53
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,500
Like it?

54
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,910
It's the Creation Bisector: Extase.

55
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,930
It's my happy little Imperial Arms.

56
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,630
That isn't

57
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,770
yours!

58
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,660
Cut through flesh, and rend it from bone!

59
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,250
Good response... I thought I had you.

60
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,810
So much for your stiff armor.

61
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,130
Poor thing.

62
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,470
This Imperial Arms can cut through 
anything in the world.

63
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,880
Armor means nothing!

64
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,960
As predicted, they're effective against 
Murasame and Incursio.

65
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
Just as planned.

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,060
It's all about finding a good match.

67
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,000
But we've lost quite a few foot soldiers.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,350
There's too much noise to hear well,

69
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,690
but the damage seems serious.

70
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,280
What a tragic loss...

71
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,280
<i>Not.</i>

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,960
<i>I have plenty of soldiers.</i>

73
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,100
<i>They're all pathetic criminals</i>

74
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,880
<i>who thought they'd made a contract 
with me for lighter punishment.</i>

75
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,840
<i>They're really lab rats until the day they die.</i>

76
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,650
Give that back!

77
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,760
That's Sheele's!

78
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,660
Who the hell is that?

79
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,670
You want to die that much?

80
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,440
I'll cut you up.

81
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,230
You seem to be struggling.

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Sloppy, as always.

83
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,660
Mine...

84
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,130
Those wimps couldn't even buy time.

85
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,960
Now one of them's managed to regroup.

86
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,160
Let's get this over with.

87
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,760
Just seeing the enemy with Extase pisses me off.

88
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,320
Get this over with?

89
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,540
Think before you speak...

90
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,400
Your base was found, you've been infiltrated,

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,850
and now you're under a frontal assault.

92
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,980
Exactly my point.

93
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,270
Enough big talk!

94
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,240
<i>Fool, my modified body even stopped Incursio.</i>

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,160
<i>I can take a gun head-on.</i>

96
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,380
<i>Hold it!</i>

97
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm better when I'm in a pinch.

98
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,800
You underestimated me.

99
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,290
<i>Welcome back, Sheele.</i>

100
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,340
Kakusan is down.

101
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,000
We've also lost a lot of foot soldiers.

102
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,640
Oh, dear.

103
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,080
I miscalculated.

104
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,560
Well, in that case...

105
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,190
Something is coming from the sky!

106
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,440
A Danger Beast, air manta!

107
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,330
There's someone on top.

108
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,320
Th-That's...

109
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,240
Ex-General Najenda!

110
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,040
There appear to be two more!

111
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,750
How stylish!

112
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,060
They tamed a Danger Beast, 
and they're riding it.

113
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,500
This isn't the time to get excited!

114
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,420
Headquarters' divination Imperial 
Arms is impressive as always.

115
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,670
Ill fortune from our base's direction.

116
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,710
Spot on.

117
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,300
Good thing I came back right away.

118
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,310
Time to unveil the new members.

119
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,150
You caught me off-guard, but this is convenient.

120
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,040
I'll make all of you my test subjects

121
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,130
with my secret weapons!

122
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,960
If I can't take you down in one blow, 
I'll have to cut you up like this.

123
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
This is going to hurt.

124
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,840
Prepare yourself.

125
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,430
I no longer feel any such sensation!

126
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,050
Tasteless... How dare you 
stab me from the side?

127
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,160
The base and my people are in danger.

128
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,170
I don't intend to just sit and watch.

129
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,790
Well, I might have lost, even one-on-one.

130
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,010
Akame, please tell me...

131
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,730
How was I inferior to you?

132
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Your attacks were vicious, but you were careless,

133
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,030
I think.

134
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,590
My defense became careless, I see...

135
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,990
Perhaps a lack of pain is not ideal.

136
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,930
What is that?

137
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,960
A new enemy?

138
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
Hold on.

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,310
It's the boss! We have backup!

140
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,750
Nice timing!

141
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,550
And no fair!

142
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,790
Why?

143
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,670
She gets to show up on that badass thing...

144
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,960
I want one, too!

145
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,910
Huh?

146
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,160
I've been thinking this for a while, 
but your taste is messed-up.

147
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,620
<i>Pretty, pretty girl...</i>

148
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,360
<i>You're wide open behind!</i>

149
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,300
Now you've done it!

150
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,330
You threw a knife at me out of nowhere.

151
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,430
I was knocked out for a while!

152
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,230
I can't breathe... Help.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:38,280
I like surprise attacks, but I dislike 
being attacked by surprise.

154
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,070
Looks like you've been strengthened.

155
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
Don't go thinking that means you can die easily.

156
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,450
Th-This little... That's what she did last time...?

157
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,060
That surprise attack got me good...

158
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,430
Oh, crap, I took him out in a single blow.

159
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,070
S-Sis...

160
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,130
Are you okay?

161
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,540
I got caught off-guard earlier, but when 
I'm transformed, I can heal faster.

162
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,560
This is nothing.

163
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,390
Is everyone all right?

164
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,250
Yeah.

165
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Everyone's here now.

166
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,940
There's still more?

167
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,020
But this is the last of the ones 
setting off the strings.

168
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,910
I don't smell anyone else nearby, either.

169
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,950
Okay, now that we're all here, 
let's finish them off!

170
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,350
Akame? What's wrong, guys?

171
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,120
M-My body...

172
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,800
won't move.

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,270
This is like that time on the ship.

174
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,020
Hypnosis?

175
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,390
No, this is

176
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,620
poison...

177
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,700
Effective on everyone except Incursio, Lord Stylish.

178
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,700
<i>Secret Weapon #1: my stylishly 
prepared paralyzing poison.</i>

179
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,900
Doesn't that mean our allies are in trouble, too?

180
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,090
They've been given an antidote.

181
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,710
Seriously? Amazing, Lord Stylish! Wow!

182
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,680
I didn't want to use a new drug 
on such good test subjects...

183
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,470
The drugs are also precious. 
They took forever to make.

184
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,440
But what could I do?

185
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,970
Our men were getting destroyed!

186
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,710
Amazing, Lord Stylish.

187
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,240
So kind.

188
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,440
And it's unscented, so it's kind to me, too!

189
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,660
<i>I can still move more than the others.</i>

190
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,070
<i>I have to protect them!</i>

191
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,680
He's on our side, right?

192
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,910
Now, eliminate those enemies before you, Susanoo.

193
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,310
Understood.

194
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,920
D-Damn...

195
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,580
There's a new one decimating our men!

196
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,930
Impossible... The poison works on all living things.

197
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,890
It might be an Imperial Arms 
we don't know about yet.

198
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,260
Well, we won't need any more test subjects.

199
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,060
My custom-made human bombs!

200
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,120
That settles that!

201
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,670
It's... No way.

202
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,110
That assistant...

203
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,010
An organism-based Imperial Arms!

204
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,360
A human Imperial Arms!

205
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,220
Wh-What do want?

206
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,060
There.

207
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,950
What?

208
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,760
<i>A good place to observe Akame in that position,</i>

209
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,050
<i>and upwind of the poison's dispersal.</i>

210
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,710
<i>If there's someone coordinating this,</i>

211
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,150
<i>they must be somewhere around there.</i>

212
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,760
<i>Bingo.</i>

213
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,880
Susanoo, enemies on the southeast ledge.

214
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,340
Don't let them escape!

215
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,230
Understood.

216
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,260
We've been found out!

217
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,190
It can't be helped. Let's be safe 
and get out of here!

218
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,030
<i>The poison doesn't work on organism types!</i>

219
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,220
<i>I must destroy the core, or deal with the handler.</i>

220
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,490
He won't just let us go, will he?

221
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,330
Fear not, Lord Stylish.

222
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,450
In Shogi, we'd be the gold and silver pieces.

223
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,630
We will protect you.

224
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,040
<i>No way. You don't stand a chance.</i>

225
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,000
<i>You're just scouts. You can't defeat him.</i>

226
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,310
<i>In that case, I'll have to do this!</i>

227
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,350
<i>Secret Weapon #2: danger type!</i>

228
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,560
It's the only choice!

229
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,000
Lord... Stylish?

230
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,280
Here it comes!

231
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,620
This is the ultimate in stylishness!

232
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,960
I become a Danger Beast myself, 
and destroy all of you!

233
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,660
Beautiful...

234
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,570
You're amazing, Lord Stylish.

235
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,910
You are my precious nourishment!

236
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,970
Let's become one!

237
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,440
Yes...

238
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I eat the nutritious meat, and I level up!

239
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,530
What the hell is that?

240
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,240
Gross.

241
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,270
It's a monster.

242
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,970
I'm still not big enough.

243
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,220
I'm not close enough to the 
ultimate Imperial Arms...

244
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,880
To go higher, I have to get even bigger!

245
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,070
For that, I will have you, too!

246
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,780
He's tough.

247
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,060
Crap, I need to go, too.

248
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,400
Tatsumi, if you can move, take me with you.

249
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,110
Akame...

250
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,160
Sure.

251
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,210
Hold on tight.

252
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,290
Let's hurry, Akame!

253
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,180
What's wrong, organism-based Imperial Arms?

254
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,210
You can hit me harder!

255
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,400
What is that, a two-man costume?

256
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,420
Since you seem rather dizzy, I'll squish you both!

257
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,320
It's no use.

258
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,830
If it can't cut my skin, even the Ichizan 
Hissatsu: Murasame is useless.

259
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,290
Time for you to give up!

260
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,900
You...

261
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,330
Checkmate,

262
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,640
Dr. Stylish!

263
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,610
I'm not done yet!

264
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,360
It looks like we can cut through there.

265
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,780
Go, Akame!

266
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,750
Eliminate.

267
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,920
<i>There...</i>

268
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,500
<i>There were still so many human 
experiments I wanted to do...</i>

269
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,970
Wh-Why do I have such bad luck?

270
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,930


271
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,620
At least you died with all your parts intact.

272
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill the Newcomers
