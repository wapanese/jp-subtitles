1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,690
Hey.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,420
Tatsumi,

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,490
it's about time we got going.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,430
We're going this way.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,080
Tatsumi, you head back now.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,710
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,260
We're supposed to be together—

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,340
You already made some new friends, didn't you?

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,880
You can't rely on us forever!

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,360
See ya, Tatsumi.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,950
If there is a next life, we'll meet there.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,740
W-Wait...

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,070
Wait a second!

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,190
Don't...

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,970
Don't leave me all alone!

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,510
What a painful dream...

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,990
And this one's asleep.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,010
It seems Tatsumi will be training under me.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,210
Let's do our best!

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,630
<i>An air-headed superior?</i>

21
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,990
Good morning.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,270
My glasses! My glasses!

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,540
Good morning.

24
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,880
Arranged by Akame

25
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,290
Kill the Dream

26
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,850
Kill the Dream

27
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,060
Hmm...

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,640
I wonder if it's really okay 
to put Sheele in charge.

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,010
I'm sure it'll be fine.

30
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,180
Sheele will probably get along with Tatsumi.

31
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,910
What makes you say that?

32
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,070
Tatsumi will take to an older trainer more.

33
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,070
Right here!

34
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,380
I called dibs on training him next.

35
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,320
See? Even this is a skill.

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,690
What the hell? That's so unfair!

37
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,690
The more experienced the assassin, 
the better the kill.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,300
How's that?

39
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,050
Wasn't that phrased well?

40
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,120
Perhaps not.

41
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,180
Regarding lunch, I'm making 
mabo tofu in a beef bowl.

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,940
What do you think?

43
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,210
Uh, shouldn't the tofu be by itself? 
And the beef bowl just a beef bowl?

44
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,610
Sounds great!

45
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,680
And I was thinking of a fried chicken topping.

46
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,500
Thoughts?

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,130
Isn't that a bit heavy? 
There's no need for more meat—

48
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,560
Sounds great!

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,510
Night Raid women are carnivorous.

50
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,440
You did well to swim in that armor.

51
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,430
It's so heavy... This is hard.

52
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,680
It's an important discipline on the 
assassin-training curriculum.

53
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,700
Since I don't have a specific job at the base,

54
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,740
I can concentrate on training you.

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,130
Why don't you have a job?

56
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,920
While cooking...

57
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,070
I burned the meat, and angered Akame.

58
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,840
The meat...

59
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,310
While cleaning, I made a bigger mess, 
and made more work for Bulat.

60
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,060
Don't worry about it!

61
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,520
While shopping, I mistook sugar for 
salt, and Leone laughed at me.

62
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,600
And this amount is ridiculous!

63
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,030
While doing laundry...

64
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,070
I accidentally washed Mine with the laundry.

65
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,070
Uh, I don't mind that last one.

66
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,500
<i>In fact, good job.</i>

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,620
By the way, Sheele...

68
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,860
When I first met everyone, you weren't 
in that returning group, right?

69
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,750
Hmm...

70
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,750
I feel like there was a reason...

71
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,970
But I've forgotten.

72
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,630
Oh...

73
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,570
I'm sorry for being so—

74
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,850
My glasses, my glasses...

75
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,070
Why are you in this line of work, Sheele?

76
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,190
If I were to start from the beginning...

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,010
I grew up in the capital's downtown district.

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,160
Ever since childhood, I've been 
clumsy and bad at everything.

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,890
In my life, I couldn't take pride in a single thing.

80
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,330
"She probably has a screw loose 
in her head somewhere."

81
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,180
People often said things like that about me.

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,580
However...

83
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,690
There was someone who was kind to me.

84
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,820
She wouldn't make fun of me,

85
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,330
no matter what mistakes I made.

86
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,660
The time I spent with her was the 
only time I was truly happy.

87
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,960
Until that day...

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,380
I was with her, as usual, at her house.

89
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,890
A man appeared at the door.

90
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,390
It was my friend's former boyfriend.

91
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,800
He resented her for leaving him,

92
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,310
and began to get violent in the house.

93
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,480
Eventually, he grabbed her neck 
and started to strangle her.

94
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,620
The man was high from drugs.

95
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,270
I thought to myself, "I have to save her."

96
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,480
I was surprisingly calm.

97
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,750
The man died immediately.

98
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,660
She was shaking from what had just happened.

99
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
But in contrast, my mind was clear.

100
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,520
In the end, the incident was ruled self-defense.

101
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,940
But I never saw my friend again.

102
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,390
And then...

103
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,370
A few days later, the man's friends 
came to avenge his death.

104
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,900
"We already killed your parents. 
You're next," they said.

105
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,860
Although I was being threatened,

106
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,320
my mind was surprisingly calm again.

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,980
I killed the men, one after the next,

108
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,800
with the knife I kept for protection.

109
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,740
That was when I realized...

110
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
The screw that was loose in my head...

111
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,280
made me a talented killer.

112
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,570
I can help rid society of garbage.

113
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,540
There's something I can be of use for...

114
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,960
When the Revolutionary Army recruited me,
 I was a freelance assassin in the capital.

115
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,610
<i>Everyone's been through so much.</i>

116
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,990
I wonder if I can do this.

117
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,320
Don't worry.

118
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,230
Unlike me, you're good at cooking!

119
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,910
<i>That's what you mean?</i>

120
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,210
Seems you're doing well, Tatsumi!

121
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,030
<i>I wonder if I can do this...</i>

122
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,790
Tatsumi,

123
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,740
your wounds have pretty much healed, right?

124
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,310
This is the Imperial Arms we took from Zank.

125
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,950
Try it on.

126
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,730
Really?

127
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,320
What about everyone else?

128
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,220
Only one Imperial Arms per person.

129
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,760
Operating them takes a lot of 
mental and physical strength.

130
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,050
<i>It doesn't look too cool,</i>

131
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,040
<i>but this eye has incredible abilities!</i>

132
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,880
It wasn't in any of the documents,

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,210
so we don't know a lot about it.

134
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,560
It has the ability to read minds, right?

135
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,020
Try looking at me.

136
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,870
You...

137
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,630
You want to eat meat tonight!

138
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,890
It's perfect.

139
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,830
Nope.

140
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,910
It hasn't even activated.

141
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,750
I don't want my mind read!

142
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,870
If it has five visionary abilities, 
why not test another?

143
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,830
You've always got something to say.

144
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,000
All right, then.

145
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,090
The last unknown ability...

146
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,220
Activate!

147
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,760
So?

148
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,210
What's wrong with you?

149
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,550
What's this wonderful power?

150
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,760
What's with him?

151
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,810
Imperial Arms are amazing!

152
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,790
This is bad... It's rejecting him!

153
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,030
Take it off at once.

154
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,390
I was suddenly exhausted...

155
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,460
It's the compatibility.

156
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,490
It just didn't suit you.

157
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,760
I bet you were worried about 
how lame you looked.

158
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,780
They say the first impression an 
Imperial Arms has of you matters.

159
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,410
We'll send it to the Revolutionary 
Army's headquarters.

160
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,170
They'll analyze it, and it'll become 
a crucial part of our strength.

161
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,370
Although we are mainly a team of assassins,

162
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,480
collecting the Imperial Arms 
is an important sub-mission.

163
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,180
In cases with Imperial Arms holders, 
like Zank, we take them.

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,350
If we can't take it, destroying it is best.

165
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,220
Basically, the more Imperial Arms we get,

166
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,060
the stronger the Revolutionary Army?

167
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,220
Exactly.

168
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,110
This has information on the Imperial 
Arms. You should read it.

169
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,860
Amazing...

170
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,170
There are so many.

171
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,570
And this is only some?

172
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,370
Learn as much as you can, if only 
about the ones in there.

173
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Speaking of that, which is the 
strongest Imperial Arms?

174
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,900
That depends on usage and compatibility.

175
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,890
But if I had to choose one...

176
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,320
The Imperial Arms that controls ice.

177
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,790
That is what I believe.

178
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,930
Fortunately, its user isn't in the capital.

179
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,430
They're busy conquering the northern race.

180
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,760
Northern race?

181
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,890
Hero of the north, Numa Seika...

182
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,910
The prince of the northern race.

183
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,870
He's never lost a battle with his spear in hand.

184
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,900
A fierce, brilliant strategist in whom the 
northern race has invested their faith.

185
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,410
Naturally, he's a threat to the capital.

186
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,670
His powerful army uses their most 
fortified city as its base.

187
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,250
They were training to invade the capital.

188
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,780
In order to prevent that,

189
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,960
the capital arranged for the North's conquest.

190
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,040
There's nothing to worry about.

191
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,870
Even if it's that woman, conquering the 
North will take at least a year.

192
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,100
That's true.

193
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,970
Bring the formidable enemies on!

194
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,690
We're collecting Imperial Arms, after all!

195
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,860
You're rather chipper.

196
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,350
What's with that, all of a sudden?

197
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,510
Well, there are still many Imperial 
Arms with unknown abilities, right?

198
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,560
That's when I realized it.

199
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,280
Having seen only some of these abilities

200
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,850
tells me that maybe...

201
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,240
Just maybe...

202
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,700
There might be an Imperial Arms 
that can resurrect people!

203
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,660
Right?

204
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,830
That way, I can bring Sayo and Ieyasu back!

205
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,260
So I'll collect as many Imperial—

206
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,210
You can't.

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,300
Bro?

208
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,720
Even Imperial Arms can't bring back the dead.

209
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,720
You only get one life.

210
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,740
Y-You don't know that!

211
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,300
Not until you try!

212
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,850
The current Emperor is perfect evidence.

213
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,050
If an Imperial Arms like that existed, 
the old Emperor would still rule.

214
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,230
He created, and passed down, the Imperial 
Arms because he knew he'd perish.

215
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,730
You must give up.

216
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,580
Otherwise, that weakness in your 
heart will be used against you.

217
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,950
And you will die.

218
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,520
Tatsumi?

219
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,890
You're still awake?

220
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,270
I thought

221
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,770
maybe they could return, and it made me happy.

222
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,280
Even if the odds were low, I could hope...

223
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,230
I guess it really is goodbye.

224
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,060
I thought I'd already given up.

225
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,770
But I...

226
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,590
Tatsumi...

227
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,680
I'll keep this a secret from everyone,

228
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,390
so cry as much as you'd like.

229
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,050
Is it really okay?

230
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,650
For my superior to be this easy on me?

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,130
Who knows?

232
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,730
I think it's fine.

233
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,690
Probably.

234
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,410
That's just like you, Sheele.

235
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,170
Thanks, Sheele.

236
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,920
<i>I would like to thank you, as well, Tatsumi.</i>

237
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,730
<i>Thanks to you, I've found another thing</i>

238
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,830
<i>I can be useful for.</i>

239
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,500
The northerners were defeated in an instant,

240
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
as expected of you, General Esdeath.

241
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,870
To think, this is supposed to be the North's hero.

242
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,070
How boring.

243
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,870
Die.

244
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,430
Is there no worthy enemy anywhere 
that can satisfy me?

245
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,440
The slums are pretty lively...

246
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,530
It's the spirit of the poor.

247
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,680
If you're born into poverty,

248
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,540
you learn to get stronger.

249
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,540
Hello, Leone!

250
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,960
Come massage my shoulders again, won't you?

251
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,650
How about a drink tonight, Leone?

252
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,820
Leone! Come play with me!

253
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,230
You're really popular here.

254
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,330
I was born and raised here, after all.

255
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,190
I also made a name for myself 
around here as a masseuse—

256
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,490
There she is! It's Leone!

257
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,350
I'll finally have you pay your tab!

258
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,950
Time to settle your gambling debts!

259
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,950
Ah, hey!

260
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,420
Return the money you hustled from my brother!

261
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,800
What do you think? Isn't this place fun?

262
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,380
I'm worried you might end up killed here!

263
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,760
I have news to report.

264
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,040
General Nakakido and General Hemi have left

265
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,520
to join the Revolutionary Army.

266
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,560
That military specialist, General Nakakido, has...

267
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,410
The Revolutionary Army is growing 
stronger at an exponential rate.

268
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,440
If we don't hurry and end this, the capital...

269
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,940
Do not be flustered!

270
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,990
They are down in the southern region.

271
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,000
We can deal with them at any time!

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,910
If they're gathered together, taking care 
of them will be easier, anyway!

273
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,540
Isn't that right, Minister?

274
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,520
As expected of you, my lord.

275
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,980
In this matter, you are the voice of calm.

276
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,920
Rather than deal with some faraway 
Revolutionary Army...

277
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,930
There are traitors much closer 
that must be dealt with.

278
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,930
Ogre, of the imperial police, 
my own relative, Iokal,

279
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,630
and even the serial killer Zank

280
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,310
were all defeated, and the Imperial 
Arms stolen by Night Raid.

281
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,390
We're being struck down, left and right!

282
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,810
I've been so overwhelmed, I'm gaining weight!

283
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,160
We will call for General Esdeath to return.

284
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,150
I-In the capital,

285
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,470
Commander-in-chief Budou has command.

286
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,630
Hunting traitors would be beneath 
the Grand General.

287
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,080
It would hurt his pride, would it not?

288
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,540
Esdeath, huh?

289
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,600
She is the strategist that rivals the Grand General.

290
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,870
There's nothing to worry about.

291
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,100
She's the ice-woman who buried over four 
hundred thousand northerners alive...

292
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,050
It's no longer a question of life or death.

293
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,100
She will hunt them all down, 
and bring about their demise!

294
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm sure this is far enough to lose them...

295
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,240
Right, Sis—

296
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,130
Hey... Huh?

297
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,080
Sis?

298
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,040
<i>This is bad! We're separated!</i>

299
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>And I don't know where I am!</i>

300
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,760
My justice radar is picking up something!

301
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,310
You, over there!

302
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,180
Is there something I can help you with?

303
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,560
That uniform...

304
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,460
I'm Seryu, of the imperial police...

305
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,520
A soldier of justice!

306
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,060
<i>Imperial police...</i>

307
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,380
Coro, are you hungry?

308
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,510
Hang in there a little longer, okay?

309
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,410
Um, what's that?

310
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,400
This is the Imperial Arms Hecatoncheir.

311
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
There's nothing to worry about.

312
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,250
He's harmless except to those who are evil.

313
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,920
<i>He was in that book.</i>

314
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,600
Anyway, did you need something?

315
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,170
Uh, well... I lost my way.

316
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,430
But I know the name of the area I was in earlier.

317
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,930
What an ordeal!

318
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,800
I'll take you there, on my patrol.

319
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,840
This way!

320
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,460
Don't get separated from me, okay?

321
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,980
Do all imperial police have these?

322
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,760
Nope.

323
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,260
I'm the only one with this Imperial Arms.

324
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,130
Coro—

325
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,500
Ah, that's the name I gave him, but...

326
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,830
If he doesn't like his user, he won't even move.

327
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,410
No one higher up was compatible with Coro.

328
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,840
So they tested compatibility 
even with the lower ranks.

329
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,740
That was when he reacted to my love for justice.

330
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,330
So, now he's my beloved partner.

331
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,050
Right, Coro?

332
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,770
O-Oh...

333
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,000
Um, I believe this is the area 
you mentioned earlier.

334
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,730
Thank you very much.

335
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,280
Don't mention it!

336
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,740
If you encounter any evil, please give me a call.

337
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,620
We'll destroy it for you.

338
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,580
That's reassuring...

339
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,170
Let's go, Coro.

340
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,460
I bet you're hungry.

341
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,820
How would you like five death-row inmates?

342
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,830
<i>An imperial police officer who 
uses Imperial Arms, huh?</i>

343
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,140
<i>Sounds like trouble.</i>

344
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,720
<i>I should report this to Najenda.</i>

345
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
<i>Helping people is important.</i>

346
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,070
<i>But I have to hurry and find Night Raid!</i>

347
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,310
<i>General Ogre...</i>

348
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,510
Nice attack, Seryu.

349
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,410
You've gotten a little stronger, haven't you?

350
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,580
That temperamental Imperial 
Arms chose me for a reason.

351
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,620
I must get stronger!

352
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,300
Justice will never yield to evil!

353
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,760
My father, killed in the line of duty, said that!

354
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,600
Oh?

355
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,160
If you want to get stronger that much,

356
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,200
I can offer you a trump card.

357
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,260
Really?

358
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,330
A doctor I know has been wanting 
to do an experiment...

359
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,150
However, you'll suffer great pain.

360
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,110
That doesn't matter!

361
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,150
I'll do anything to help me defeat evil!

362
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,360
<i>The evil that killed my master, General Ogre!</i>

363
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,750
<i>Night Raid...</i>

364
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,510
<i>I will never forgive you!</i>

365
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Absolute Justice

366
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
