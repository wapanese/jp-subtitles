1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,090
How many intruders, and where are they?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,570
According to my barrier's signal, apparently eight.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,360
They're all in the vicinity of our base.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,740
I have to commend them 
for sniffing this place out.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,200
They're probably assassins from 
one of the surrounding tribes.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,410
Move out. Do not let any escape.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,340
You still aren't used to combat with groups.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,560
Don't push yourself!

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,050
First, you should concentrate on gaining 
first-hand battlefield experience.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,770
Right.

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,210
Also, when you refer to me, 
call me "Bro" or "Handsome."

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,540
Got it, Bro.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,260
All right! That feels great!

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,260
In return, I'll show you something awesome.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,940
<i>Incursio!</i>

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,200
Whoa, amazing!

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,160
Right?

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,110
This is the Imperial Arm Incursio.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,870
Imperial Arm?

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,190
I don't really get it, but I'm fired up!

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,120
Oh? You understand its awesomeness?

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,640
The enemy.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,560
Let's go.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,300
Be sure to take a good look at 
the Imperial Arm's power.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,530
Right!

26
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,570
Kill Your Cares

27
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,480
Kill Your Cares

28
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,550
That's one of the faces from the wanted posters.

29
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,580
It appears that Night Raid's secret base is close.

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,460
She's pretty cute.

31
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,620
Seems we can have fun, even after we kill her.

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,250
Make sure you don't wound her too badly...

33
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,400
Ah.

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Eh?

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,260
You lowered your guard far too 
much for enemy territory.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
She's way too fast—

37
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,290
Damn it! I'll at least take her with me!

38
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,890
Cursed poison from my wounds?

39
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,240
One slice, certain death.

40
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,980
<i>They've noticed our infiltration...</i>

41
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,650
<i>But we've confirmed that Night 
Raid's secret base is here.</i>

42
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,070
<i>That information alone is worth a great deal.</i>

43
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,580
Looks like they've gotten pretty far.

44
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,190
I don't really like being seen, but...

45
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
I've got you!

46
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,760
My apologies.

47
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,720
Thank you, Sheele.

48
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,440
It was a nice pinch.

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,610
That risk was enough to reach him!

50
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,440
All right... Bullseye.

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,370
The more trouble we're in, 
the greater Pumpkin's firepower.

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,290
Oh?

53
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,350
That was Mine's Pumpkin.

54
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm surprised she'd use such an 
annoying Imperial Arm...

55
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,300
In my case, I simply turn into 
a beast and hit people.

56
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,380
So simple!

57
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,750
I thought the resistance on the strings was light.

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,880
So, you're a girl.

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,930
Please save me! I'll do anything!

60
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,310
Nope.

61
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,140
I knew someone who died because 
they fell for a woman's charms.

62
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,220
Aw, such a waste.

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,970
This job really sucks at times like this...

64
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,220
Bro!

65
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,730
S-Strong...

66
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,200
<i>This is Night Raid's power?</i>

67
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,620
So you survived, Tatsumi.

68
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,410
Y-Yeah.

69
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,710
Good! That means you're 
showing promise, Tatsumi.

70
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,750
Right!

71
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,920
<i>Assassins...</i>

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,810
<i>And the need for revolution.</i>

73
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,700
<i>Night Raid.</i>

74
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,900
Apparently, I joined an amazing group.

75
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,080
<i>Why did I just picture Bro's face?</i>

76
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,210
This is where the capital is.

77
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,630
The vast castle walls that protect the capital,

78
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,600
the trade ships that go up and down the canals.

79
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,080
There's a lot to look forward to.

80
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,500
Especially all the hot babes there.

81
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,220
Yeah!

82
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,140
So gross.

83
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,100
Why just me?

84
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,690
<i>Sayo... Ieyasu...</i>

85
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,620
<i>I'm gonna do my best.</i>

86
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,910
Is something the matter?

87
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,490
Oh, Sheele...

88
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,810
Well...

89
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,580
I was told, starting today, I'd be 
on assignment with Mine.

90
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,090
So I've been waiting, but...

91
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,370
Oh, Mine doesn't wake up easily.

92
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,660
What the hell? But this is work...

93
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,940
I guess it can't be helped...

94
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,530
Shall I go wake her up?

95
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,850
No, Tatsumi should go.

96
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,440
Why me?!

97
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,630
Tatsumi, you're Mine's subordinate today.

98
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,110
It's a subordinate's job to get his superior.

99
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,320
Fine.

100
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,770
Is that true?

101
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,160
This is just another trial.

102
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,310
Eh?

103
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,080
Hey, Mine! Hurry and wake up alrea—

104
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,070
A-Are you trying to kill me?!

105
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,160
Yes!

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,820
That's why I shot you!

107
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,980
How dare you dodge that, you perv!

108
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,450
You idiot!

109
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,270
I was told to come wake... you up...

110
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,530
Don't you know how to knock? You hick!

111
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,100
What was that? Is there some kind of festival?

112
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,810
They're really going at it.

113
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,040
Looks like Tatsumi's going 
to have more work to do.

114
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,300
<i>Now that I look more closely at 
the capital I admired so much,</i>

115
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,420
<i>there are so many people with gloomy faces.</i>

116
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,800
Hey! Hey, peeping tom!

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,030
What's taking you so long, you hick?

118
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
Today, you're following me around 
as my minion, aren't you?

119
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,520
Minion?

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
Isn't that what the boss told you?

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,400
She just told me to learn from you!

122
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,040
Then that means you're my minion.

123
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,920
Just hurry it up!

124
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,150
H-Hey, wai—

125
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Hey, Mine...

126
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,350
Doesn't it seem like lots 
of people are suffering?

127
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,230
They're dealing with recession and 
the political realities of fear...

128
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,900
Only one social segment lives in prosperity.

129
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,850
The rest of them are in slums.

130
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,090
This is reality.

131
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,180
Hey, what are you guys do—

132
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,510
Stop picking on the weak.

133
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,730
Who the hell are you guys?

134
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,290
This girl is a refugee.

135
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,230
She has to do what we say.

136
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,190
And?

137
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,130
Tatsumi?

138
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,830
Right.

139
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,620
U-Um, thank you—

140
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,240
Don't thank me.

141
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,050
You need to learn how to protect yourself.

142
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,710
By the way, is it all right for us 
to walk around during the day?

143
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,400
Huh?

144
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, those four are the only ones 
whose faces have been seen.

145
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,760
I see...

146
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,330
Who's the guy in the middle?

147
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,480
Bulat.

148
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, Bulat...

149
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,620
B-Bro?

150
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,740
That's what he looked like when 
he was in the military.

151
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,860
He changed his image after joining Night Raid.

152
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,480
Isn't that going a bit far?

153
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,280
Th-This is like the world's 
worst "before and after."

154
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,740
Anyway, this is why the two of 
us, who haven't been seen,

155
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,300
have an assignment here.

156
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,140
Got it?

157
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,370
Bring it on!

158
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,300
That's why you brought me, right?

159
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,280
Good!

160
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,640
Let's begin the investigation into 
the capital city's conditions!

161
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,890
I don't really know what's going on, but sure!

162
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,410
What a haul!

163
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,270
For spring, pink clothes are best...

164
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,620
Right.

165
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,360
We have to stretch our wings on our days off.

166
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,160
Right.

167
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,920
All right, mission complete!

168
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,750
The hell? This was just shopping!

169
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,120
Lower your head.

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,370
I'm on top, and you're the bottom.

171
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,890
A subordinate shouldn't talk back.

172
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,680
You should be thankful you're 
carrying my packages!

173
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,850
You're my superior, but only for the moment!

174
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,640
And this isn't any kind of training!

175
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,020
Huh?

176
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,710
You really thought you'd be on 
equal terms just like that?

177
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,820
Sounds like you're confident with your sword.

178
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,110
But compared to you, the number of battles 
we've faced is far too different.

179
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,660
Even I...

180
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,390
Even I know that I'm not experienced enough.

181
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,870
But...

182
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,340
I still have to keep moving forward.

183
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,090
For Sayo and Ieyasu's sake!

184
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,030
Hmph.

185
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,220
It seems Akame and Bulat 
have high hopes for you,

186
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,640
but I wonder...

187
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,340
What's that fuss about?

188
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,140
They're probably having a public execution.

189
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,400
In the capital, it happens all the time.

190
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,050
That...

191
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,740
That's awful.

192
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,330
The current cabinet minister 
can do this without remorse.

193
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,250
In the quarrel over succession, he cunningly 
obtained the title for the youngest heir.

194
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,670
I won't

195
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,380
end up like that.

196
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,340
I'm going to survive and be one of the winners.

197
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,710
<i>A sly minister, huh?</i>

198
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,010
<i>I wonder what he's like.</i>

199
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,430
Domestic Affairs Official Shoui,

200
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,220
for speaking against my policies and 
delaying government affairs,

201
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,450
you are sentenced to death by being 
drawn and quartered by bulls.

202
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,580
This is what needs to be done, right, Minister?

203
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,490
Well done, my lord.

204
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,300
You are such a wise ruler, my lord...

205
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,430
Meat again? You sure eat a lot.

206
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,310
Well, it's best to eat it when it's fresh.

207
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,270
Buono, buono.

208
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,020
My lord! You're being tricked by the Minister!

209
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,990
Please listen to your people!

210
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,390
Hey, Minister, did you hear what 
he just said about you?

211
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm sure he's merely gone mad.

212
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,370
Right! After all, you've never been wrong!

213
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,500
Sir Shoui...

214
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,370
This is our sad farewell.

215
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,690
My lord!

216
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,500
At this rate, the empire's glorious 
1,000-year history will be...

217
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,570
Sir Shoui,

218
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,540
don't worry about that beautiful 
wife you're leaving behind.

219
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,310
I'll take good care of her...

220
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,440
To the fullest extent.

221
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,730
Is... Is this really allowed to happen?

222
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,130
Every crime cries for punishment.

223
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,030
Anyone, please...

224
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,410
Please see that this demon 
gets what he deserves!

225
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,070
We just got a new assignment.

226
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,880
The target, Iokal, is distantly 
related to Minister Onest.

227
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,880
He's uses the minister's name

228
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,060
to kidnap women and beat them to death.

229
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,550
His five guards

230
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,190
are getting their shares, 
and are guilty, as well.

231
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,100
This is an extremely important mission.

232
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm sending in all of you!

233
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,130
Then that's the mansion Iokal lives in.

234
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,520
It's huge.

235
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,340
Hey.

236
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,480
What?

237
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,340
Is that another of those Imperial Arms?

238
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,450
Yeah, Imperial Arm Pumpkin.

239
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,280
The more of a pinch its user is in, 
the more its destructive power.

240
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,290
Though I'm never in a pinch.

241
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,300
How do you even make something like that?

242
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,840
Imperial Arms are ancient super weapons.

243
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,400
And currently, it's unclear how they were made.

244
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,330
You're really nosy, you know that?

245
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,610
I shouldn't have any problem at this distance.

246
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,390
As soon as he leaves his mansion, 
I'll shoot right through him.

247
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,620
All right! After you snipe him, 
my job is to be your escort.

248
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,740
Leave it to me!

249
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,540
Hmph.

250
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,790
I'm not expecting anything.

251
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,030
<i>Her concentration is amazing.</i>

252
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,200
<i>I can feel her drive from here.</i>

253
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,170
He came out.

254
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,920
Huh?

255
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,140
Where?

256
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,270
A lot of people who aren't 
our target came out, as well.

257
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,350
And?

258
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,770
What do you mean, "and"?

259
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,290
How are you going to shoot him?

260
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,490
It's irrelevant.

261
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,090
Irrelevant?

262
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,470
You don't mean you're going 
to involve innocent pe—

263
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,570
I'm a master sniper.

264
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,000
Find the person who killed Lord Iokal at once!

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,810
If they get away, the minister will kill us.

266
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,410
They couldn't have gone far!

267
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,410
Here they come.

268
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,370
This time, I'm gonna get wild!

269
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,100
Ugh... This other route is 
really hard to traverse.

270
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,050
I wonder if all pursuit has been eliminated.

271
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,130
All the guards around here 
have trained at Koukenji.

272
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,840
It probably won't be that easy.

273
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,010
Koukenji, the empire's top martial arts temple.

274
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,470
Koukenji

275
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,580
When you work for the minister, I guess 
they don't mess around with the guards.

276
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,780
Doing anything because of 
who they're related to...

277
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,730
That pisses me off more than anything else.

278
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,700
<i>I wonder what happened in her past.</i>

279
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,550
As a special treat, I'll tell you 
a little about my past.

280
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,910
<i>She's gonna tell me anyway!</i>

281
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,620
I'm from a land near the western border.

282
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,450
And I'm half foreigner.

283
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,130
In the city, I was really discriminated against.

284
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,630
No one accepted me.

285
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,560
It was a very tragic childhood.

286
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,080
But...

287
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,130
The Revolutionary Army and the 
western foreigners are allies.

288
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,610
Once the capital has a new ruler, borders will 
be opened and geography won't matter.

289
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,940
Then others won't have to go through what I did.

290
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,450
I won't let anyone be discriminated against again!

291
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,660
Mine...

292
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,480
And so, I'll get rich from the reward

293
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,900
from helping the revolution, 
and I'll live a life of luxury!

294
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,220
I feel so refreshed and calm!

295
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,550
They were quite strong.

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,070
It's strange...

297
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,970
There should have been five guards.

298
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,690
I didn't even get to kill one... 
So we're missing one.

299
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,980
Then you only get half the reward, Lubbock.

300
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,600
What?!

301
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,420
That's not fair, Sis!

302
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,420
Half a man...

303
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,320
Tatsumi...

304
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,020
This is where we're supposed to regroup.

305
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,370
Mission complete.

306
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,830
It's not complete until we report it!

307
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,220
Did you get that from Akame?

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
Look out!

309
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,880
He—

310
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,910
Tatsumi!

311
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,250
Wh-Why, you...

312
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,360
Not bad, if I do say so myself.

313
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,260
You must be a Koukenji martial artist.

314
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,360
Precisely. I was even a master...

315
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,310
Though that was ten years ago!

316
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,130
And now, you're just a lowly guard?

317
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,560
Looks like you've fallen from the ranks!

318
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,690
I was a little bad, so they kicked me out.

319
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll have a little fun before I hand 
you over to the minister.

320
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,030
Hope you're prepared!

321
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,280
You've got to be kidding.

322
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,170
Now, Mine! Shoot!

323
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,440
Tatsumi...

324
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,460
You're risking your life to...

325
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,090
No, I'm not, you idiot!

326
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,550
You're a master sniper, right?

327
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,550
I believe in you.

328
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,100
Why you... Damn it, let go...

329
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,720
Hurry!

330
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,400
You stupid newbie.

331
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,060
All right, I'll do it!

332
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,310
Wait!

333
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,770
You bastards...

334
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,410
Don't think you'll get away...

335
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,090
with killing one of the minister's relatives...

336
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,780
You've got some guts.

337
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,190
I guess I have no choice but to 
acknowledge you a little—

338
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,940
That bullet was way too close...

339
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,200
Look what you did to my head!

340
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,540
Wh-What?!

341
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,710
And I was just about to acknowledge you!

342
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,620
Shut up!

343
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,370
You're no master sniper.

344
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,310
You aren't even competent!

345
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,120
Apparently, we didn't need to 
rush over here, after all.

346
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,120
What? Of course I am!

347
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,070
Masters don't call themselves 
"masters," to begin with!

348
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,730
Just like me...

349
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,510
An Imperial Arm user, an assassin...

350
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,710
Splendid... Splendid.

351
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,770
So someone like her is running amok.

352
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,890
Hey, you!

353
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,440
You look suspicious... Don't move!

354
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,440
It appears that the capital is a 
very comfortable place to live.

355
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,980
There are so many people, there's no 
end to the number I can cut down!

356
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,240
Splendid... Splendid.

357
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill the Imperial Arm Users
