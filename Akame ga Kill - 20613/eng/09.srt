1
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,180
Okay.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,070
Finally healed!

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,570
<i>I was resting until my wounds healed,</i>

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,450
<i>but now I can fight like before.</i>

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>I have to work hard for 
Sheele and Bulat's sake!</i>

6
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,300
Kill the Battle Fanatic

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,010
Kill the Battle Fanatic

8
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,550
Someone, train with me.

9
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,350
Hey... Mine...

10
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,470
You've recovered. That's great.

11
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,230
What are you doing?

12
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,340
These guys were gung-ho about training, 
so we're helping them out.

13
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,620
After putting it on...

14
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,710
I realized how much energy Incursio takes.

15
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,830
Train Daily
Bulat

16
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,680
I need to train my body, so I can wear it

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,380
for a prolonged time like Bro.

18
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,180
As of now,

19
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,210
I can barely use invisibility for a second.

20
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,510
I rarely see you drenched in sweat, Lubbock.

21
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,830
Well, there are only two 
guys in our group now.

22
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,140
I figured I should start 
putting in more effort...

23
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,250
Good job, sounding cool.

24
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,410
But you realize you've only done half 
as many push-ups as Tatsumi.

25
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,230
That can't be helped.

26
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,920
Since Leone and I have a 
major weight disparity.

27
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,910
You're all here.

28
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,760
Boss...

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,230
I'm going to Revolutionary Army headquarters

30
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,910
to deliver the Imperial Arms we 
confiscated from the Three.

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,270
Alone?

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,870
That axe is ridiculously heavy, though.

33
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,460
Oh, I can handle this much.

34
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,850
Here.

35
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,420
It isn't possible to use as a weapon, 
but transporting it isn't an issue.

36
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
The boss is amazing like the rest of you?

37
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,280
Obviously.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
You know she was a general, right?

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,430
Akame, you're in charge while I'm gone.

40
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,390
Our plan of action is that 
everyone does their best.

41
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,320
I understand the basics.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,850
Just the basics?!

43
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,850
Don't worry, she'll take her role seriously.

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,870
The other reason I'm going to headquarters 
is to recruit new members.

45
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,740
I hope they can spare some 
talented individuals,

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,780
but I doubt there are any.

47
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,080
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,750
I was weak...

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,710
You fought the Three, who were 
key figures in Esdeath's army,

50
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,300
considered among the capital's strongest.

51
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,400
You eliminated all of them.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,210
Although Esdeath's strength is unmatched,

53
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,300
her army has clearly been weakened.

54
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,920
When the Revolution takes place,

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,510
you'll have helped mitigate a huge concern.

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,700
Not only did you save the lives 
of the people on that ship,

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,920
you essentially saved thousands 
in the Revolutionary Army

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,400
who would've had to have faced them.

59
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,490
You're strong, and you've done well.

60
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,830
Boss...

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,140
I didn't want to inflate your ego, 
so I refrained from saying this.

62
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,330
But Bulat once told me...

63
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,750
Tatsumi's still green

64
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,750
But he'll undoubtedly become stronger.

65
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,120
As long as he trains rigorously,

66
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,720
he may just surpass me one day.

67
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,580
I look forward to seeing that.

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,660
Bro...

69
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,390
Be proud, Tatsumi.

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,730
Keep surviving.

71
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,190
And become the man Bulat 
anticipated you could be.

72
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,610
That being said...

73
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,110
We're still short-handed.

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,740
And according to Leone,

75
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,450
Esdeath is organizing a special 
force of Imperial Arms users.

76
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,300
I have to do something.

77
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,300
Liver, Nyau, Daidara...

78
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,390
You three lost.

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,410
Which means you were weak.

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,260
It's only natural that 
the weak are eliminated.

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,100
My poor subordinates.

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,360
There's nothing else that can be done

83
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,300
other than avenge your deaths.

84
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,990
My new subordinates who use 
Imperial Arms arrive today.

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,740
I've been told they have their quirks.

86
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,720
Perhaps I'll play around with them some.

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,790
Fish Market

88
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,630
<i>My name is Wave.</i>

89
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,240
<i>As a true man of the sea, 
I fought in the Imperial Navy.</i>

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,320
<i>I've been recruited to join the special 
forces squad the capital's organized.</i>

91
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,300
<i>Basically, it's a promotion.</i>

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>Since it's my first time in the big city,</i>

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
<i>I didn't want to look like a hick.</i>

94
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,640
<i>So I wore super cool 
clothes to help me fit in.</i>

95
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,940
<i>Back home, everyone admired me!</i>

96
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,060
<i>And the assorted seafood my mother 
made me bring as gifts</i>

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,640
<i>is all top-notch, so there's no oversight.</i>

98
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,280
It will be rude if you don't 
bring gifts! Take this!

99
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,950
<i>However...</i>

100
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,790
He's a hick.

101
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,190
He must be from the country...

102
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,370
<i>Maybe I'm imagining things,</i>

103
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,700
<i>but I feel like people 
are looking at me funny.</i>

104
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,390
<i>Did I do something rude?</i>

105
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,580
A hillbilly.

106
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,950
Yeah, definitely from the country.

107
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,870
<i>Well,</i>

108
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,010
<i>I'm a man who's fought pirates and 
aquatic Danger Beasts!</i>

109
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,140
<i>Little things won't bother me!</i>

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,260
<i>All right.</i>

111
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,890
<i>My new teammates are in here?</i>

112
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,930
<i>First impressions are crucial.</i>

113
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,350
<i>I can't be intimidated by them, so let's go!</i>

114
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,320
You can't let them bulldoze you.

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,820
Dive in head-first!

116
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,570
Good afternoon!

117
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,300
I've come from the Imperial Navy—

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,910
Pardon me!

119
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,830
<i>Uh, so this must be the torturer's room.</i>

120
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,120
<i>Jeez...</i>

121
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,130
<i>It's correct.</i>

122
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,620
<i>Which means he's one of my teammates!</i>

123
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,430
H-Hello.

124
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,140
<i>For the time being, I'll just 
try not to draw attention.</i>

125
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,730
<i>Hey, hey... What's with him?</i>

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,700
<i>He's been staring straight 
at me the whole time!</i>

127
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,150
<i>This is bad.</i>

128
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,660
<i>Mom, I wanna go home!</i>

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,240
<i>It's a normal girl!</i>

130
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,890
H-Hey!

131
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,930
I'm Wave, and—

132
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,430
You can't have any of these.

133
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,640
<i>She's totally weird, too!</i>

134
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,500
Sorry for bothering you.

135
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,570
<i>Crap. What the hell?</i>

136
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,690
Pardon me!

137
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm Seryu Ubiquitous, of the imperial police.

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,200
And this is Coro.

139
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,330
<i>Oh, this one seems normal enough!</i>

140
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,660
Dr. Stylish, all is prepared now!

141
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,890
Caring about one's first impression...

142
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,290
That is indeed what I call "stylish,"

143
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,760
as a man with etiquette.

144
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,640
<i>Another crazy one!</i>

145
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,530
Oh, my.

146
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,440
I can tell by sight alone that 
you're a country boy.

147
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,270
But you're pretty good looking!

148
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,560
I can polish you to be even better.

149
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,480
We'll get along well.

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
<i>And he's into me.</i>

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
Hello.

152
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,030
Seems I'm the last to arrive.

153
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,140
Hey.

154
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,280
Nice to meet you. I'm Wave.

155
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,700
I'm Run. It's a pleasure 
to meet you, as well.

156
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,670
<i>Finally! A normal person!</i>

157
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,670
Um...

158
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,590
Everyone... I've made some tea.

159
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,920
I'm really sorry.

160
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,800
I was the first one here, 
and I didn't say anything.

161
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm what you call painfully shy...

162
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,890
So I was nervous.

163
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,010
But I probably have the most seniority...

164
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,190
I have to get it together!

165
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,170
Since we're all Imperial Arms users, 
I'm sure we'll get along!

166
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,150
I'm Bols, of the Incineration Squad.

167
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,240
<i>That isn't the look of someone who's shy...</i>

168
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,930
The Incineration Squad...

169
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,910
The stylish squad that sets anything ablaze,

170
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,670
be it man or thing.

171
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,870
No wonder he looks like that.

172
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,040
He isn't my type.

173
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,710
Huh? Who are you?

174
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,920
What are you all doing here?

175
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,150
Hey, hey...

176
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,550
We were all told to assemble here.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,770
Assassins are among the traitors.

178
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,600
Don't ever drop your guard!

179
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,020
This one has good reflexes.

180
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,220
For someone trying to attack from behind,

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,700
you're giving off too much presence.

182
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,790
Even if you're just messing around,

183
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,120
I can't hold back.

184
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,290
So that's the Imperial Arms Yatsufusa, eh?

185
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,380
What an impressive blade.

186
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,710
General Esdeath!

187
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,920
Ouch...

188
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,330
<i>Even our boss is weird!</i>

189
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,470
Did I surprise you earlier?

190
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,180
I figured a normal greeting would be boring.

191
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,560
I'm used to rough situations.

192
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,440
In fact, thank you for the lesson!

193
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,770
All right, then.

194
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,530
We have a party to attend, 
after we meet with the emperor.

195
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,380
W-We're already meeting him?

196
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,990
For the first day, this is a pretty 
fast-paced schedule.

197
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,740
I believe in getting annoying 
things out of the way first.

198
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,920
But before that, Lady Esdeath...

199
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,500
What do we call ourselves?

200
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,710
We are a unique organization,

201
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,390
ordered to mercilessly hunt and 
take down the atrocious traitors.

202
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,510
We are the special police force...

203
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,340
We are the Jaegers.

204
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,930
I'm really happy

205
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,420
we're serving my assorted 
seafood as the main course...

206
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,890
But isn't it weird that 
he's the one who can cook?

207
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,810
Wave,

208
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,600
the spinach should go in last.

209
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,470
If you put it in now, 
it'll become too tender.

210
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,820
I, uh... Sorry.

211
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,490
By the way, I was relieved when I 
learned that you're a kind person.

212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm not... a kind person...

213
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,660
General!

214
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,420
How have you been spending your time here?

215
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,360
Mostly hunting and torturing.

216
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Or researching.

217
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,010
But at the moment...

218
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,930
I am interested in falling in love.

219
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:24,800
Love?

220
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,680
On another note,

221
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,590
I've been informed there 
is a spare Imperial Arms.

222
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,430
Oh, uh... Yes.

223
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,090
The giant scissor-shaped Imperial Arms, 
retrieved from evil, is at the main office.

224
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,730
But they have yet to find 
someone suited to it.

225
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,840
If it stays like that, the 
minister will take them.

226
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,720
That would be quite a waste.

227
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,590
Perhaps we should put on a show,

228
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,210
to help us identify one who's 
capable of using them.

229
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,190
Oh.

230
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,580
Hey.

231
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,450
Yo.

232
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,990
Whoa!

233
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,260
This really does feel like a secret base!

234
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,140
Right?

235
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,490
It's my pride and joy!

236
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,470
But you didn't make it or anything, did you?

237
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,930
Hey, there!

238
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,320
Welcome to the secret base in the capital!

239
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,560
Sis, you're way too relaxed.

240
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,570
Well... Mine's face appeared 
on the wanted signs,

241
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,200
so only we three can walk 
freely in the capital.

242
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,710
Also, the city's been clamoring 
about the special police force.

243
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,690
They call themselves the Jaegers.

244
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,170
Considering Esdeath is their leader, 
that isn't surprising.

245
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,540
I get why it's a hot topic,

246
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,500
since she's such a dangerous person.

247
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,100
Tell me exactly how dangerous she is.

248
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,510
Let's see...

249
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,510
Let me give you an idea.

250
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,260
A few years ago,

251
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,170
a tribe in the southwestern region

252
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,100
rebelled against the imperial 
capital's tyrannical rule.

253
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,830
The capital responded by dispatching a 
special force to go enslave them.

254
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,880
The tribe had about ten thousand warriors,

255
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,640
and the capital sent one hundred and 
twenty thousand soldiers.

256
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,860
Everyone felt the result would be obvious.

257
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,440
However...

258
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,550
The land itself and the obstacles 
they faced were intense

259
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,000
for soldiers who lived comfortable 
lives near the capital.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
When faced with nature's brutality, 
they were overwhelmed.

261
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,780
On top of that, the tribal 
warriors attacked nightly.

262
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,390
The young but capable Generals Najenda and

263
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,460
General Esdeath,

264
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,840
you seem gloomier than usual.

265
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,970
Of course I am.

266
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,340
The minister's orders were to 
end the rebellion swiftly

267
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,300
with our Imperial Arms.

268
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,120
Handling nature's fury, which was too 
daunting for the special forces,

269
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,330
is part of warfare's true 
thrill and pleasure.

270
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,980
And yet, we have these boring orders.

271
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,980
However, it's an order.

272
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,150
Whether it's facing a 
beast or noxious insects,

273
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,120
or a plague or virus,

274
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,140
everything before me

275
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,710
will freeze.

276
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,390
Wh-What power...

277
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,880
Travel directly to enemy 
headquarters to destroy them!

278
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,930
My attacks are as strong as a cannon!

279
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,350
Musket troops,

280
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,260
fire!

281
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,060
After annihilating the enemy,

282
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,860
it's time to enjoy ourselves.

283
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,230
Destroy this town to your hearts' content.

284
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,480
Are you watching?

285
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,860
Do you see your home being ravaged?

286
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,680
Damn you! Just kill us!

287
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,590
I am a woman of mercy.

288
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,210
Some things are worth pitying.

289
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm going to let a few of you go.

290
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,520
Stop joking around!

291
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,180
If you don't kill us now, we'll certainly 
come back and kill you—

292
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,250
Remember this.

293
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,370
It's only natural for the 
weak to end up like this.

294
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,630
If that makes you angry, become stronger.

295
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,320
I can't be a part of this.

296
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,090
Even though the capital ordered 
us to make an example of them...

297
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,500
I can't be among those 
who enjoy this savagery.

298
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,290
So that's what happened.

299
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,090
After causing so much agony, letting them 
live seems pretty wicked.

300
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,350
In fact, from the capital's prospective,

301
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,590
wouldn't that be like 
adding fuel to the fire?

302
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,160
That's exactly what Esdeath wants.

303
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,550
She wants more rebellions.

304
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,260
So she can enjoy being in war 
for as long as possible.

305
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,040
Unbelievable...

306
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,500
Jeez, she's dangerous!

307
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm glad I decided not to mess 
with her when I was alone.

308
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,170
I wonder how many hundreds of 
thousands of kills it took

309
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,510
for her to gain that evil aura.

310
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,000
She must be a monster for you to 
talk about it like that, Sis.

311
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,340
If you're so curious, you should 
check her out yourself.

312
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,310
Esdeath is sponsoring a citywide 
martial arts tournament.

313
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,550
The winner gets a cash reward.

314
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,980
Maybe you can earn some money 
to send back to your hometown.

315
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,770
Say, Minister?

316
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,990
Why do you think General Esdeath 
said she wants to fall in love?

317
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,870
When they reach a certain age, 
everyone desires the opposite sex.

318
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,820
General Esdeath was 
practically born to battle.

319
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,700
Until now, she's always chosen 
war over anything else.

320
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,170
But it seems different 
desires have blossomed.

321
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,470
I see.

322
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,170
I'd like to help her find someone suitable.

323
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,760
She is a person of great pride.

324
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,550
I'm sure she won't accept anyone 
less than perfect for her.

325
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,140
But no man like this exists.

326
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,820
<i>Above all, he must possess 
the potential for a great future.</i>

327
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,350
<i>I would personally like to train him 
into a highly ranked general.</i>

328
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,870
<i>Second, he must be fearless, 
and able to hunt Danger Beasts.</i>

329
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,270
<i>Third, much like myself,</i>

330
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,030
<i>he must have been raised outside the capital.</i>

331
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,780
"Fourth, since I will be controlling him, 
he must be younger than I am."

332
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,320
"Fifth, it would be nice if he 
has a pure, innocent smile."

333
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,790
Most would be disqualified 
at the first requirement.

334
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,900
Being trained by her into a highly ranked 
general is also problematic.

335
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,230
What do you think of them?

336
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,270
Since they're boring subjects, the 
battle itself is boring, as well.

337
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,800
I guess it was asking too much to expect 
one capable of using an Imperial Arms.

338
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,280
Oh, it seems they've chosen the winner.

339
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
The winner is Nobunaga, 
the dry goods merchant!

340
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,310
I did it!

341
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,880
This next battle is the last match.

342
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,400
On the east side...

343
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,620
Kalbi the butcher!

344
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,800
And on the west side...

345
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,080
Tatsumi the blacksmith!

346
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,300
That's an interesting cover.

347
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,550
Does he know how to strike iron?

348
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,040
Not as well as I do.

349
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,650
But he's pretty skilled.

350
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,130
It looks like one of them 
is still a young man.

351
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,130
You're quite small, aren't you?

352
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,510
Guess I'll be taking that prize money!

353
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,060
I may have been excommunicated,

354
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,560
but I'm still a ninth-level master at Koukenji.

355
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,190
<i>This old guy...</i>

356
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,770
<i>He isn't just talking himself up. 
He's definitely powerful.</i>

357
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,410
<i>I may have been intimidated in the past,</i>

358
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,780
<i>but I'm calm now, aren't I?</i>

359
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,200
<i>Compared to the Three, this is nothing.</i>

360
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,330
Begin!

361
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,790
Have a full course of my explosive fist!

362
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,130
<i>I don't even need Incursio for this guy.</i>

363
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Whoa!

364
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,920
Wow!

365
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,730
That young man is outstandingly talented.

366
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,160
Yeah.

367
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
That'll be all!

368
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,390
The winner is Tatsumi!

369
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,790
<i>Everyone is cheering for me...</i>

370
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>I did it!</i>

371
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,980
We've found him.

372
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,360
A candidate for an Imperial 
Arms user, I presume?

373
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,680
That, as well.

374
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,730
But also...

375
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
Commander?

376
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,320
<i>She's coming to the ring herself?</i>

377
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,740
Tatsumi... That's your name, right?

378
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,120
It's a nice name.

379
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,580
Th-Thanks.

380
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,570
<i>So this is Esdeath,</i>

381
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,540
<i>the commander of the Three.</i>

382
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,450
<i>If she didn't exist, Bro would still...</i>

383
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,210
Your win just now was magnificent.

384
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,710
I'd like to give you a reward.

385
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,910
Thank you very much.

386
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,820
<i>Even though I'm taking it from the enemy,</i>

387
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,250
<i>money is money.</i>

388
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,890
<i>I'll gratefully accept it.</i>

389
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,100
Huh?

390
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,060
From now on, you'll belong to me.

391
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,190
Wh-What?

392
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,470
It's too distracting out here.

393
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,610
Come to my palace.

394
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,420
W-Wait, hold on!

395
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,940
No, I won't wait.

396
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,200
<i>What did she just do to me?</i>

397
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,000
Let's talk in my room,

398
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,700
just the two of us.

399
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,620
Wh-What the hell is going on?!

400
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,830
Tatsumi's been taken by Esdeath?

401
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,460
Did she find out he was a Night Raid member?

402
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,280
I don't really know...

403
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,570
There's a fifty-fifty chance.

404
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,840
We watched them go to the palace, but...

405
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,090
What do we do, acting boss?

406
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,840
Tatsumi...

407
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,470
I won't die!

408
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,690
Don't say something stupid 
like you'll rescue him, Akame.

409
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,780
For the time being,

410
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,950
let's move our base farther 
into the mountains.

411
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,910
That's a good idea.

412
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,660
They might find this hideout.

413
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,920
So what do we do about Tatsumi?

414
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,670
It may be impossible to rescue him...

415
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,660
I'm aware of that.

416
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,120
We won't rush in without any means,

417
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,780
but Tatsumi is an important teammate!

418
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,380
We'll do what we can!

419
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:41,060
Kill the Temptation
