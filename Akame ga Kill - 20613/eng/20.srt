1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,480
What? There was another surrender 
without any bloodshed?

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,730
Honestly... How can they be so disloyal?

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,530
Well, the viceroys in remote regions

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,080
were those who were demoted for 
opposing the capital in the first place.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,100
It's no surprise they would betray us.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,590
H-However, if this keeps up, 
the rebel army will reach the capitalâ€”

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,830
Stop panicking.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,520
C-Commander-in-Chief Budou...

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,800
They say the military should keep 
their mouth shut about politics.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,330
I've abided by that maxim, 
but given the circumstances,

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,060
I can't keep quiet, either, Minister.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,330
My, that's harsh...

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,160
"Protect this kingdom."

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,730
For a thousand years, this mission has 
been bestowed upon my family.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,850
I shall sever whatever disturbs the 
nation's peace, with my own hands.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,930
Regardless of who or what it may be.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,030
Oh, how terrifying.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,330
But you need not worry.

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,030
Even if the masses rebel, 
we have countermeasures in place.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,910
Allow me to introduce you...

21
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,800
In order to maintain public 
order within the capital,

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,980
a new elite unit has been established!

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,300
Pardon the intrusion.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,750
He's too incompetent to be a commander,

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,730
but I've chosen my son, Shura, for the job.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,480
Ah, so you're the infamous Commander-in-Chief.

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,730
I heard that only General Esdeath 
can match your strength.

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,810
There's no need for someone 
of your rank to step in,

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,660
just because some have decided to rebel.

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,430
Simply leave it to me.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,490
Oh? Where are you going?

32
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,050
There are always a few rats that sniff around

33
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,830
before the whole swarm arrives.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,960
Jeez... Doesn't he know he 
can sit back and relax?

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,780
Now, Shura...

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,800
I'll be observing what you can do.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,550
To determine whether you're 
worthy to be my successor.

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,340
Yeah, I'll be looking forward to it.

39
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,830
<i>Hunting some rats, huh?</i>

40
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,220
<i>It'll be the perfect warm-up.</i>

41
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,200
Kill the Carnage

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,950
Kill the Carnage

43
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,020
This place got a whole lot emptier.

44
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,170
Kurome, is your body really okay?

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,910
There are no issues.

46
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,180
Here you are.

47
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,050
I don't know if it's as good 
as what Bols used to make.

48
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,260
Have you heard, Wave?

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,370
Supposedly, the minister has created 
an elite unit he directly supervises.

50
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,570
Seems that way.

51
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,660
Captain Esdeath is away on an expedition.

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,980
And the Jaegers are down to 
half of what we started with.

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,150
But isn't that exactly why we should 
be the ones on the front lines?

54
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,020
Why would they put us on standby?

55
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,830
This must mean the capital has 
more than one central figure.

56
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,080
What the hell are they thinking?!

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,960
At times like these, we should unite to 
stop the rebel army in their tracks!

58
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,630
Seconds.

59
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,710
So fast!

60
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,300
Man, as always, you're a bottomless pit.

61
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,270
Here you are.

62
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,140
Kurome!

63
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,310
Kurome?

64
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,200
Kurome!

65
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,120
Kurome?

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
Kurome!

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,640
Kurome?

68
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,450
Hey, Kurome!

69
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,260
Kurome...

70
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,230
The soldiers are being sent out again.

71
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,740
Yeah, the capital's gonna be 
a battle zone soon, too.

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,860
We'll take advantage of that commotion,

73
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,480
sneak into the palace,

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
and kill the minister.

75
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,490
You've steeled your resolve, right, Tatsumi?

76
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,980
Of course I have.

77
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,250
But I want as few civilian casualties as possible.

78
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,290
So the sooner we defeat the minister, the better.

79
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,200
Well said.

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Now, then...

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,880
It's almost time to meet the resistance.

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,180
Let's go.

83
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,730
I'm surprised they made such a 
complicated underground channel.

84
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,040
As the capital flourished, it probably 
became bigger and bigger.

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,850
Pointlessly.

86
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,730
And it was managed so poorly, 
there aren't any accurate maps.

87
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,990
But thanks to their carelessness, 
we can use it in our plans.

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,320
Hey, Mine...

89
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,410
What is it, all of a sudden?

90
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,200
How's it going with Tatsumi lately?

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,560
Huh?!

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,390
Did you think your big sis Leone wouldn't notice?

93
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,340
Since getting back from Kyoroch, 
you two are pretty cozy!

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,170
D-Don't be stupid.

95
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,150
Nothing's changed! In fact, 
it isn't like that at all!

96
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,300
What, you want to die?

97
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,750
Stop getting so worked up.

98
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,080
But your face gives it away.

99
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,950
Idiot! That's impossible!

100
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,660
If you keep saying stuff like that, 
I might snatch him for myself...

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,530
You can't do that!

102
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,370
You're finally being honest.

103
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,240
Well, regardless, I'll be taking him.

104
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,830
Stop saying stupid things. 
We're here to work.

105
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,080
Work!

106
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,260
All right, all right.

107
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,870
I understand.

108
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,670
You may resume your duty.

109
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,130
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,950
Communication with the 
western tribes has been lost.

111
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,540
Eh? Then...

112
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,810
No, this was to be expected.

113
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,300
We'll carry out our mission as planned.

114
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,430
When we infiltrate the palace, 
you kill the guards.

115
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,660
I'm counting on you.

116
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,020
Understood.

117
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,110
<i>I'm also relying on you, Tatsumi and Lubbock.</i>

118
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,510
Hey, Tatsumi?

119
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,260
Hm?

120
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,030
After this battle, what will you do?

121
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,220
Uh, I've never really given it any thought...

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,830
What about you?

123
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm gonna continue running the bookstore.

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,350
I'll expand the store, and eventually, 
I'll turn it into a national franchise.

125
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,590
Wow.

126
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,340
Then I'll wait for the right time 
to propose to Miss Najenda!

127
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,570
Oh, yeah? That's great.

128
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,320
And how's it going with you?

129
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,600
And Mine?

130
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,580
Mine has nothing to do with me.

131
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,320
Don't play dumb.

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,230
Ever since we got back from Kyoroch,

133
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,760
you two have been acting suspicious...

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,510
Well? How far have you two gotten?

135
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,070
Have you at least kissed?

136
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,840
I-Idiot.

137
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
U-Um...

138
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,320
You're members of Night Raid, right?

139
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,700
Oh, do you belong to the resistance?

140
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,580
Yes.

141
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,180
From here on, you'll have to be quiet.

142
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,130
Roger.

143
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,130
But this is unexpected.

144
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,480
For someone like you to be 
part of the resistance...

145
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,890
My father used to be in charge 
of the emperor's education.

146
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,660
But the minister framed him for treason,

147
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,650
and both my mother and he were incarcerated.

148
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
I see.

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,030
Then, does that mean other Revolutionary 
Army members are also within the palace?

150
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,560
Yes.

151
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,270
The bureaucracy that opposes the minister

152
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,370
has been in covert communications 
with the Revolutionary Army.

153
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,120
So our role is to work with these people

154
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,290
and support the Revolutionary 
Army's break-in from within.

155
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,920
Oh, that's reassuring.

156
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,370
That's why you, who can turn invisible,

157
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,230
and I, the espionage expert, 
were chosen for this mission.

158
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,390
We have to pull this off.

159
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,340
Right.

160
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,400
This is it.

161
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,250
What is it?

162
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,810
Something's wrong.

163
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,300
Normally, someone knocks from 
the inside to confirm...

164
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,580
Get back.

165
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,670
Th-This is...

166
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,910
This is bad... It means they found out about...

167
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,930
Everyone, run!

168
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,960
Heh, you're late...

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,740
I got tired of waiting.

170
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
Too bad,

171
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,890
but I've taken care of all of 
the resistance members.

172
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,080
I, the great Shura!

173
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,660
You're Night Raid?

174
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,130
You'll entertain me at least a little, right?

175
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,630
Hmm? Oh?

176
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,230
You're the one who was with Esdeath,

177
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,140
when I transported her to the far island.

178
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,640
That means you were behind 
all those Danger Beasts.

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,640
What was the point?

180
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,860
Isn't it obvious?

181
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,770
Because it was fun!

182
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,180
I despise boredom.

183
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,490
I had a lot of fun on their behalf.

184
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,420
How dare you?!

185
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Tatsumi!

186
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,290
Wh-What is this?

187
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,840
As I suspected, some rats snuck in.

188
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,700
Hey! You came at a good 
time, Old Man Lightning.

189
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,710
I'll leave them to you.

190
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,730
I don't need you to tell me.

191
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,030
My name is Budou.

192
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,820
I've been appointed Commander-in-Chief 
by our lord and master.

193
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,400
<i>So this is the Commander-in-Chief.</i>

194
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,410
With your treasonous acts, 
you've wronged the empire.

195
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,110
Your fate will be determined by my Imperial Arms,

196
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,040
Thunder God's Rage: Adramelech.

197
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,550
Tatsumi!

198
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,350
Crap...

199
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,650
I wasn't even hit.

200
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,840
What was that impact?

201
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,560
Oh, so you dodged my attack.

202
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,600
You've got a good eye.

203
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,690
<i>Incursio!</i>

204
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,690
Tatsumi!

205
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,410
What the hell? When did you...

206
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,700
I'll be your opponent.

207
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,040
Make sure you guys don't interfere.

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,750
This one's my prey.

209
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,880
That was fun.

210
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,290
Clearly, I am better suited to a 
battlefield than to guard duty.

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,230
We're heading back to the capital.

212
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,510
<i>You had best prepare yourselves, Night Raid.</i>

213
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,250
What?

214
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,660
Pay attention, Night Raid!

215
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,750
Oh? An Imperial Arms made of string.

216
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,440
That's pretty interesting.

217
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,590
Don't look so surprised. 
I'll reveal the trick to my Imperial Arms.

218
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,180
My toy, Shambhala, 
can teleport me or anyone else,

219
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,960
so long as I've marked the location.

220
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,270
<i>An Imperial Arms that controls time and space.</i>

221
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,070
It's extremely tiring, so I wasn't able 
to constantly attack before.

222
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,240
But I got my hands on 
something great in the capital.

223
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,980
Now I can teleport as much as I want.

224
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,670
As you can see, I've marked a 
lot of places in the palace!

225
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,840
What's wrong? You aren't gonna run?

226
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,390
Hey, hey, are we done already?

227
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,950
<i>There's no point in trying to get away.</i>

228
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,770
<i>No matter where I go, 
he'll reach me immediately!</i>

229
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,250
<i>But...</i>

230
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,270
<i>He won't be able to get to me 
in an area he hasn't marked.</i>

231
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,210
Huh?

232
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,720
That's too bad.

233
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,080
You can leave a mark in the air?

234
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,320
Exactly.

235
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,250
From the start, there was 
nowhere for you to run.

236
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,500
Nowhere.

237
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,090
<i>He may be strong, but his moves 
leave openings. I can do it.</i>

238
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,550
Young man, what is your name?

239
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,350
Huh?

240
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,410
Your name...

241
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,890
Unless assassins don't have names.

242
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,120
It's Tatsumi.

243
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,730
<i>Tatsumi?</i>

244
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,860
<i>How earnest.</i>

245
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>How honest.</i>

246
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,890
<i>There isn't a single tremor 
in his swordsmanship.</i>

247
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,800
<i>How much discipline does one 
need to become this skilled?</i>

248
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
<i>However...</i>

249
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,270
<i>If you've wronged the 
empire or His Excellency,</i>

250
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,190
<i>I must destroy you!</i>

251
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,180
Tatsumi!

252
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,470
You...

253
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,310
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,870
Whatâ€”

255
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,430
If I don't do this,

256
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,250
my father and my mother won't...

257
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,250
Let go. Hey.

258
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,270
Huh?

259
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,210
I said not to interfere.

260
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,840
How dare you get in the way, 
when you're just a toy?

261
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,350
A toy...?

262
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,640
That's right!

263
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,580
This capital, everyone here... 
They're all my toys!

264
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,440
Eventually, I'll surpass my father, 
and the very throne will be mine.

265
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,740
Hey, don't tell me you're giving up.

266
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,820
We aren't done playing.

267
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,020
No, we're done.

268
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,570
You lose.

269
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,480
Huh?

270
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,420
Commander Shura!

271
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,420
Don't move.

272
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,710
Or I'll cut off more than 
just his arm next time.

273
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,540
You...

274
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,550
What's this?

275
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,600
It's a barrier made of my thread.

276
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,220
I used almost all of it.
 I just barely made it.

277
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,100
You did this while you were running around?

278
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,150
Thanks to your showing off, 
I figured out where all the marks were.

279
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,670
You little bastard...

280
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,230
Now, everyone drop your weapons!

281
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,110
Shura, there are many questions I want to ask.

282
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,910
Y-You...

283
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,800
M-Master Shura, please take this into account.

284
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,230
And free my father... And my mother...

285
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:21,310
Too bad! Your parents were 
killed a long time ago!

286
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,520
Thanks for showing me a good time, Night Raid.

287
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,600
However, it's about time to end this.

288
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,490
I'll let you have a taste of my hidden ability.

289
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,090
Disappear! Off the face of the world!

290
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,170
No one's ever come back 
from this hidden ability.

291
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,050
Crumble into dust in the abyss, Night Raid!

292
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,890
Huh?

293
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,640
<i>String?</i>

294
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,640
<i>Don't tell me... That son of a bitch!</i>

295
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,920
Regardless of who you who are, 
you can't sever this thread,

296
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,400
even if you have an Imperial Arms that 
can manipulate time and space.

297
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,970
So we meet again.

298
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,280
You...

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,660
Like I'd let you escape!

300
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,380
Don't give me that look...

301
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,790
Let's go together, Mister Shura.

302
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,810
You've gotta be joking...

303
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,930
I can't die here.

304
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,420
I need the throne, so I can 
change this boring world!

305
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,760
It isn't like I don't understand what you want.

306
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,090
Crap, I can't... In a place like this...

307
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,270
I was supposed to...

308
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,040
You want to change the world, huh?

309
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,420
I understand. Everyone feels that way...

310
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,290
But it doesn't give you the right to 
treat others' lives like toys.

311
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,990
You can't just destroy whatever you want!

312
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,620
We've been through a lot,

313
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,190
Cross Tail...

314
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,760
Miss Najenda, I'm sorry.

315
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,950
It seems like this is it for me...

316
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,880
I'll leave the rest to you, Tatsumi.

317
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,680
Lu...

318
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,980
Lubba...

319
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,300
Lubba!

320
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,400
D-D-Died?

321
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,200
No, Shura!

322
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,460
To think you've left me!

323
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,540
Oh, well.

324
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,210
Nothing to be done about his death.

325
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,090
At least he was able to finish off 
one of the Night Raid members.

326
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,860
The other one is confined in the dungeon.

327
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,230
Good work.

328
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,290
Now, then...

329
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,440
We need to make an example out of him.

330
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,890
So the Revolutionary Army knows to back down.

331
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,280
Now, I wonder what awful things 
we should do to him...

332
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,890
Boorish as always.

333
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,710
But it would be successful in discouraging traitors.

334
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,550
I heard what happened, Budou.

335
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,260
Give that role to me.

336
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,850
Oh?

337
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,340
<i>Tatsumi...</i>

338
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,320
<i>I won't let anyone else have you.</i>

339
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,450
To be executed in public...

340
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,790
Tatsumi...

341
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Despair

342
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
