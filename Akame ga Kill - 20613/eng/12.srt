1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,640
Whoa! Awesome!

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,980
This feels great!

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,740
For an assassin, you're ridiculously innocent, Tatsumi.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,450
You're pretty entertaining, though.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,510
Man, this is a lot more fun than I expected!

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,270
Good.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,920
This isn't good at all!

8
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,470
Kill the Newcomers

9
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,010
Kill the Newcomers

10
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,210
The Danger Beasts that inhabit these 
Marg Highlands are of a high level,

11
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,640
and the area is mostly unexplored by humans.

12
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,350
That's why it's perfect for concealment.

13
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,620
As for a place suitable for our new base,

14
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,610
I'm having the Revolutionary Army scouts  
look for a place around the capital.

15
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,370
Until then, I guess we'll be leveling up here.

16
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,210
Huh?

17
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,590
It left. You're okay with that?

18
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,340
I'm sure it's returning to its nest, 
back at headquarters.

19
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,320
I guess you can't even figure that out, Mine.

20
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,220
She pisses me off.

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,640
Now, let me introduce the new members.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,150
First...

23
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,850
Oh?

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,820
When you see her up close, 
Akame-chan's so cute...

25
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,400
What are you doing, all of a sudden?

26
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,570
I'm Chelsea.

27
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,150
As fellow assassins, let's all get along.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,780
Here, have a treat.

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,140
I welcome you.

30
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,430
Ah! She managed to lure Akame by feeding her!

31
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,790
She must have been hungry from the long trip.

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,000
But Chelsea looks even less like an 
assassin than Mine and the rest...

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't judge a book by its cover.

34
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,840
She's an amazing talent, who's done about the 
same number of successful jobs as Akame.

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,630
Eh?

36
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,010
And this is my new Imperial Arms, which I 
got from the Revolutionary Army,

37
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,430
Lightning Speed: Susanoo.

38
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,040
He's an organism-based type that operates 
on auto, so the burden is low.

39
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,600
Meaning even I could use him.

40
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,900
N-Nice to meet you again...

41
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,510
Wh-What?

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,910
All right!

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,070
His personality is that of quite a neat freak.

44
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,700
Even though he's an Imperial Arms...

45
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,460
Come to think of it, he did fix my hair.

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,000
Well? More importantly, what's his power?

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,710
He's just strong in physical brawls?

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Then let us show you.

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,930
Don't be too surprised.

50
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,890
Do it, Susanoo!

51
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,140
Understood.

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,230
Well, I mean this is amazing, but...

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,840
But what the hell?

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,580
It looks like he's merely doing household chores.

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,830
Precisely!

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,800
Susanoo was originally created to 
be an Imperial Arms bodyguard.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,620
Of course, he has attack power,

58
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,790
but he's also trained to do housework 
while he protects you.

59
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,840
Cleaning, laundry, everything!

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,350
Chores                    Fighting

61
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,350
He's able to prepare over a hundred dishes.

62
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,810
That has nothing to do with fighting!

63
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,980
But he's extremely convenient!

64
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,220
Well, of course he has a secret fighting technique.

65
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,050
Right?

66
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,770
Yes.

67
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,570
<i>Then these two are our new members...</i>

68
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,370
<i>They seem very reliable!</i>

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey, you flat-chested shrimp! 
Tiny chest! Tiny chest!

70
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,690
Even though he's good looking and can 
cook, he is an Imperial Arms, right?

71
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,580
Yeah, I'm definitely not gonna lose to that.

72
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,800
<i>Though I'm worried about our teamwork...</i>

73
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
We finished searching the doctor's residence.

74
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,380
However, there was no solid evidence 
to explain the fact that he's missing.

75
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,080
But all his important experimental materials 
and equipment were left in the lab.

76
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,530
So, he didn't flee.

77
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,450
Then he was killed, after all.

78
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,960
His super soldiers were all gone, as well.

79
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,910
It's believed they all perished in battle.

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,040
All right.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,260
So that means Seryu lost another patron.

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,970
After losing Stylish, how are you doing mentally?

83
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm fine!

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,310
Materials were left in his lab.

85
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,390
I won't be able to do additions or modifications, 
but I can keep up my maintenance.

86
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,150
I see.

87
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,410
Seryu, how is your Judgment of the Ten 
Kings and other weaponry doing?

88
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,980
Oh! They're working perfectly, Doctor.

89
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,390
You were able to withstand the experiments.

90
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,420
Now, use those powers to achieve your goals.

91
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,420
Even if you get hurt, I'm here for you.

92
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,380
Right!

93
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,920
My parents... My teacher... 
And now my patron!

94
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,720
All the people precious to me 
are getting killed by villains.

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,610
Seryu...

96
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,500
Captain,

97
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,010
I'm angry!

98
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,630
I want to hurry and eradicate them all!

99
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,670
If you're with me, I shall grant that wish.

100
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,550
Without fail.

101
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
Captain...

102
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,190
Thank you very much.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,190
I will use my strength, my life...

104
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,990
For you and justice.

105
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,470
Good.

106
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,060
All right!

107
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,450
I'm totally going to cheer Seryu up.

108
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,280
I don't think you'll be able to do it, Wave.

109
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,450
My mom always told me

110
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,290
if a girl seems sad, be a man and help her.

111
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,440
Huh...

112
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
And that time is now!

113
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,370
Seryu, I'm here for you!

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,470
It appears the capital is also steadily 
strengthening their forces...

115
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,990
At this rate, we lack power.

116
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,970
We must become stronger.

117
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,590
The day of revolution is near.

118
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,850
We'll have to use this time to train.

119
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,000
Most likely, our team will 
not be ready immediately.

120
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,260
Think of this as our last chance 
to get any new members.

121
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,600
Complete the missions together, survive, 
and let us welcome the day of revolution.

122
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,790
We got one.

123
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,470
All right.

124
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,830
We're going to feast tonight, Su.

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,930
Whew...

126
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,680
The food Su makes is delicious!

127
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,590
All my fatigue from training is gone.

128
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,190
Thank you, Su.

129
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,940
Su, let's train together tomorrow!

130
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,820
I told you that Susanoo was amazing.

131
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,580
I'm surprised the Revolutionary Army was willing 
to let such an efficient Imperial Arms go.

132
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,720
No...

133
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,060
This whole time, Susanoo has been asleep.

134
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,290
He responded to me, and began to move.

135
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,370
That's our boss.

136
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,460
Well, I guess you could

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,800
call it charm...

138
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,050
Najenda looks just like my old master.

139
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,470
I get it.

140
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,720
I'm sure your master was a fascinating person.

141
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,180
Yes.

142
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,180
He was an amazing general!

143
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,020
He?!

144
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,070
You look just like a guy!

145
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,860
Nothing less from our boss, 
who's called a handsome guy!

146
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,860
Sis, you shouldn't laugh so much.

147
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,260
Uh, well, um...

148
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,290
Um...

149
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,260
Everyone got chummy with Su so fast...

150
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,600
My position's been taken.

151
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,630
Lubba, you've always had the comedian's role.

152
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,020
Oh? It's a baby Marg panther.

153
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,030
Those guys don't fear humans.

154
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,440
What? I'm telling you right now, 
I don't have any food for—

155
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,940
G-Guess I don't have a choice.

156
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,740
It's mine now, meow.

157
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,790
Chelsea!

158
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,040
Mine, you're way too open.

159
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,100
Wh-Why, you...

160
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,120
So that's your Imperial Arms, Chelsea?

161
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,130
Yep, I can change into whatever I like.

162
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,470
Isn't my Imperial Arms, 
Gaea Foundation, convenient?

163
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,300
Mine, if you don't tighten your guard, 
you might end up the next victim.

164
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,270
What?!

165
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,810
If they learn what your Imperial 
Arms is, you're finished, too!

166
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,860
True... I have a cosmetic Imperial 
Arms rather than one for battle.

167
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,770
But that's exactly why it's worth using.

168
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,990
The look of surprise on your face 
just now, Mine, was priceless.

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
She pisses me off so much!

170
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,500
Tatsumi, I'll leave the small fry to you.

171
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,430
Got it!

172
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,760
<i>Their single blows are heavy.</i>

173
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,980
<i>I'll watch their movements, 
and avoid any direct impact.</i>

174
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,070
<i>Then I'll eliminate them!</i>

175
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,650
<i>That's...</i>

176
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,120
<i>Incursio's supplemental weapon, Neuntöte.</i>

177
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,030
<i>Since when</i>

178
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,370
<i>could he use that?</i>

179
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,140
<i>Slowly, he's getting closer to Bulat...</i>

180
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,940
There's no end to these small fry.

181
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,930
They just keep calling more reinforcements.

182
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,350
I have to find the leader.

183
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,780
Found it!

184
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,700
Whoa, there.

185
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,170
I guess that's your hidden technique.

186
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,430
Subjugation complete!

187
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,690
To think we've been able to subjugate 
the area this smoothly...

188
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,500
All sorts of things attack, so we 
can't lower our guard.

189
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,840
That's fine. That makes things more fun.

190
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,870
The air is thin here.

191
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,400
Having battles in a rough area...

192
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,870
You guys have leveled up quite a bit.

193
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,750
True... I can definitely feel it.

194
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,240
Chelsea...

195
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,130
Well? After observing Night Raid 
for a month, how do you feel?

196
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,480
Yeah, you guys are strong.

197
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,430
You're stronger than my last team.

198
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,370
All right!

199
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,430
<i>We made her admit it!</i>

200
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,390
But...

201
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,350
Mere strength isn't enough to survive.

202
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,900
I was reading your old records, 
but Sheele and Bulat,

203
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,980
the two who died in the line of duty...

204
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm sure they were great people...

205
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,150
But I think they're failures as assassins.

206
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,370
If you don't do something about that naiveté,

207
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,580
I don't think it'd matter if you had endless lives.

208
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,380
She pisses me off to no end.

209
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,090
As honest as ever, I see.

210
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Anyway,

211
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,210
let's cook all of the beasts we've hunted.

212
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,830
We should take care of our hunger first.

213
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,890
You're seriously independent, too.

214
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,860
Well? What did you want to discuss, Mine?

215
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,950
You guys are okay with this?

216
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,210
With what she said about Sheele and Bulat?

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,710
Well, I mean...

218
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,990
I don't want anyone saying 
anything about Bro, either.

219
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
Then give Chelsea a piece of your mind.

220
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,870
Tell her she's wide-open, too, and laugh at her!

221
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,090
And while she's in shock, I'll deal her the 
finishing blow and declare victory!

222
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,270
It's perfect.

223
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,330
I have a feeling that nothing good 
happens when I pair with you.

224
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,930
What? Obviously, you guys are on my side, right?

225
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,270
Right?

226
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,730
All right, fine. But how are we 
going to teach her a lesson?

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,320
You need to figure that out with 
Lubba. I'll think on my own.

228
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,780
Got it? We're going through with this tonight.

229
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,090
We're gonna teach her a lesson!

230
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,420
Forceful as always...

231
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,250
A way to teach her a lesson?

232
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,070
Well, I guess we could use our Imperial Arms...

233
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,170
Ah! I totally got an idea! A great idea!

234
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,480
<i>To be using my Imperial Arms 
for something like this...</i>

235
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,980
Listen, it's almost time for Chelsea's bath.

236
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,110
You turn invisible, and go in 
after her from the back.

237
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,860
And then get close to her while she's 
bathing, and put a bucket over her head.

238
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,270
She'll be super surprised.

239
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,130
Are you sure that's okay?

240
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,080
You idiot!

241
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,320
Mine's orders are for a just cause.

242
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,340
This is our only chance.

243
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,800
B-But...

244
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,510
You won't be able to come with me, Lubba.

245
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,350
That's fine. I'm giving you the chance. Go!

246
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,310
Lubba...

247
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,520
<i>Just kidding.</i>

248
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,340
<i>Now I can learn how angry Chelsea will 
get if we peep on her while bathing.</i>

249
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,320
<i>If she's the type to laugh and forgive, 
I'm totally going for it!</i>

250
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,000
<i>I'd feel bad if I looked too long, 
so I'll make this quick.</i>

251
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,770
<i>But then again...</i>

252
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,900
<i>I sort of want to see.</i>

253
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,700
The pubescent young man is conflicted.

254
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,590
<i>All right... Here we go!</i>

255
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,740
<i>It's a guy?!</i>

256
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,740
Where are you? I know you're there.

257
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,210
Su, why...

258
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,020
Incursio can go invisible, but that is all.

259
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,630
It cannot render your presence invisible.

260
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,800
Do not forget this. Otherwise, you will die!

261
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,970
Yeah.

262
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,740
Wide-open.

263
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,230
Eh? E-Eh?

264
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,190
Just kidding, it was me.

265
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,280
Ah.

266
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,000
I felt your presence getting closer,

267
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,750
so I thought I'd surprise you instead.

268
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,540
So that's why you transformed and waited for me.

269
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,430
You got me.

270
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,570
Deception is my specialty.

271
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,630
You need at least ten more years 
before trying to deceive me!

272
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,760
If I said that, are you the type to get mad?

273
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,470
No.

274
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,360
Hmm?

275
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,110
What you mentioned about being invisible...

276
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,790
Everything you said is true.

277
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,390
I'll remember that in actual combat.

278
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,320
Huh... You seem to comprehend things well.

279
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,250
I...

280
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,070
Recently, I came back from a job, 
and my whole team was killed.

281
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,040
I don't want that to happen to everyone here...

282
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,200
If you don't do something about that naiveté,

283
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,590
I don't think it'd matter if you had endless lives.

284
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,410
<i>Then she said that because she 
was thinking of everyone.</i>

285
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,890
Well...

286
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,810
You're pretty naïve yourself, Chelsea.

287
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,300
That isn't true.

288
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,020
That has to do with my mental health.

289
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,860
Ah.

290
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,240
Also, the next time you come in on me bathing,

291
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,240
I'll chop it off, so be prepared.

292
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,290
Ch-Chop it off? Chop what off?!

293
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,770
Captain?

294
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,860
Is something the matter?

295
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,930
When there are a lot of people, I always 
want to search for Tatsumi.

296
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,300
Captain...

297
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,220
We managed to find many people 
in the army who resemble him.

298
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,390
If you wish, we could arrange 
for you to meet them.

299
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,450
There's no need for that, Run.

300
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,500
There is only one Tatsumi in the world.

301
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,910
I shall accept no substitute.

302
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,120
My apologies.

303
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,920
<i>This isn't good...</i>

304
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,030
<i>A very sadistic woman, working with the minister.</i>

305
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,670
<i>I knew she had power, although I 
thought she was trash.</i>

306
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,130
<i>I guess keeping an eye on 
her for a bit is one idea.</i>

307
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,830
<i>What is this feeling in my chest?</i>

308
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,070
<i>Am I going to be reunited with Tatsumi soon?</i>

309
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,310
<i>Or...</i>

310
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,150
<i>Does our final battle with them approach?</i>

311
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,620
<i>Or is it something else completely?</i>

312
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,570
It's a Danger Beast I've never seen before!

313
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,800
Run!

314
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,480
Well... It appears I've acquired 
some rather amusing toys.

315
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,690
It's been forever since I was in the capital.

316
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,770
I will enjoy it to the fullest.

317
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Nuisances
