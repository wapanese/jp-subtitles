1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,710
Why... Just to save me?

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,940
Don't be so self-absorbed.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,550
We needed to stop the public execution

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,050
to protect the Revolutionary Army's morale.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,010
Everyone went in prepared for this.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,230
Even if that's the case...

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,620
Also,

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,190
we were able to eliminate Commander-in-Chief Budou,

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,650
who's been a problem for years.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,920
All things considered, a notable military gain.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,710
How can you say that?

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,650
Tatsumi,

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,970
it isn't like the boss isn't in pain, too.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,570
She lost Susanoo.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,760
Don't worry about that.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,600
As an Imperial Arms, 
he simply fulfilled his mission.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,120
Su...

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,340
As the survivors, we carry the feelings

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,970
of those who've passed away on our shoulders.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,930
They're heavy...

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,680
They are.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,840
However, we can't just surrender 
because we feel they're too much.

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,420
Akame...

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,470
If we throw in the towel,

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,670
the dead won't be able to rest in peace!

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,890
You're right.

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,040
This anguish... We have to end it.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>My life was required to activate 
Susanoo's trump card.</i>

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,440
<i>And yet, I'm still alive.</i>

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,450
<i>Susanoo, you took your own life to save mine.</i>

31
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,140
<i>You weren't a mere weapon.</i>

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,670
<i>You were my precious partner.</i>

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,700
<i>You told me that you wanted 
to stand on the winning side,</i>

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,050
<i>and create a world without discrimination.</i>

35
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,470
<i>I'm going to fulfill that wish for you,</i>

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,320
<i>Mine...</i>

37
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,610
Kill the Little Sister

38
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,200
Kill the Little Sister

39
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,210
Let go...

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,870
If you keep resisting, I'll have you arrested!

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,930
Don't make me laugh.

42
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,420
This kingdom's done for.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,970
What did you say, you bastard?

44
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,710
Stop!

45
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,390
Damn it!

46
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,810
How long are we supposed to keep this up?

47
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,290
This kingdom will not last much longer.

48
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,970
Most of the civilians we're supposed to 
protect side with the rebel army.

49
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,450
Are we, the Jaegers, really okay with this?!

50
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,200
Please calm down.

51
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,010
This chaos will, most likely, 
continue past the revolution.

52
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,670
We will be needed then.

53
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,660
You talk as though you knew all this would happen.

54
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,580
It occurred faster than I'd predicted, though.

55
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,530
Huh?

56
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,150
I hoped for revolution,

57
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,360
and joined the Jaegers in order to change

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,250
this kingdom from the inside.

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,590
Change the kingdom?

60
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,550
This kingdom is rotten.

61
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,000
However, rebelling like those out 
there would have been foolish.

62
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,050
That's why you joined Esdeath's special forces.

63
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,920
That's right.

64
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,220
She's quite the interesting specimen.

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,310
You're pretty odd.

66
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm often told that.

67
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,450
Being here, I became so comfortable,

68
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,300
I nearly forgot my true objective.

69
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,330
And as for you, what will you do?

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,450
You don't have much time left.

71
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,630
Y-You knew about Kurome's condition?

72
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,810
Don't be so surprised.

73
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,990
Your attitude and behavior gave it away.

74
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,010
If you leave now, you won't have to worry 
about capture or punishment.

75
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,490
You can be free.

76
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,250
Freedom...

77
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,390
That's right.

78
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,810
Freedom isn't what I desire.

79
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,440
There's only one thing I want...

80
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,990
This is, indeed, how a battle should be.

81
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,140
If you're discontent with your situation,

82
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,990
show me how strong you are by defeating me.

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,000
Say your prayers, Esdeath.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,370
If we defeat you, this will all end!

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
An Imperial Arms user.

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,540
How interesting!

87
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,680
Is there no one who can overcome death?

88
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
<i>Tatsumi survived.</i>

89
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>He managed to escape 
death in that dire situation.</i>

90
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,480
<i>As I thought, we are destined for each other.</i>

91
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,100
<i>Wait for me.</i>

92
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,530
<i>After I take care of the grunts, 
I'll be coming for you.</i>

93
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,700
Shisuikan and Bench Fortress have both fallen.

94
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,820
The capital's almost completely surrounded.

95
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,490
What is Esdeath doing?

96
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,400
If she's attacked on all sides,

97
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,320
even General Esdeath wouldn't be able to...

98
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,960
Your Excellency!

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,510
Because of me,

100
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,880
the kingdom is going to be destroyed...

101
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,180
Have I been wrong this whole time?

102
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,550
You haven't been wrong, Your Excellency.

103
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,930
O-Onest...

104
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,890
Not a single person is reliable.

105
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,770
Everyone is far too flustered.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,130
I am painfully aware of how you 
are feeling, Your Excellency.

107
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,740
The citizens are being foolish.

108
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,320
They don't understand what it's like 
to protect an entire kingdom.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,550
I can't believe my people would rebel.

110
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,910
What am I supposed to do?

111
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,170
Your Excellency, at times, 
an emperor must be cruel.

112
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,210
Now is the time to demonstrate your authority.

113
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,550
It's time to prepare!

114
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,680
<i>The emperor's true strength...</i>

115
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,080
It's almost over for me.

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,870
So...

117
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,280
Let's settle this once and for all, Sis.

118
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,370
They say he was a Revolutionary Army spy.

119
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,590
Is this meant to be a warning?

120
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,950
How cruel...

121
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,260
It's a code.

122
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,440
A code?

123
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,890
It's for me.

124
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,380
What did you say?

125
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,300
"I will be waiting for you near 
the Kadai Forest facility."

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,180
Don't be stupid... You know it's a trap!

127
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,800
At this point in time, there'd be 
no reason to single me out.

128
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,760
This is personal.

129
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,100
Personal? Who?

130
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,360
Kurome wants to settle things for good.

131
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,210
Is it important that you two see this through?

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,560
Right now, many people are 
pinning their hopes on us.

133
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,340
Despite that, is this something you must do?

134
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,810
It's especially because we're their last hope.

135
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,490
I have to respect Kurome's wishes.

136
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,040
Even if she's the enemy?

137
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,340
She's my sister.

138
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,120
I'm the only one who can understand and accept

139
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,300
her wishes.

140
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,160
I understand. I'm coming with you.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,450
No, you're not.

142
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,520
Your strength will be 
needed in the final battle.

143
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,540
You must fulfill your mission.

144
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,560
Then...

145
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,430
Promise that you'll come back alive.

146
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,660
Tatsumi...

147
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
You've always said those words to me.

148
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,030
Don't make me the only one to promise!

149
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,480
Okay.

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,580
It's a promise.

151
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,630
I knew you'd come, Sis.

152
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,080
Kurome...

153
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,870
Do you want any?

154
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,220
In the past, we were reunited in this place.

155
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,180
And this is also where you betrayed us.

156
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,810
I can't think of a place more 
fitting for me to kill you.

157
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,050
It's nostalgic...

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,150
You've always protected me.

159
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,440
As children who had no relatives,

160
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,460
we didn't belong anywhere but here.

161
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,570
Raised as assassins for the empire,

162
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,470
we were tasked with upholding public order

163
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,780
by stopping any potential insurgency.

164
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,920
That's what we were told 
and how we were raised.

165
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,070
We obeyed our orders,

166
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,890
killing those who'd wronged the empire.

167
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,620
Because we believed it was the right thing to do.

168
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,620
Sis!

169
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,370
Kurome...

170
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,380
Sis...

171
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,280
We were finally reunited after being 
trained in separate divisions,

172
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,720
simply because we needed to 
replace our fallen comrades.

173
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,160
After that, we were always together.

174
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Almost as if we were reliving our childhood.

175
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,040
We were the best squad of assassins.

176
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,000
Some missions were painful.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,100
But because we were together, we managed.

178
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,470
As long as I was with you, I was happy.

179
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,600
But you...

180
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,350
But you...

181
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,480
But you...

182
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,360
You betrayed the empire and joined Night Raid.

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,210
Why?

184
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,790
I tried to stop you.

185
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,600
After you left me, I was miserable.

186
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,790
I thought about you every day.

187
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,750
About how I was going to kill you.

188
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,340
If you kill me, will you find peace?

189
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,630
There is no peace.

190
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,560
I just want to be the one that 
does it, so you'll belong to me.

191
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,560
Using your Imperial Arms takes an 
enormous amount of energy.

192
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,970
It's agonizing, isn't it?

193
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,820
I'll help you feel better.

194
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,390
Let's kill each other,

195
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,230
Sis.

196
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,990
Kurome's Snacks

197
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,990
Kurome...

198
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,240
She went out, didn't she?

199
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,550
To sort everything out for herself.

200
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,000
Why would she do that 
without letting any of us know?

201
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,800
Because if she'd told you, 
you'd have stopped her.

202
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,330
Do you have any idea what location she'd choose?

203
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
A place that's special to them?

204
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,250
Why did you betray our squad?

205
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,860
We could've stayed together!

206
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,320
I started to realize that what we were doing

207
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,040
wasn't to keep the peace.

208
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,000
It was all a lie.

209
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,100
We were a special unit dedicated

210
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,860
to executing any orders from the capital.

211
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,010
If the current empire continues to exist, 
the citizens are doomed to suffer.

212
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,640
That's why I tried to get you to escape with me.

213
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
There's no way I could simply escape.

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,520
I can't betray our comrades, 
who gave their lives for the mission!

215
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,250
The people who run the empire are 
the source of everyone's misery.

216
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,070
If eliminating them will help the citizens,

217
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,860
our comrades that passed would understand.

218
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,570
That's a convenient argument, Sis!

219
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,490
A Danger Beast?

220
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,620
The clash of our battle must've awakened him.

221
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,440
Kurome!

222
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,510
Natala!

223
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,610
How dare you do that to my friend?!

224
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,190
Doya!

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,720
Doya!

226
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,690
Even Doya...

227
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,410
I'll never let you into my collection!

228
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,710
Are you all right, Kurome?

229
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,390
Sis...

230
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:14,890
Let's do it.

231
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,910
Eliminate!

232
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,530
As expected of you and me.

233
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,270
We always made the best team.

234
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,100
Isn't that right, Sis?

235
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,740
Come forth!

236
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,000
Random puppets won't do...

237
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,420
This is

238
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,150
the end!

239
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,640
I won't let you hurt Kurome.

240
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,630
Wave?

241
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,060
Night Raid, I am your opponent!

242
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,300
Tatsumi?

243
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,460
Get out of the way, Tatsumi!

244
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,110
Don't interrupt us!

245
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,680
Kurome, I can't just abandon my comrades.

246
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,900
This doesn't make me happy at all...

247
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,200
Kurome...

248
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,270
Tatsumi,

249
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,460
why did you come?

250
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,000
To make sure no one interferes with your duel.

251
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,590
Tatsumi, I don't have time to deal withâ€”

252
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,110
I want to stop them, too.

253
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,170
But then they'll never overcome their past!

254
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,280
Is that the answer you've 
gotten from Night Raid?

255
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,550
I can't allow this battle to occur!

256
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,510
Everyone has their own reasons.

257
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,680
Sometimes, you must settle it without others' help

258
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,140
or there's no way forward!

259
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,800
Their own reasons...

260
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,700
I...

261
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,450
Wave...

262
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,800
Thank you for coming.

263
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,130
I wish we could've been 
closer in a different situation.

264
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,180
Kurome...

265
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,560
I need this to deal with my 
regret from back then.

266
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
So I can finally move on.

267
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,700
Let's do this, Sis.

268
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,850
Kurome... My little sister...

269
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,390
That's right. I love you, Sis.

270
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,930
It couldn't be any other way?

271
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,310
I couldn't do anything for Kurome...

272
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,830
You came for her.

273
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,320
That's plenty.

274
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,250
Damn it.

275
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,480
Damn it...

276
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,940
Damn it!

277
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,640
Night Raid...

278
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,990
What are we fighting for?

279
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,930
If you can't answer that for yourself, 
you've no business with a weapon.

280
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,550
Only those who've committed themselves 
have the right to wield a sword.

281
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,310
Committed?

282
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,060
Committed to keep carrying on.

283
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,470
Akame!

284
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,530
I told you not to come.

285
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,000
Not to fight.

286
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,000
But I'm just here to pick up a wounded comrade.

287
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,300
I've lost a lot that's important to me.

288
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,640
But you...

289
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,720
You've borne more than I can 
imagine on your shoulders,

290
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,810
this whole time.

291
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,910
Akame,

292
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,480
we're done losing things that are precious to us.

293
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,780
What impressive determination.

294
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,470
Your wisdom is a testament to your greatness.

295
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,480
Now is the time to unleash the capital's 
supreme Imperial Arms.

296
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,420
You must show the foolish 
rebels and foolish citizens

297
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,010
the emperor's true power.

298
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,490
I am the Emperor.

299
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,560
I must protect the kingdom with my power.

300
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the Emperor

301
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,610


302
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,610
