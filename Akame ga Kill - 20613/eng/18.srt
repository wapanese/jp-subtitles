1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,040
<i>I wanted</i>

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,480
<i>to spend more time with everyone.</i>

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,740
<i>I wanted to fight alongside everyone.</i>

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,570
<i>If only I...</i>

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,030
<i>If I were more...</i>

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,200
Tatsumi, how long do you plan on sleeping?

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,120
A-Ah, right.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,630
My bad.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,290
I was sleeping like a log.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,530
We're finally entering Kyoroch, the religious 
organization's headquarters.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,090
Pull yourself together.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,340
I know!

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,330
As long as we can defeat 
the evil that dwells here,

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,960
the Revolutionary Army can 
make their move, right?

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,270
<i>This isn't the time to be
 distracted by memories.</i>

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,180
<i>We need to take down this empire, 
which starves its people,</i>

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,240
<i>and sever the root of these tragedies.</i>

18
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,110
Kill the Demon

19
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,690
Kill the Demon

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,380
Borick, advisor to the religious sect's founder,

21
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,810
the minister has ordered us, 
the special police force,

22
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,190
otherwise known as the Jaegers, to protect you.

23
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,210
Well, well...

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,690
To think that General Esdeath, 
strongest in the empire, would come...

25
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,180
I couldn't be more relieved.

26
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,700
There have been reports already that 
Night Raid's infiltrating the area.

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,940
Until they're caught, we'll borrow a room.

28
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,480
Of course.

29
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,280
I doubt you'll be bored in my mansion.

30
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,240
I have no interest in such things.

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,750
However, I would like to meet the 
ones who have been spying on us.

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,290
As expected, you noticed their presence.

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,090
What's with these guys?

34
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,740
The empire let me borrow them.

35
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,620
They are the ones who control the followers,

36
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,840
the very face of violence,

37
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,040
the Four Koukenji Rakshasa Demons.

38
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,020
Oh... I was wondering why I hadn't 
seen them in the capital.

39
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,800
They've been here this whole time.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,220
Now that you're here, General, these demons 
don't have to be devoted to protecting me.

41
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,530
They can be used for offensives now.

42
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,030
Wait a second, please...

43
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,150
Fighting Night Raid without using 
Imperial Arms is impossible—

44
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,320
There's no need to worry.

45
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,120
We've defeated Imperial Arms 
users with our bare hands.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,580
Just like this...

47
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,640
Even if the Imperial Arms 
are considered powerful...

48
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
...ultimately, the ones who use 
them are regular humans.

49
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,840
Which means there many ways 
to defeat them, right?

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,350
The Four Rakshasa Demons are 
executioners hired by the minister.

51
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,640
As you've seen, their skill is superb.

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,390
Exactly.

53
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,520
You can just relax and have some 
wine in the mansion while we—

54
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,420
Regardless of your accomplishments, 
you shouldn't lower your guard.

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,380
Ah, incredible...

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,840
As expected of General Esdeath.

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,030
I'm gonna fall for you.

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,130
<i>He had us come here, even though his 
important pawns are already here.</i>

59
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>That minister must be pretty cautious 
about this religious organization.</i>

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,960
<i>Kurome...</i>

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,420
Kurome!

62
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,680
Damn it. If I had gotten here sooner...

63
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,210
Bols is gone, too.

64
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,590
Even though he has a wife and kid...

65
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,510
What am I supposed to say to them?

66
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,930
But you were blown away because 
you were protecting Kurome.

67
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,360
The captain doesn't blame
 anyone for this incident.

68
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,900
I understand how you feel, 
but you must calm down.

69
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,030
Damn it... Damn it!

70
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,020
Damn it!

71
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,160
How's Kurome?

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,080
She's still sleeping.

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,920
The doctor said that if she's made 
it this far, she'll be all right.

74
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,220
I see.

75
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,160
I dissected the assassin we retrieved, 
but I couldn't find anything

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,380
to reveal her identity.

77
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,270
Most likely, an Imperial Arms user.

78
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,720
Probably a member of Night Raid.

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,850
Indeed.

80
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,180
Captain...

81
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,060
May I feed Coro the evil person's corpse?

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,750
Sure.

83
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,730
Whew!

84
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,360
K-Kurome?

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,330
Now that I've rested, I'm better.

86
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,960
I've recovered a whole lot.

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,530
Eh? You must be kidding.

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,530
You were hit in the vitals!

89
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,820
Captain...

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,990
Please allow me to continue working for you.

91
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
As you can see, I can fight.

92
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,160
Very well, then.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,960
As long as you're accompanying 
us, I'll have you do your best.

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,220
We leave for Kyoroch in thirty minutes.

95
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,170
Yes, ma'am!

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,730
Wave, is something the matter?

97
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,470
N-No, it's nothing...

98
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,900
Hey, are you okay?

99
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,230
You're probably not fully recovered yet.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,850
You should withdraw from the front lines.

101
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,740
I-I'm okay.

102
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,260
What are you talking about?

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,830
I'm gonna talk to the captain, 
and have you taken off this mission—

104
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,670
Kurome...

105
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,820
In this squad, if assassins are 
considered unable to fight,

106
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,710
they're disposed of, to keep them quiet.

107
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,720
Huh? Disposed of?

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,830
If I'm kicked off the Jaegers, I'm...

109
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,160
It'll be okay.

110
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
If we tell the captain, she'll protect you.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,540
That's no good.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,730
I have to fight.

113
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,290
I refuse to be disposed of...

114
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,050
I wasn't born into this world for that!

115
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,380
If I'm going to die, I'll die fighting.

116
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,740
Just like our comrades.

117
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,200
Kurome...

118
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,690
I'm okay now, Wave.

119
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm sorry for making you worry.

120
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,930
When my wounds heal,
 I'll be completely fine.

121
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,100
<i>Kurome...</i>

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,180
It seems there aren't any wanted 
posters this far from the capital.

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,340
The Jaegers may have distributed 
some recently, though.

124
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,430
Don't let your guard down.

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,060
Hey, just as I was saying...

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,680
What are you even doing?

127
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,380
I understand what you mean, but...

128
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,470
Isn't being too paranoid dangerous?

129
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,070
The enemy can sense that kind of tension.

130
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,360
Let's be more casual.

131
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,230
<i>Even though he was so upset 
when Chelsea was killed,</i>

132
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,790
<i>he's staying calm and focusing on the mission.</i>

133
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,410
<i>Heh, so he's matured.</i>

134
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,870
Well, I guess you have a point.

135
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,670
What is this?

136
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,780
It's delicious!

137
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,340
Isn't it?

138
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,680
You can't find this in the capital, right?

139
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,010
Now that I think about it, 
people seem much livelier here.

140
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,560
It's probably thanks to underground 
resources and religion.

141
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,010
Religion?

142
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,700
Apparently, it's very profitable.

143
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,190
Although most of the proceeds seem to 
go directly into Minister Onest's hands.

144
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,040
I see... So they don't know they're being used.

145
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,210
Borick is oppressing everyone
 who knows the truth.

146
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,910
They can't do anything about it.

147
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,810
That's why we have to breach the system.

148
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,610
Exactly.

149
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, for now, we have to 
survey the city a bit more.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,620
Right, let's circle the
 outer perimeter this time.

151
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,790
Good idea.

152
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's leave the dangerous area 
around the church to Lubba,

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,530
who volunteered so enthusiastically.

154
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,830
<i>Jeez.</i>

155
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,180
<i>These streets are like a maze...</i>

156
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,450
<i>But since there are lots of people, 
it's easy to slip into a crowd.</i>

157
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,430
<i>That's helpful.</i>

158
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,610
<i>Whoops.</i>

159
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,720
<i>Luckily neither my face nor my name is known.</i>

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,280
<i>So I'll gather as much information as possible, 
and score some points with Najenda.</i>

161
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,490
<i>Good job, Lubba.</i>

162
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,450
Hey, Sten...

163
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,770
Doesn't he kinda seem like 
he's surveying the area?

164
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,660
My instincts are screaming that he's an enemy.

165
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,900
The way he walks is what gives it away.

166
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,660
That's the movement of someone 
who's fought a few battles.

167
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,710
It seems that he's being careful,
 but I can tell.

168
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,470
That settles it, then.

169
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,970
Let's kill him.

170
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,190
Wrong, Mez.

171
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,220
Let's call it "freeing his soul."

172
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,670
According to our research,

173
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,020
there may be an underground passage 
beneath this graveyard,

174
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,020
leading from the church to Borick's mansion.

175
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,500
If we can find the entrance,

176
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,780
we could go straight to Borick's basement.

177
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,010
Finding it would be difficult.

178
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,160
After all, this area is pretty big.

179
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,530
There's also the possibility of a trap 
inside the underground passage.

180
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,490
Thanks for your help.

181
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,940
Did you think you could hide,

182
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,760
sweet Akame?

183
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,820
Ibara...

184
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,270
You're here, in Kyoroch?

185
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,670
Then you remember me?

186
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,710
That makes me happy.

187
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,630
When we were on the Assassination Squad,

188
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,990
we couldn't talk to each other at all.

189
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,880
I expected my battle with 
the Four Rakshasa Demons

190
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,250
to be the last fight during 
the minister's assassination.

191
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,370
A bad girl who's betrayed the empire

192
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,900
deserves a spanking.

193
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,410
I'll bury you!

194
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,900
Go ahead and try.

195
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,530
We, the Four Rakshasa Demons,

196
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,740
have not only undergone intense training,

197
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,210
but we also grew up consuming 
broth of the lake kraken

198
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,050
that lives behind our temple, in the mountains.

199
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,190
So we can control every part of our bodies!

200
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,140
Crap, they suddenly started attacking.

201
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,980
How did they see me?

202
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,560
Are you just gonna keep running, little boy?

203
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,830
What? You died already?

204
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,900
I barely felt you get hit.

205
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,020
<i>Come on, old man...</i>

206
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,490
<i>Hurry up and get out of here.</i>

207
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,660
<i>The thread armor I wrapped my 
body in absorbed his punch.</i>

208
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,750
<i>As for my pulse, I inserted Cross Tail into 
my body, and blocked the blood vessels.</i>

209
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,920
So we didn't even need to 
worry about this small fry.

210
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,990
How boring.

211
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,310
<i>Hurry up.</i>

212
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,840
<i>How long do I have to play dead?</i>

213
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,290
Here you go, Sten.

214
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,090
There's another one coming your way.

215
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,800
She's also a rebel spy.

216
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,880
<i>Is that the girl I was supposed to meet?</i>

217
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,480
<i>I'm sorry, but I can't save you...</i>

218
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,580
<i>As a spy, you should know 
to prepare for the worst.</i>

219
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,030
You must be another lost child, 
wandering around in this world.

220
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,900
Huh?

221
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,920
I shall free your soul for you.

222
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,620
You should be happy.

223
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,740
H-Help me...

224
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,950
So I couldn't do it...

225
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,880
I couldn't just sit back and watch an ally die.

226
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,270
Earlier, you didn't have a pulse.

227
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,680
What an idiot.

228
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,010
You should have just continued playing dead.

229
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:32,730
Given my circumstances, I was trying 
my best to avoid close combat.

230
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,310
However,

231
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,180
when it comes down to it, 
I'll give it everything I've got.

232
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,880
Both of you, come at me!

233
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

234
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,020
That's a pretty sinister blade.

235
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,130
Murasame... It suits you perfectly.

236
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,910
There, there, there!

237
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,420
How's that, sweet Akame?

238
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,360
I told you, we underwent intense training.

239
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,390
Here we go.

240
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,590
Imperial Arms confiscated.

241
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,980
What's with this blade?

242
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,920
Don't tell me... this was the plan...

243
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,610
To let go of your Imperial Arms?

244
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,250
You called Murasame "sinister."

245
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,750
I figured you wouldn't get along.

246
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,100
How dare you...

247
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,080
How dare you?!

248
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,880
The cursed blade didn't take a liking to you.

249
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,090
Perhaps you should be relieved, Ibara.

250
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,810
What a dangerous woman...

251
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,770
I might fall for you.

252
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,430
A surprise attack won't work, I see.

253
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,160
A member of the Jaegers?

254
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,630
Yes.

255
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,620
Akame, of Night Raid, infiltration confirmed.

256
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,820
My role is reconnaissance.

257
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,860
I was able to get a good 
look at your Murasame.

258
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,030
The Four Rakshasa 
Demons and the Jaegers...

259
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,480
I hope everyone's all right.

260
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,540
Now, come at me!

261
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,350
What do you mean by "come at me"?

262
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,980
You're the one that's attacking with those strings.

263
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,340
I figured that would be too obvious.

264
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,600
Would you like me to free your soul for you?

265
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,860
<i>Koukenji</i>

266
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,370
<i>Hundred Fists!</i>

267
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,330
I wasn't calling to you, old man.

268
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,730
Ah, you're rather skilled.

269
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,290
That thread is an Imperial Arms?

270
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,210
Which means you belong to Night Raid.

271
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,970
Then, this time, I'll split your skull, 
and make sure to kill you.

272
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,620
Stop flirting with me like that, would you?

273
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,470
Assemble, my thread.

274
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,170
And enhance...

275
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,690
<i>Centrifugal Force!</i>

276
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,270
Doesn't that move have far too many gaps?

277
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,210
Not really.

278
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,590
Take this.

279
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,450
Hidden ability...

280
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,410
<i>Wire Impact!</i>

281
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,950
Feeble.

282
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,120
This is your hidden move?

283
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,170
Don't make me laugh.

284
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,160
R-Really?

285
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,010
But I've already accomplished my goal.

286
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,150
Look behind you.

287
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,340
The woman got away.

288
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,350
And I'm gone, too.

289
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,570
He was using flashy moves to draw 
our attention from the woman.

290
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,310
We have no choice.

291
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,400
Even if it's only you, I'll free your soul.

292
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,030
Are you sure it's okay to charge me like that?

293
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,310
My thread is made from the fur of a mega-class

294
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,790
Danger Beast, which lives in the eastern clouds.

295
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,960
The fur that protects its vitals is especially tough.

296
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,660
Thread from those areas is particularly sharp,

297
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,520
sharp enough to earn the name 
"Realm-Cutting Thread."

298
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,050
What?

299
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,020
It's my best thread.

300
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,840
Even you won't be able to cut it.

301
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,300
Final blow.

302
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,570
F-Feeble...

303
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,000
This body's been through the toughest training.

304
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,530
This wound can't possibly...

305
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,650
It doesn't matter how tough your body is.

306
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,570
From the moment Cross Tail pierced your body,

307
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,190
its thread headed straight for your heart.

308
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,820
There's no way to train your 
heart to be invulnerable.

309
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,220
Wow, not bad.

310
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,960
You actually defeated Sten.

311
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,610
The minister is gonna be mad about this.

312
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,300
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

313
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,810
Sorry, but now that you've 
seen my Imperial Arms,

314
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,100
I can't let you live.

315
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,890
Don't be sorry.

316
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,440
After all, we're assassins,
 so it's to be expected.

317
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,920
<i>What the hell is that liquid?</i>

318
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,130
<i>This is bad.</i>

319
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,590
<i>That liquid is weighing down my 
thread, rendering it useless.</i>

320
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,600
It isn't oil. More like my sweat.

321
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,240
The Four Rakshasa Demons are 
experts in body-manipulation.

322
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,000
Now the thread used for your 
defensive barrier is useless.

323
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,940
S-So fast...

324
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,830
<i>C-Can't get up...</i>

325
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,570
<i>If I take another attack, I'll die for sure.</i>

326
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,620
Take this!

327
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,350
Don't be so desperate.

328
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,570
It's embarrassing.

329
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,240
Damn, you're cute...

330
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,980
If we weren't enemies, I would've 
definitely tried to seduce you.

331
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,970
I don't dislike guys like you, so I 
probably would have let you.

332
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,510
However...

333
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,850
That'll have to wait for the next life.

334
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,200
Bye-bye.

335
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,930
I had some thread tied to those knives.

336
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,680
So when I reeled in my thread, 
the knives came back, too.

337
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,870
Bye-bye.

338
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,000
I have to hurry and get outta here...

339
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,670
Man, what a waste.

340
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,550
This always happens to me!

341
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,450
Whew.

342
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,920
We've searched the area a few times,

343
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,900
but there are still many escape routes 
and secret paths to investigate.

344
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,810
This area is way too big!

345
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,970
That's exactly why we're surveying it.

346
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,450
If I could just go shopping, I would 
gladly survey the whole area.

347
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,090
Your shopping takes forever, so it's 
annoying to accompany you.

348
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,290
Huh? It's normal.

349
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,900
A man who can't excuse a woman's shopping?

350
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,040
How shallow.

351
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,590
A woman who immediately labels 
a man's observations shallow?

352
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,790
Now that's shallow.

353
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,250
I see how it is!

354
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,190
Let's see whose rank is higher, here and now.

355
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,880
You're so arrogant!

356
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,440
The fact that you think there should 
be a ranking system is messed-up!

357
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,310
Please stop this unproductive fighting.

358
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,810
Huh?

359
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,420
Who are you?

360
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,710
My apologies for intruding
 on your conversation.

361
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,570
I couldn't help but speak up.

362
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,000
Are you perhaps the founder...

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,470
...of the Path of Peace?

364
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,490
Yes.

365
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,770
Sometimes, I go around the outskirts of 
town, to ensure everything is all right.

366
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,440
I can clearly see that you two are 
bound by the red thread of fate.

367
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,540
So instead of fighting, 
you should confess your love.

368
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,540
Huh?

369
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,410
If you became a couple, an occasional 
squabble would be good for you.

370
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,250
Huh?

371
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,310
Huh?!

372
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,130
Why would I ever be with someone like him?

373
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,980
What about me? I'd never be 
with someone like you!

374
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,340
I believe you two are meant for one another.

375
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,880
Congratulations.

376
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,300
You've been chosen as our lord's noble disciple.

377
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,980
I-Is that true?

378
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,450
To be able to witness our lord's miracles...

379
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,920
It's a dream come true.

380
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,130
However, there still seems to be 
something wicked in your body,

381
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,060
which makes you unfit for the role.

382
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,450
N-No...

383
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,840
Remove your clothes.

384
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,710
I'll cleanse you with a special ritual.

385
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,290
Yes, Lord Borick.

386
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,950
I implore you...

387
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,910
<i>Full control of the religious 
organization will soon occur.</i>

388
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,660
<i>Till then, I'll make the most of it.</i>

389
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,880
Lord Borick...

390
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,140
What is it?

391
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,390
I'm in the middle of an important ritual.

392
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,560
The Four Rakshasa Demons...

393
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,230
In conclusion, three were
 taken out in one night.

394
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,810
We underestimated Night Raid.

395
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,990
In other words,

396
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,550
we, the Jaegers, are the only 
ones that can bestow justice

397
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,280
upon those heinous people.

398
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,700
Najenda... You may have won 
a few battles along the way,

399
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,750
but I'll trample every single 
one of your allies here.

400
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:41,020
Kill the Fate
