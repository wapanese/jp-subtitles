1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,100
So this isn't a dream...

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,520
<i>Seriously, I wish it were a dream...</i>

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,490
<i>An intruder from the base of the mountain?</i>

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,570
<i>What's up with this speed?</i>

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,780
<i>This isn't normal!</i>

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,810
<i>Stylish's mementos are essentially all dead, huh?</i>

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,090
<i>I'll hide and let them pass.</i>

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,040
<i>Tatsumi still hasn't come back, either.</i>

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,790
<i>It's starting to smell suspicious.</i>

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,850
<i>I've come back to you,</i>

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,260
<i>imperial capital!</i>

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,390
Kill the Giant Danger Beast

13
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,930
Kill the Giant Danger Beast

14
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,680
Undoubtedly, this is Tatsumi's scent.

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,230
You're the real thing.

16
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,810
How dare you run away?

17
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,850
I was lonely.

18
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,550
Wh-Why are you here?

19
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,690
Lately, I've been exterminating the 
Danger Beasts harassing the capital.

20
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,950
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,620
<i>She's suspicious of me.</i>

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,490
<i>If I don't answer carefully, I'm doomed.</i>

23
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,850
Um, before that, do you mind doing 
something about this position?

24
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,730
No.

25
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,930
When we're this close, I can't concentrate...

26
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,200
I won't let you run again.

27
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,200
I-It's to test my skill!

28
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,300
I hear a lot of Danger Beasts roam around here!

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,920
Then you're here to fight them, too.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,270
Well? Have you joined the Revolutionary Army?

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,890
Not yet.

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,730
But I don't intend on changing my mind.

33
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,110
I'm currently training myself to be a warrior.

34
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,110
I see...

35
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,640
Your physique has certainly 
become more pronounced.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,870
And you've clearly leveled up.

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,090
You've done well in this short amount of time!

38
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,940
Surely, you'll continue to grow even stronger!

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,290
W-Well...

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,290
<i>This isn't the time to be buttered up like this!</i>

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,680
The Danger Beasts here are 
pretty much annihilated.

42
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,090
They were annoying, but...

43
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,460
Thanks to them, I was able to find you.

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,210
This can only be destiny.

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,730
There's a surprising number 
of nuisances around here.

46
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,630
The one that just hid...

47
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,770
I know you're there. Come out.

48
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,690
If you do not, I shall not hesitate on attacking.

49
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,000
I thought I hid pretty well.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,130
But I gotta give it to you.

51
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,170
As expected from the capital's strongest.

52
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,170
Still, to encounter you out here...

53
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,330
I guess playtime is over.

54
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,860
Seems as though you know why the 
Danger Beasts are everywhere.

55
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,920
I'll escort you to the torture room.

56
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,970
Unfortunately, I'm not into that.

57
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,840
And ultimately, I'll have you clean up a big toy!

58
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,260
Imperial Arms Shambala!

59
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,810
Activate!

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,110
Wh-What's happening?

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,740
Now.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,170
What shall I play with next?

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,200
Wh-What the hell is this?

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,010
E-Esdeath...

65
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,710
Will you hurt me?

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,610
Tatsumi...

67
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,800
To think you had such a fetish.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,470
Just as I thought, we really 
are meant for each other.

69
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,590
That isn't what I meant!

70
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,560
Because of that guy, we may 
be hallucinating all of this!

71
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,830
So if we feel some physical pain, 
maybe we'll wake up!

72
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,730
All right.

73
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,240
Here goes.

74
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,390
It isn't an illusion.

75
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,900
The sensations are too real.

76
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,530
The smell of salt and the ocean breeze...

77
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,780
Temperature and humidity.

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,830
This is probably all real.

79
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,520
Which means...

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,220
Most likely, it's that guy's ability.

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,750
Have we been teleported somewhere else?

82
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,920
Something like that is possible?

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,490
In the capital are forty-eight super 
weapons known as Imperial Arms.

84
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,740
And among those,

85
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,090
I've heard some can manipulate space and time,

86
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,180
using secret arts from the lost country.

87
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,270
Eh? That's incredible...

88
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,560
<i>But wait...</i>

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,370
<i>Is it the same concept as when Incursio 
suddenly appears when I call for it?</i>

90
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,660
<i>When I think about it that way,</i>

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,530
<i>for some reason, it's really scary.</i>

92
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,070
<i>Manipulating space and time is a superior ability.</i>

93
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,270
<i>Definitely in the top percentile 
among the Imperial Arms.</i>

94
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,080
<i>Just who is he?</i>

95
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,830
For now, let's check our surroundings.

96
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,980
We're completely surrounded by ocean.

97
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,010
This is a beautiful view.

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,970
It's as though we're on a date.

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,770
You sure are calm.

100
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,510
The ability of the Imperial Arms 
surpasses the imagination.

101
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,150
If you want to go on, you have 
to keep an open mind.

102
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,520
I see.

103
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,570
Back to the main subject...

104
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,340
It's as though we're on a date!

105
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,790
W-Wait a second!

106
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,410
A giant Danger Beast.

107
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,930
<i>That thing</i>

108
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,870
<i>looks exactly like Dr. Stylish 
after his transformation.</i>

109
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>All of Night Raid fought him, 
and we finally defeated him.</i>

110
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,570
<i>Can we win?</i>

111
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,980
<i>With only two of us?</i>

112
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,170
Whoa, here he comes!

113
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,930
I have no mercy for nuisances.

114
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,810
Something like you deserves skewering!

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,600
<i>Weiss Schnabel!</i>

116
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,830
Amazing... In one instant.

117
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,910
You're tougher than I'd thought.

118
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,320
This is becoming exciting.

119
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,230
Um, that spot on his forehead...

120
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,950
It looks pretty fragile, doesn't it?

121
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,650
Hmm, my thoughts exactly.

122
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,870
We really are meant for each other.

123
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,920
<i>Grau Horn!</i>

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,530
How tenacious.

125
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,000
Tatsumi!

126
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,540
Magnificent.

127
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,650
I wanted to charm you by showing off...

128
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,770
But to think you'd charm me even more.

129
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,000
I even called out my special move...

130
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,690
There's still more?

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,560
Leave it to me.

132
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
I'll give it a fitting death.

133
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,370
<i>Hagel Sprung!</i>

134
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,090
What an impressive fighting style...

135
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,840
She's on a completely different level.

136
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,390
<i>So this is the true strength 
of the capital's strongest.</i>

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,230
<i>How are you going to kill her, Akame?</i>

138
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,400
It seems there were only two of them.

139
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,570
So that's what he meant by cleaning up toys.

140
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,530
And it seems this was the hiding place 
for the new type of Danger Beasts.

141
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,210
After we've rested, what do we do?

142
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,720
First, we'll investigate our surroundings.

143
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,130
We must gain an understanding 
of our environment.

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,530
That's true.

145
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,570
There are too many mysterious things.

146
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,030
Panicking would be fatal.

147
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,380
We'll stay calm while venturing out.

148
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,560
Roger that!

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,650
Let's go!

150
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,560
<i>I responded that way without thinking...</i>

151
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,760
<i>She's an enemy...</i>

152
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,840
Hmm...

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,630
It doesn't look like him.

154
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,540
Exploring the area took all day. 
It's already dark.

155
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,610
But it was quite fun!

156
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,670
Uh, yeah.

157
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,840
And now I know this island's location.

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,610
Huh?

159
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,260
This is a deserted island to the 
far southeast of the capital.

160
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,800
The far southeast?

161
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,750
We were teleported that far, huh?

162
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,890
Basically,

163
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,710
we are the only ones on this deserted island.

164
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,060
So, what would you like to do, Tatsumi?

165
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,520
It's your destiny, so you choose.

166
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:59,650
Tatsumi

167
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,660
That really isn't a choice!

168
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,030
How boring.

169
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,870
How are you so composed?

170
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,490
It's because I have an idea 
of how we can get back.

171
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,290
Don't worry.

172
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,490
Wow!

173
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,540
However, I need you to do your part, too.

174
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,620
Got it?

175
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,700
Y-Yes!

176
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,560
<i>I have a terribly bad feeling about this.</i>

177
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,720
<i>But while we try to get back, 
maybe I'll have a chance to escape!</i>

178
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,590
<i>I'm willing to take a risk for that.</i>

179
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,730
As I thought.

180
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,790
There was a clue hidden where 
we were first teleported.

181
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,440
Does this mean he can only teleport 
to places he's marked like this?

182
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,950
Judging from the area he 
activated when moving us,

183
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,640
it seems he can only move a few people at once.

184
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,480
And that he uses a tremendous 
amount of energy to do so.

185
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,790
He probably can't keep doing it.

186
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,080
Which means that if we watch over this spot...

187
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,650
The gate may open eventually.

188
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,550
That's one way to get back.

189
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,170
Now, before we talk about the 
more likely way to return...

190
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,590
Before?

191
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,800
Since it's just the two of us here, 
let's get to know one another better!

192
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,000
T-Time out!

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,050
W-We can get to know each 
other in a different way!

194
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,610
Would you like me to stop?

195
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,270
Then tell me your story.

196
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,630
First, where did you learn to wield a sword?

197
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,490
Th-There was a guy who retired 
from the military in my village.

198
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,790
He used to be a martial arts trainer, too.

199
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,410
He was a good teacher, so...

200
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,820
I see.

201
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,910
Is that also where you learned to forge weapons?

202
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,540
I wanted to learn a lot of different things, 
so I could make a living in the capital...

203
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,840
To actually learn all that, you are quite skilled.

204
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,190
You also seem like you can do 
practically anything, Esdeath.

205
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,930
Not quite.

206
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,890
I don't really take to the fine arts.

207
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,200
When Nyau would play his flute,

208
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
I had no idea what was good about it at first.

209
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,860
<i>This is the perfect chance to 
obtain information from her!</i>

210
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,130
<i>Also, she cares this much about me.</i>

211
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,280
<i>Maybe there's some way I can still 
convince her to be our ally.</i>

212
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,670
<i>It would be much better to have her 
on our side than as our enemy.</i>

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,770
You weren't born in the capital, 
were you, Esdeath?

214
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,680
That's right.

215
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm from the northern border.

216
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,220
Have you ever heard of the Paltas Clan?

217
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,050
No.

218
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,520
They're a race of hunters 
who target Danger Beasts.

219
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,580
I grew up there as the chief's daughter.

220
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,180
Since you told me about your 
past, I'll tell you about mine.

221
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,290
Father, I caught my prey!

222
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,950
Wow, good job!

223
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,650
For your age, that's quite impressive!

224
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,780
But mine is more amazing!

225
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,650
We're just about to dissect it, to harvest materials.

226
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,600
So help out.

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,240
Okay!

228
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,980
He's weakened and tied up, so he 
won't be able to move much.

229
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,040
We'll do this boldly and quickly.

230
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,640
What a terrible scream, as always...

231
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,900
We need to remove the lizard 
orb while it's still alive,

232
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,640
or it won't be as valuable.

233
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,560
It may hurt, but that can't be helped.

234
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,880
This creature attacks and eats people.

235
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,950
But this time around, we were the stronger ones.

236
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,190
So he's the one that gets killed.

237
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,340
It's his fate for being weaker.

238
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,900
All right, Esdeath, you remove the eyes and crest.

239
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,630
Okay, I'll do it cleanly.

240
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,400
<i>Esdeath can land the final blow 
on any prey without hesitation,</i>

241
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,730
<i>even if it's weakened or running away.</i>

242
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,830
<i>She's a natural hunter.</i>

243
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,230
<i>But she seems to be lacking something.</i>

244
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,390
<i>Well, I don't see a problem.</i>

245
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,600
Eat or be eaten...

246
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,510
I was brought up in that wonderful environment.

247
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,350
The Danger Beasts and us...

248
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,010
Both sides gave it our all to survive one another.

249
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,060
Living like that was fun.

250
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh? A war between insects?

251
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,520
Yeah.

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,440
But it seems like there's a winner already.

253
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,900
Look, the queen's been dragged out

254
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,330
and lynched by enemy soldiers.

255
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,530
The fate of the weak, huh?

256
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,230
That's right.

257
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,420
Your mother was eaten by a high-level 
Danger Beast just like that.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,790
But that couldn't be helped, either.

259
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,270
It's sad, but she was hunted 
because she was weak.

260
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,800
And that's all there is to it.

261
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,750
<i>The strong win.</i>

262
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,050
<i>And the weak perish.</i>

263
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,530
It was worth waiting in the mountains for days.

264
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,730
I was able to catch a rare evil bird!

265
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,630
I bet Father will be proud!

266
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,350
Wh-What is this?

267
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,230
Are you all right?

268
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,530
A northern tribe crossed the border and attacked.

269
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,360
The chief stood on the front lines, 
and defeated several dozen...

270
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,000
But in the end, they overpowered him...

271
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,790
Father!

272
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,410
Esdeath...

273
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,000
As you can see...

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,770
We were weaker, so we lost.

275
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,770
It can't be helped.

276
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,800
Live strong, Esdeath...

277
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,730
But I don't need to worry about that.

278
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,230
After that, I continued to hunt 
Danger Beasts on my own.

279
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,590
But the prey was becoming scarce, so I 
went to the capital to join the military.

280
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,310
It was simply a matter of shifting from 
killing Danger Beasts to killing humans.

281
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,990
That's the story of my life.

282
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,120
So that means the northern tribe 
was a justifiable enemy of yours.

283
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,180
Hmm?

284
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,870
They were an adversary, but I 
didn't do it for revenge.

285
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,130
B-But I heard you buried hundreds of 
thousands of tribal people alive.

286
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,670
Merely to cut costs and set an example.

287
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,840
I would've done it regardless of whether 
they were my personal enemy.

288
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,640
And it was the capital's order.

289
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
I mourn the death of my father.

290
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,770
But that, too, was simply because he was weak.

291
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,290
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

292
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,690
If it's about me, I'll tell you anything.

293
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,440
Oh, then...

294
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
I'd like to see what your Imperial Arms looks like.

295
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,660
Oh, that?

296
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
My Imperial Arms is here.

297
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,970
This.

298
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,960
Eh?

299
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,320
It was a few years ago.

300
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,380
I've prepared several Imperial Arms for you.

301
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,340
But none seems suited to you.

302
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,340
I like this axe. It's rather splendid.

303
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,340
But it doesn't quite feel right.

304
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,850
Is that urn over there an Imperial Arms, as well?

305
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,500
That Imperial Arms is the Demon's Extract.

306
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,980
It's the lifeblood of a high-level Danger 
Beast that lived in the far North.

307
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,760
The blood is the Imperial Arms?

308
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,960
A legend says that if you drink 
it and it's compatible,

309
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,990
you'll gain the Danger Beast's control over ice.

310
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,190
All those who tried have lost their minds,

311
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,370
and are now insane.

312
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,020
It isn't worth trying.

313
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,670
That sounds quite interesting.

314
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,440
W-Wait, you aren't going to drink it, are you?

315
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,060
Regardless of how sadistic you are,

316
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,380
I can't guarantee its compatibility!

317
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,570
This blood is calling to me.

318
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,260
I can't help but feel that way.

319
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,730
I see.

320
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,390
Then you may very well be compatible with it.

321
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:19,930
Right?

322
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,050
For some reason, I'm certain

323
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,860
that this will suit me.

324
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,040
If my instincts, sharpened in the wild, are off,

325
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,960
it means this was the extent of my life.

326
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,780
One glass should be enough.

327
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,760
I might as well drink it all.

328
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
I feel that it'll make me stronger that way.

329
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,360
Since you're already crazy, 
perhaps it won't drive you mad.

330
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,500
That tasted quiteâ€”

331
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,850
<i>Kill. Take. Attack. Steal. Perish. Break. Harm.</i>

332
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,810
What destructive urges...

333
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,710
I see.

334
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,500
So they were driven to insanity by this.

335
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,620
However...

336
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,880
How tepid!

337
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,230
To try and taint me with something like this.

338
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,080
I am the one that dominates.

339
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,740
Regardless of what the enemy may be.

340
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,790
I act out of my own volition.

341
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,830
This is a truly good feeling, Minister.

342
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,240
I can feel the power coursing 
through my entire body.

343
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,130
Looks like it's completely adapted to you.

344
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,210
Let's celebrate the strongest soldier's birth.

345
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,970
Cheers.

346
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,900
So even now, the Danger Beast blood 
is running through your body?

347
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,090
That's right.

348
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,350
But it's tamed, so don't worry.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,450
Is that how you gained an affinity for torture?

350
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,320
No, I've always liked that.

351
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,490
<i>Something like avenging her people</i>

352
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,930
<i>or being driven berserk by 
a Danger Beast's blood</i>

353
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,210
<i>would've been more understandable.</i>

354
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,720
<i>But this person has always been like this.</i>

355
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,250
<i>There's no way I can change 
the core of her being!</i>

356
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,210
<i>I underestimated her, 
thinking I could try to convince her.</i>

357
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,350
Now, then...

358
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,670
I wonder how the rest are doing.

359
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,610
They'd better not have died or anything like that.

360
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,600
Guess I should open a path home...

361
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,220
<i>Shambala Point-B Release.</i>

362
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,990
That should do it.

363
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,930
What are you doing over there?

364
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,920
Huh? It's nothing.

365
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Your speech pattern is rowdy,

366
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,770
but there's something sophisticated about you.

367
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,240
Well, of course. I'm Minister Onest's son.

368
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,500
Minister... As in that one?

369
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,550
What do you mean by "that"? Huh?

370
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,930
I look up to him, you know.

371
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,320
Well, I'm sure I'll surpass him one day.

372
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,050
Surpassing a parent is the ultimate form 
of filial piety, don't you think?

373
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,430
Wh-What's the other way to get back?

374
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,580
I guess I should tell you now.

375
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,150
We need to acquire some form of a ride.

376
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,120
For travel, you can ride on 
some Danger Beasts' backs.

377
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,160
Taming one is quite difficult, 
but it isn't an issue for me.

378
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,270
Wait a second, like that one?

379
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,240
Speak of the devil... What bad timing.

380
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,610
Wh-What are you going to do?

381
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,120
It's incredibly high in the sky!

382
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,130
I'll train it after I shoot it down!

383
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,230
I won't let you get away!

384
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,810
Whoa!

385
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,670
This is the way back.

386
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,300
If I sneak out right now...

387
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,780
But she took care of me here.

388
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,140
I should return the favor.

389
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,970
Esdeath!

390
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,860
Something like an exit appeared!

391
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,060
I'll go in first!

392
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,120
Wait, Tatsumi!

393
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,070
Wait!

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,830
This is the summit we were on yesterday.

395
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,580
It seems we've returned.

396
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,570
Where are you, Tatsumi?

397
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,210
Could it be that he ran away in 
that short amount of time?

398
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,410
That's impossible.

399
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,580
There was only an instant.

400
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,600
<i>Even though I'm invisible right now, 
I can't hide my presence if I move.</i>

401
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,870
<i>I have to stay like this for a while.</i>

402
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,530
He isn't here...

403
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,360
Was he sent elsewhere?

404
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,410
Regardless, we're separated again...

405
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,980
However,

406
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,840
what happens twice will happen thrice.

407
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,080
We'll meet again, won't we?

408
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,180
<i>It's true... I have the same feeling.</i>

409
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,660
<i>But now I know for sure.</i>

410
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,070
<i>That it's impossible to convince her.</i>

411
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,650
<i>Which is why, the next time we meet,</i>

412
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,420
<i>it will be as enemies.</i>

413
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,060
Kill the Religious Organization
