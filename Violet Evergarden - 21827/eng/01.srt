1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,960
What's wrong?

2
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,080
I see your eyes.

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,710
It's the same color as your eyes.

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,680
When I saw it,

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,680
I felt something.

6
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,940
What is this feeling called?

7
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,310
<i>To Major Gilbert,</i>

8
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,680
<i>Today marks the 120th day of my hospitalization.</i>

9
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,730
<i>I have regained nearly all bodily function.</i>

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,570
<i>I still have some difficulty moving,
but not enough to impede a mission.</i>

11
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,570
<i>Requesting immediate return to duty.</i>

12
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,880
Somewhere in Enchaîné,
Capital of the Enciel Kingdom

13
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,640
<i>The girl's existence was kept tightly under wraps.</i>

14
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,140
Somewhere in Enchaîné,
Capital of the Enciel Kingdom

15
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,720
<i>Anyone who knew of her referred to her as a weapon—</i>

16
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,940
<i>as a wannabe human that fought whenever ordered,</i>

17
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,980
<i>a tool without a mind of her own.</i>

18
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,860
Colonel Hodgins?

19
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,860
Over here.

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,700
Right.

21
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,580
Sorry about that.

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,630
Violet!

23
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,590
You okay?

24
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,670
Are you hurt?

25
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,390
Where's the major?

26
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,680
Where's Major Gilbert?

27
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,270
He's not here.

28
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,560
Might I ask where he is?

29
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,770
Is he back home on leave?

30
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,110
How are his injuries now?

31
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,980
I believe he was gravely hurt as well.

32
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,870
Is he still alive?

33
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,540
He's...

34
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,410
You can be discharged now.

35
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,250
Colonel Hodgins came all the way to pick you up.

36
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,300
Well, there you have it.

37
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,760
Pardon me,

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,970
Colonel Hodgins.

39
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,720
Stand at ease, Violet.

40
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,850
I'm terribly sorry to report that I
couldn't remember your name and rank.

41
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,810
It's fine. Now take a seat.

42
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,190
But you recognized me, huh?

43
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,650
We met twice before—back at the training
barracks, and the night before the final battle.

44
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,320
Yeah, we did.

45
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,530
What were you doing?

46
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,040
Writing a report for Major Gilbert.

47
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,170
I was also told that putting pen to
paper would help with my recovery.

48
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,840
So, what about the major?

49
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,640
Relax, Violet.

50
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,770
I'm here because he asked me to come.

51
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,940
So he's alive and well.

52
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,150
The doctors told me we won the War.

53
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,410
What's his current assignment?

54
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,540
When should I regroup with him?

55
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,450
First things first, get dressed.

56
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,750
I'll get us a ride in the meantime.

57
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,250
Here are your belongings. They finally arrived.

58
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,260
They were apparently shipped
by mistake to a faraway army base.

59
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,260
The brooch...

60
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,270
Where's the emerald brooch?

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,690
This was all they found by
your side and in your quarters.

62
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,440
If it's not here, then I must look for it.

63
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,230
Violet!

64
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,900
It was a gift!

65
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,240
It was a gift from the major!

66
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,660
Very well.

67
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,660
I'll find it for you.

68
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,960
I promise.

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,710
But...

70
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,130
Anyway, you are to accompany me.

71
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,460
Those are his orders.

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,680
Orders?

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,930
Roger.

74
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,940
When will the major give me my next assignment?

75
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm afraid some missions
might be beyond me in this state.

76
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,950
Violet.

77
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,950
To celebrate your discharge.

78
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,450
I didn't know which you'd like, so I bought all three.

79
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,950
Which'll it be?

80
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,200
None of them.

81
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,460
Well, uh, let's say the world
will end if you don't pick one.

82
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,250
Pick now! Three... two...

83
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,540
The puppy, then.

84
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,750
Here you go!

85
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,480
Why the puppy?

86
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,820
The major's older brother once said I was "Gilbert's dog."

87
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
This journey will take a while.

88
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,990
The railroads in this area were
rendered useless by enemy bombings.

89
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,950
Have you ever been to Leiden?

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,830
No.

91
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,680
Violet...

92
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,310
You must live on...

93
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,770
and be free.

94
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,020
From the bottom of my heart...

95
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
There you are.

96
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,830
Colonel.

97
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,040
We can see the port of Leiden now.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,750
Port City Leiden,
Capital of Leidenschaftlich

99
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,730
Gilbert was really worried about your life after the war.

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,940
So he said he wanted to leave you
in the care of the Evergarden family,

101
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
the relatives he most trusted.

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,450
Once they were contacted, both Mr.
and Mrs. Evergarden agreed to take you in.

103
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,010
Welcome.

104
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,260
Come, Violet.

105
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,760
This is Mrs. Evergarden.

106
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,510
Say hello.

107
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,430
Uh, a polite bow would be enough.

108
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,520
What does it take, three days from Enchaîné now?

109
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,650
Yes. Normally, I'd be back within a day.

110
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,110
The War did last four whole years.

111
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,030
The infrastructure will take
a while to get back up to speed.

112
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,660
Come on, Violet.

113
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,830
Drink up.

114
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm so sorry! Don't push yourself!

115
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,630
Oh no!

116
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,760
You'll get a burn!

117
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,010
No need to worry.

118
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,010
I don't feel heat.

119
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,590
But we must cool your bandages off.

120
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,260
Bring us some ice, Oliver!

121
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,470
Right away, ma'am!

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
These arms are made from adamantine.

123
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,400
Uncouth as they may look, they're just as sturdy.

124
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,150
I'm not used to them yet, but I believe
they'll eventually feel like part of my body.

125
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,780
Could you come with me for a moment?

126
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,790
I used to wear these back when I was young.

127
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,920
Good idea.

128
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,790
Try them on.

129
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,130
They look great on you.

130
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,170
Truly.

131
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll take my leave now, then.

132
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,680
I must get back to the office.

133
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,560
Oh?

134
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Violet,

135
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,650
be a good girl and listen to Tiffany, okay?

136
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,770
It's fine.

137
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,690
No need to be so uptight.

138
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,650
Think of us as your real family.

139
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,450
You can talk to us about anything, all right?

140
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,910
I've never had a family,

141
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,200
so I don't need a new one.

142
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,460
Don't be like that.

143
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,420
We had a son, but we lost him in the War.

144
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,970
I can't be a replacement for your late son.

145
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,970
Violet.

146
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,470
Gilbert wants you to lead a life of happiness here.

147
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,980
So please...

148
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,480
You understand, right?

149
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,830
Why?

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,750
Why is Major Gilbert putting me here?

151
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,080
Is it because I've lost my arms and all value as a weapon?

152
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,960
With some training, I can fight again!

153
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,220
Violet, the war is over.

154
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,180
I'm the major's tool.

155
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,480
But if he no longer needs me,

156
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,980
I should be disposed of.

157
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,730
Please cast me aside.

158
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,980
Dump me somewhere.

159
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,660
Colonel Hodgins...

160
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,330
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

161
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,830
I quit the military.

162
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,250
I'm not a colonel anymore.

163
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,500
Then how should I address you?

164
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,010
"Boss," maybe?

165
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,970
I run this company here.

166
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,720
I bought an old mansion and renovated it some.

167
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,480
The ground floor is the reception.

168
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,480
Sir, if you could write down the
destination and the sender's address.

169
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,490
We'll need three days or so to complete the shipment.

170
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,660
The first floor has the office
and the ghostwriting department.

171
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,780
Ghostwriting?

172
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,490
Oh...

173
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,160
It's where we write letters and
the like as per the clients' requests.

174
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,960
Many people still can't write.

175
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,710
I couldn't either.

176
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,380
Not until the major taught me.

177
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,970
Is that so?

178
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,180
I was thinking of starting a business once the war ended,

179
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,390
and the government's postal
service isn't available to civilians yet,

180
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,100
so I figured this could work.

181
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,730
Anyway...

182
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,230
Here are your orders, Violet Evergarden.

183
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,400
Gilbert left you in my hands,

184
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,240
so I'll give you your orders in his stead.

185
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,740
You can still serve a purpose.

186
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,240
You can still work.

187
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,830
Right here.

188
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,750
Benedict.

189
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,920
The hell d'you want, Boss?

190
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,750
"What can I do for you, Boss," you mean!

191
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,880
Well? The hell d'you want?

192
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,510
Ow! What was that for?

193
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,630
You did that on purpose!

194
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,930
This is Benedict, a postman.

195
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,760
Sadly for me, we've been joined at the
hip since before I founded this company.

196
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,600
And, Benedict, this is Violet.

197
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,560
She'll be joining you as postman from today.

198
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,730
What? A kid like her?

199
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,820
Her ability to see a mission through is unmatched.

200
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,240
I have to hit up the banks,

201
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,570
so you show her the ropes.

202
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Your stuff goes in here.

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,960
Understood.

204
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,170
Your uniform.

205
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,590
Get changed.

206
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,840
Understood.

207
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,670
What are you—

208
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,920
Wait! Hold up!

209
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,010
Kinda baggy.

210
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,680
No problem.

211
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,640
Shouldn't you take your gloves off?

212
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,150
Would sorting the mail be hard for you?

213
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,990
No. It shouldn't pose a major problem.

214
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,820
Sort them by the street names written here

215
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,530
and put them in that shelf.

216
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,620
We always have a ton of packages to
go through, but you don't have to rush.

217
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,870
Also, there's a break room on the second floor.

218
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,620
Roger.

219
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,420
Later.

220
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,860
I'll be done with my assignment shortly.

221
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,150
You were at it the whole time?

222
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,860
Without taking any breaks?

223
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,450
I'm used to operations with long hours.

224
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,950
Then... Wanna try going on a delivery run next?

225
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,790
Delivery?

226
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,250
You take the mail to the address on the envelope.

227
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,170
Anyway, I'm leaving.

228
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,220
See you tomorrow.

229
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,230
"We'll consider an investment
depending on your results," huh?

230
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,940
Some company's running nighttime deliveries too?

231
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,950
We're nowhere near that yet.

232
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,280
Violet!

233
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,000
What are you doing?

234
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,620
A delivery run.

235
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,000
When I said a delivery run next, I meant tomorrow!

236
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,010
Also, please make sure to take breaks during work.

237
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,550
You just got out of the hospital.

238
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,260
It's not a problem.

239
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,680
Look, it <i>is</i> a problem.

240
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,270
Violet.

241
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,020
You may eat.

242
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,060
I will, thank you.

243
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,070
Once we're done here, I'll walk you to the office.

244
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,570
Only the attic's available,
but I set it up so you can sleep there.

245
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,080
Also, uh, the Evergarden family say
they're still willing to be your guarantors

246
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,080
until you become an adult.

247
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,500
But as for letting you live with them...

248
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,710
That part hit a snag, huh?

249
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:10,960
That hurt!
Come on! I was trying to break it to her gently!

250
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,920
Come on! I was trying to break it to her gently!

251
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,680
Why should I care?

252
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,050
See you tomorrow, then.

253
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,180
Let me walk you.

254
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,520
What were the last orders Gilbert gave you?

255
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,190
"Run away and live free."

256
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,860
Also... "I..."

257
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,950
Ever since you were little,
you'd spent your life in the military,

258
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,620
focusing only on completing your missions.

259
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,210
From now on, you'll broaden your
horizons and learn many new things.

260
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,590
But it might be easier to live a life of blissful ignorance.

261
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,060
You haven't realized that everything
you've done so far has sparked a flame

262
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,520
that is now burning you up.

263
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,440
But I'm not on fire.

264
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,940
Oh, you are.

265
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,740
No, I am not. You're not making any sense.

266
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,690
You are.

267
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,110
You most definitely are.

268
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,410
And yet, I looked the other
way and pretended I didn't see it.

269
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,670
So when Gilbert left you in my care,
I saw it as my chance to make amends.

270
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,300
You'll understand what I'm saying one day.

271
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,430
And, for the first time, you'll notice all your burn marks.

272
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,330
A Doll?

273
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,620
No, I'm Violet.

274
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,920
Well, uh, Miss Violet,

275
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,840
I'd like to request a ghostwriting.

276
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,590
A ghostwriting?

277
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,090
Yeah.

278
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,010
I can't write, you see.

279
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,770
So I'd like you to write a letter for me.

280
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,100
What should I write?

281
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,560
You want me to tell you here and now?

282
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,690
Is that a problem?

283
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,690
Well, er...

284
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,450
It's a letter to my childhood friend out in the country.

285
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,700
I heard there'll be marriage
talks between her and another man.

286
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,700
So...

287
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,740
I want you to tell her...

288
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,460
"You were the first person to ever be nice to me."

289
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,720
"You meant the world to me."

290
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,180
"For you, I was willing to do anything and everything."

291
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,180
Go!

292
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,480
"I want to know how you feel."

293
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,190
"I want to understand your thoughts."

294
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,990
"We may be far apart now,

295
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,660
but I..."

296
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,420
"I love you."

297
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,710
Is that all right?

298
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,630
Y-Yes!

299
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,970
"I love you."

300
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,390
Now, take this to the reception on the
ground floor and complete the mailing paperwork.

301
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:58,230
Thank you very much for using
our Auto Memoir Doll service, sir.

302
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,870
And?

303
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,870
Who might you be?

304
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,250
How could you tell?

305
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,210
Hm?

306
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,510
How could you understand that man's "I love you"?

307
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,510
You want to work with the Auto Memoir Dolls?

308
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,600
Yes.

309
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,230
I still have difficulty holding a
pen, but I am able to use a typewriter.

310
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,520
No, that's not it. I'm asking you why you want that work.

311
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,360
I want to know.

312
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,360
I want to know what "I love you" means.

313
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,620
After giving his final orders,

314
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,000
the major uttered those words to me.

315
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,920
That was the first time I had ever heard him say it.

316
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,670
I don't understand what state of mind it refers to.

317
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,800
I <i>can't</i> understand it.

318
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,850
Generally speaking,

319
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,060
understanding that is what makes an Auto Memoir Doll.

320
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,560
But...

321
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,810
Very well.

322
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,240
<i>After doing nothing but
following Gilbert's orders for so long,</i>

323
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,370
<i>she spoke for herself for the very first time.</i>

324
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,330
<i>The girl they called a tool without a mind of her own</i>

325
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,080
<i>wanted to know what "I love you" meant.</i>

326
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,510
I swear... I swear I won't let you die, Major!

327
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,100
Stop it.

328
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,980
That's enough!

329
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,570
You must live...

330
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,660
Violet...

331
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,580
You must live on...

332
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,000
and be free.

333
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,250
From the bottom of my heart...

334
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,890
I love you.

335
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,520
"I Love You" and Auto Memoir Dolls
