1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,480
Hey, get up.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,530
I found her on the northeastern front.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,160
Her name is... nothing yet.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,820
I've just been calling her "you."

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,740
Come on. Say hello.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,870
Don't be rough! She's just a child!

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,130
Gil, that's no child.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,630
That's a weapon.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,260
A weapon?

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,510
A tool of war, nothing more.

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,680
Got it. I'll take custody of her.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,310
Really? I'm glad you accept my gift.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,480
I've already cleared things with the army.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,200
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,910
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,670
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,050
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,970
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,020
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,610
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

21
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,490
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,870
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,040
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,710
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,470
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

26
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,760
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,020
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:15,030
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

29
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,660
Leidenschaftlich
Navy Department

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,490
I really must meet with Captain Dietfried Bougainvillea!

31
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,410
Like I said, he can't see you!

32
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,710
There is something I must confirm with him at once!

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,710
Give it a rest!

34
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,420
What's going on?

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,960
Captain!

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,380
We're terribly sorry.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,300
That girl refuses to leave without seeing you.

38
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,510
You're dismissed.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,390
If you don't want to die, leave.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,150
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,060
Captain.

42
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,690
Of course.

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,780
Still a weapon, nothing more.

44
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,530
Captain!

45
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,660
Is the major... Is Major Gilbert...

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,290
Is it true that he was killed in action?

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,290
You didn't know?

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,170
Gilbert is no longer...

49
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,670
It's a lie! I refuse to believe it!

50
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,170
I'm sure he's all right!

51
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,050
What's with that look on your face?

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,770
You were nothing but a tool to him.

53
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,690
You're nothing but a heartless instrument of war!

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,230
How could you possibly feel sorrow?

55
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,820
Why would you tell her?!

56
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,990
Well, I thought she was ready for the truth...

57
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,700
Are you stupid?!

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,950
You're always such a terrible judge of things!

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,580
And you still haven't learned
how a woman's heart works!

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,210
In any case, you'd better go look for her right now!

61
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,920
Yeah, I know.

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,030
Oh...

63
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,030
Young Master, and... who might that be?

64
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,790
Before we get to that,
get her a bath and change her clothes.

65
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,290
If I may ask, does the madam know?

66
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,540
She's over at the Leiden mansion now.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
No need to tell her.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,090
I'll simply be taking this girl in for a while.

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,880
This way.

70
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,140
Come on.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,430
Ow!

72
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,220
S-Stop that! It hurts!

73
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,010
Cut it out!

74
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,390
Young Master, I did what I could with her clothes,

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,480
but she wouldn't sit still.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,900
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

77
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,400
Feed her and then take her to the guest room.

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,400
Please.

79
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:13,960
You'll catch...

80
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,750
You'll catch a cold. Use a blanket.

81
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,010
Tomorrow will be even colder.

82
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,680
Hold it! Don't!

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,020
You mustn't go outside!

84
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,060
What's the matter?

85
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,730
I'm terribly sorry.

86
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,990
She's been looking for you ever since she awakened.

87
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,190
She didn't even eat.

88
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,580
I'm not bringing her to the frontlines.

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,330
She's too unstable.

90
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Why are you against it?
You do realize this is an order from the brass?

91
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,260
You watched her at the
training barracks too, didn't you?

92
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,720
Manslaughter is all she's good for.

93
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,350
Just take her with you.

94
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,720
But...

95
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,100
Don't get so worked up.

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,980
She's a girl with no family or friends.

97
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,900
Use her for all she's worth,
and when she no longer serves a purpose,

98
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,940
simply abandon her on the battlefield.

99
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,190
She's stillâ€”

100
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,740
Enough! Spare me your holier-than-thou attitude!

101
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,660
This is an order!

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,530
That is all.

103
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,720
The Gardariki Allied Army
began marching toward Bociaccia.

104
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,180
We immediately set up a defensive
line at the river before Capria, its capital,

105
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,720
and now we're locked in a battle of attrition.

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,440
Our troops number 30,000; the enemy's, 60,000.

107
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,940
They're holding out somehow,
but the enemy has now sent cannons to the frontlines.

108
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,440
The artillery fire has hurt command and control,

109
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,660
and there's a real chance our front may fall apart.

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,820
As such, Major Bougainvillea...

111
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,450
Sir?

112
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,950
I want you to lead a company behind
enemy lines and destroy their cannons.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,460
Yes, sir. I'll make sure this mission succeeds.

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,840
You stay here.

115
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,340
Don't move until I return.

116
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,760
Understand?

117
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,930
Everything's ready, Major.

118
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,050
I'll be right there.

119
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,820
Major.

120
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,150
Enemy patrol.

121
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,180
What the hell?

122
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,300
What's going on?

123
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,180
Enemy attack!

124
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,270
Alert Command!

125
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,770
Leidenschaftlich is attacking!

126
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,770
Send for reinforcements!

127
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,230
Captain! The enemy's drawing near!

128
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,900
Charge!

129
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,790
Yes?

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
You're...

131
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,050
Is... Is the major in?

132
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,050
The major is here, isn't he?

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,810
Young Master is...

134
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,250
"Gilbert Bougainvillea"...

135
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,750
It has the major's name.

136
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,170
Violet...

137
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,670
Your name is Violet.

138
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,510
You won't be a tool, but a person worthy of that name.

139
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,310
V... Vio... let?

140
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,940
You understood me?

141
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,980
May-jor. Vio-let.

142
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,490
That's right. You're Violet, and I'm the major.

143
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,200
May-jor?

144
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,000
May-jor.

145
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,880
I read it.

146
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,550
Good. You should learn how to write now.

147
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,590
Major. The re-port.

148
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,640
Right.

149
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
You did well to write this.

150
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,270
It'll serve as good practice,
so submit a report to me every day.

151
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,270
Got that?

152
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,650
I'll submit a re-port every day.

153
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,030
We couldn't locate or identify his body,
but we did find his dog tag in the rubble.

154
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,320
Young Master is...

155
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,700
Now the late Gilbert's soul can rest in peace.

156
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,160
And so, he was considered killed in action.

157
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,250
Gilbert is no longer...

158
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,880
It's Thanksgiving.

159
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,470
This city was under Gardariki
Army control for three years

160
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,140
and was only recently liberated.

161
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,390
Violet,

162
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,640
this is all down to you.

163
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,520
Thanksgiving here in Machtig customarily
entails giving gifts to those you're grateful to.

164
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,940
Violet...

165
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,160
Is there something you want?

166
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,830
Something I want?

167
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,370
That's right. Ask for anything.

168
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,540
I will, if that's your order.

169
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,040
It's not an order.

170
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,800
I want to show you my gratitude.

171
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,550
Gratitude?

172
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,800
Yes. You always fight so bravely...

173
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,890
Never mind.

174
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,850
Shall we walk?

175
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,150
Major.

176
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,450
What is appropriate for me to want?

177
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,570
Let's see...

178
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,040
A girl of your age might want a dress or an accessory.

179
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,540
Understood. I want a dress or an accessory.

180
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,190
What's wrong?

181
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,440
I see your eyes.

182
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,950
It's the same color as your eyes.

183
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,120
When I saw it,

184
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,870
I felt something.

185
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,630
What is this feeling called?

186
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,970
What do you think? It's a beautiful brooch, right?

187
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,430
Beau...

188
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,140
...tiful?

189
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,220
Indeed.

190
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,180
I didn't know that word.

191
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,440
Is it similar to the word "pretty"?

192
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,440
That's right.

193
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,660
Are you sure you didn't want one
the same color as your eyes instead?

194
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,240
Yes, this was the most beautiful.

195
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,830
I didn't know the word, so I haven't said it.

196
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,630
But I've thought your eyes are
beautiful from the first time we met.

197
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,640
Major?

198
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,310
May I have the brooch?

199
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,940
Yes.

200
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,750
Thank you.

201
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,670
Thank you.

202
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,930
Oberberg,
Western Front

203
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,470
Leidenschaftlich Army
Frontline Command

204
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,980
I heard the Gardarikis retreated
from their western base too.

205
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,690
Think we can go home by spring?

206
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,110
Let's all go home together.

207
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,240
Gilbert!

208
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,030
Long time no see!

209
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,910
Colonel Hodgins!

210
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,410
Don't call me that.

211
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,420
You know I have to. You're a superior officer.

212
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,130
There's that standoffish manner again.

213
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,750
It's strange how it seems almost
likeable when you haven't seen it in a while.

214
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,760
I see you haven't changed either, even as a colonel.

215
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,470
Well, I've been assigned to
fronts we could win without a fight.

216
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,480
Your family is a major contributor of war funds.

217
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,230
It's only natural that Army
HQ would take that into account.

218
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,730
That's why I don't exactly
feel great about my promotions.

219
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,940
Anyway, how've you been doing?

220
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,740
You eating okay?
Hope you've been getting enough sleep!

221
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,700
He's just messing around. Stand at ease.

222
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,540
He's older than me, but we were
in the same batch at officer school.

223
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,920
Is she the one from the training barracks?

224
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,840
You're still keeping her around?

225
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,680
It was her who charged in and drew
first blood during the battle at Capria, right?

226
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,680
People have started gossiping
about how she's "your weapon."

227
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,810
Aren't there other things you could have her do?

228
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,610
Wait, sorry. Er...

229
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,150
Violet.

230
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,360
She didn't have a name, so I gave her one.

231
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,370
Are you taking her along for the Intens liberation?

232
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,870
If this operation succeeds,
the enemy will fall apart once and for all.

233
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,290
This will likely be the final battle of this war.

234
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,080
Yeah.

235
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,130
You know, I'm thinking of quitting the army
and starting a company once this war ends.

236
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,680
A company?

237
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,180
I don't mind hiring you.

238
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,690
Can't say I enjoy the thought of working under you.

239
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,820
Then maybe I'll hire Violet instead.

240
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,570
Yeah...

241
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,240
That might be a good idea.

242
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,120
Assemble!

243
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,840
Major.

244
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,090
What is it?

245
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,970
Am I not needed anymore?

246
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,340
What are you talking about?

247
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,850
Will I be disposed of and transferred
into Colonel Hodgins's custody?

248
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,480
Will you not give me orders anymore?

249
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,900
You haven't done anything wrong.

250
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,780
The final battle is only a few hours away.

251
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,290
Let's talk about this some other time.

252
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,540
I'll detail the operation.

253
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,040
The enemy army's general HQ lies here in Intens.

254
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,380
It's a natural fortress surrounded by cliffs on all sides.

255
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,670
It'll be hard to breach their defenses from the front.

256
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,550
As such, we'll have a special unit open artillery fire first.

257
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,390
We'll take that chance to sneak into
Intens through the underground waterway,

258
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,810
charge into the cathedral,

259
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,230
and secure the enemy HQ.

260
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,320
Then we'll send up a signal flare telling our
allies to attack, and our mission will be complete.

261
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,280
Understood?

262
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes, sir!

263
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,410
T-minus five minutes to artillery fire.

264
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,910
Move out!

265
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,010
Commence artillery fire.

266
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,970
Commence artillery fire!

267
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,800
Fire!

268
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,740
Follow her lead!

269
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,830
All squads, sitrep!

270
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,380
Squad One, we lost three!

271
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,460
Squad Two is pretty much unhurt!

272
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,380
Squads Three and Four have
lost about half their members!

273
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,720
We're in bad shape!

274
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,010
All right!

275
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,350
Squads One and Two, secure the area
and keep enemy reinforcements at bay.

276
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,180
Everyone alive in Squads Three and Four
will come with me and take over the cathedral!

277
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,810
Let's go!

278
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,640
Yes, sir!

279
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,770
Fire!

280
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,690
Do your best, Gilbert.

281
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,990
Fire!

282
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,500
Major!

283
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,910
Circle around to the right!

284
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,730
All troops, charge!

285
00:21:45,780 --> 00:22:08,970
Major?

286
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:22,730
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

287
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:44,340
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

288
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:55,270
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

289
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:06,650
yasashisa de amitsuzuketa yurikago de asu e yukou
I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

290
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:12,990
hare no hi mo ame no hi ni mo
Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

291
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,080
anata wo mamoru tame ni
I will be there to protect you

292
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:29,010
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

293
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:34,140
namae no nai hana wa
A nameless flower

294
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,350
shizuka ni nemuru yo
Lies in peace
