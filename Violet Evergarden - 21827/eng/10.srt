1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,400
What are we gonna play today?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,360
Dunno.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,070
I'm bored of playing house.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,070
Me too.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,370
When are Mom's guests gonna leave?

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,080
I wish they'd leave already.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,000
Right?

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,340
What's going on there?

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,350
<i>A doll came walking toward us.</i>

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,890
<i>A really big doll.</i>

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,230
<i>And for some reason, it felt like bad news.</i>

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,030
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,750
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,510
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,880
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,810
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

17
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,850
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,450
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

19
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,320
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,700
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,880
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,550
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

23
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,310
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

24
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,600
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,850
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

26
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:17,860
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,370
Mom! Mom!

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,710
Miss, you mustn't!

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,920
I understand what you're saying...

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,290
...but this is important.

31
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,840
Yes, but...

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,540
Mom!

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,340
Anne, how many times must I tell
you to knock before entering a room?

34
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,720
Also, say your greetings.

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,310
Welcome.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,480
Pardon me, Mother.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,980
My...

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
Good.

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,570
So, what is it?

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Did you find another strange bug?

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,410
Please don't show me, though.

42
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,490
Not a bug!

43
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,910
A doll came walking!

44
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,950
A doll?

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,790
Milady.

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,630
She's here.

47
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,210
Oh, that kind of doll.

48
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,340
I forgot the appointment was today.

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,760
Show her in to the living room.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,970
Certainly, milady.

51
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,880
Hey!

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,850
I'm sorry, but we'll have to
talk about this some other time.

53
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,850
"Some other time"? What are
you going to do about this mansion?

54
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,520
It's too big for her to live in alone.
That's why we're offering to...

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,810
Please leave for today.

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Wait!

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,330
Anne.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,750
Be a good girl, all right?

59
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,710
Sorry to keep you waiting,

60
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,960
and thank you for coming all this way.

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,340
Please don't mention it.

62
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,300
It talked!

63
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,640
If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,100
Representing the Auto Memoir Doll service...

65
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,720
I knew it!

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,890
You <i>are</i> a doll!

67
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,100
Anne!

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,060
Excuse her.

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,900
It's okay.

70
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,610
I am Violet Evergarden.

71
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,110
Come, take a seat. Tea will be served soon.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,580
I hope you like it. Please help yourself.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,580
Thank you.

74
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,040
It drank!

75
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,340
What happens to the tea after it drinks it?

76
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,920
Anne...

77
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,180
It will soon be discharged from the
body and eventually return to the ground.

78
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,890
Anne!

79
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,720
Where are your manners?

80
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,640
Shall we begin?

81
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,350
I have been told our contract is seven days in length.

82
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,190
Yes. Let's begin right away.

83
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,860
Certainly. Where will we be working?

84
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,070
Well, shall we take it to the
sunroom? It's nice and bright there.

85
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,490
What are you doing?

86
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,540
I'm having her help me write some letters.

87
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,830
I could've done that for you!

88
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,880
But you can't use big words yet, can you?

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,250
I can, too!

90
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,260
Besides, Miss Violet here is
famously exceptional at writing letters.

91
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,930
Who are you writing to?

92
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,850
Well...

93
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,720
Someone very far away.

94
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,100
Far away?

95
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,600
Yes.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,810
These are very important letters.

97
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,440
Don't disturb us in the sunroom, all right?

98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Shall we, Miss Violet?

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,730
Certainly.

100
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,450
I've brought this typewriter with me.

101
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,740
That will do.

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,500
Understood.

103
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,880
I <i>knew</i> she was bad news!

104
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,010
Wow! She really is a doll!

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
Milady!

106
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,860
Mom...

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
Are you okay?

108
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm fine.

109
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,860
I'll be better right away.

110
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,780
Really?

111
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Really.

112
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,160
I know! I'll sing you a lullaby!

113
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,750
Thank you. But I'm a grown-up, so I'll be fine.

114
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,670
Hmm... Can I sleep with you, then?

115
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,550
Oh my. Didn't you grow out of afternoon naps?

116
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,100
Today's special.

117
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,390
Instead of that, Anne, could you entertain our guest?

118
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,230
I hate guests.

119
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,520
They take you away from me.

120
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm sorry, Anne.

121
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,240
But please bear with it for seven days.

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Be a good girl, all right?

123
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,670
Mother will be resting for a while.

124
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,010
Is that so?

125
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,800
She says she's a bit sleepy, is all.

126
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,800
While she's resting,

127
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,560
I'll entertain you.

128
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,810
I hate guests,

129
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,810
but you're okay since you're a doll.

130
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,650
And how will you entertain me?

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,780
Well, we could have a chat, play a game, or something.

132
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,410
Those aren't in the terms of my contract.

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
But...

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,830
I don't mind if it's just for a little while.

135
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,130
Let's play with this doll, then!

136
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:06,790
Sure.

137
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,600
A doll playing with a doll? Isn't that funny?

138
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,730
What do I do with this?

139
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,270
Talk or tend to it, obviously.

140
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,310
Start by saying hello.

141
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,360
Hello!

142
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,860
Hello.

143
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh, good day!

144
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,620
That was the doll talking!

145
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,620
I see.

146
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,580
I understand now.

147
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:51,130
Oh, you're a doll, so you've
always been the toy and not the player.

148
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,170
No, I...

149
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,670
I'll teach you!

150
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,720
We'll play house next.

151
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
There's a table on the lawn.

152
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,140
Excuse me.

153
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,350
Your room is ready, so allow me to show you there.

154
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,020
Sure.

155
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,520
See you later, miss.

156
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,690
The room is on the second floor.

157
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,540
What could they be talking about?

158
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,670
Eris!

159
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,880
I'll take it to them!

160
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,090
No, you won't.

161
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,130
This is my job.

162
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,380
Please don't take it from me.

163
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,350
Sheesh.

164
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,810
Why must nothing in life ever go right?

165
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,430
Yes?

166
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,850
It's me, Anne.

167
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,430
Please come in.

168
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,140
Is something the matter?

169
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,690
What are you doing?

170
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,610
Tuning my hand.

171
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,440
Tuning?

172
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes, tuning it to work as it should.

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,700
Does that mean you'll be
writing letters again tomorrow?

174
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,820
Yes.

175
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,280
And the day after that?

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes.

177
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
You're here for seven days,
so the day after that and the day after <i>that</i>?

178
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,160
Yes.

179
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,710
Who are you writing to?

180
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,170
I'm afraid I cannot tell you.

181
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,210
Why?

182
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,050
Client confidentiality.

183
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,670
Confiden...?

184
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,050
Stop using big words all the time!

185
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,800
Forgive me.

186
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,100
It can't be Father.

187
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,430
I mean, he's gone.

188
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,140
Remember that huge war?

189
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,150
He fought in it and died an honorable death.

190
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,400
Tell me. Who are you writing to?

191
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,030
Miss, didn't you come here for a reason?

192
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,830
A reason?

193
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,870
Eris left, and Mom's asleep now...

194
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,170
Shouldn't you be going to bed too, then?

195
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,760
Why?!

196
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,840
Staying up late is a lady's worst enemy.

197
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,010
That's what Cattleya told me.

198
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,140
Who?

199
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,850
Another of our Dolls.

200
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,560
There's another one?

201
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,980
Yes.

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,560
We have others too. They're called Erica and Iris.

203
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,030
Wow! Are there really so
many dolls that move by themselves?

204
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,450
That's right.

205
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,280
Miss?

206
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,910
Fine! I'll go to bed!

207
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,160
You'd better do the same, or Mom will yell at you!

208
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,710
Besides, if you stay up late,
evil ghosts will come to get you!

209
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,010
Good night, miss.

210
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,430
Good night!

211
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,860
What a weird doll.

212
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,080
"Then, the thief screamed, 'Whoa!'

213
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,330
And he ran away in fear."

214
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,830
You're pretty good at reading.

215
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,670
Violet!

216
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,840
What kind of pancake is
really hard and impossible to eat?

217
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,970
They're all edible once doused in syrup.

218
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,810
Violet!

219
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,810
Until Mom gets here, solve riddles, dance, play house,

220
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,310
and catch bugs...

221
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,360
Miss.

222
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Please sort them in order of priority.

223
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,440
Violet.

224
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,400
Read to me.

225
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,030
Violet!

226
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,700
Violet!

227
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,160
Will this do?

228
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,250
Yes, it's perfect.

229
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,210
I'll write along these lines, then.

230
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,130
Thank you.

231
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,720
Anne.

232
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,980
N-No, I just wanted Violet to tie my ribbon.

233
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,270
I see. But save it for later.

234
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,360
Madam, may I have a short break?

235
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,740
I'm sure the young miss would
prefer her ribbon tied right away.

236
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,870
All done, miss.

237
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,040
It wasn't really you I wanted to tie my ribbon.

238
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,460
Right.

239
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,420
I really wanted Mom to do it.

240
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,710
Right.

241
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,090
It's the same for reading,
solving riddles, and playing house.

242
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,590
Mom hates bugs, so I'll give up on that.

243
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,180
Stop taking away the time
Mom and I spend together, Violet!

244
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,600
I'll be gone in a few days.

245
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,600
Then tell her I can be there
while you're writing the letters!

246
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,360
I wanna be by her side!

247
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,650
I just wanna be there and hold her hand tight! Please!

248
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your request.

249
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,370
But why?

250
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,830
Excuse me, miss.

251
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,700
I must return to work.

252
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,840
Do you think we can finish today?

253
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,010
If we maintain this pace, yes.

254
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,930
Please review this, Madam.

255
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,680
Madam?

256
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,890
I'm fine.

257
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,270
Milady!

258
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
I'm fine.

259
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,650
But...

260
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,980
Please keep going.

261
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,440
That's enough!

262
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,610
Miss?
Mom!

263
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,490
Please stop already!

264
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,360
Anne?

265
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,660
I'm fine, so could you stay inside?

266
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,370
Why? Why must you write these letters?

267
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,830
Who are you writing them to?

268
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,000
Dad's gone!

269
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,920
They're very important letters.

270
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,010
They're for someone I don't know, right?

271
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,720
Someone who doesn't even visit when you're sick!

272
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,600
There's nobody out there who's truly worried about you!

273
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,730
Are these letters more important than me?

274
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,700
Nothing's more important to me than you, Anne.

275
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,570
You're always full of lies.

276
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,870
I'm not lying.

277
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,250
Then why aren't you getting any better at all?

278
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,370
You said you'd be better right away!

279
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,790
I will.

280
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,050
I know that you're...

281
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm going to be all alone when you're gone!

282
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,890
How much longer do I have with you?!

283
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,350
If I'm going to be left all alone forever soon,

284
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,980
then forget about the letters
and spend this time with me!

285
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,980
Be with me!

286
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,150
Mom!

287
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,400
Miss.

288
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,860
Mom!

289
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,870
Miss!

290
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,320
Miss.

291
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,740
I'm taking the time you can spend
with your mother away for a good reason.

292
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,120
Please don't be angry at her.

293
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,710
But... But...

294
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,380
It's only natural that this would be painful for you.

295
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,550
You're already carrying the burden of
your mother's illness on your frail body.

296
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,510
You're a wonderful girl.

297
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm not!

298
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,140
I'm not...

299
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,100
I made Mom cry!

300
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,020
No, you are a very gentle girl.

301
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,440
You're wrong.

302
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,360
I am not.

303
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,490
You're wrong!

304
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,700
You're wrong! You're wrong!

305
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,200
Mom fell sick because I'm a bad girl!

306
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,490
You had nothing to do with it.

307
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,330
You're wrong! You're wrong!

308
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,460
You're wrong!

309
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,790
There was nothing anybody could have done.

310
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,670
You're wrong!

311
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:38,760
Just as nothing can ever make my
arms have skin and be soft like yours,

312
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,390
nothing can be done about this.

313
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,400
Mom... Mom...

314
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,070
Why do you write those letters?

315
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,490
Because everyone has feelings
they want to deliver to someone.

316
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,910
Who cares about that?

317
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,290
They don't have to be!

318
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,960
No letter that could be sent
deserves to go undelivered, miss.

319
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,730
<i>And then, the doll that embraced me</i>

320
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,400
<i>finished writing her letters and said goodbye one day.</i>

321
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,660
Violet.

322
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,720
Miss.

323
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,090
Huh?

324
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,810
You're warm.

325
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,640
Wait, are you...

326
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,060
Then what happens to the tea you drink?

327
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,520
As I said,

328
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,860
it will soon be discharged from the
body and eventually return to the ground.

329
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,950
<i>She was no doll. </i>

330
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,710
<i>She wasn't bad news either.</i>

331
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,460
<i>She was a kind and gentle person.</i>

332
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,880
<i>I wish I could've read the letters she wrote.</i>

333
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,180
<i>I wonder who they were for. </i>

334
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,560
Anne.

335
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,430
Come, let's have tea.

336
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,190
Mom, let's play with this doll!

337
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,860
Sure.

338
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,230
And then read books, play house...

339
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,040
<i>Anne. </i>

340
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,000
<i>Anne.</i>

341
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,180
<i>My dear Anne.</i>

342
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,780
<i>Anne.</i>

343
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,790
<i>"Dear Anne,</i>

344
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,670
<i>happy eighth birthday.</i>

345
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,630
<i>I'm sure there are many things that make you sad.</i>

346
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,630
<i>You may be crumbling under
the weight of your responsibilities.</i>

347
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,220
<i>But don't give in.</i>

348
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,720
<i>Even if you're so lonely that it makes you cry,</i>

349
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,930
<i>please don't forget</i>

350
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,720
<i>that Mom loves you always."</i>

351
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,600
<i>"Dear Anne,</i>

352
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,190
<i>happy tenth birthday.</i>

353
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,650
<i>You must have grown up and gotten much taller.</i>

354
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,450
<i>But I'm sure you still love
reading and dancing just as much.</i>

355
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,910
<i>Have you grown out of the riddles and bugs yet?"</i>

356
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,750
<i>"Happy eighteenth birthday.</i>

357
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>You're a lady now.</i>

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,840
<i>Have you fallen in love with someone?</i>

359
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,760
<i>I'm afraid I can't give you any relationship advice,</i>

360
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,220
<i>but I'm sure anyone you choose would
have to be a truly wonderful person."</i>

361
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,730
<i>"Happy birthday, Anne.</i>

362
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,980
<i>You've lived twenty whole years now! That's incredible!</i>

363
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,990
<i>I hope you know that it's okay to
cry once in a while, even as an adult.</i>

364
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,030
<i>Whenever you're anxious or afraid,
remember that I'll always be here.</i>

365
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,540
<i>Anne,</i>

366
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,750
<i>I'll always and forever be watching over you."</i>

367
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,110
Welcome back.

368
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,110
That's a lot of letters.

369
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,990
They're letters set to be delivered to
Anne Magnolia over the next fifty years.

370
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,660
You wrote fifty?!

371
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,500
And you hadn't been on a house
call in a while, too. Were you all right?

372
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,370
It wasn't a problem.

373
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,580
But this is a wonderful idea.

374
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,460
I'm already excited to see them be delivered every year.

375
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,380
I am too, but...

376
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,090
By the time they are,

377
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,970
the mother will be gone,
and her daughter, still so young,

378
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,480
and so quick to get lonely,

379
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,060
will have been left behind by
the mother she loves so much.

380
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,820
She'll be all alone in that huge mansion.

381
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,280
I...

382
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,330
I was fighting back tears the entire time I was there.

383
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,790
Yeah?

384
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,840
But, Violet,

385
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,840
she will receive the letters you wrote.

386
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,770
Besides, no matter how far apart they may be...

387
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,810
"Loved Ones Will Always Watch Over You"

388
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:17,030
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

389
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:38,640
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

390
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:49,560
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

391
00:25:49,940 --> 00:26:00,950
yasashisa de amitsuzuketa yurikago de asu e yukou
I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

392
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:07,290
hare no hi mo ame no hi ni mo
Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

393
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,380
anata wo mamoru tame ni
I will be there to protect you

394
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,970
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

395
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,310
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

396
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:28,440
namae no nai hana wa
A nameless flower

397
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,650
shizuka ni nemuru yo
Lies in peace
