1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
Justitia Province,
Nation of Astraea

2
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,420
Hey, Leon! Look!

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,590
Women from all across the
continent are headed our way!

4
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,430
They're just ghostwriters.

5
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,260
You mean Auto Memoir Dolls.

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,520
Beautiful women who write
beautiful prose for their clients alone.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,060
Hmph. They're dolled up for one reason:

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,980
because it's a profession full of women
who hope to one day marry into money.

9
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,660
<i>If called upon, these women will go anywhere in the world</i>

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,700
<i>to hawk their so-called ghostwriting skills.</i>

11
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,790
<i>At first, I despised that Doll
profession for no discernible reason—</i>

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,760
<i>so much that I was taken
aback by how much it annoyed me.</i>

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:21,140
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,850
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

15
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:34,610
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

16
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,990
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

17
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,910
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

18
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:49,960
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

19
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,550
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

20
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,430
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

21
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,810
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

22
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,980
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

23
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,650
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

24
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,410
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

25
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,710
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

26
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,960
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:39,970
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

28
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,280
Violet.

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,900
Long time no see!

30
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,650
You doing all right?

31
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,240
Miss Bluebell, Miss Iberis...

32
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,620
Luculia.

33
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,290
Hey, Violet. The letters you ghostwrote for
the Princess of Drossel were simply magical.

34
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,460
They really were.

35
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,460
I read the news articles too. I'm proud
to count you among my acquaintances.

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,670
What's up?

37
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,970
Nothing. Thank you.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,590
Are you all right?

39
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,140
You seem rather down.

40
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,310
Violet...

41
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,360
Uh, ladies.

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm Le Verrier, chief of the Shaher
Astronomy HQ in Justitia Observatory.

43
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,740
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Our Shaher Astronomy HQ,

45
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:59,380
as you can see, also has a library housing
astronomy literature from all eras and places.

46
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,550
Our Manuscript Department spends
each day keeping every book in tip-top shape,

47
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,270
and if any get too worn out, they
make a fresh copy for preservation.

48
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,890
It is a highly important task.

49
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,900
Now, if that were the only work we
faced, they could handle it all themselves.

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:26,410
But last month, we received a great number
of extremely rare but poorly maintained books.

51
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,160
Some of them threatened to crumble
if you turned so much as a single page.

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,050
We have here eighty of you Auto Memoir Dolls
and eighty men from the Manuscript Department.

53
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,220
You will form pairs with one member from each side,

54
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,800
dictate the contents of the books, and write new copies.

55
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,890
You have two weeks.

56
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,300
These books are irreplaceable

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,560
and are of great worth to us
and many generations to come,

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,310
so your assistance is greatly appreciated.

59
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,810
Uh...

60
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,320
Next, Kyle Zoenig

61
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,990
and Miss Iberis Konoue from Fujimi Postal.

62
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,450
Looking forward to working with you, sir.

63
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,620
Y-Yeah, likewise.

64
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,120
Next, Leon Stephanotis

65
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,590
and Miss Violet Evergarden from C.H. Postal.

66
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,640
It is a pleasure to meet you.

67
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,770
If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

68
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,150
Representing the Auto Memoir Doll service,

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,450
I am Violet Evergarden.

70
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,120
Sir?

71
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,000
What's wrong, Leon?

72
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,170
U-Uh...

73
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,590
Nothing, really.

74
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,010
Next...

75
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't bother. Just stay seated.

76
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,730
Pardon me.

77
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,520
It's fine.

78
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,900
First off,

79
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,780
we'll go with this book, written
in a common classical language.

80
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,780
It begins with records of a
sighting of Alley's Comet 400 years ago.

81
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,660
Alley's Comet?

82
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,950
That's right.

83
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,420
It's a periodic comet that
appears around once every 200 years.

84
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,420
We estimate that it'll be
visible from this observatory soon.

85
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,300
Understood.

86
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,680
Let's begin, then.

87
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,430
Okay.

88
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,930
Just so you know, I dictate very quickly.

89
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,430
If your typing can't keep up,

90
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,100
you won't be of use—

91
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,900
I am perfectly aware.

92
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,690
Th-Then let's see what you've got.

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,660
"An arrow of light in the great dark sky,

94
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,950
its long tail slicing Barbarossa's neck in two.

95
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,410
According to Ariadna, an astrologist,

96
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,000
'The arrow of light is an ill omen.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Once its shining light passes,

98
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,300
disease will abound, and the
king's demise will rock the country.'

99
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,010
Likewise, the arrow of light
also pierced through Barbarossa,

100
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,140
and it was almost as though his
body and soul were ripped apart...

101
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,600
If Ariadna is to be believed, the
arrow of light has appeared before.

102
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,360
And it signifies the Fairy King, Reinhard, taking a wife.

103
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,820
Of those fortunate enough to die beneath its light,

104
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
the women become Reinhard's consorts,

105
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,200
and the men become
offerings for the celebratory banquet.

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,090
As such, that parting is not a tragedy.

107
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,470
In the fairy kingdom, a land of eternity,

108
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,600
they will be bestowed new vessels in
which their souls will live on for all of time."

109
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,600
Please keep going.

110
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,860
R-Right. I guess you can keep up.

111
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,530
"However, the deaths of those fortunate
ones still cause panic among the populace.

112
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,110
All who see the arrow of light..."

113
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,450
Let's call it a day.

114
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,210
144.

115
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,290
Sir,

116
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,290
we completed about three days' work today.

117
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,670
You are an exemplary scribe.

118
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,670
Oh, really.

119
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,680
You all have done splendidly today.

120
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,680
We even have a pair who have made
three days' worth of progress already.

121
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,060
Please keep up the excellent
work for the remainder of the job.

122
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,150
Say...

123
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,700
How can you be fine after all that writing you did today?

124
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,030
It isn't all that exhausting compared to the travel.

125
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,420
It is our job as Dolls to go
anywhere, any time a client calls upon us.

126
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,300
Most of our year is spent on all
kinds of travel, suitcase in hand.

127
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,300
Then why are you working such a hard job?

128
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,140
Because it is a role I can fulfill.

129
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,520
At first, I thought of it as a mission.

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,150
But now I believe that this work—whether it
means expressing the feelings and desires of my clients,

131
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,200
or even taking in and transcribing the
thoughts of authors from days long past—

132
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,910
is, in these and many other ways,
a very special and wonderful thing.

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,250
I guess.

134
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,380
Am I really fit to have such a wonderful job?

135
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,270
What are you trying to say?

136
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,810
That we feel sorry for you, having Leon as a partner.

137
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,280
He has a real annoying personality, doesn't he?

138
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,780
He's an orphan who couldn't even
work here if not for Shaher's donation funds.

139
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,870
A lovely girl like you is wasted on him.

140
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,450
So come see us once you're done with work.

141
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm an orphan too.

142
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,790
Also...

143
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,920
I haven't lived the kind of
proper life you seem to have assumed.

144
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
I only learned to read and
write in the past few years, too.

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,260
If one's birth or upbringing places a
restriction on who they can speak to,

146
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,430
then I believe you should stay away from me.

147
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,720
Well, it's different for you. Right?

148
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,390
Yeah. You know, his mother...

149
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,770
I don't even know what my parents look like.

150
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,030
You're sticking up for him
because you're his partner, right?

151
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,030
No.

152
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,200
I am merely stating the facts.

153
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,700
Let's go. We're not getting through to her.

154
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,340
Sir, did you find the book you were looking for?

155
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,250
Yeah, I did.

156
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,010
Are you upset?

157
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,550
I'm not upset.

158
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,010
This is just how I look.

159
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,890
I...

160
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,350
I'm often told I'm expressionless.

161
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,350
This is just how I look.

162
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,440
We're somewhat alike, aren't we?

163
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,660
What do you think she said then?

164
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,240
"You're a cute one."

165
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,790
How can I not ask her to stargaze with me?!

166
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,670
Hey, you listening to me?

167
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,920
Leon?

168
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,300
Let's both do our best.

169
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,430
For the four days they're still around.

170
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,900
It's lunchtime.

171
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,230
Why don't you eat with everyone else?

172
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,110
It's a habit.

173
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,780
You are most defenseless when eating or sleeping.

174
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
You don't react as quickly to enemies.

175
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,830
Enemies?

176
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,210
I used to be a soldier.

177
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,710
A soldier?

178
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,790
Is that strange?

179
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,170
I-It is!

180
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,010
You're clearly an ordinary girl!

181
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,340
Ordinary?

182
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,090
Yeah.

183
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,760
An ordinary... girl.

184
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,600
Don't you want to see it?

185
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,940
It's a 200-year cycle, so you won't
get another chance in your lifetime!

186
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,190
Uh, I mean Alley's Comet.

187
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,860
The comet covered in that book from the first day?

188
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,030
That's right.

189
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,740
D...

190
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,360
Don't you want to see it?

191
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,490
I...

192
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,490
It's an extraordinarily beautiful sight!

193
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,120
Yes, I would love to.

194
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,460
Really?!

195
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,540
Then I'll pick you up in front of the
quarters at 2 AM, three days from now.

196
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,250
Wait for me there.

197
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,700
Sit down here.

198
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,500
That's Alley's Comet.

199
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,460
A comet's tail is most clearly
visible in the eastern sky before sunrise.

200
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,670
Sir?

201
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,260
It's fine.

202
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,260
Don't be shy.

203
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,310
Have some soup.

204
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,150
You're a really nice person.

205
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,280
D-Don't be stupid! I'm not nice!

206
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,530
Also, I'm not good with women.
I'm always cold to them, and you're no exception.

207
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,410
Do you remember all those
things they said in the library?

208
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

209
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,130
They were telling the truth.

210
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,250
Both about me and my family.

211
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,760
My mother was a traveling performer.

212
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,760
She toured the world, putting her
singing and dancing talents on show.

213
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,400
And then, she fell in love with a man
of this town and had a child with him.

214
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,650
That child was me.

215
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,780
Looking back, I think it was a good, happy family.

216
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,910
But one day, my father vanished.

217
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,790
He'd been in charge of Shaher's manuscript acquisition,

218
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,410
and he would travel across the
continent collecting rare books.

219
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,670
It wasn't unusual for his work
to take him to dangerous places.

220
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,920
And in the midst of one such trip,

221
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,010
we lost all contact with him.

222
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,930
Two years passed, and the search was called off.

223
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,430
Mom!

224
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,220
Leon!

225
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,560
Just wait, Leon! I promise to come back with Dad!

226
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,230
No!

227
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,730
Don't go, Mom!

228
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,610
Mom!

229
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,860
Mom...

230
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,370
She loved my father more than anyone,
so it must've been an easy choice for her.

231
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,370
I don't know if my wellbeing
never crossed her mind or what.

232
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,630
I learned back then that love
reduces people to bumbling fools.

233
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,800
That's why I...

234
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,850
Your mother was very important to you, wasn't she?

235
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,100
What about you?

236
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't have any blood relations.

237
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,610
But there was one man who
took care of me for a long time.

238
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,610
We're separated now, though.

239
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,540
Being apart from him must make you lonely.

240
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,580
I don't understand how it feels to be lonely.

241
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,590
Even if I know what the emotion entails,

242
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,510
I can't tell if I'm feeling it.

243
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,430
Are you serious?

244
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,260
I don't lie.

245
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,100
Then...

246
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,140
Do you sometimes think back to him?

247
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,190
Always.

248
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,610
I always do.

249
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,740
Does your heart feel heavier
the more days you spend apart?

250
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,700
It does.

251
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,070
That's loneliness.

252
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,870
That's loneliness?

253
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,670
So being away from him made me feel lonely...

254
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:04,930
What if, while we're still working together,
you receive word that he's in serious danger?

255
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,400
Even if you go, there's no telling if you can save him.

256
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,900
Would you still rush to his aid?

257
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,530
Sorry. I guess I put you on the spot.

258
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,200
No. That isn't what gave me pause.

259
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,990
I wouldn't even have a choice in the matter.

260
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,450
I just wasn't sure how I'd apologize to you.

261
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,960
He means the world to me.

262
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,460
I would rather die than lose him.

263
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,310
Man, that's a shocker.

264
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,480
I didn't think you were the type to say such things.

265
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,860
Is that so?

266
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,110
That's like...

267
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,110
Almost like...

268
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,660
I see now! You love—

269
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,910
Look. I think that comet's tail has grown longer.

270
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,130
Well, Violet? Can you see it?

271
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,880
I can.

272
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,380
I've never felt the stars so close to me before.

273
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,010
Forget the stars! The comet!

274
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,760
We'll never see it again.

275
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,100
It's a once-in-a-lifetime encounter!

276
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,310
Yes, I am watching it.

277
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,980
It's marvelous.

278
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,410
"That parting is not a tragedy.

279
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,240
In the fairy kingdom, a land of eternity,

280
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,170
they will be bestowed new vessels in
which their souls will live on for all of time."

281
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,220
Thank you all so much!

282
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,550
Thanks!

283
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,720
Take care on the way back!

284
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,970
Thanks for having us!

285
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,730
Come back sometime!

286
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,940
Sir, it wasn't for long,

287
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,190
but thanks for having me.

288
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,690
Sure.

289
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,700
Violet.

290
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,450
Yes?

291
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,330
I...

292
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,960
I'm in the Manuscript Department now, but I actually
always wanted to work in Acquisition like my dad.

293
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,710
I felt that as long as I waited here,
my mother would come back with him one day,

294
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,800
and so I grew up holed away in here.

295
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,970
This place made it possible,

296
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,970
and that's what I wanted.

297
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,480
But I've changed my mind now.

298
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,230
I'm going to tour the continent like you.

299
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,980
I may run into danger.

300
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,240
I may even lose my life.

301
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,740
But that's the path I want to walk.

302
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,950
Right.

303
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,910
And then,

304
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,830
one day, we might meet again
somewhere, under a starry sky.

305
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,540
We're fellow travelers, after all,

306
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,290
Violet Evergarden!

307
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,960
Right.

308
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,560
When we do, would you gaze at the stars again with me?!

309
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,020
Would you, Violet Evergarden?

310
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,740
<i>I don't know what the odds are
of seeing her again on my travels.</i>

311
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,000
<i>Are they as astronomical as the
odds of seeing that comet again?</i>

312
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,500
<i>Even if they are, I won't hesitate anymore.</i>

313
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:06,220
<i>Because she gave me the courage to take the
first step beyond the door that had locked me away.</i>

314
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:16,060
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

315
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,640
<i>And one day, for sure...
