1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,810
Major!

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,980
I'm... okay...

3
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,090
Major!

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,920
Run away.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,760
Leave me... and run!

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,470
I can't do that! I'm taking you with me!

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,470
Forget me...

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,100
I won't! If you're staying here, I'll stay with you and fight!

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,730
If you want to run away,
I'll take you with me and run away!

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Violet!

11
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,630
I swear... I swear I won't let you die, Major!

12
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,260
Stop it.

13
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,140
That's enough!

14
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,730
You must live...

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,820
Violet...

16
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,450
You must live on...

17
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,160
and be free.

18
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,420
From the bottom of my heart...

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,050
I love you.

20
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,180
"Love"?

21
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,690
What is that?

22
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,360
What is...

23
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,820
What is love?

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,530
I don't understand!

25
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,910
I don't understand it, Major!

26
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,000
I knew you'd be here.

27
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,340
It was a truly horrible battle.

28
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,220
After your unit sent up the signal flare,

29
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,430
the rest of us charged in.

30
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:11,480
Sensing defeat, the Gardariki Army
bombed their own HQ before retreating.

31
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,190
You were found at the foot of that staircase.

32
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:24,070
He must've pushed you down to save
your life right as the explosion happened.

33
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,750
While I was hospitalized,
everyone I asked said that the major was fine.

34
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,210
We couldn't tell you.

35
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,800
You were more concerned about him than yourself.

36
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
Let's go,

37
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,270
Violet.

38
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,560
Where to?

39
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,570
I will only go where the major is.

40
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,110
We're heading back to the office.

41
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,120
You're one of our Auto Memoir Dolls, remember?

42
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,630
Fine, then. I'll stay here too.

43
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,210
I'm not leaving until you come back with me.

44
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,090
He entrusted me with you, after all.

45
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,270
Right before that battle, he came to visit me and said...

46
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,270
Should anything happen to me, take care of Violet.

47
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,570
Take her to the Evergarden
family in Leiden after the war is over.

48
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,820
Gilbert?

49
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,870
Please.

50
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,750
He definitely didn't see you as a tool of warfare.

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,380
He was worried about your future as an ordinary girl.

52
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,480
Hey, uh...

53
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,860
Sorry I dragged you into the car.

54
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,940
You okay?

55
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,360
You are okay, right?

56
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,750
Around the time you got discharged,
I wasn't sure if things would work out.

57
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,250
But you learned how to work as a Doll,

58
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,590
and you put everything you had into it.

59
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,470
You're fully capable of living
now, even without his orders.

60
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,140
Will you not give me orders anymore?

61
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,690
You haven't done anything wrong.

62
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,690
Let's talk about this some other time.

63
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,750
The road's blocked off.

64
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,500
Colonel!

65
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,000
I've quit the army...

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Never mind. At ease!

67
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,420
Sir!

68
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,010
Did something happen?

69
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,050
The town of Caisseclaire was
attacked by Gardariki's anti-peace faction.

70
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,850
I'd heard that the opposition had
grown stronger, but I didn't expect this.

71
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,850
What's the situation?

72
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,730
We suppressed the attack, but the town and
its surroundings still have to be on high alert.

73
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,280
Let's take another route.

74
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,030
Got it.

75
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,720
Violet's back, right?

76
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,390
Seems like it.

77
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,220
She'll be coming back to work too, right?

78
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,350
Go see how she's doing.

79
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,100
Why don't you go?

80
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,480
Someone of your kind would be better.

81
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,610
What's that supposed to mean?

82
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,780
I'm preoccupied here!

83
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,110
Benedict.

84
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,910
Could you go look around District 12?

85
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,500
I'll try District 14.

86
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,290
Is something wrong?

87
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,380
A new delivery boy dumped the
letters he couldn't deliver on time.

88
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,510
So we have to go find them.

89
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,340
Don't worry. We know where to look, more or less.

90
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,860
Violet. I know you're in there.

91
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,410
Could I see you? Just for a bit.

92
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,080
I'm sorry to have worried you.

93
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,250
How's your health? Are you eating all right?

94
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,390
I'm leaving some snacks for you here, okay?

95
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,680
Do you think you can come in to work tomorrow?

96
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,980
Everyone's waiting for you, and we've got
tons of requests with your name on them.

97
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,940
I...

98
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,950
As President Hodgins said, I'm burning up

99
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,030
in the flames of what I've done.

100
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,210
You'll understand what I'm saying one day.

101
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,790
And, for the first time, you'll notice all your burn marks.

102
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,090
Why would you say that to her?

103
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,260
Considering her circumstances,
what else could she have done?!

104
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,810
Regardless of the circumstances,
regardless of how it happened or why,

105
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,390
the things she did can never be undone.

106
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,270
Then she can forget about it and start overâ€”

107
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,860
You know she won't be able to forget.

108
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,570
She's not the only one burning up.

109
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,820
So are you and I.

110
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,950
Even the burns that may seem to
have faded have left a mark deep down.

111
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,170
Then what is she to do?

112
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,750
That's for her to decide

113
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,260
after she faces up to her burning body and accepts it.

114
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,140
But she lost her major.

115
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,060
She lost everything.

116
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,890
It's okay.

117
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,900
She hasn't.

118
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,400
She hasn't lost anything.

119
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,650
Now Cattleya's not coming back.

120
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,330
I'll go check on Violet tomorrow.

121
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,750
We should probably leave her be for a while.

122
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,000
But...

123
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,630
I want to know what "I love you" means.

124
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,010
I became a Doll because I wanted
to know what his "I love you" meant.

125
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,100
Should we really just leave her be?

126
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,900
What if she quits being a Doll?

127
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,360
I'd like to request a ghostwriting.

128
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,350
Major...

129
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,190
What's the matter?

130
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,830
Violet.

131
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,630
Major... Major!

132
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,590
You're all right!

133
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,550
What's with your outfit?

134
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,310
I'm currently working as an Auto Memoir Doll.

135
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,770
You are?

136
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,190
Yes. I ghostwrite letters.

137
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,020
Letters?

138
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,150
With your bloodstained hands
that have taken countless lives...

139
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,080
Major?

140
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,210
...you write letters that bring people together?

141
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Major?

142
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,600
Major... Major...

143
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,600
What am I supposed to do?

144
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,110
Your orders... Please give me your orders!

145
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,460
Letter delivery,

146
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,880
Violet Evergarden.

147
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,350
It's for you.

148
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,980
Erica and Iris asked me to deliver it.

149
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,740
The letter has been duly received. See you.

150
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,370
You have more deliveries this late?

151
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,250
Yeah. We found a bunch of
letters that'd been thrown away.

152
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,710
What about Benedict?

153
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,210
He sprained his ankle.

154
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,970
Serves him right for wearing those boots.

155
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,890
Sheesh, what is wrong with you?

156
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,100
O-Ow!

157
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll go around Kraft Street, then.

158
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,520
You handle the next street.

159
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,610
Each and every one of those letters

160
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,990
is filled with someone's heart and soul.

161
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,160
No letter deserves to go undelivered.

162
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,340
A letter!

163
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Mom!

164
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,550
Letter from Dad!

165
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,770
Finished with deliveries?

166
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,480
Good work.

167
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,240
Thank goodness! They all found their homes!

168
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,260
"Dear Violet,

169
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,470
are you all right?

170
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,970
I thought about coming to see you, but Iris and
I discussed it, and we decided to write this letter.

171
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,980
Dolls writing a letter to
another Doll might be a strange idea,

172
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,030
but we wanted to let you
know that we're worried for you,

173
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,990
and that we're...

174
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,570
waiting for you."

175
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,790
<i>We know you probably don't want
to come back to work at all right now, </i>

176
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,710
<i>so take a nice, long break.</i>

177
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,250
<i>But call for us anytime if you ever need anything.</i>

178
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,170
<i>Both Iris and I believe that you will come back to us.</i>

179
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:48,100
<i>Also, someone named Spencer came in
today with a ghostwriting request for you.</i>

180
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,570
<i>He said he wanted to give his sister a
letter expressing his apologies and gratitude.</i>

181
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,070
<i>He wants you to write it.</i>

182
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,570
<i>He insists that it has to be you. </i>

183
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,090
Will this do?

184
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,220
Yeah.

185
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,430
It feels embarrassing giving my little sister a letter,

186
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,970
but thanks to her,

187
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,940
I found a job.

188
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,020
She's the one who made me want to get back on my feet.

189
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,780
Sorry to have you come over.

190
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,330
I'd heard you were taking time off, though.

191
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,790
My coworkers let me know with a letter.

192
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,040
It was the first letter I'd ever received in my life.

193
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,920
And it helped me realize that receiving a letter

194
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,930
makes one very happy.

195
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm sure Luculia will be overjoyed too.

196
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,390
Thank you.

197
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,090
"Just as lovely as those flowers"...

198
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,970
"A person worthy of that name."

199
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,750
Violet?

200
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,750
Violet!

201
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,640
You trace your dreams back to their origins
tsuzurareta yume wo sakanobotta

202
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,310
You were right. I was covered in burn marks.

203
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,970
You trace your dreams back to their origins
tsuzurareta yume wo sakanobotta

204
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,020
Holding your heart that doesn't know how to cry
nakikata sae shiranu kokoro daku you ni

205
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,140
Is it really all right?

206
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,730
Holding your heart that doesn't know how to cry
nakikata sae shiranu kokoro daku you ni

207
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,610
Is it really all right for me to be an Auto Memoir Doll?

208
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,030
Your memories are dyed
kioku ni shimiwatatteku

209
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,780
kioku ni shimiwatatteku
Your memories are dyed

210
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,410
Is it really all right for me to liveâ€”to live on?

211
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,120
In mistakes that can't be undone
ayamachi wa kienai

212
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,450
ayamachi wa kienai
In mistakes that can't be undone

213
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,830
In wounds that even time can't heal
kisetsu ga megutteitte mo

214
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,540
They may ache and throb at times
seotta kizu wa tokini uzuku kedo

215
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,550
The things you did can never be undone.

216
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:49,220
They may ache and throb at times
seotta kizu wa tokini uzuku kedo

217
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,180
But the warmth won't fade either
nukumori mo kienai

218
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,930
But...

219
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,140
But the warmth won't fade either
nukumori mo kienai

220
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,690
It lives on in your memories
kioku to tomo ni ikiteru

221
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:08,570
Along with countless loves that provide your heart salvation
musuu no ai ga kokoro wo sukuu deshou

222
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:18,290
So don't forget to keep walking toward the future
dakara wasurenaide ashita e mukau koto

223
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,880
You have the courage to embrace everything
subete dakishimeru yuuki wo

224
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,540
But...

225
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,250
You have the courage to embrace everything
subete dakishimeru yuuki wo

226
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,670
Believe in it
shinjite

227
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,800
Everything you've done as an Auto Memoir Doll

228
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,050
Believe in it
shinjite

229
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,470
will never go away either,

230
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,020
