1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
Leiden sure is huge, isn't it?

2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,550
It really is! It has so many streets
compared to my hometown that I got lost!

3
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,140
Apparently, getting this school's
brooch makes it easier to find a job.

4
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,890
I wanna graduate and go back home right away.

5
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,310
Are you sure you're not just after the brooch?

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,520
Oh, come on!

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,940
Silence, please.

8
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,750
I welcome you all to the
Auto Memoir Doll Training School.

9
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,000
Sorry I'm late!

10
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,050
Know that repeated tardiness is
counted as absence without leave.

11
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,630
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,010
With the War now over,

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,350
the demand for Dolls grows by the day.

14
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,930
Of course, you can become
one without attending this school.

15
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,650
However, our goal is not to produce just any Dolls

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,730
but to produce the very finest.

17
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,030
The brooch that symbolizes graduation
from this school also symbolizes excellence.

18
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,280
That said, those of you I do not deem worthy Dolls

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,740
will find it entirely out of your grasp.

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,660
Are you all ready?

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Roger!

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,380
<i>Violet Evergarden.</i>

23
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,130
<i>Her demeanor was completely
divorced from her doll-like appearance.</i>

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,220
<i>She was more like a soldier.</i>

25
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:08,140
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,860
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,620
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

28
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,990
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

29
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,920
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,960
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

31
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,560
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,430
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

33
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,810
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

34
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,990
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

35
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,660
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

36
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,420
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

37
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,710
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

38
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,960
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:26,970
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

40
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,230
To be a first-rate Doll,

41
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,730
you need the typing speed to
transcribe the words as they are spoken.

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,360
Please begin.

43
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,580
What is the matter, Ms. Evergarden?

44
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,580
You haven't specified a required speed.

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,210
Ah.

46
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,460
If I do, you will be able to match it?

47
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,300
Two hundred characters per minute, then.

48
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,960
Roger.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
I'll start now.

50
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,140
Go ahead.

51
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,200
Aren't you going to eat?

52
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,120
I've been trained to
minimize my intake during a mission.

53
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,460
But...

54
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,670
Want some of mine?

55
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,170
No, thank you,

56
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,130
Miss Luculia from Leiden.

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,470
You remember what I said in my introduction?

58
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,720
I remember what everyone said in theirs.

59
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,680
The letter-writing skills required of a first-rate
Doll include grammatical perfection, a rich vocabulary,

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,980
and detailed knowledge of the various types of letters.

61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,320
That's it for today.

62
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,950
I shall now announce today's grades,

63
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,450
Starting with grammar.

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,740
Violet Evergarden, full marks.

65
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,990
Next, vocabulary.

66
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,120
Violet Evergarden, full marks.

67
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,790
I have returned from my mission.

68
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,380
How was school?

69
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,750
I bet you got yelled at.

70
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,380
No, I didn't.

71
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,420
Welcome back, Violet.

72
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,390
Boss, I have here Instructor
Rhodanthe's daily evaluation of my work.

73
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,760
Okay.

74
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,310
What's it say?

75
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,390
Wow, great grades for the first day.

76
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,310
Oh, you're back?

77
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,650
How long are you going to keep that up? Be a man!

78
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,360
Right back at you!

79
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,320
Huh? No, you!
What are they doing?

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,570
Those two are always at loggerheads.
Huh? No, you!

81
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,120
Forget it.
Those two are always at loggerheads.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,410
Those two are always at loggerheads.

83
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,620
I'm amazed you got them to work together
long enough to form this company with you.

84
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,340
Your exercise for today will be an actual ghostwriting.

85
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,840
Let's do this.

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,920
I'm in your hands, Miss Luculia.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,260
So, who will this letter be for?

88
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,640
You are asking who I want to send a letter to?

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,440
Simply pick someone close to you to
whom you wish to convey something.

90
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,110
Someone close to me?

91
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,740
Please address the letter to Claudia Hodgins.

92
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,240
Claudia?

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,990
A friend? Family?

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,990
My boss.

95
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,870
That is all for my report.

96
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,870
Yours, Violet Evergarden.

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,130
Is that it?

98
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,880
On second thought,

99
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,590
"When will I receive new orders from the major?"

100
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,140
Add that to the end, please.

101
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,180
This feels more like filing official
paperwork than sending a letter.

102
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,480
Now it is your turn to dictate a letter, Miss Luculia.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,940
R-Right.

104
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,020
Uh, to my bro...

105
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,480
Actually, I think I'll address it to my parents.

106
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,520
Roger.

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,700
You see, I haven't really thanked my
mother and father for everything they've done.

108
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,540
Hmm... Now that I'm actually
sending a letter, I can't find the right words.

109
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,170
There's so much I want to say about the places
we went, and the places I wish we could've gone,

110
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,540
that I can't fit it all in.

111
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
Talk to you again soon.
Please don't worry about me.

112
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,260
Yours, Luculia.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,060
Violet, read this out for us.

114
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,520
Sure.

115
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,190
"Dear Father, Mother,

116
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,650
I know I haven't written to you in
some time, but I have nothing new to report.

117
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,490
It is a matter of great concern to me that I
haven't expressed my gratitude for what you did.

118
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,410
As for the places we went,
and the places I wish we could've gone,

119
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,750
I have no information to give you.

120
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,580
I am carrying out my duties in a diligent manner

121
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,880
and am sound in both body and mind.

122
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,750
I haven't run into any problems.

123
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,010
That is all. I ask that you don't concern
yourself with my wellbeing. Yours, Luculia."

124
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,010
You call that a letter?

125
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,600
U-Uh, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,440
That isn't the issue here.

127
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,190
Letters are an instrument for
communicating a person's feelings.

128
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,480
A first-rate Doll should
understand the words the client is speaking

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,450
and take from them the
feelings they truly wish to express.

130
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,370
Violet, your grades are good across all subjects,

131
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,830
and your typing is truly fast and precise.

132
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,080
But what you have ghostwritten can't be called a letter.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,580
It can't be called a letter?

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,130
Um, we can try againâ€”

135
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,170
That's it for today.

136
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,680
Please give the letters you have written
to the people to whom they are addressed.

137
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,220
Don't worry. You just weren't at your best today.

138
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,390
Something similar happened previously.

139
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,230
Really?

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,740
Hey, let me show you the
most beautiful view in this city.

141
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,120
Here we are.

142
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,250
The stairs are steep, so watch your step.

143
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,850
Isn't it amazing?

144
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,650
I've loved this view ever since I was a little kid.

145
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,820
Violet...

146
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,240
I hope that one day,

147
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,450
you'll get to see that beautiful view in Leiden.

148
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,250
Well, I'm going this way.

149
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,460
See you.

150
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,210
Miss Luculia.

151
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,890
Just call me Luculia, Violet.

152
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,680
Go home already.

153
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,180
Don't be like that, man. What's the problem?

154
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,520
Brother! Have you been drinking again?

155
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,900
I haven't.

156
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,690
Welcome back.

157
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,480
This guy won't let me, so I haven'tâ€”

158
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,400
Brother!

159
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,320
Are you okay?

160
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,610
Damn it!

161
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,750
Luculia...

162
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,130
Thank you.

163
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,880
Violet, I'm happy about the letter,

164
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,430
but this is more like a report.

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,020
The instructor also said that what I
ghostwrote couldn't be called a letter.

166
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,310
Will I...

167
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,440
Will I ever be a worthy Doll?

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,150
I'm home! I'll get cooking right awayâ€”

169
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,140
Dad, Mom...

170
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,190
Bluebell Junoa.

171
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,480
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,690
Iberis Konoue.

173
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,820
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,910
Luculia Marlborough.

175
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,280
Luculia Marlborough.

176
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,540
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,790
The aforementioned nine will graduate from this class.

178
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,420
May you all be exemplary Dolls.

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,300
We did it! Where are you going to work?

180
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,210
The post office back home.

181
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,510
I think I'll look for something here in Leiden.

182
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,180
And you, Luculia?

183
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,180
Uh, I haven't decided yet.

184
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,430
What? But you're graduating top of the class!

185
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,770
Really? That's too bad.

186
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,940
I'm terribly sorry.

187
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,860
Don't worry.

188
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,610
It's not like you <i>have</i> to graduate to be a Doll.

189
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,450
But then...

190
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,030
Why did I go to school at all?

191
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,870
I'm aware that graduating isn't everything,

192
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,290
but if I can't understand the words the client is speaking

193
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,960
and take from them the feelings they wish to express,

194
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,260
I don't serve any purpose as a Doll.

195
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,350
I knew you would come here.

196
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,600
Luculia.

197
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,280
School has ended. Why are you here?

198
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,740
Because I thought I might be able to see you again.

199
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,910
Say, Violet.

200
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,780
Who is this major of yours?

201
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:38,290
You always asked after replies
from the major in each of your letters.

202
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,340
Aren't they the one you really wanted to write to?

203
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,090
Why don't we try writing to them today?

204
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,930
Not one of your usual reports,

205
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,430
but a letter packed with how you really feel.

206
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,350
I'll be with you all the way.

207
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,730
Major...

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,910
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,540
I don't know what I want to tell him either.

210
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,630
I haven't even understood the words he said to me.

211
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,800
What made you want to be a Doll?

212
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,560
I want to know what "I love you" means.

213
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,560
What "I love you" means?

214
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,320
It's difficult to tell someone how you feel, isn't it?

215
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,490
The truth is, my parents are dead.

216
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,580
My brother's the only family I have left.

217
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,080
And I don't know what I can say to him.

218
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,760
When the War broke out, he went to fight in the army.

219
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,510
But the western front, where he
was stationed, saw next to no combat.

220
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,350
The War was always being fought somewhere far away,

221
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,440
so we never really felt its true impact.

222
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,900
But when Dad and Mom went to Herne for trade talks...

223
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,910
...the western front was breached?

224
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,160
Nothing was left, not even their belongings.

225
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,920
And then, the War ended.

226
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,130
C'mon, just one drink!
My brother came home.

227
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,920
Knock it off!

228
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,090
I wanted to be happy that he at
least came back alive, and I was.

229
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,970
What the hell, man?

230
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,550
But...

231
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,430
Shut up!

232
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,430
He was filled with regret about
not being able to defend Herne.

233
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,600
He'd convinced himself that it
was his fault that our parents died.

234
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,070
Don't show your face 'round here again.

235
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,750
But all that doesn't matter.

236
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm really just glad he's alive.

237
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,130
All I want is to thank him!

238
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,020
But I've never been able to.

239
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,270
Luculia, write a letter.

240
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,400
A letter where you put all the
feelings you wish to express into words.

241
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,160
But I can never find the right words to say.

242
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,460
I've tried many times before, but I just can't do it.

243
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,170
And I don't know if I ever will.

244
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,920
Thank you for hearing me out, Violet.

245
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,510
I'll help you write that letter
to the major some other time.

246
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,850
"A first-rate Doll should
understand the words the client is speaking

247
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,860
and take from them the
feelings they truly wish to express."

248
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,620
Brother!

249
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,170
Wait, Brother!

250
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,000
Come on.

251
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,340
Thanks.

252
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,090
Hurry up. Get over here.

253
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,850
You were right! It's so pretty!

254
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
A woman?

255
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,880
Aren't you Luculia's...

256
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,670
What's that?

257
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,800
My missionâ€”

258
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,130
No, my duty.

259
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,640
Or rather, a letter.

260
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,220
From Luculia to you.

261
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,140
From Luculia?

262
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,410
"Dear Brother,

263
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm glad you're here for me.

264
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,290
Thank you for everything."

265
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,810
Welcome back.

266
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,320
Where have you been?
You were out awfully late.

267
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,820
School.

268
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,900
By the way, where's the boss?

269
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,820
A union get-together, apparently.

270
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,910
Wait, weren't you already through with school?

271
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,830
That's correct, but I wrote a letter today.

272
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know if I managed to
convey my client's feelings, though.

273
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,760
Is that so?

274
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,840
Weren't you two fighting?

275
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,430
Oh, right! Can you believe what this moron did?

276
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,560
He left a wet cup on top of a letter I'd ghostwritten!

277
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,850
You're the moron!

278
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,430
Your fault for leaving a letter there!

279
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,310
Seriously, what is with your attitude?

280
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,480
Oh, for crying out loud!

281
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,980
Violet!

282
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,570
Luculia?

283
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,530
What's the matter?

284
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,700
Good morning, Violet.

285
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,660
Instructor. I thought the course was complete.

286
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,540
Sorry. I barged in and asked her.

287
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,250
Luculia showed me this letter.

288
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,090
This letter from her to her
brother, which you ghostwrote.

289
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,100
I'd never been able to tell
my brother how I felt about him,

290
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,600
but Violet, you helped me finally express it.

291
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,650
"A first-rate Doll should

292

293
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,330
You have just taken that first step.

294
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,620
Violet...

295
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,330
May you be an exemplary Doll.

296
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,750
Violet!

297
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,960
Congratulations!

298
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
Luculia...

299
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,430
