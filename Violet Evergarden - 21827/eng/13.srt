1
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,250
<i>The tool I cast away became Gilbert's dog.</i>

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,000
<i>But even after losing her arms,
her master, and everything she'd ever had,</i>

3
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,510
<i>she still stood tall.</i>

4
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,730
Thank you.

5
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,120
All too naïve.

6
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,160
Time's up.

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,210
If you'd killed me right at the
outset, you might have made it.

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,250
Bombs?

9
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,720
Stop the train!

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Now!

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,310
It won't work!

12
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,190
Use the brakes in the carriage!

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,770
Emergency brakes!

14
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,740
What the...

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,130
Violet!

16
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,310
Violet!

17
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,980
Get the other bomb!

18
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:54,980
Got it!

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
It's off!

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,790
Violet!

21
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,440
Violet!

22
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,580
Holmgard,
Capital of Gardariki

23
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,160
Temporary
Leidenschaftlich Embassy

24
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,750
"The nations of Gardariki and Leidenschaftlich
will strive to maintain international peace and order

25
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,840
and hereby sign an all-encompassing
pact that respects each other's sovereignty.

26
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,090
To that end, both nations will immediately
recommence free and fair trade,

27
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,680
and Leidenschaftlich will, as a token of friendship,

28
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,850
provide one year's worth of emergency aid.

29
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,230
Both nations hereby swear to adhere
to and uphold this treaty to the utmost."

30
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,660
It's over.

31
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,950
Yeah.

32
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,580
What's wrong?

33
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,250
It's over, and yet...

34
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,790
It's over...

35
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
The War is over,

36
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,170
and yet our son still hasn't come home.

37
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,180
I keep telling my wife that we should give up on him.

38
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,810
But...

39
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,020
I understand.

40
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,860
I understand how you feel very well.

41
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,860
If you could please write the letter like so:

42
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,160
"Thank you for being born our son."

43
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,790
Of course.

44
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,990
Well then,

45
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,210
I will ensure that this is
delivered to the air show on time.

46
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,420
On that day, this letter will be
delivered from the sky.

47
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,260
Thank you for using the
Auto Memoir Doll service.

48
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,170
Thank you for all your hard work.

49
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,310
It must have been stressful
having clients stay so late.

50
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,010
It was no problem.

51
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,520
Air Show season, huh?

52
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,530
It had been suspended during the war,

53
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,700
so everyone's excited for its comeback after five years.

54
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,950
The deadline for letter submissions is
tomorrow, so let's keep at it for one more day.

55
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes, I'll do my best.

56
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm thinking of writing a letter myself.

57
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,470
I used to be a showgirl before I became a Doll.

58
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,850
Many of our patrons were soldiers,

59
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,640
and many of them are dead now.

60
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,230
I'm thinking of writing to them.

61
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,730
Why don't you write one too?

62
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,370
I've never written a letter of my own.

63
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,950
Then this can be a memorable first.

64
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,540
Just write how you feel right now—

65
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,380
as your heart wills you.

66
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,260
As my heart...

67
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,220
Major.

68
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,220
What is it?

69
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,980
Am I not needed anymore?

70
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,230
What are you talking about?

71
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,230
Will I be disposed of and transferred
into Colonel Hodgins's custody?

72
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,700
Will you not give me orders anymore?

73
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,410
Do you want my orders so badly?

74
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,370
Your orders are everything to me.

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,880
After this battle, you can stop taking orders from me.

76
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,050
Actually, you can stop taking orders from anyone.

77
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
Live free.

78
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,800
Is that an order?

79
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,560
Why?

80
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,060
Why would you take that as an order?

81
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,820
Do you really think I see you as a tool?

82
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,030
If I did, I would never have carried you
out of there and taken you back home.

83
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,450
I would never have kept you beside me all this while!

84
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,710
You should know that I'm only feeling this anger
and anguish because I want what's best for you!

85
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,960
Major?

86
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,670
You have emotions.

87
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,510
You have a heart, just like me!

88
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,880
If you don't...

89
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,890
If you don't, then how do you
explain that look on your face?!

90
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
You're perfectly capable of making such expressions!

91
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,770
You find me scary right now, don't you?

92
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,900
You don't like being yelled at out of nowhere, do you?

93
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,770
I don't understand.

94
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,070
These unreasonable words anger you, don't they?

95
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,940
I don't understand.

96
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,110
You lie!

97
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm not lying.

98
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,620
I really don't understand.

99
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,870
I...

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,620
I want to keep taking orders from you.

101
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,380
If you order me to, I shall go anywhere.

102
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,710
That's all.

103
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,610
But I can't watch you force yourself to remain a tool.

105
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,150
It hurts me.

106
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,740
I was the one who took you in when you
were so young and turned you into this.

107
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,240
And yet,

108
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,490
you still believe in me...

109
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,010
You haven't done anything wrong.

110
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,010
The final battle is only a few hours away.

111
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,520
Let's talk about this some other time.

112
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,770
You couldn't write one?

113
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,280
I do have emotions I want to express,

114
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,530
and I had them back then too.

115
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,030
But I don't know what I...

116
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,450
...want to tell the major?

117
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,500
Violet.

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
There is still some time left.

119
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,770
The deadline is tonight,

120
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,510
but if you can write a letter by the
morning, I'll take it to the admins for you.

121
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,760
So try to write something.

122
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,390
Even if it's short—

123
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,640
even if it's only one sentence.

124
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,690
Come in.

125
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,400
Excuse me.

126
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,070
Someone's here to see Violet.

127
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,320
A man named Bougainvillea.

128
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,660
Thank you very much.

129
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,500
Over here.

130
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,260
You must've been busy ghostwriting
letters for the Air Show until yesterday.

131
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,770
I'm sorry you had to meet me on your day off.

132
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:49,890
It's fine.

133
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,770
You've never been to our
Leiden mansion before, have you?

134
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,770
I should warn you in advance.

135
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,150
Their memory has gotten a bit hazy.

136
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,450
It's our mother.

137
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,790
You are?

138
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,260
This is Violet.

139
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,300
You said you wanted to meet her.

140
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,310
Oh, right. The one he wants us to adopt.

141
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,640
You're finally here.

142
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes.

143
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,730
Oh.

144
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,690
I thought you were a much smaller girl.

145
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,730
How long ago was it?

146
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,730
Four years ago.

147
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,730
Ah, yes.

148
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,080
It has been a while.

149
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,080
Isn't Gilbert with you?

150
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,500
Mother, Gilbert is...

151
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,630
He is with us.

152
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,930
It's the same color as his eyes.

153
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,520
It's the same color as your eyes.

154
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,530
Beautiful, isn't it?

155
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,820
Yes.

156
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,280
I didn't know the word, so I haven't said it.

157
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,330
But I've thought your eyes are
beautiful from the first time we met.

158
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,880
Very beautiful.

159
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,470
So, what is your relationship with Gilbert?

160
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,430
The major took me in,

161
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,640
raised me,

162
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,310
and gave me a purpose.

163
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,680
But...

164
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,440
I know. In the battle of Intens, he...

165
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,070
That's right. You asked to see her to discuss that.

166
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,370
Isn't that right, Mother?

167
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,240
Right.

168
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,090
It wasn't your fault.

169
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,550
It isn't your cross to bear.

170
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,060
Dietfried keeps telling me to give up on Gilbert...

171
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,940
when I know he can't give up on him either.

172
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,570
The two of them were always such loving brothers.

173
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,700
He's alive...

174
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,790
within my heart.

175
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,040
So I won't ever forget him.

176
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,590
Even if it always hurts to remember,
I'll live the rest of my life thinking about him.

177
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,550
I mean, even now,

178
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,020
I still love him.

179
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,980
Right.

180
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,940
Right.

181
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,740
Right!

182
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,670
Violet.

183
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,800
Live his share of life too.

184
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,390
Live, live, live some more,

185
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,600
and die.

186
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,940
Those are my final orders for you.

187
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,110
I...

188
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,700
I don't need orders anymore.

189
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,260
<i>Gilbert never treated the tool I cast away as one.</i>

190
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,310
<i>So, even though she lost her arms and her master,</i>

191
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,570
<i>she will never lose all the important things he gave her.</i>

192
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,740
I'm really glad the weather cleared up in time.

193
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,160
Yeah. It actually snowed, and Leiden never gets snow.

194
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,120
Roland.

195
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,160
Oh, they're holding hands.

196
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,720
That's amazing.

197
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,510
So nice...

198
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,050
Violet!

199
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,590
Luculia.

200
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,130
I'm glad you could make it.

201
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,930
It must've been hectic with all
the ghostwriting for the Air Show.

202
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,430
Not really, but I did write a lot of letters.

203
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,690
I even wrote one of my own for the first time.

204
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
I see.

205
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,360
I wrote one to my parents too.

206
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm sure it'll reach them.

207
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,830
Thanks.

208
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,620
I wrote one too.

209
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,460
To my future self,

210
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,380
who has become Leiden's—
no, the continent's most popular Doll!

211
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,210
That's one lofty goal.

212
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,470
What about you, Erica?

213
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,590
What did you write?

214
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,430
I've fallen for someone recently, so I wrote a love—

215
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,850
What?

216
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,190
Who? Who is it?!

217
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,020
Hey.

218
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,320
Want to know what I wrote?

219
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,440
Yes. I do.

220
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,110
Ah.

221
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,950
Believe it or not,

222
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,110
I wrote it to Hodgins.

223
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,240
"One day,

224
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,950
I'm going to be the boss."

225
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,080
Wait, you want to take my place?

226
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,500
What kind of letter is that?!

227
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,670
You're one to talk.

228
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,500
What kind of letter is <i>this</i>?

229
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,710
"From Papa, to my future daughter."

230
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,090
How'd you get that?

231
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Stop!

232
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,140
I found a bunch of drafts crammed
into the trash can in your office,

233
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,100
Papa.

234
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,930
You of all people shouldn't be calling me that!

235
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,140
Papa...

236
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,940
Stop it!

237
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,610
"Papa's eagerly awaiting the day you are born.

238
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,490
And I'm praying that you grow up healthy and strong,

239
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,250
that you find happiness,

240
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,580
and that you love someone who loves you just as much.

241
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,920
And I pray that the future you and your children live in

242
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,180
is a world free of conflict and filled with happiness."

243
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,010
The feelings of countless people are raining from the sky.

244
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,020
Violet.

245
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,960
Major...

246
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,620
<i>"Dear Major Gilbert, </i>

247
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,620
<i>Do you have any news? Are you doing well?</i>

248
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,830
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

249
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,200
<i>Are you having any difficulties?</i>

250
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,260
<i>Spring, summer, autumn, and winter...</i>

251
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,810
<i>Many seasons have come and gone,</i>

252
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,480
<i>but the one with you isn't coming around at all.</i>

253
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,570
<i>At first, I couldn't understand.</i>

254
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,450
<i>I couldn't understand anything about how you felt.</i>

255
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,290
<i>But within this new life you gave me,</i>

256
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,290
<i>I've begun to feel the same way as you, if only a little,</i>

257
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,880
<i>through ghostwriting, and through
the people I've met along the way. </i>

258
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:17,600
<i>I believe that you are still alive somewhere.</i>

259
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,780
<i>So I shall live, live, live,</i>

260
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,950
<i>and live some more, though there's
no telling what life might have in store.</i>

261
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,040
<i>And if I can ever see you again, I want to let you know...</i>

262
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,590
<i>that the phrase "I love you"...</i>

263
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,770
I understand it a little now.

264
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,470
Ghostwriting request, Violet! They say it's urgent!

265
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,770
Benedict, you make some tea.

266
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,230
What? Why should I?

267
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,990
Violet, the customer's waiting.

268
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,330
I'll be right there.

269
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:49,170

270
00:24:49,710 --> 00:25:00,600
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

271
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:22,200
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

272
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:33,130
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

273
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:44,520

I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

274
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,860

Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

Lies in peace

279
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,990
It is a pleasure to meet you.

280
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,100
If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

281

Representing the Auto Memoir Doll service,

282
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,620
