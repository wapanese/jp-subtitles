1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,690
Can I leave this request to you, then?

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,450
Sure thing.

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,280
That leaves us with this...

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,910
Ctrigall's Menace base? That's one
of our former enemies to the north!

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,670
Did we really get a ghostwriting request from there?

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,710
There's much demand for
Dolls among garrisoned soldiers.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,340
And I <i>have</i> been publicizing CH Postal all over. But...

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,550
Is there a problem?

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,130
Civil war recently broke out over there.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,020
The radicals want to reignite the War,
and the moderates want to keep things as they are.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,270
Right when they finally had peace
again. I don't even know what to say.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,520
I suppose some people can't live without war.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,530
Yeah.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,030
And the Menace base lies on
the front lines of that civil war.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,660
I understand why they'd want to
send a letter, but it's too dangerous.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,160
It's a bit unfortunate, though.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,500
That soldier must've asked for a Doll because
he had a message to send from the battlefield.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,090
But I can't send one of our Dolls to a war zone.

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,600
Menace Base
Ctrigall

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,940
Maria...

21
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,240
Our squad will hereby go into battle.

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:48,170
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

23
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,880
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,640
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,020
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,940
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:16,990
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,580
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,460
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,830
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

31
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,010
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,680
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,440
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,730
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

35
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,990
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

36
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:06,990
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

37
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,710
The envelope with the request is gone!

38
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,460
The one you said you would turn down?

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,470
Where's Violet?

40
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,470
She left this morning, saying she had work to do.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,350
I think she mentioned going to Ctrigall,
and that's a week-long trip each way.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,600
Crap.

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,760
I hear you, but we still can't.

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,590
Please.

45
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,890
Like I said, that's outside our delivery area.

46
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,850
What's all this ruckus?

47
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,400
Boss, this woman wants us to deliver her to this place.

48
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,020
The Menace base?

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,490
And you're from Leidenschaftlich?

50
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,320
No wonder you're dressed so lightly.

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,870
Now look here, missy.

52
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,160
This is the Menace base, where you want to be delivered.

53
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,250
And over here, there's an internment camp.

54
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,540
Or well, there used to be.

55
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
Did they run away?

56
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,800
Looks like they had some outside help.

57
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,800
And we have a faction that
wants to continue the War, too.

58
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,220
They handed weapons to the
Gardariki stragglers in the internment camp,

59
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,180
making a mess of everything
and throwing us into civil war.

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,190
The Menace base is barely hanging
in there as our last line of defense,

61
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,820
but the roads around it have been
blockaded, cutting off reinforcements.

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,900
Get it now?

63
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,820
The place you want to go is a bona fide battlefield.

64
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,080
But isn't that exactly why the soldiers there
would want to express their feelings to others?

65
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah, but not even an ant could
crawl into that base in one piece.

66
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,920
No.

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,130
This mountain is steep and
extremely difficult to cross on foot.

68
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,560
As such, neither army will be keeping close watch on it.

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,180
B-But crossing that mountain is...

70
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,980
Possible.

71
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,190
Given a plane and a skilled pilot.

72
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,400
Not happening. Even if you got over the
mountain, you'd have to be airdropped in.

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,960
You're an amusing lass.

74
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,460
I like ya.

75
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,590
Oh, you're a Doll?

76
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,510
Yes. If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,270
Then I guess a postman's job is to
deliver anything anywhere, anytime.

78
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,450
Say, the transcontinental
railroad will be finished soon, right?

79
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,200
Yeah, meaning it'll take no time to get to the south.

80
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,960
They say the girls down there are all beautiful.

81
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,920
We'll start receiving a lot of good food too.

82
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,630
The south, huh?

83
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,260
Hey, Yale.

84
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,880
Sir.

85
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,010
Message for the company commander.

86
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,390
Platoon Two will be circling around from this point.

87
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,760
Circling? Got it.

88
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,810
Our ETA to the mission point will be—

89
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,530
Sergeant Major! Yale!

90
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,780
Enemy ambush!

91
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,910
Damn it! I'll get them!

92
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,120
Get down!

93
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,590
Shit!

94
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,090
Shit!

95
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,140
Aiden...

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,100
Please don't leave me here.

97
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,560
Why would I?!

98
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,410
We're going home alive.

99
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,200
No! I don't want to die!

100
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,040
I don't want to die either!

101
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,810
No... Aiden...

102
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,770
Don't leave me...

103
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,900
Yale!

104
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,480
Yale!

105
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,990
No!

106
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
No!

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,660
I don't want to die!

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,660
I have to come home!

109
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,250
Maria!

110
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,950
I have to come home...

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You can see the battlefield now.

112
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,220
The Menace base has fallen too.

113
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,090
There's no way you can go
down there. We're heading back.

114
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,480
The Ctrigallan Army is so frail.

115
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,490
The moderates are just a bunch of cowards.

116
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,320
That's why we must show them the way once again.

117
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,040
Shall we continue the hunt, then?

118
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,870
A plane?

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,620
Aren't our allies grounded right now?

120
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,130
A child?

121
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,730
Get her!

122
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,900
Quit it.

123
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,410
I recognize you,

124
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,500
Leidenschaftlich's girl soldier.

125
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,710
Why are you here?

126
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm sorry to ask,

127
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,210
but would you please fall back?

128
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,260
Fine. I get it.

129
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,180
Let's go. We're no match for her.

130
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,190
Are you Mister Aiden Field?

131
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,820
How do you... know my name...

132
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,280
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, sir.

133
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,800
Aren't you going to play, Aiden?

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,670
Nope. Can't think of anything I'd use the money for.

135
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Then why not send a letter home?

136
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,600
A letter? From the battlefield?

137
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,600
Yeah.

138
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,940
I've never written a letter in
my life. I don't even know how.

139
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,440
Take a look at the poster.

140
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,450
It says a lovely lady will put
your feelings into words in a letter.

141
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,870
Hey, Aiden.

142
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,160
Make sure I look good, okay?

143
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,500
Aiden...

144
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Maria.

145
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Sir.

146
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,720
We'll hide here for a while.

147
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,140
Someone will come pick us up in the morning.

148
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,600
I feel hot right now.

149
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,980
This is to prevent hypothermia.

150
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,690
Will you write a letter for me?

151
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,610
I must focus on treating you.

152
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,620
I'd rather you wrote the letter.

153
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,620
I think I'm going to die soon.

154
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,620
So please.

155
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,630
Understood.

156
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,140
Pretty.

157
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,260
I'm ready, sir.

158
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,480
Address it to Dad and Mom.

159
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,890
Certainly.

160
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,610
"Dad, Mom...

161
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,900
Thank you for raising me all these years."

162
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,410
Are you writing the letter?

163
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,910
I'm memorizing your words with my fingers.

164
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,160
I see.

165
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,910
"This might be my final letter to you.

166
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,170
If you two are reincarnated
and marry in the next life too,

167
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,180
then please have me as your son again.

168
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,800
Please.

169
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,690
Things weren't supposed to end this way.

170
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:04,190
I was going to find happiness
in life and show you that I had.

171
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:14,370
So please pray a lot so that I can be your son again.

172
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,790
I beg of you."

173
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,930
Was it okay to use such unrefined language?

174
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,550
Yes. I think it's better this way.

175
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,440
Hearing you say that makes it sound true.

176
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,480
Sir!

177
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,630
Sir, is there anyone else you'd like to write to?

178
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,800
Maria... To Maria.

179
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,310
Miss Maria, yes?

180
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,230
An old friend from the neighborhood.

181
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,070
We'd been together since we were kids,

182
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,360
and she was like a kid sister to me.

183
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,080
She said she loved me, and
the feeling was probably mutual.

184
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,540
But I came here before I could do
anything a boyfriend would do for her.

185
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,210
We didn't even kiss.

186
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,760
I'll put those feelings of yours

187
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,850
into words in a letter.

188
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,940
”Maria, are you doing well?

189
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:16,370
Do you remember when you said you loved me?

190
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,370
I was really, really happy.

191
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,960
Maria... Maria...

192
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,550
I want to come home to you.

193
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,880
I don't want to die.

194
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,850
I want to come home... to you...

195
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,350
Wait for me."

196
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,100
I can't open my eyes anymore.

197
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,320
Are you writing this down?

198
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,690
Yes, I am.

199
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,540
Violet, please make sure my letters are delivered.

200
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,290
And thank you for saving me.

201
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,420
I...

202
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm not alone.

203
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,630
I'm right here. I'm right by your side.

204
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,560
Please touch me.

205
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,320
I'm holding your hand, sir.

206
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, now I feel kind of cold.

207
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,830
Dad, Mom...

208
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,300
Maria.

209
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Maria,

210
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,780
kiss me.

211
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,790
Thank you.

212
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,660
Everything will be all right now, sir.

213
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,830
I promise to deliver your letters for you.

214
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,360
"From the Vandal Postal Service.

215
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,070
We've recovered your item.

216
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,360
It'll be returned to you intact."

217
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,240
Thank goodness.

218
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,200
So, when will she be back?

219
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,040
They say they're taking a detour on the way, though.

220
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,500
Maria! Letter from Aiden!

221
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,570
I bring you this letter from Mister Aiden Field.

222
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,750
No...

223
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,960
Aiden!

224
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,880
Aiden!

225
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,620
Thank you.

226
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,000
Thank you so much for bringing our son back to us!

227
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,210
No, I didn't...

228
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,510
Thank you.

229
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,510
Thank you so much.

230
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,140
No...

231
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,140
No...

232
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,650
No...

233
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:49,280
No. I'm sorry I couldn't protect him.

234
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm sorry I let him die.

235
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,550
I'm so sorry!

236
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,930
"I Don't Want to See Anyone Die Ever Again"

237
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:21,230
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

238
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:42,840
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

239
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:53,760
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

240
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:05,150
yasashisa de amitsuzuketa yurikago de asu e yukou
I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

241
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:11,490
hare no hi mo ame no hi ni mo
Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

242
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,580
anata wo mamoru tame ni
I will be there to protect you

243
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:27,510
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

244
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,640
namae no nai hana wa
A nameless flower

245
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,850
shizuka ni nemuru yo
Lies in peace
