1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,480
What? A personal request?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,980
For me?!

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,190
I'm happy for you, Iris.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,730
You will be making a house call to Kazaly.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,360
Kazaly? That's my hometown.

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,450
Oh, right.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,330
So, who's the client?

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,250
Sara Florent, a woman in her forties. Do you know her?

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,370
Hmm... No, can't say I do.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,290
All right.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,250
To celebrate Iris's first request,

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,840
let's all go out for lunch today.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,930
My hometown's way out in the
country, and I'm the only Doll from there.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,430
The client must've heard about me from someone.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,060
Not that I mind. I can go home and show this off.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,240
Man, my friends and family
aren't going to leave me alone!

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,950
Try not to get carried away.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,870
Behave in a manner befitting a Doll of C.H. Postal—

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,030
I know! I get it!

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,460
That's the kind of "I get it" that
means you don't get it at all, isn't it?

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,420
Excuse me? What did you just...

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,140
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,850
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,610
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,990
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

26
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,910
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:47,960
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

28
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,550
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,430
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,810
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,980
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

32
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,650
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:22,410
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,700
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,960
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:37,970
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,730
Nothing but letters canvassing votes lately.

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,230
Well, it is the first post-war election,
and the Lords are making all kinds of moves,

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,940
so the Commons candidates must be getting desperate.

40
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,990
Will those two be all right?

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,710
Of all the rotten luck...

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,210
I lost the perfect opportunity to
show off my awesome typing skills.

43
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,220
No need to worry. I'll type in your stead.

44
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,640
That's not the point.

45
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,180
Kazaly is a village midway up the mountains,

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,850
and its principal industries are
dairy farming and agriculture, yes?

47
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,020
It's a fairly new settlement, so it has no
other features or specialties to speak of.

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,230
Well, excuse us for having nothing going on.

49
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,110
It isn't a bad thing.

50
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,070
Anything of value will be fought
over, forever in the eye of the storm.

51
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,870
In North Leidenschaftlich,

52
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,500
the rich iron and copper reserves led
to its invasion by the Gardariki Empire.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,750
Yeah, that's what kicked off the War.

54
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,420
My uncle was full of bluster, yelling
that he'd enlist, but my aunt was against it.

55
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,550
In the end, he never did.

56
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,470
Thanks to that, he didn't get hurt.

57
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,140
Sorry.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,310
What was that apology for, exactly?

59
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,020
Well, uh, you <i>did</i> get hurt.

60
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,820
But why would you feel responsible for my injuries?

61
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,860
I don't, but...

62
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,370
An apology is the act of asking for forgiveness
when you feel responsible for a wrongdoing.

63
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,370
All right, all right! I get it!

64
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,120
<i>From the moment I first met her, all the way up to now,</i>

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,130
<i>I never was able to wrap my
head around Violet Evergarden.</i>

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
<i>I just couldn't understand her.</i>

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,150
Kazaly,
Leidenschaftlich

68
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,280
Yeah, it really is sticky here compared to Leiden.

69
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,570
Aren't you hot in those clothes?

70
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,950
No problem.

71
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,660
I'm used to temperature swings.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,290
Are you, now?

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,040
Iris!

74
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Welcome back.

75
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,630
Welcome home!

76
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,170
I'm so glad you could make it.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,880
Dad, Mom! And Uncle and Aunt too!

78
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,600
What's with your arm?

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,350
What happened to it?

80
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,930
Oh, it was a flight—

81
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,400
A slight miscalculation. I overworked and hurt myself.

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,980
That statement is not factual.

83
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,570
I get a lot of personal requests, you see.

84
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,610
Nor is that one.

85
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,360
Ow!

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,990
Ouch! Crap, it started hurting again!

87
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,120
Work must be rough.
Especially for a star Auto Memoir Doll like you.
Ow, ow!

88
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,910
"Star"?

89
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,950
Jeez, Dad. Tone it down.

90
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,040
But if you're hurt, how are you going to ghostwrite?

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,710
Oh, that?

92
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,750
That's why she's here.

93
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,300
If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

94
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,970
Representing the Auto Memoir Doll service,

95
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,480
I am Violet Evergarden.

96
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,490
Like a toy doll?

97
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,910
Nah, "Doll" is their job title.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,200
That took my breath away for a second.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,500
I guess that's a city Doll for you.

100
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,170
Hey, I'm dressed as a Doll too!

101
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,630
Huh? Oh...

102
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,630
You look good, Iris. The very image of a career woman.

103
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,090
What the heck? Jeez...

104
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,890
Oh, right. Do you know Sara Florent?

105
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,470
She's the client. She's supposed to be here to meet me.

106
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,350
That was your late great-grandma's name.

107
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,110
The request was from me.

108
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,400
I figured I could see you by requesting a ghostwriting.

109
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,860
That's messed—

110
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,610
That makes your request invalid.

111
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,200
As the contract states, we don't accept
requests made under anonymity or pseudonyms.

112
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,620
Have a nice day.

113
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,710
H-Hey, Violet!

114
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,300
If you make a new request, I can accept it here and now.

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Please write your legal name on the form.

116
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,220
What kind of invitations would you like me to write?

117
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,230
Invitations for Iris's birthday party.

118
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,150
Mine?!

119
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,480
Your birthday's the day after tomorrow, remember?

120
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,400
I totally forgot.

121
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,410
We're going to invite a lot of
people and throw one heck of a party.

122
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,330
If it's for the day after tomorrow, I must
start writing immediately to make it in time.

123
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,660
I'll need time for the deliveries, too.

124
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,540
So pretty!

125
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,330
What happened to you?

126
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,750
Stop that.

127
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,550
There's no need for concern.

128
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,550
Do you have a guest list?

129
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,340
Yeah.

130
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,890
Here you go.

131
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,310
Let me take a look.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,810
Is it just me, or are there a lot of guys on this list?

133
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,860
Well, you're all grown up now.

134
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,530
And?

135
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,030
Don't you think it's time you got married?

136
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,240
What's that supposed to mean?

137
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,280
You're our only daughter.

138
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,790
We want you to come back home and settle down.

139
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,790
Quit your Doll work and live here with us.

140
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,920
<i>This</i> is why you called me back?

141
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,920
This is why you lied to me?!

142
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,300
You're lying to us too!

143
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,420
We know you're not "Leiden's most popular Doll."

144
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,590
Just quit already.

145
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,970
Either way, we're throwing this party.

146
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,640
Violet, please address the envelopes too.

147
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,140
Roger.

148
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,900
See this "Emonn Snow"?

149
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,160
Don't send him an invite.

150
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,070
Even though he's on the list?

151
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,740
Yeah.

152
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,990
Why is that?

153
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,160
Doesn't matter why.

154
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,670
Your parents selected this guest list.

155
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,300
I don't believe you have the
right to remove any names from it.

156
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,460
Look, just don't send him one.

157
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,170
But...

158
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,220
This request was for me.

159
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,840
You're only here to help me out. Got that?

160
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,470
Thanks a lot.

161
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,270
I'm done delivering my share.

162
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,230
I've finished as well.

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Well, let's head back and have dinner.

164
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,940
We can't offer you anything
special all the way out here, though.

165
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,280
No problem. You don't have to.

166
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,070
Huh? I meant...

167
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,620
Besides,

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,540
while I don't have a clear reason why,

169
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,880
this scenery strikes me as
"something special" all on its own.

170
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,640
Here you are.

171
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,100
Thank you.

172
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,770
Happy birthday, Iris.

173
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,900
Thanks.

174
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,530
Is your arm okay?

175
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,570
Yeah, it's fine.

176
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,360
You became a Doll in Leiden, right?

177
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,740
Really? That's awesome!

178
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,410
Well, yeah...

179
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,790
Iris.

180
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,160
Got a moment?

181
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,750
We'll talk to you later.

182
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,500
Yeah.

183
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,210
Sorry to interrupt.

184
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,920
Remember him?

185
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,680
Montgomery. I hear he
passed the teacher's license exam.

186
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,640
And apparently, Hans is training to be a shoe craftsman.

187
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,180
Emonn!

188
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,060
Long time no see.

189
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,940
Sorry I'm late.

190
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,320
Happy birthday, Iris.

191
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,830
Why are you here?

192
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,080
Uh, because I got an invite.

193
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,340
You sent him one?

194
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,340
I checked with your mother,
and she said I should send one after all.

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,560
Iris?

196
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Iris!

197
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,240
You did this by sending him that invite.

198
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,870
How is that related to your
sudden downturn in condition?

199
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,960
I told you not to send him one.

200
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,840
Why'd you have to go and do that?

201
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,210
I only carried out my mission.

202
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,380
I didn't want to see him.

203
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,470
Why is that? I won't
understand unless you give a reason.

204
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,940
Because he rejected me!

205
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,820
Do you mean you made advances
toward him, but he turned you down?

206
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,620
You showed your affection
for him, but he pushed you away?

207
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,950
Yeah.

208
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,910
That's right!

209
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,420
I can't believe Iris.

210
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,720
Sorry.

211
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,760
Oh, Violet. How was Iris?

212
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,060
She's crying.

213
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,180
Crying? Why?

214
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,560
Did something happen to her?

215
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,580
Iris?

216
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,620
Are you okay, Iris?

217
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,250
Cheer up.

218
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,090
We'll find you someone better—

219
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,720
You're still going on about that?!
This is all your fault for throwing that stupid party!

220
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,130
I never should've come back!

221
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,180
Food for you.

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,770
You told them?

223
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,440
Told them what?

224
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,690
About Emonn!

225
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,190
I did.

226
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,860
Why would you do that?!

227
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,280
It didn't seem like classified information,

228
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,910
and they were all worried about you.

229
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,450
That doesn't mean...

230
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,210
You really don't understand
how people feel at all, do you?

231
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,130
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,720
I thought I'd come to understand them a little,

233
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,470
but people's emotions are
extremely complicated and delicate.

234
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,520
Not everyone puts all of their feelings into words.

235
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,600
People can be contrary

236
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,860
or at times, untruthful.

237
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,190
I can't decipher them accurately.

238
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,610
It's proving all too difficult for me.

239
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,370
I'm truly sorry.

240
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,370
You don't need to apologize.

241
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,120
I know you had good intentions.

242
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,250
It's not like I understand
everything about how people feel either.

243
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,760
Really?

244
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,590
Yeah, really.

245
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,470
I've known Emonn since we were kids.

246
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,390
He was always sweet and kind to me.

247
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,100
I'd had a crush on him since forever,

248
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,360
and I'd convinced myself that the feeling was mutual.

249
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,110
I always wondered why he wouldn't make the first move.

250
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,870
So right before we graduated school, I told him.

251
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,490
I said, "I love you."

252
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,120
But...

253
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,960
Sorry.

254
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,300
I only see you as an old friend.

255
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,470
I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.

256
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,310
I couldn't stay here after that.

257
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,230
Writing was never my
strong suit, but I worked hard at it,

258
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,730
left for Leiden, and became a Doll there.

259
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,990
It seems "I love you" requires a lot of courage to say.

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,750
So much so that you want to
run away when it isn't reciprocated.

261
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,000
When the major said it,

262
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,590
did he feel the same way?

263
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,340
"The major"?

264
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,880
My commanding officer.

265
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,310
I became a Doll because I wanted
to know what his "I love you" meant.

266
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,890
<i>Violet had been a complete enigma to me,</i>

267
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,390
<i>but right then, I understood her a little.</i>

268
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,400
<i>The major came into her life when
she knew nothing outside of the army</i>

269
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,490
<i>and showed her love.</i>

270
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,160
<i>And now, she's trying to find out what it truly means...</i>

271
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,660
<i>in her own way.</i>

272
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,880
Say, Auto Memoir Doll.

273
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,640
Would you write some letters for me?

274
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,140
What kind of letters?

275
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,640
Apology letters for everyone who attended the party.

276
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,640
Sure.

277
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,150
Make them thoughtful and heartfelt, okay?

278
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,900
Do you want to send one to Emonn as well?

279
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,360
Talk about rubbing salt into the wound...

280
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,740
But yeah, send him one.

281
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,660
And your parents?

282
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Why don't you try telling them how you really feel?

283
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,130
A letter can help you express it.

284
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,170
If you're having trouble speaking from the heart,

285
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,420
a letter can help you do it.

286
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,100
<i>"Dear Dad and Mom,</i>

287
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,940
<i>I'm sorry for ruining the party.</i>

288
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,240
<i>I'll send apology letters to all the invitees.</i>

289
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,870
<i>Also, thank you for making a personal request for me.</i>

290
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,250
<i>In truth, it was my first.</i>

291
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,540
<i>So it made me really happy.</i>

292
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,960
<i>Work is a real handful at times,
but I chose this path for myself,</i>

293
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,050
<i>so I'll give it my best shot.</i>

294
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,300
<i>I'm sorry for making you worry so much over the years.</i>

295
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,020
<i>But I ask that you give me a little more time</i>

296
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,020
<i>and watch over me.</i>

297
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,940
<i>From the future most popular Doll in Leiden</i>

298
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,320
<i>in her first-ever letter to her beloved Dad and Mom—</i>

299
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,820
<i>one that will be remembered for years to come.</i>

300
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,380
Sure you haven't forgotten anything?

301
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,010
Yeah.

302
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,350
If you ever need anything, let us know at once.

303
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,220
I'll be fine.

304
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,350
Also...

305
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,350
Thank you for that letter.

306
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,230
Uh...

307
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,490
She's the one who typed it out.

308
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,780
That's right. I'll hand you the invoice later.

309
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,530
What? You're going to charge me?

310
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,780
Ghostwriting is my job.

311
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,790
How about I buy you lunch for three days?

312
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,540
That isn't enough to cover the fee.

313
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,040
Give me an employee discount!

314
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,380
The train's about to leave.

315
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,790
Iris.

316
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,100
Happy birthday.

317
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,180
Take care.

318
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,070
Did that letter...

319
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,940
Did it help your feelings get through to your parents?

320
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,280
Couldn't you tell by looking at them?

321
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,750
It was a fine letter.

322
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,750
The words you wrote got through to them.

323
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,260
It was a fine letter, okay?

324
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,390
I... wrote... a good letter?

325
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,890
Why are you talking like a machine?

326
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,230
What flowers are those?

327
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,150
Oh, irises.

328
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,400
Take a look.

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,160
You see,

330
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,630
I was born when these flowers were in full bloom.

331
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,510
That's why my parents gave me this name.

332
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,720
What's your name?

333
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,390
Oh...

334
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,180
Can I give you one, then?

335
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,540
Violet...

336
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,250
Your name is Violet.

337
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm sure you'll grow into a
woman just as lovely as those flowers.

338
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:10,010
"You Won't Be a Tool, but a Person Worthy of That Name"

339
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:21,310
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

343
