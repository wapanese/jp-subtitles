1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,980
You will not talk me down!

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,480
All I did was punish him for his act of folly!

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,820
Your virtuous facade doesn't fool me, you devil!

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,740
Sink to the depths of darkness where you belong!

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,790
Taking my life makes you no better.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,080
You will burn in the flames of your sin.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,130
I know. I'll have to bear this cross...

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,470
for the rest of my life!

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,560
Last night's play was incredible.

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,730
You should've come with us, Violet.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,150
If you're referring to <i>The Red Devil</i>,
I'm reading the screenplay right now.

12
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,610
Ah, lucky you.

13
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,780
I'm so envious that you get to
ghostwrite for Oscar Webster.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,120
I mean, that means you'll be
the first to read his new work.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,290
It's going to be his first new production in a while.

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,970
"I know. I'll have to bear this cross...

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,090
for the rest of my life."

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,140
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,860
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,610
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,990
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

22
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,910
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

23
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:52,960
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,550
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,430
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

26
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,810
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

27
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,980
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

28
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,660
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,410
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

30
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,710
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

31
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,960
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:42,970
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

33
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,770
Here.

34
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,520
Ghostwriting requests.

35
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,230
All of these?

36
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,280
Ever since the public love letters,
Violet's been getting a lot more requests.

37
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,320
Say...

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,580
Have you told her about that major yet?

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,540
No.

40
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,170
The thing is, lately there have been times
where it seems like her mind is far away.

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Roswell Province
Nation of Genetrix

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,740
Who is it?

43
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,610
The Auto Memoir Doll service.

44
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,820
The heck's that supposed to be?

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,450
It is a pleasure to meet you.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,620
If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,870
Representing the Auto Memoir Doll service,

48
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,130
I am Violet Evergarden.

49
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,630
<i>There stood a girl.</i>

50
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,800
<i>Not the one I wished I could see again, the one
whose very name is too painful for me to utter,</i>

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,640
<i>but a girl with hair the same shade of gold.</i>

52
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,890
This is a surprise, though.

53
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,690
I didn't expect a child to show up.

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,070
If I am not to your liking,
we can arrange a replacement Doll.

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,530
Nah, it doesn't matter as long as you can type.

56
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm not exactly in the best of health right now.

57
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,120
I know it isn't my place to say, but I'd like to
ask you to refrain from drinking during work.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Please.

59
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,670
I can't write unless I drink!

60
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,920
I'll be the one writing.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,590
Let's start work tomorrow, then.

62
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,680
I see you're quite the handful.

63
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,720
Are we going to work here?

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,600
It's either here or out on the terrace.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,480
I do have a study, but it's cramped and suffocating.

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,020
Then I know what I must do today.

67
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,570
What happened to your arms?

68
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,740
I lost them in the War.

69
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,490
But rest assured, it won't affect my work.

70
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,490
Right.

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
Sir.

72
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,710
I've cleaned things up so that we may work comfortably.

73
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,720
I've brought my own typewriter.
Do you have blank paper?

74
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,010
Nope. There's a store that sells it by
the port, so pick some up from there.

75
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,810
Also, I'd like carbonara for dinner...

76
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,480
Sir, I'm your ghostwriter, not your maid.

77
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,730
Quite the handful indeed.

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,990
Here, all the ingredients you
need for the dish you asked for.

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,490
Thank you.

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,160
What's the matter? Is there something on it?

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,380
No. How exactly do I cook this?

82
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,250
Huh? You crack the shell and take just the yolk...

83
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,260
Yolk?

84
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,560
What are you doing?

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,600
Trying my hand at cooking.

86
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,490
Well...

87
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,990
It's pretty good for your first time.

88
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,580
Aren't you going to eat?

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,700
I will, later.

90
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,500
I see.

91
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,060
What are you doing?

92
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,310
What'd you do with the booze on the shelf?

93
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,820
I hid it.

94
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,240
It will hinder our work, and...

95
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,740
it isn't good for you either.

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,620
I trust you don't mind me holding on to this.

97
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,670
Next, Olive's dialog:

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
"I must cross this valley of fire

99
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,380
if I am to obtain the sword I need to slay the beast."

100
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,090
Direction: "A water sprite appears."

101
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,390
The sprite's dialog:

102
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,220
"I'll extinguish this fire for you.

103
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,100
Then you can cross the valley."

104
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,520
So she'll be able to cross it? Thank goodness.

105
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,650
Direction: "The raging fire disappears."

106
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,280
How does it disappear?

107
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,950
Pull in the red cloth fluttering on stage,

108
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,240
and it'll look like the fire disappeared.

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,870
I see. Understood.

110
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,870
Hey, what do you think?

111
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,460
Is this interesting?

112
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,580
Well...

113
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,290
Well?

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,680
It's a fictional story, but I feel
like I'm experiencing it myself.

115
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,220
Together with this girl called Olive,

116
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm finding joy, feeling sorrow,

117
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,690
and growing anxious.

118
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,560
Why is that?

119
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:33,200
It means you're putting yourself
in the shoes of the protagonist, Olive.

120
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,200
You're empathizing with her.

121
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm relieved to hear you feel that way.

122
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,130
You see, this is my first time writing a play for kids.

123
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,130
After this, Olive will cross the
valley of fire, obtain the sword,

124
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,340
and slay the beast, yes?

125
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,850
Yeah, but at a price. She'll lose
her sprite-summoning powers.

126
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,980
What? No... How does she return home, then?

127
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,480
Her boat was damaged beyond repair.

128
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,480
I haven't figured that out yet.

129
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,820
But you must.

130
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,900
If you don't,

131
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,870
she won't find her way back home to her father.

132
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,790
Have you figured it out now?

133
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,710
It's a beautiful day.

134
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Too beautiful, almost.

135
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,010
Sir.

136
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,600
What is this?

137
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,850
Oh, just a parasol.

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Why do you ask?

139
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,480
I found it very pretty.

140
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,360
I need a break.

141
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,110
Leave me alone for a while, please.

142
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,260
One day...

143
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
One day, I'll show you. I promise!

144
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,300
Knock it off!

145
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,850
Please, stop.

146
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,600
I'm sorry for not asking—

147
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,940
Forget it.

148
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,480
Just... forget it.

149
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Leave.

150
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,900
But the play would be left incomplete.

151
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,910
Olive's story wouldn't reach its conclusion!

152
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,330
Sir, are you hiding something deep down in your heart?

153
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,670
Unfortunately, I lack the ability to understand what it is.

154
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,670
I'm truly sorry.

155
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,430
I...

156
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,930
I can't write anything anymore.

157
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,770
But I realized I need to fix that,

158
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,440
so I decided to complete the
story I told her. The story I told Olivia.

159
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,690
Olivia?

160
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,860
Yes.

161
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,450
My daughter.

162
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,450
When my wife succumbed to illness,

163
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,620
I moved here, to what used to be our
summer vacation home, with my daughter.

164
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,580
I'm sure she was sad and lonely without her mother,

165
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,670
but she never let it show, not for one moment.

166
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,930
In fact, she was always helping
out so I could focus on my work.

167
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,560
And her favorite things were
her frilly parasol and the swans here.

168
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,730
How nice.

169
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,110
I wanna cross this lake too.

170
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,110
Do you think I can walk atop those leaves?

171
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,990
If you hold up your parasol and catch the wind,

172
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,910
you might be able to.

173
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,380
Olivia!

174
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm okay.

175
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm going to walk across this lake, no matter what.

176
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,680
One day, I'll show you. I promise,

177
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,390
Dad!

178
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,140
But then...

179
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,980
After a series of pointless arguments with the doctor,

180
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,990
I decided to bring my daughter back here so
she could spend her remaining days in peace.

181
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
For the first time in a long while, she smiled.

182
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,330
Those were gentle, peaceful days.

183
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,790
But...

184
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,330
I lost my only hope in life.

185
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,460
How many things I hold dear
must God take away from me?

186
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,840
I never knew parting with someone dear to you,

187
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,600
never getting to see them again,

188
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,140
was so sad

189
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,480
and so painful.

190
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,040
I'm sorry about earlier.

191
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,630
Oh, no. I lost my composure when you were in pain.

192
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,590
I should be the one apologizing.

193
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,050
I'll complete it...

194
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,590
Olive's story.

195
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,350
She'll return home and reunite with her father.

196
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,060
No matter how difficult the adventure
may be, it must have a happy ending.

197
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,690
Both the protagonist and the
audience deserve to be happy—

198
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,810
No, I'll make sure that they are.

199
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,820
The beast crumbles to the ground. Olive's dialog:

200
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,820
"I have finally slain the beast."

201
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,870
Water sprite: "You did well."

202
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,080
Wind sprite: "We must return to the world of the fae."

203
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,500
Fire sprite: "This is goodbye."

204
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,170
Olive stands still, lost for words.

205
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,880
Now...

206
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,050
How do we get Olive home from here?

207
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,520
Her boat is broken, so a plane?

208
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,810
I'd like something more magical.

209
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,110
A bird would be able to fly back home.

210
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,110
How about using her parasol to fly?

211
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,650
You can't fly with a parasol.

212
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,030
She can. The wind sprite
shows up one last time and says...

213
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,040
"Olive, open your parasol wide."

214
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,000
Could you open that one for me?

215
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,050
"That parasol will be your wings. If you
fly too high, the wind will carry you astray.

216
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,300
So ride the waves over the
ocean, step on the rocks in the river,

217
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,680
walk on the leaves floating atop
the lake, and find your way home."

218
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,970
That's a wonderful idea.

219
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,470
Right?

220
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,930
Once she gets back, she'll see her father again.

221
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,980
And after crossing the ocean to return home,
what do you think she'll say to him first?

222
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,400
"I'm home"?

223
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,950
No, "Dad"?

224
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,700
Are you stuck again?

225
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,040
Could you go over there and walk this way?

226
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,000
I want to picture the scene.

227
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,870
Do you just want me to walk?

228
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,840
If possible, walk on the leaves floating atop the lake.

229
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,090
Understood.

230
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,470
Uh, I wasn't serious about that.

231
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,610
<i>How nice.</i>

232
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,120
<i>I wanna cross this lake too.</i>

233
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,620
<i>Do you think I can walk atop those leaves?</i>

234
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,290
<i>One day...</i>

235
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,130
One day, I'll show you. I promise,

236
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,000
Dad!

237
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,600
<i>I wanted her to keep calling me
that thousands upon thousands of times.</i>

238
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,190
<i>I wish she hadn't died.</i>

239
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>I wanted her to live on... and grow up...</i>

240
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,410
<i>How I wish it were so!</i>

241
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,010
Did you see that?

242
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,520
I'm sure I managed three steps across!

243
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Sir?

244
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,770
What is the matter?

245
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,820
Do you feel ill?

246
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,990
<i>After she made that miracle happen, I said to her,</i>

247
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,700
<i>"I was sure there was no God,</i>

248
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,620
<i>but if there is one, it must be you."</i>

249
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,670
Are you sure?

250
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,050
Can I really have this parasol?

251
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,840
Yeah.

252
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,630
I thought I could jump farther than I did...

253
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,050
That was more than enough.

254
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,640
You fulfilled the promise my late daughter made to me.

255
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,100
The promise... she made to you?

256
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,270
Well, then.

257
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,780
Thank you for using the Auto Memoir Doll service.

258
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,030
No, thank you,

259
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,950
Violet Evergarden.

260
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,920
<i>With your bloodstained hands
that have taken countless lives,</i>

261
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,430
<i>you write letters that bring people together?</i>

262
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,850
You haven't realized that everything
you've done so far has sparked a flame

263
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,350
that is now burning you up.

264
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,190
But I'm not on fire.

265
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,690
You most definitely are.

266
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,900
You'll understand what I'm saying one day.

267
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,200
And, for the first time, you'll notice all your burn marks.

268
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,290
Major...

269
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,920
You must live...

270
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,920
Do I have the right to?

271
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,800
...and be free.

272
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,510
Do I have any right to after I
killed so many people as a weapon?

273
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,390
I must have prevented them
from keeping promises of their own!

274
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,690
Promises they made to loved ones of their own!

275
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,190
I'm not on fire.

276
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,690
I am!

277
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,190
No, I am not.

278
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,190
I most definitely am!

279
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,700
Everything I've done so far has
sparked a flame that is now burning me up!

280
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,260
Oh?

281
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,890
If it isn't Violet!

282
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,890
Mrs. Evergarden... I'm terribly sorry
for my behavior the last time we met.

283
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,940
I can't apologize enough for the hurt I caused.

284
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,900
Violet... Oh, it's fine.

285
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,820
There's no need to apologize.

286
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,450
I'm so glad to see you've grown up.

287
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,910
Now the late Gilbert's soul can rest in peace.

288
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,210
"Late"?

289
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,300
You told me he was alive, didn't you?

290
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,680
The major is all right, isn't he?!

291
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,560
That's...

292
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,310
Please tell me he's still alive.

293
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,810
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,820
I didn't have the heart to break it to you.

295
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,320
After the final battle at Intens,

296
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,030
you were found lying alone outside the church.

297
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,410
He must've pushed you out in
the moment before it got bombed.

298
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,090
We couldn't locate or identify his body,
but we did find his dog tag in the rubble.

299
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,170
And so, he was considered killed in action.

300
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,590
So we don't know?

301
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,260
But given the situation...

302
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm sure the major is alive and well.

303
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Violet...

304
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,020
He's fine!

305
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,440
Please understand, Violet.

306
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,310
He's not...

307
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,150
I don't understand. I don't understand it at all.

308
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,240
Why was I the only one found? That makes no sense!

309
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,530
He was right beside me, and he told me...

310
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,830
Violet, as painful as the truth is, you must accept it.

311
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,410
Violet!

312
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:21,270
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

313
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:42,880
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

314
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:53,810
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

315
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:05,190
yasashisa de amitsuzuketa yurikago de asu e yukou
I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

316
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:11,530
hare no hi mo ame no hi ni mo
Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

317
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,620

I will be there to protect you

318
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:22,210

A treasure more valuable than all

319
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,550
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

320
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,680
namae no nai hana wa
A nameless flower

321
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,890
shizuka ni nemuru yo
Lies in peace
