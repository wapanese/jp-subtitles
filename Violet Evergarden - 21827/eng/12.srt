1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,860
The anti-peace faction that gained traction in
Ctrigall has been almost completely suppressed.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,860
However, some remnants managed to escape

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,490
and are likely looking to meet up with other powers.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,200
As such, we're requesting the assistance of your squad,

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,290
Naval Captain Dietfried Bougainvillea.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,080
Why ask me and not the army?

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,090
I belong to the navy.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,760
As you're aware,

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,850
the future of the continent rests on the
upcoming peace treaty signing ceremony.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,890
We want to take all possible
measures to prevent any interference.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,900
In addition, the army's special task force has disbanded,

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,360
leaving us shorthanded in case of an emergency.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,190
But fortunately, your squad is still active,

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,490
and the navy is perfect for this operation.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,830
Now that the man who used to clean up
your messes is gone, you ask his older brother?

16
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,590
The radicals are certain to
try and disrupt the peace talks.

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,930
Do you have some idea what they may be planning?

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,520
In three days, an ambassador and a civilian
Doll will be taking the transcontinental railroad

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,100
from Distery to Gardariki as envoys of peace.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,940
This is a risky move.

21
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,610
We can't have another war breaking out.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,530
You may use the troops in the area as you please.

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,200
Foil their plans, no matter what.

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,370
"Peace," huh?

25
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,170
Each time I learn a new word
shiranai kotoba wo oboeteyuku tabi

26
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,890
The fog begins to clear
omokage no naka te wo nobasu no

27
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,640
But there may well be words
dakedo hitori de wa wakaranai kotoba mo

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,020
I cannot understand alone
aru no kamoshirenai

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,940
"Goodbye" is a bitter pill to swallow
sayonara wa nigakute

30
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,990
And "I love you" is strangely distant
aishiteru wa tooi nioi ga shita

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,580
This indescribable emotion welling inside
tatoeyou no nai kono omoi wa

32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,460
Scares me to the bone
totemo kowakute

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,840
But also feels very dear to me
dakedo totemo itooshikute

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,010
Why am I crying?
watashi nande naiterundarou

35
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:48,690
What reason do I give my heart?
kokoro ni nante kotaetara ii

36
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,440
Words don't always tell the whole story
kotoba wa itsudemo kataru demo nakute

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,740
Sometimes, they are simply there
soko ni aru bakari

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,990
Building up rapidly
tsunoru bakari

39
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:11,000
And making me miss you
watashi wa anata ni aitakunaru

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,720
Are you sure you only want to be delivered to Distery?

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,470
If I can resupply, I don't mind
taking you all the way to Leiden.

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,350
I mean, you had a hell of a time back there.

43
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,980
Well, let me know if you change your mind.

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,420
You can feel the tension in the air.

45
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,460
Shows how important this mission is.

46
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,930
We're accompanying that ambassador to Gardariki,

47
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,600
where we'll help him with the
public peace correspondence?

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,350
Yeah. And if it goes well,

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,650
the War will be over for good.

50
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,280
E-Excuse me! You're from C.H. Postal, yes?

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,660
Yeah.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,740
I'll lay out our schedule for you.

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,460
Our ship left Port Leiden at 1100 hours.

54
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,540
From Nahalar, we'll sail up the River Rentler,

55
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,590
then use the canals from Machtig,

56
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,640
and arrive at Distery in
Eckstreme at 1200 hours tomorrow.

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,430
There, you will board a
special train with the ambassador.

58
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,810
The reason we're sailing partway is to ensure your safety.

59
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,310
Thank you.

60
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,150
Is your boss not coming?

61
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,950
I can't believe he retired the moment the War ended.

62
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,540
Who are you?

63
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,750
C-Captain Bougainvillea.

64
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,250
Bougainvillea?

65
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,500
Wasn't that Violet's major...

66
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm his older brother.

67
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,760
What do you want?

68
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,550
Dismissed.

69
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,140
Sir!

70
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,970
My mission is to escort you guys to your destination

71
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,430
and ensure that the ceremony goes smoothly.

72
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,270
Are you the only civilian Doll coming along?

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,230
That's right.

74
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,780
If you're wondering about Violet, she's not on this job.

75
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,030
That's music to my ears.

76
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,280
Though I <i>am</i> surprised she's still working as a Dollâ€”

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,500
that defective, wannabe human.

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,330
Why, you...

79
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,540
Yeah, she may be defective,

80
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,670
but she's giving it her all.

81
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,050
And her letters have given hope and salvation to many.

82
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,720
Huh?

83
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,720
The letters Violet writes are magical.

84
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,100
They slide unnoticed into your heart

85
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,980
and let you express your true feelings.

86
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,420
So you made it.

87
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,300
1,041 of us Gardariki soldiers who
escaped from the internment camp

88
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,460
are reporting for duty.

89
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,760
Thanks for coming all this way.

90
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,550
Sir.

91
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,180
Please don't mention it, Brigadier General Merkulov.

92
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,930
You saved me not only in Intens,

93
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,390
but also from the internment camp,
so I'm very grateful to you.

94
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,810
Intens, huh?

95
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,070
That humiliation...

96
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,280
I can never forget it.

97
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,330
I'm also pleased to report that
our decoy strategy was a success.

98
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,120
The imbeciles in the south probably
think we were wiped out in Ctrigall.

99
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,710
Good.

100
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,090
We'll take this chance to destroy the
transport between the north and south

101
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,760
and reclaim Intens in the ensuing chaos.

102
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,100
That's the railroad.

103
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,730
You can follow it all the way to Leidenschaftlich.

104
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,150
This thing will bring our
country food and other resources.

105
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,950
The north and the south will be bound by peace!

106
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,620
Peace...

107
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,710
Yeah. Won't be any need for war no more.

108
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,840
And my work will get super busy.

109
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,340
I might even get to transport your letters.

110
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,450
Dad!

111
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,370
Welcome back!

112
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,580
Amy...

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,290
I'm home.

114
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,340
I hope she'll be back soon.

115
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,640
We've received reports of fires along
the train tracks in the past 24 hours.

116
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,850
Do we know where?

117
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,020
I'll have them check.

118
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,190
So they've made their move.

119
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,690
This is the Great Grandezza Bridge.

120
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,190
Without this,
the transcontinental railroad wouldn't exist.

121
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,450
Intens...

122
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,130
What the...

123
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,930
Fires?

124
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,930
No!

125
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,350
There are signs of explosions!

126
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,450
Let the brigadier general know
that we've infiltrated the train.

127
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,370
Roger.

128
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,500
Why won't it move out?

129
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,830
There was a fire nearby.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,050
Vandal!

131
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,880
Let me down by that train!

132
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,180
Don't be absurd!

133
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,680
A colleague of mine is aboard! Please!

134
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,350
Fine. Hold on tight!

135
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,690
Seven fires since yesterday,
and that's only the ones we've confirmed.

136
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,490
They're all near the railroad,

137
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,900
and they're gradually headed this way.

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,990
The anti-peace faction?

139
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah. They'll target this train next.

140
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,540
Send a recon squad along the tracks
ahead to see what the enemy is up to.

141
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,710
Understood.

142
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,420
I'll have them ready immediately.

143
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,260
Violet!

144
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,800
Why are you here?

145
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,260
Where are you going?

146
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,060
Huh? To the peace treaty
signing ceremony in Gardariki...

147
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,350
I saw signs of explosions nearby.

148
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
I will accompany you.

149
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,150
No. You return to HQ.

150
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,610
But...

151
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,530
Why are <i>you</i> here?

152
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,370
I spotted her on my way
back from my mission in Ctrigall.

153
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,000
Ctrigall?

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,620
I ran into the remnants of the
Gardariki Army during that mission.

155
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,000
Did you really?

156
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,250
Yes.

157
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,420
Give me the details.

158
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,630
Violet!

159
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,060
I got visual on signs of explosions
and nine pillars of smoke from midair.

160
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,820
So they are planning to slow
down the train and attack it directly.

161
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,660
We'll depart as soon as the
recon team gives us the all-clear.

162
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,740
You get off this train at once!

163
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,160
Given the situation, I cannot leave.

164
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,290
Your orders, Captain!

165
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,710
I see you're still a tool who wants to be ordered around.

166
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,590
No.

167
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
I no longer...

168
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,730
Begone!

169
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,950
Message from Navy Captain Bougainvillea.

170
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,700
Someone, likely the anti-peace faction,
has been conducting acts of sabotage along the railroad.

171
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,540
They seem to be targeting the ambassador's train.

172
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,870
Tell him to protect the ambassador at all costs.

173
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,830
Have all our troops ready to sortie.

174
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,920
Contact our neighbors too.

175
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,250
We must avoid another war, no matter what!

176
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,380
Brigadier General Merkulov!

177
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,630
Message from the advance unit.

178
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,380
Right.

179
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,220
A peace ambassador is taking
a special train from Distery,

180
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,810
and Isidor has managed to sneak aboard.

181
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,650
We'll attack that train and send
the peace talks back to square one.

182
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,570
There was an explosion at
Distery Station after we departed.

183
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,320
No casualties.

184
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,200
As I thought.

185
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,040
We got away this time,
but we must keep close watch around the clock.

186
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,750
Don't let anyone near the train.

187
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,460
Where do you think they'll attack?

188
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,210
Somewhere the train needs to slow down,

189
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,630
and somewhere it'll be hard to make repairs.

190
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
The Great Grandezza Bridge?

191
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,350
It took ten years to build those tunnels.

192
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,350
If it's destroyed, the transcontinental
railroad will be out of commission for a long time.

193
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,700
The only passengers on this train are in the
first and second compartments of the third car.

194
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,450
There's a young man in the first,

195
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,330
and a middle-aged man in the second.

196
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,790
That one's probably the ambassador.

197
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,920
All the troops are in the fourth car and beyond.

198
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,010
Very well. Commence the operation.

199
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,760
Go!

200
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,340
Sir!

201
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,980
Who are you guys?

202
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,490
Enemy attack!

203
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,960
At the rear of car four! Hurry!

204
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,540
Separate them.

205
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,750
Hurry up.

206
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,600
They were planning to take
the troops out of the picture?

207
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,850
What was that shaking?

208
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,390
Violet?

209
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,310
I'll bring the ambassador.

210
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,980
You two stay here.

211
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,160
There are a few enemies to the rear.

212
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,700
I heard noises from the front too.

213
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,540
We have next to no troops left.

214
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,080
I'll stop this train.

215
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,540
You keep the passengers alive.

216
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,670
I understand, sir.

217
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,920
So you really do want to be ordered around.

218
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,050
No.

219
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,640
Yes.

220
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,060
You're a tool.

221
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,770
If I order you to massacre the enemy,

222
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,650
you'll do it without batting an eye, right?

223
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,560
I won't kill anyone.

224
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,440
I don't need a weapon.

225
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,620
What are you if not a tool?

226
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,080
You're Leidenschaftlich's...

227
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,000
We meet again.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,090
What happened to the Ctrigallan brat from back then?

229
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,180
Did he die like a dog?

230
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,600
No need for you to get angry.

231
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,810
Nobody would be saddened by his death.

232
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Luckyâ€”

233
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,290
A woman?

234
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,460
Go.

235
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,430
I remember now.

236
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,430
I've met her on the battlefield before.

237
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,350
Leidenschaftlich's combat doll.

238
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,610
Why are you doing this?

239
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,740
To take back the things and
the people you've trampled upon.

240
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,870
Are you trying to start another war?

241
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,710
Has the War really ended in your mind?

242
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,130
It seems you're not entirely convinced yourself.

243
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,170
That violence still lingers
like burn marks within you and I.

244
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,800
For us, it will never end.

245
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,430
But it has ended in reality.

246
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,140
Like hell it has!

247
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,600
We all fought dreaming of the glory awaiting us,
living or dead, once the War was over.

248
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,230
But what happened in reality?

249
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,860
The brass are your puppets now,

250
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,990
and we soldiers, who risked our
lives and fought to protect our people,

251
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,620
are called useless and pelted by stones.

252
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,000
We were betrayed and abandoned
by everything we ever believed in.

253
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,370
Don't we have the right to destroy it all in return?

254
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,010
I don't want to kill anyone anymore.

255
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,260
Attack.

256
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,440
Is this important to you?

257
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,370
Hey, you all right?

258
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,580
What the hell is going on?

259
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,260
<i>Major. </i>

260
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,220
<i>I... </i>

261
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,480
Die!

262
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,030
Major?

263
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,740
What are you doing?

264
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,170
Brigadier General! Why, you!

265
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,090
Captain Dietfried...

266
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Where do you get off not killing
when you can't even protect yourself?

267
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Is that the kind of person
my brother Gil died to protect?!

268
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,060
I don't want to kill anyone anymore.

269
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,320
The major's orders were to live on, not kill!

270
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,870
A combat doll that doesn't fight
or kill is nothing but dead weight!

271
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,330
That's why you couldn't protect Gilbert!

272
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,580
You killed Gil!

273
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,750
So you should die too! Hurry up and die already!

274
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:30,220
Even so, the major told me to live on.

275
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,100
I wanted to protect him!

276
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,360
I wanted to protect him just as much!

277
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,900
Brigadier General!

278
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,950
Isidor!

279
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:21,270
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

280
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:42,880
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

281
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:53,810
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

282
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:05,190
yasashisa de amitsuzuketa yurikago de asu e yukou
I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

283
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:11,530
hare no hi mo ame no hi ni mo
Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

284
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,620
anata wo mamoru tame ni
I will be there to protect you

285
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:27,550
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

286
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,680
namae no nai hana wa
A nameless flower

287
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,890
shizuka ni nemuru yo
Lies in peace
