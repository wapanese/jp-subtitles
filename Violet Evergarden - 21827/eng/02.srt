1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,650
Four Years Ago

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,650
Port Stimmer,
Leidenschaftlich

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,650
Colonel Dietfried Bougainvillea,

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,160
your younger brother is here to see you.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,660
Hey, Gil.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,160
Have you been well? I see you still
have that stodgy look on your face.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,420
You look just like Dad.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,170
You haven't changed either, Brother.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,050
Father would never have approved of that hairstyle.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,340
He'd probably have lopped it off with his sword.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,550
Anything but that.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,800
You're always like this.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,930
I'm glad he died.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,020
Sorry.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,230
Don't look at me like that.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,280
I have a wonderful gift for you
tonight, to celebrate your promotion.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,030
Listen.

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,030
This is but a weapon.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,280
Use it without mercy or compassion.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,660
Open it.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,340
Hey, get up.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,600
I found her on the northeastern front.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,610
Her name is...

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,360
Violet Evergarden.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,990
She'll be working as a trainee
Auto Memoir Doll from today.

26
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,990
Show her the ropes and the tricks of the trade.

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,240
Sure.

28
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,740
<i>The blank-faced girl before me </i>

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,580
<i>looked just like a doll—</i>

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,130
<i>like the namesake of the job she performed.</i>

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,300
<i>Like a mechanical doll.</i>

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,510
Uh, first off,

33
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,260
how much do you know
about an Auto Memoir Doll's job?

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,520
It entails writing letters and
the like as per the clients' requests.

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,520
Colonel Hodgins—

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,060
I mean, the boss told me.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,480
Precisely.

38
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,980
I can't say I fully understand it yet,

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
but I should be able to carry out my missions.

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,070
This job ain't that easy!

41
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,410
And what do you mean, missions?

42
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,580
Iris, just focus on your work.

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,790
Okay.

44
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,540
Oh, right. I haven't introduced
you to the other Dolls yet, have I?

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,880
By the way, "Doll" is—

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,050
The short-form address for "Auto Memoir Doll"?

47
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,920
I realized that the other day.

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
Precisely.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
The girl from before?

50
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,100
She's Iris, a rookie who just finished her training course.

51
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,680
And this is Erica.

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,350
She and I have been in this business for ages,

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,190
but since this company wasn't founded too long ago,

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,980
we're basically all newcomers here.

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,940
I don't think that's even close.

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,950
Violet, how are you with a typewriter?

57
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,450
I've never used one.

58
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,960
Let's begin with typing practice, then.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,250
And she wants to be a Doll?

60
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,380
Iris, could you get us the manual?

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,800
Right away.

62
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,340
Uh, take a seat.

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Roger.

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,520
You should take off your gloves.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,270
Right.

66
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,530
Will you be okay?

67
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,070
No problem.

68
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,370
I see.

69
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,580
Give it a shot, then.

70
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,830
You place the paper like this,
and then you turn the knob to wind it around.

71
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,710
Place your index fingers on F
and J and press down on them.

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,340
Okay.

73
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,390
Yes, like that.

74
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,720
That's the way.

75
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,480
Next, memorize the finger placements for each letter.

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,730
Try following this manual.

77
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,590
H-Hey, Violet?

78
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,600
Violet, stop!

79
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,230
Could you, er,

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
keep it down?

81
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,780
Thank you very much!

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,290
That's 1.2 libre, so it'll be 10 colis.

83
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,210
Thank you very much.

84
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,630
Finally lunch!

85
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,290
Nerine, Lilian.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
Let's eat together.

87
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,590
I bought noodles. There's enough for you guys too.

88
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,720
No thanks.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,180
And don't show up at the counter all sweaty.

90
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,690
What the heck was that?

91
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,940
A man pours his blood, sweat,
and tears into his work, and he gets no praise?

92
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,610
And "don't show up"? What the hell?

93
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,320
Why are women so calculating these days?

94
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,200
And all that perfume!

95
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,950
I bet they're trying to reel in a
couple rich guys at the counter.

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,710
Let it go, boy.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,330
Forget it. I've had it with working women.

98
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,500
Hey, you fellas want noodles?

99
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,260
No. And stop calling us fellas.

100
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,850
I'll gladly share your noodles.

101
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,100
Aw, another day of typing addresses?

102
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,360
Both afternoon bookings personally requested Cattleya.

103
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,110
You okay?

104
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,690
I-I'm fine.

105
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,780
I come all the way to Leiden and start working as a Doll,

106
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,530
but each and every day, I'm either writing addresses

107
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,540
or letters seeking information
about people who went MIA.

108
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,830
Nothing but that crap.

109
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,500
Yeah.

110
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,130
That reminds me. Apparently,
that newbie was in the army too.

111
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,510
But she's just a kid.

112
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,920
Oh, so that's why.

113
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,340
Why appoint her as a Doll?

114
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,680
She's so aloof, and I bet there's
not a tactful bone in her body.

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,970
There's no way she's cut out for this.

116
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,770
Man, I wanna write something exciting!

117
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,900
For a celebrity! Like an actress's secret love letter!

118
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,820
But Cattleya takes all of those.

119
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,490
How's Violet?

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
I asked her to lunch,

121
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,240
but she said she needed no "replenishment."

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,370
She's glued to the typewriter, practicing.

123
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,830
I see.

124
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,090
Sorry for all this.

125
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,380
Then you can make it up by taking me out to dinner,

126
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,300
Claudia!

127
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,550
Don't call me by that name!

128
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,140
I know your parents wanted a girl,
but that was just cruel of them.

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,930
I couldn't handle calling out a woman's name in bed.

130
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,770
Stop it, please! I'm sorry!

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,020
I can't treat you anytime soon.

132
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,240
No pay for me this month.

133
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm done writing the addresses.

134
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,800
Good work.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,840
I'll send them over to Deliveries.

136
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,050
Please do.

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,300
You should call it a day too, Violet.

138
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,140
Let me see.

139
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,730
My, you've improved a lot.

140
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,100
Impressive.

141
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,690
This weapon is what's impressive.

142
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,560
"Weapon"?

143
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,440
I guess. You could say it's a weapon that lets
us working women fight in the wider society.

144
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,700
You can accompany a Doll
and see how they work tomorrow.

145
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm going on a house call now.

146
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,580
If a client requests it, we even visit their
home or workplace to ghostwrite for them.

147
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,250
May I take one with me as well?

148
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,710
A typewriter? Where?

149
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,590
My quarters. For training,

150
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,970
and also...

151
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,610
Gilbert's address?

152
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,610
Yes.

153
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,860
I wish to report to him that
I've assumed a ghostwriting post

154
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,870
and have begun training for it.

155
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,990
The major must still be busy.

156
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,250
I can't see him yet, can I?

157
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,540
Yeah...

158
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,130
Got it. I'll send this out for you.

159
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,880
So, how is your training? Going well?

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,090
It is.

161
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,350
No problem.

162
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,600
As you know,

163
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm having a hard time getting
through each day as it comes.

164
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,560
"As you're aware, I require more funds..."

165
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,730
You spelled that incorrectly.

166
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,650
Also mention that I'll repay it at two clore per month.

167
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,360
"Every month..."

168
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,910
At two clore per month,

169
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,450
it will take about 120 years to repay the sum in full.

170
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,450
Will either of you live that long?

171
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,790
He's normally a very good boy.

172
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,880
But he does lose his temper at times.

173
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,630
"We apologize for the harm your dear child suffered."

174
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,130
Did I not raise him right?

175
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,180
"We promise to discipline him more firmly..."

176
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,140
Where?
"We promise to discipline him more firmly..."

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,430
Where did I go wrong?

178
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,350
Uh...

179
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,810
You're stalling the work,

180
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,190
so please cease crying immediately.

181
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,600
Wha—

182
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,400
What the hell is this?

183
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
"I know this is a selfish request"?

184
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
What do you mean, selfish?!

185
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,780
And "I have no excuse for the delay"?

187
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,120
Why are you making it sound like it was all my fault?!

188
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,580
Who do you think you are?

189
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
She's Erica.

190
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,670
I wasn't asking for her name!

191
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,420
Anyway, I don't like this letter!

192
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
I ain't paying for it!

193
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,470
Withholding payment for a service
because you don't like it is against the law.

194
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,890
What is it that you don't like, and why?

195
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,010
Out of my way.

196
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,930
We need a clear, precise explanation.

197
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,430
Please be prompt.

198
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,690
I've received quite a few complaints from customers.

199
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,530
Was there a problem?

200
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,740
Well, uh...

201
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,240
Are you okay?

202
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,620
There are no issues with my health.

203
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,990
I mean, how are you adjusting to Doll work?

204
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,040
I am devoting myself to my training.

205
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,210
I-Is that so?

206
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,460
If I may...

207
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,670
We have no more bookings for the day.

208
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,090
The Chamber of Commerce and
Industry's roster needs to be prepared,

209
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,300
but I'll work on it with her.

210
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,300
Type out the company name,

211
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,810
address, and industry sector.

212
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,310
Roger that.

213
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,110
Hey.

214
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,360
Why did you choose this line of work?

215
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,740
I...

216
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,110
Oh.

217
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,610
Nobody home?

218
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,740
Welcome, ma'am.

219
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Are you looking for a ghostwriter?

220
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,080
Why else would I be here?

221
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,920
Pardon me.

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
If it pleases you,

223
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,420
we would be honored to write anything you request.

224
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,630
The Auto Memoir Doll service—

225
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,930
Is the Doll named Cattleya Baudelaire here?

226
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,430
She is currently out on a house call.

227
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,310
Really? I'd heard that she was the best one for the job.

228
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,390
Oh, well.

229
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,350
Someone asked me out, you see.

230
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,150
He's a man who founded an automobile company,

231
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,530
saying the age of personal vehicles was upon us.

232
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,150
I see...

233
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,280
But I'm not that easy.

234
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,950
I don't want him to think I'm a loose woman.

235
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm not sure I follow.

236
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, he's not that special,
and I don't have any feelings for him.

237
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,420
But I may consider it if he shows that he truly loves me.

238
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,590
I want to send a refined, romantic letter.

239
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,260
Write it for me.

240
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,680
Um...

241
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,770
Oh? Will you write it for me?

242
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,190
Roger.

243
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,920
What was <i>with</i> that letter?!

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,460
Please calm down, ma'am.

245
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,170
Iris!

246
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,500
Get her some tea!

247
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,800
R-Right away!

248
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,680
I wrote it according to your request.

249
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,720
Like hell you did!

250
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,600
He got angry and sent it back to me!

251
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,720
Why don't you read out what you wrote for us?

252
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,730
"I read your letter, but I currently feel nothing for you.

253
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,980
Also, you're lacking in affection and sincerity.

254
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,120
Keep in mind that I happen to
be a complex and dignified woman

255
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:16,120
and try again once you've
acquired enough funds and presents."

256
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,130
What is the issue?

257
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,460
I'm terribly sorry!

258
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,090
That was a bit too straightforward.

259
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,340
I wanted to be with him.

260
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,270
But if I accepted right away, he'd think I was too easy.

261
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,730
Doesn't every woman want
to make her man pursue her?

262
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,440
I loved him too, you know!

263
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,030
What will you have?

264
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,700
Water, warm or otherwise,
will provide ample hydration.

265
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,210
Two floral teas, please.

266
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,460
Certainly.

267
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,090
We shouldn't have let you
take up that job right off the bat.

268
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,970
I fail to understand.

269
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,350
I wrote the letter that best reflected the client's wishes.

270
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,100
There are two sides to words.

271
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,610
What's spoken isn't necessarily all there is to it.

272
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,690
It's a human weakness.

273
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,820
We tend to test others to reaffirm our worth.

274
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,120
How contrary, right?

275
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,590
I think I'll visit the addressee and apologize to him.

276
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,350
Major?

277
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
Major!

278
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,240
Major Gilbert!

279
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,830
Hup.

280
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,370
Hey!

281
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,840
What's up?

282
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,050
You alone?

283
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,340
You look out of sorts. Are you eating properly?

284
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
There is no problem with my nutrition intake.

285
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,350
Did you mess up at work, then?

286
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
You should just come back to Deliveries.

287
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,610
Deliveries won't do.

288
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,820
You should drop that obsession with
Doll work and look for something else.

289
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
I should think about it too.

290
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,540
Hodgins was complaining about no pay this month.

291
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
Our company might be in trouble.

292
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,900
May I ask you a question?

293
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,030
Huh?

294
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,530
Am I not suited to being an Auto Memoir Doll?

295
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,910
You could say the same about me.

296
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm not asking about you.

297
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,550
Then no, you're not.
Why did you want to do this in the first place?

298
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,930
I want to know what "I love you" means.

299
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,430
That's it?

300
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,560
That's it.

301
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm aware that it is an
expression of a particular emotion.

302
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,570
But I don't know why the major suddenly said it to me.

303
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,410
And I want to know.

304
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,330
Even if I'm not suited to this work,

305
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,540
I want to continue with it.

306
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,050
We have towels in the dressing room.

307
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,270
Either way, I don't think Violet can be a Doll.

308
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,230
We're still a new company,

309
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,150
but Cattleya is crazy popular.

310
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,530
We can't afford to tank our reputation
when things are starting to look up.

311
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,320
You should let Violet go.

312
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,820
Nah. Give her some more...

313
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,410
Excuse me!

314
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,780
Erica?

315
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,000
And Violet?

316
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,370
What happened to you two?

317
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,380
I... I don't think there's any need to fire her!

318
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,630
Violet, she...

319
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,720
Her typing is quick and precise,

320
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,640
so she can handle basic tasks like
writing addresses and preparing rosters.

321
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,020
She'll eventually learn more things,

322
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,140
and one day she'll be capable of ghostwriting letters.

323
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,900
Please,

324
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,110
don't fire her.

325
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,570
That's contrary.

326
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,410
You said yourself I wasn't suited for this mission.

327
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,660
You're being contrary.

328
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,670
<i>I'm the one who isn't suited
to being an Auto Memoir Doll. </i>

329
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,930
<i>That's why I got so worked
up and spoke out on her behalf.</i>

330
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,770
<i>The instrument that would later become the typewriter</i>

331
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,570
<i>was invented by Professor Orland,
a leader in the field of letterpress printing.</i>

332
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:26,580
<i>He made it for his author wife Molly
after she went blind and became unable to write,</i>

333
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,950
<i>but he called it an "Auto Memoir Doll"—</i>

334
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,210
<i>the term that now symbolizes the ghostwriting business.</i>

335
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,960
<i>Meeting that girl brought it all back to me.</i>

336
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,880
<i>The dream that I nearly forgot,</i>

337
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,470
<i>and the feelings that had been buried deep inside of me.</i>

338
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,980
<i>Just like how Mrs. Orland's novel touched my heart... </i>

339
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,350
I'm closing up shop. That okay?

340
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,730
Oh, sure.

341
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,110
<i>I pray that I too...</i>

342
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,950
<i>will one day be able to write
letters that can move people's hearts.</i>

343
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,670
All done!

344
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,670
What do you think?

345
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,970
Stand up, Violet.

346
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,550
Okay.

347
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,850
Great.

348
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,190
You look wonderful.

349
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,980
I knew it would suit you.

350
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,980
Oh, also...

351
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,820
One last thing.

352
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,820
Sorry it took so long.

353
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,280
Open it.

354
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm opening it.

355
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,040
This is it.

356
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,790
This is the brooch the major gave me!

357
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,590
I found it for sale on the black market.

358
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,470
Somebody must've stolen it from your belongings.

359
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,220
I know!

360
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,180
Violet,

361
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,140
would you like to join a Doll training course?

362
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,360
They have intensive ones for newcomers.

363
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,190
Iris went to one, too.

364
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,190
The teachers were crazy strict, though.

365
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm sure it'll help.

366
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,200
Ah, so that brooch was where
your pay for this month went?

367
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,950
Thank you so very much!

368
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,670
So who is this major she mentioned?

369
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,470
Gilbert.

370
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,470
A friend of mine from officer school.

371
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,020
One of the Bougainvillea.

372
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,770
Like the marquis?

373
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,700
Man, for a pampered rich kid,

374
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,280
he had real character.

375
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,990
"Had"?

376
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,680
He's...

377
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,020
"Never Coming Back"

378
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:51,320
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

379
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:12,930
ichiwa no tori ga naiteiru
A sparrow cries out

380
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:23,850
namae no nai sora ni watashi wo sagashite
Looking for me within a nameless sky

381
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:35,240
yasashisa de amitsuzuketa yurikago de asu e yukou
I will head for tomorrow in this cradle woven from kindness

382
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,580
hare no hi mo ame no hi ni mo
Be it a day of rain or a day of sunshine

383
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,670
anata wo mamoru tame ni
I will be there to protect you

384
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:57,600
kakegae no nai takaramono
A treasure more valuable than all

385
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,730
namae no nai hana wa
A nameless flower

386
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,940
shizuka ni nemuru yo
Lies in peace
