1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,100
Leidenschaftlich
Army Department

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,440
Excuse me.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,690
Want a drink?

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,520
Not now, thank you.

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,360
Is that so?

6
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,360
Well, I suppose you're not military
anymore. You're a private entrepreneur now.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,120
Business is booming, I hear?

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,950
Thankfully.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,670
But what if another war breaks out?

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,790
With the north?

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,880
That's right.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,590
There are some powers within the
Northern League led by the Gardariki Empire

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,640
who haven't come to terms with the peace yet.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,930
I assume you've heard of Drossel's public love letters?

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,770
Drossel? The kingdom that's
part of our Southern Federation?

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,070
Yes.

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,740
Drossel and Flugel, two enemy nations,
will be entering a marriage of happy convenience.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,490
This ceremony has the distinct aim of proclaiming
the end of the War to the neighboring countries.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,920
I'll be on my way, Boss.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,470
The Kingdom of Drossel

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,420
Violet.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,220
I know this is no easy task,

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,470
but you've completed a great
many jobs over the past few months.

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,680
Believe in yourself. You can do this.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,100
This is the royal palace.

26
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,610
Goodbye.

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,400
May you write a fine letter.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,670
This is Miss Violet Evergarden from C.H. Postal,

29
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,800
requesting an audience with
Princess Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel.

30
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,010
It is a pleasure to meet you.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,140
If a client requests it, we shall go anywhere.

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,230
Representing the Auto Memoir
Doll service, I am Violet Evergarden.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,020
Your Highness?

34
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,610
Your Highness,

35
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,120
I believe I told you that you had an appointment today.

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,870
What, is the ghostwriter here?

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,870
It is a pleasure to meet you.

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,880
Representing the Auto Memoir
Doll service, I am Violet Evergarden.

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,340
I am Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel,

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,640
arranged to marry Prince Damian Baldur
Flugel of the neighboring Kingdom of Flugel.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,810
I have need of you to write
me a public love letter to him.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,140
Your Highness...

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,650
Your current slovenly appearance entirely
undermines the refinement in your speech.

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,620
Our public love letters are defined by
how beautifully they express one's love

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,540
and establish the wedding in
people's minds as something to celebrate.

46
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,130
It all rides on your skill, ghostwriter.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,250
I am perfectly aware.

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,630
I won't betray your expectations.

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,880
Why do I feel like I'm not speaking to another person?

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,220
You really are like a doll.

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,020
By the way, ghostwriter, how old are you?

52
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm sorry to say that, as an orphan,
I do not know the precise year of my birth.

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,150
However, I have been told
that I should be around fourteen.

54
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,160
Sorry about that.

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,240
Would you please accept my apology, ghostwriter?

56
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,540
You needn't apologize.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,040
If I may ask, is there a problem with my age?

58
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,710
Not at all. I simply wish to hear the
opinion of someone close to me in years.

59
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,800
Er...

60
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,130
How much older can a man be and still be kosher?

61
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,260
Kosher?

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,550
Her Highness refers to suitability as a romantic partner.

63
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,680
I have never been involved in romance.

64
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,770
But through reading a wide variety of literature,

65
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,230
I have been able to compile a statistical analysis.

66
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,820
My conclusion

67
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,610
is that there are many examples of
couples with a substantial age difference.

68
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,450
Socially speaking, age is no barrier.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,830
Even if there is a ten-year gap?

70
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,910
Prince Damian is twenty-four.

71
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,290
I don't believe that would be a problem.

72
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,250
Even if there is no love?

73
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,550
Well?

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,300
"Love"...

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,170
That is a concept which has been weighing on my mind.

76
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,680
Be it love,

77
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,310
or a loveless marriage,

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,560
I do not possess sufficient
knowledge or understanding of the topic

79
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,810
to answer your query.

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,190
What is <i>with</i> you? What sort of life have you led?

81
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,690
You can hardly call this a conversation!

82
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,940
It's making me more worried
about your future than mine!

83
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,160
Also, could you please show <i>some</i> kind of emotion?

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,030
Please give me a moment.

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
It is complete.

86
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,810
"Dear Damian Baldur Flugel,

87
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,730
If I were to say that simply saying your
name out loud, or writing it out like so,

88
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,820
makes my heart race, how would that make you feel?

89
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,280
Every happening in this city
of flowers reminds me of you,

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,990
leaving me to spend every day sighing endlessly.

91
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,330
One such example is when I
gaze up at the moon in the night sky.

92
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,460
The waning moon strikes me as
much like a petal swaying in the wind.

93
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,330
The Kingdom of Flugel

94
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,050
Which then brings me to my next thought:
The Kingdom of Flugel

95
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,300
how do you feel when you gaze upon that same moon?

96
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,050
You've written about flowers
and the moon as instructed.

97
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,930
Wow...

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,140
You're really good at writing love letters!

99
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,730
Hey!

100
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,310
Yes?

101
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,820
Oh, "The Wedding Draws Near," huh?

102
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Looks like things might work out.

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,200
"Dear Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel,
the beautiful princess of White Camellia Castle,

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,540
You are my love story, the object of my passion,
and I can hardly contain my desire for you.

105
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,710
How dreamy.

106
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,460
You are my love story, the object of my passion,
and I can hardly contain my desire for you.

107
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,300
My dear, I want to touch you as soon as I can."

108
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,550
Excuse me.

109
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,180
An exquisite letter, as you would expect.

110
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,160
Is she feeling overwhelmed by the letter?

111
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
No.

112
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,080
It wasn't that kind of tears.

113
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,540
That's how she cries when
things don't go the way she wants.

114
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,000
I can tell because I've known the princess
ever since she was still in the queen's womb.

115
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,850
Your Highness, hiding is futile.
I can find you in a heartbeat.

116
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,810
Your Highness.

117
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,190
If I were your future mother-in-law,
this would lower my opinion of you.

118
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,200
You have a bad habit of forgetting
who you are when you get too emotional.

119
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,460
Once you marry into Flugel,
you won't have me by your side.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,460
How could you say that, Alberta?

121
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,250
I am a court maid.

122
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,170
I serve the royal family, not you.

123
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,140
No, you're mine!

124
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,850
You brought me out of my mother's womb!

125
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,110
You raised me!

126
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,740
If nothing else, I'm yours!

127
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,580
First the letter, and now you.

128
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,420
Why is everything going wrong?

129
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,960
Get out!

130
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,630
I said get out!

131
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,960
No.

132
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,340
I shall stay right by your side.

133
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,860
Princess Charlotte, how would you like the next letter?

134
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,820
I don't really care anymore, to be honest.

135
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,750
Write whatever you want.

136
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,170
I bet a Doll's writing his letters too, anyway.

137
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,260
And Prince Damian is a busy man.
He likely isn't even reading these.

138
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,260
It doesn't matter what we write.

139
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,180
You aren't satisfied with his replies?

140
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,600
That's not it.

141
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,150
It's just...

142
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,530
I've met Prince Damian once, and he wasn't
the kind of man who would speak like that.

143
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,580
Say, may I put the Princess of
Drossel thing aside, just for now?

144
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,050
And Violet, could you also forget about being a Doll

145
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,960
and listen to me as the person you are?

146
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,010
Just hearing me out would be enough.

147
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,220
Sure.

148
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,520
The day I turned ten,

149
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,480
Drossel threw a grand party to celebrate.

150
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,360
For royalty, marriage arrangements
officially begin when we turn ten.

151
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,200
Every single person I was made
to meet was a prospective husband.

152
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,750
It felt like nobody was there to celebrate my birthday.

153
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,710
My own feelings didn't matter.

154
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,840
Or so everyone seemed to think.

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,360
Hey.

156
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
Did no one come looking for you?

157
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,610
Go on and cry.

158
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,530
Cry all you want.

159
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm trying to <i>stop</i> crying here!

160
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,620
Don't say that!

161
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,760
Back at the party, you came across as a sassy little brat,

162
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,630
so it's a relief to see you can cry too.

163
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,680
That was the worst birthday bash I could imagine.

164
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,510
Even I had to hightail it out of there.

165
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,520
Of course the birthday girl would want to cry.

166
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,020
See you.

167
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,490
He spoke to me plainly, from the heart.

168
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,490
That's all it was.

169
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,660
But it left an impression on me.

170
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,960
It made me really happy.

171
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,710
Soon after, the War grew in scale,
putting all the marriage talks on the backburner.

172
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,390
But as soon as it ended,
I received a proposal out of nowhere.

173
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,140
I didn't want to let this chance go to waste,

174
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,150
so I studied up on all the benefits a marriage
between our countries would bring to Drossel.

175
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,530
I also laid the groundwork
with my father and the cabinet.

176
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,900
And while I don't know if that was the direct cause,

177
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,910
Drossel chose Flugel.

178
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,540
I'm incredibly happy about this marriage.

179
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,580
But what about him?

180
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,800
Maybe he has someone else he loves?

181
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,420
And we're ten whole years apart.

182
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
We might not click with each other.

183
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
I mean...

184
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm nothing but a crybaby.

185
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,390
I'll be in a new country without Alberta by my side.

186
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,940
What if I do something to make him hate me?

187
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,940
That letter was all hogwash.

188
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,150
It had no heart.

189
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,450
I want to know how he truly feels.

190
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,460
You want to know how he truly feels...

191
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,640
Princess Charlotte.

192
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,850
Violet?

193
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,310
We Auto Memoir Dolls are our
clients' ghostwriters, and nothing more.

194
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,860
We don't do anything that they don't ask for.

195
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,360
So please understand that
what I'm about to do is out of line,

196
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,990
and that C.H. Postal will not be held responsible.

197
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,370
What are you thinking?

198
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,830
I want to stop your tears.

199
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:26,420
You see, I recognize his Doll's prose somewhat.

200
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,760
Violet...

201
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,810
What is she going to do?

202
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
Your Highness.

203
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,820
"Dear Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel,

204
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,070
do you remember meeting me that moonlit
night in the White Camellia Castle's garden?"

205
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,620
Hey, that letter's handwritten!

206
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,280
And is that all? What the heck?

207
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,500
This is unprecedented. What's going on?

208
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,920
Violet!

209
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,920
I met with Prince Damian's Doll
and laid out a plan for future letters.

210
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,180
Now, you write a letter

211
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,800
in your own words.

212
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,020
<i>Dear Damian Baldur Flugel,</i>

213
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,230
<i>I remember you very well.</i>

214
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,400
<i>You laughed when you saw me crying.</i>

215
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,230
<i>That really got on my nerves.</i>

216
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,280
<i>But I can never forget your voice as you told me to cry,</i>

217
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,740
<i>nor the kindness you showed me back then.</i>

218
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,450
<i>I laughed because it was cute
to see you finally act your age.</i>

219
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,750
<i>I didn't mean to offend you. Forgive me.</i>

220
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,170
<i>I may be a prince in name, but I'm not
the kind of guy everyone wanted me to be.</i>

221
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,250
<i>Don't expect me to be a mature man.</i>

222
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,010
<i>We only met once, on that night,
so I don't know you well. What kind of girl are you?</i>

223
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,390
Oh my god!

224
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,140
It's like a real love letter!

225
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,100
<i>I'm a crybaby with a short temper,</i>

226
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,520
<i>not the kind of girl who would make you go crazy.</i>

227
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,310
That's not true!

228
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,320
Put her at ease, prince!

229
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,450
<i>I have a little sister, so I'm used to crybaby girls.</i>

230
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,370
<i>I'm not much of a great guy myself.</i>

231
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,290
<i>I can't make you go crazy for me either.</i>

232
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,200
What are you even saying?

233
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,710
If you're a man, be one and tell her to walk with you!

234
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,920
<i>You're wrong. I'm already crazy for you!</i>

235
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,460
<i>Because of the first letter I sent?</i>

236
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,840
<i>A first-rate Doll wrote that one.</i>

237
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,300
<i>I don't mean the person in that letter.</i>

238
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,600
<i>I mean the one who patted my head
on that moonlit night four years ago!</i>

239
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,600
<i>Why? All I did was give you a shoulder to cry on one time.</i>

240
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,900
<i>To me, that one time has been a
precious memory, a shining jewel in my life.</i>

241
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,450
<i>I'm a thoughtless guy who doesn't understand women.</i>

242
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,200
<i>I'll go on hunts and stuff and leave you behind.</i>

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,620
<i>I know I'll disappoint you.</i>

244
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,880
<i>I'm sure you'll find a much better,
far more wonderful man as you grow upâ€”</i>

245
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,970
<i>If I may ask, what makes a wonderful man?</i>

246
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,640
<i>Looks? Riches?</i>

247
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:23,390
<i>In my mind, a wonderful man is one
who is willing to be himself with me.</i>

248
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,810
<i>Among all the men putting on airs,</i>

249
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,400
<i>you are the only one I know who says he's not a great guy.</i>

250
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,900
<i>That's more than enough! That's what I want!</i>

251
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,200
<i>If you go hunting, I'll go with you!</i>

252
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,950
<i>Don't make light of a Drossel princess!</i>

253
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,160
<i>I've had the education to be a fine match for any man!</i>

254
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,870
<i>I'm confident I'll be a faster rider than you!</i>

255
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,380
I never should've written those things!

256
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,430
He must think for sure I'm a rebellious, sassy brat now!

257
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,930
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've made you write everything!

258
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,560
Alberta should've stopped me too!

259
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,560
Princess Charlotte...

260
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,940
You have a reply.

261
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,490
What does it say?

262
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
"I'll be waiting in the moonlit garden tonight."

263
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,340
Hey.

264
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,640
Prince Damian?

265
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,060
I brought you my reply.

266
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,440
It seems my future bride is a
smart, tough, and intriguing person.

267
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,690
You'll be an amazing wife.

268
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,440
Let's get married, Charlotte.

269
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,950
Will you marry me?

270
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,250
Yes.

271
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,810
Their love came true.

272
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,320
Your Highness?

273
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,200
It's time to get ready.

274
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,030
Rise and shine.

275
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,240
Your Highness?

276
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,240
Alberta.

277
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,540
I'm over here, Alberta.

278
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,920
Good morning.

279
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,300
Your Highness, you mustn't poke fun at grownups.

280
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,800
Oh, but I'm all grown up too.

281
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,470
Come.

282
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,100
It's time to get ready, Princess Charlotte.

283
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,230
Say, Alberta.

284
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,980
Where do you think Violet is right now?

285
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,700
She must have left the country already.

286
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,790
You're beautiful.

287
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,420
I wish I could've showed Violet this wedding dress too.

288
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,920
Are you not worried anymore?

289
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,880
I am worried. Of course I'm worried.

290
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,220
Even now, I'm this close to crying.

291
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,680
You mustn't.

292
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,600
Not on this auspicious day.

293
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,310
I'm happy about marrying Prince Damian.

294
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
Right.

295
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,190
But leaving the country makes me sad.

296
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,650
Right.

297
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:08,830
But forget everybody else.
What really makes me sad is leaving you,

298
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Alberta.

299
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,580
Princess...

300
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,050
I wish you all the happiness in the world,

301
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,100
Princess Charlotte.

302
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,100
Alberta...

303
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,970
You owe me one, Violet.

304
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,050
Convincing Prince Damian was hell.

305
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,600
I'm truly grateful.

306
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,600
I could go for some meat.

307
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,310
Is that how I should pay you back?

308
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,860
Precisely.

309
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,610
Roger.

310
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,750
It's a truly beautiful day, don't you think?

311
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
Yes.

312
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,670
It's the perfect day for a wedding.

313
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:58,100
anata no koe ga michishirube
Your voice is my guiding light

Port Leiden,
Leidenschaftlich

323
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,690
You...

324
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,570
Naval Captain Dietfried Bougainvillea...

325
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,120
It seems the rumors were true.
You really have become an Auto Memoir Doll, huh?

326
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,450
You, of all people?

327
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,290
You, who killed so many of my men,

328
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,920
are writing letters?

329
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,180
With your bloodstained hands
that have taken countless lives,

330
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,230
"You Write Letters That Bring People Together?"
