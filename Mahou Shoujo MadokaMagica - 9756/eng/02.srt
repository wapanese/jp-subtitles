1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,920
I am Mami Tomoe.

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,050
I'm a third-year student at
Mitakihara Middle School.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,350
And...

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,100
...I am one who has made a contract
with Kyubey -- a magical girl!

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,040
Another weird dream...?!

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,750
Good morning, Madoka!

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,710
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

8
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,010
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

9
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,930
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,720
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

11
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,820
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,950
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,790
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

14
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,880
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,000
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,930
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

17
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,220
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

18
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,560
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,980
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

20
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,280
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,700
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,830
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

23
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,540
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

24
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,880
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,470
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

26
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,420
EPISODE 2: THAT WOULD BE TRULY WONDERFUL

27
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,970
Madoka...

28
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,520
I heard you got in late last night?

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,850
Yeah, I got invited over to an
older student's house...

30
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,860
Well, I'm not going to make a fuss
about curfews or anything,

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,610
let us know where you are
before dinner, all right?

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,830
People really can't see him...

34
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,850
Wow...

35
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,060
What a wonderful room!

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,020
I live here alone, so feel free to
make yourselves comfortable.

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,600
Though I’m afraid I don't have much
to offer as refreshments...

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,820
Oh, Mami! This is so delicious!

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,280
Seriously--insanely tasty!

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,450
Thank you.

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,120
Since you two have been chosen
by Kyubey as well,

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,740
it means you are now involved in all of this.

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,620
So I thought there were a few
things we should go over.

44
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,250
Right, right! Feel free to ask
us anything you want!

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,960
Sayaka... I think you've got it backwards...

46
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,550
How pretty!

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,010
This is a Soul Gem.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,600
When Kyubey makes a contract
with a girl, a Soul Gem is born.

49
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,480
It is the source of our magic, and also
the proof that we are magical girls.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,850
What about that "contract" business?

51
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,480
I will grant you one wish
- any wish you desire!

52
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,480
Huh? Really?!

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,820
A wish...?

54
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,980
Yes, anything at all.

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,650
I can grant you even the most
impossible of miracles!

56
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,490
So we could wish for riches and treasures?

57
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,700
Or eternal youth?

58
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,870
Or even the fabled 108-dish
banquet of the emperors?!

59
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,950
Uh, maybe not that last one...

60
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,540
Yes, but in exchange for that wish,
your Soul Gem is created.

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,130
Those who possess a Soul Gem are
duty-bound to do battle with witches.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Witches?

63
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,550
Hey... Mom?

64
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,010
Hm?

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,720
Say that - just hypothetically...

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,980
Say that someone offered to magically
grant you any wish in the world.

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,600
What would you do?

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,860
I'd have those two trustees driven
straight out of the company.

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Ahh...

70
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,280
And also...

71
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,450
The CEO really is getting too
old to keep pushing himself,

72
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,620
so maybe I'd have him retire?

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,700
Oh, but he hasn't named a successor yet...

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,500
Then what if you became the new CEO?

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,380
I hadn't considered that...

76
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,090
If I could gather enough support
in the Sales Department...

77
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,930
I've already got the Planning Committee
and General Affairs in my corner...

78
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,890
Then my only hurdle would be old Baldy
from the Accounting Department...

79
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,140
Maybe... Interesting...

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Mom... You've got a scary
look in your eyes...

81
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,940
So what exactly is a witch?

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,520
Are they different from magical girls?

83
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,150
If magical girls can be said
to be born from wishes,

84
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,400
then witches are creatures
born from curses.

85
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,410
Just as magical girls spread hope to
the world, witches spread despair.

86
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,200
And since they're invisible
to regular humans,

87
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,500
it makes their evil all the more insidious.

88
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,500
Anxiety and mistrust...

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,670
Irrational rage and hatred...

90
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,590
They sow the seeds of disaster
throughout the world.

91
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,300
Many of the inexplicable suicides
and murders that occur...

92
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,340
...are caused by a witch's curse.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,600
Its formless darkness grows
within the cursed human...

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,970
...until it consumes him
from the inside out.

95
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,100
If these witches are so dangerous, why
don't people know about them yet?

96
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,150
Because witches hide themselves deep
within the labyrinths they create...

97
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,860
and take care never to appear
before human eyes.

98
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,910
That maze-like place you wandered
into today was a labyrinth.

99
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,030
Actually, they're very dangerous.

100
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,620
Humans who stray into them usually
don't make it out alive.

101
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,620
And you fight such scary creatures?

102
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes, often at the risk of my life.

103
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,840
That's why you two...

104
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,510
should think very carefully before
deciding to become magical girls.

105
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,380
Having been chosen by Kyubey,

106
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,180
you have the rare chance
to have any wish granted.

107
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,890
But remember that that wish
lies side-by-side with death.

108
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,810
Oh, man... This is gonna be a tough choice.

109
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,940
To help you make up your minds,

110
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,190
why don't you come along with
me on a few witch hunts?

111
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,150
Huh?!

112
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,690
You should see for yourself what
it's like to do battle with witches.

113
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,610
Also... you should think long and hard...

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,620
about whether there's something
you want badly enough...

115
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,410
...to make it worth putting
yourself in danger.

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,500
Good morning!

117
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,750
Good morning.

118
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,840
Good-- waaughh!

119
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,380
Good morning, Sayaka!

120
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,920
Uh...

121
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,380
Is something the matter, Sayaka?

122
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,390
So other people really can't see him?

123
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,600
Seems that way.

124
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,810
Um...

125
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,600
O-oh! No, it's nothing at all!

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
L-let's get going!

127
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,900
It seems like we can communicate...

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,770
...just by thinking to each other like this.

129
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,570
Wah!

130
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,570
What?! You mean we already
have magical powers?!

131
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,070
No, no.

132
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,740
I'm just acting as an intermediary
between your thoughts right now.

133
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,660
But it's handy being able to
talk telepathically, isn't it?

134
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,410
It... feels a little weird...

135
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,960
Hey, you two. What's going on?

136
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,880
You've been staring so intently
into one another's eyes...

137
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Huh? Oh, n-no, there's nothing... going on...

138
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,630
No, don't tell me--

139
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,680
You're already close enough to
communicate through your eyes alone?!

140
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,390
Ohh!! But for two people to suddenly
get that much closer overnight--

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,480
What on earth did you do
after I left yesterday?!

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,770
No, seriously. It totally isn't
what you're thinking--

143
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,400
Well, a lot of things did happen
last night, but...

144
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,570
But you can't!! You're both girls, after all!

145
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,160
Don't you see that it's a love
that can never beeeee?!

146
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,160
You left your bag!

147
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,080
Hitomi's acting so much
like you today, Sayaka.

148
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,830
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!

149
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,470
But seriously, is it really okay for you
to tag along to school with us?

150
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,970
Why not?

151
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,150
Like I said, that girl from yesterday
just transferred into our class.

152
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,360
Isn't she trying to kill you?

153
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,400
Actually, I think the school
is the safest place for me.

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,740
After all, Mami's here too.

155
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,360
But Mami is a third-year student, so her
class is pretty far from ours.

156
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,120
Don't worry, I can hear you all perfectly.

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,200
At this distance, I can still reach
her with my telepathy.

158
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,870
Oh! U-uh, um, good morning!

159
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,380
I promise I'll keep close watch
over you all, so don't worry.

160
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,880
Anyway, she doesn't strike me as the
type who would attack you in public.

161
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,720
I sure hope you're right...

162
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,800
Ugh! Speak of the devil...

163
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,690
So is that transfer student also a...

164
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,310
A magical girl?

165
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,270
Just like you, Mami?

166
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,110
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

167
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,030
She seems to be a fairly powerful one, too.

168
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,070
But doesn't that mean she's a good guy
who also fights against the witches?

169
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,910
So why would she suddenly
start attacking Madoka?

170
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,410
It was me that she was after.

171
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,920
It seemed like she was trying to prevent
me from contracting a new magical girl.

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,920
But why?

173
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,710
If we're all fighting the same enemy,

174
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,920
wouldn't it be better if there
were more of us?

175
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,930
Not necessarily.

176
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,220
It's actually more common for magical
girls to contend against one another.

177
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,350
What? But why?

178
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,060
There are certain rewards one can
gain from defeating a witch.

179
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,190
That's why sometimes, depending
on the time and situation,

180
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,820
Magical girls may actually battle one
another for the right to those rewards.

181
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,690
So basically,

182
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,860
the reason that girl was staring
at Madoka all day yesterday...

183
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,370
...was because she knew Kyubey
was trying to get to her?

184
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,740
Most likely, yes.

185
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,380
Don't worry, Madoka.

186
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,800
If she tries anything on you,
I'll punch her lights out!

187
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,720
Plus, we have Mami here
to protect you too!

188
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,680
That's right.

189
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,640
Leaving aside Miki and her punches,
I am here, so you will be just fine.

190
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,470
What do you mean "leaving aside?!"

191
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,270
And so...

192
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,640
...the form we've been studying
up to this point...

193
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,770
...in which the person or thing performing
an action is the subject of the sentence...

194
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,770
...is called the "active voice."

195
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,070
On the flip side, we have
the "passive voice"...

196
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,110
...which is what we call a sentence
in which "B is et cetera'd by A."

197
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,870
In other words, the subject of the sentence
is the recipient of the verb...

198
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,790
...instead of the one performing it.

199
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,250
So the form is "be" + the verb
in the past participle.

200
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,710
Now let's take the sample
sentence, "he likes me."

201
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,250
Here you go.

202
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,420
Hey, Madoka...

203
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,850
Have you come up with a wish yet?

204
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,100
Not really...

205
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,390
Have you?

206
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,060
Nope, not a clue.

207
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Seriously...

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,150
I've gone through and considered
so many different things too.

209
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,400
I mean, there are plenty of things
I want to have or do, but...

210
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,490
...I guess the whole "risking your life
for it" part is what's getting me.

211
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,410
None of the stuff I want
is worth that much.

212
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,120
Yeah...

213
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,030
How odd.

214
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,080
Most of the girls I make my
offer to accept right away.

215
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,580
Well... Maybe the pair of us are just fools?

216
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,590
Huh? You think so?

217
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,630
Yep. A pair of blissfully ignorant fools...

218
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,220
I'm sure it's not all that unusual.

219
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,800
Wishing for something so strongly
you'd gladly trade your life for it...

220
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,850
There must be countless
people in this world...

221
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,680
...who have such wishes in their hearts.

222
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,850
Most likely...

223
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,150
It means the two of us who can't even
figure out what to wish for...

224
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,650
...haven't experienced even a fraction
of those people's suffering.

225
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,440
We've been so blessed...

226
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,030
...that we've become ignorant fools.

227
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,910
...Why us, of all people?

228
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,200
Doesn't it seem unfair?

229
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,750
There are probably people who would
give anything for a chance like this...

230
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,170
Sayaka...

231
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,680
It's all right.

232
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,980
Picking up where you left off yesterday?

233
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,230
No. I have no such intention.

234
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,950
I had hoped to kill it before it made
contact with Madoka Kaname,

235
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,990
but it is too late for that now...

236
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,200
So what will you do?

237
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,620
Will you become a magical girl as well?

238
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,420
I...

239
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,590
Like you have any right to ask us anything!

240
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,420
...Do you remember what I said yesterday?

241
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,970
Yeah...

242
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,300
Good. Then I'll pray that my warning
will not have been in vain.

243
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,600
H-Homura!

244
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,060
Um...

245
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,560
What did you wish for when
you became a magical girl?

246
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,710
Hitomi!

247
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,710
Sorry, but the two of us have a few
small errands to run today, so...

248
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,840
Oh, my. Something private?

249
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,380
Um...

250
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,510
I'm so jealous!

251
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,390
I guess there's just no room anymore...

252
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,180
...for a third wheel like meeeee!!

253
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,810
Once again, you've got it totally wrong...

254
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,310
Miss Akemi...

255
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,150
You're finally going to come have
coffee with us after school, right?

256
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,280
...I have some urgent business
to attend to today as well.

257
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,070
My apologies.

258
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,870
Aww...

259
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,290
Now, then!

260
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,290
Shall we begin Lesson 1 of our little "A
Day in the Life of a Magical Girl" class?

261
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,960
Are you ready?

262
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,460
I don't know if it'll be any help, but...

263
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,050
...I brought this along!

264
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,090
I figured it was better than having
nothing to defend ourselves with.

265
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,970
Well, I'm glad you're going into
this with that kind of mindset.

266
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,560
How about you, Madoka? Bring anything?

267
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,140
Huh?!

268
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,190
Well... I...

269
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,820
Ooh!

270
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,280
I-I thought maybe I should at least start
thinking about costume ideas...

271
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,200
Huh?!

272
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,120
Well, you've certainly brought
enough enthusiasm!

273
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,420
Well, I can't top that! You totally beat me...!

274
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,260
These are remnants of the magic used
by that witch we faced yesterday.

275
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,760
The core of witch-hunting is
scouting the city on foot.

276
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,020
Once your Soul Gem picks
up a witch's trail,

277
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,480
you just follow it until it
leads you to the witch.

278
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,940
It's a lot less exciting than I was expecting.

279
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,280
The Gem doesn't seem to
be glowing any brighter.

280
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,490
It's because it's been a full night
since the witch escaped.

281
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,450
There are fewer footprints around
to catch hold of now.

282
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,250
What if you had gone after
it right away yesterday?

283
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,410
I may have been able to finish it off.

284
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,250
But it wasn't worth leaving the two of you
alone after what you'd been through.

285
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,340
...I'm sorry.

286
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,300
It's fine.

287
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,840
Yep! You truly are an ally of justice, Mami!

288
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,300
On the other hand, what is with
that transfer student?!

289
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,680
She really pisses me off!

290
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,270
Is she really a bad person...?

291
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,320
Say, Mami...

292
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,740
Do you at least have an idea
of where the witch might be?

293
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,120
You often find traces of witches' auras...

294
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,370
...around car crashes or deadly accidents.

295
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,710
That's why I usually check high-traffic streets
and spots in the Red Light District...

296
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,550
...where fights tend to break out first.

297
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,340
Also, out-of-the-way places where people
might try to commit suicide.

298
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,430
Then, there are hospitals--the most
awful places for a witch to take up.

299
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,060
It's unbearable to see them...

300
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,140
...draining the precious life force...

301
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,940
out of those who are already weakened
with pain and illness.

302
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,360
It's reacting to some very powerful magic.

303
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,200
It must be close.

304
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,250
There's no mistake!

305
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,710
It must be here!

306
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,120
Mami, look!

307
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,060
A Witch's Kiss...

308
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,900
Just as I expected.

309
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,570
I-is she...?

310
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,110
No, she's fine. She's only fainted.

311
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Let's go!

312
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,840
I won't let you escape this time!

313
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,880
Wh-whoa!

314
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,590
Wow!

315
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,050
It's not much,

316
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,600
but it should serve to protect you from
any immediate dangers at least.

317
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,350
You must stay near me once
we're inside, all right?

318
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,600
Right!

319
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,990
Stay away!

320
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,370
Stay away!!

321
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,210
So?

322
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,830
Are you scared yet, you two?

323
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,340
A-As if!

324
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,600
I am scared...

325
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,640
But...

326
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,350
Keep it up!

327
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,230
We're almost at the deepest
point in the labyrinth!

328
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,130
Look.

329
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,590
That is a witch.

330
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,720
Eww... Disgusting...

331
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,930
Y-you're going to fight that thing?

332
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,430
I'll be fine.

333
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,440
As though I would lose to that!

334
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,900
Stay back!!

335
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,110
Mami!!

336
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,240
I'm fine.

337
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,120
As though I could let myself look so uncool
in front of my future magical girl juniors!

338
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,470
Close, but no cigar.

339
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,100
Tiro Finale!

340
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,910
S-she beat it...?

341
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,030
Amazing...!

342
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,250
This is a Grief Seed.

343
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,960
It's a witch's egg.

344
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,130
E-egg?!

345
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,510
Witches carry them sometimes. If you’re
lucky, you’ll find one after a battle.

346
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,600
It's all right. In this form,
they're perfectly safe.

347
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,890
In fact, they're incredibly valuable
because of what they can do.

348
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,900
The color of my Soul Gem looks a little
muddier now than it did last night, right?

349
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,480
Now that you mention it...

350
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,650
But if I use the Grief Seed...

351
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,530
See?

352
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,030
Oh! It cleared up again!

353
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,240
Right?

354
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,910
With this, the magic I expended during
the fight is restored as well.

355
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,700
When I said there were certain
rewards to defeating witches,

356
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,540
I meant this.

357
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,760
It should be good for one more use.

358
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll let you have it...

359
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,140
...Miss Homura Akemi.

360
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,390
Her again?!

361
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Or do you dislike sharing with others?

362
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,890
It was your kill.

363
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,400
You should keep the reward for yourself.

364
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,820
I see.

365
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,990
So that's your answer.

366
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,660
Ugh! She really does bug me!

367
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,750
We could have been friends...

368
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,460
It only works if both parties feel that way.

369
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,300
Where am I? Huh? I...

370
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,010
O-oh my god, what was I about to...?

371
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,470
Why would I...?

372
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,350
It's okay. You're safe now.

373
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,520
You were just having
a bad dream, that's all.

374
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,730
Well, that's one case closed.

375
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,570
Yeah...

376
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:35,450
It's too confusing, figuring out
what I would wish for...

377
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,410
But Mami looked so amazing when
she was fighting to save people...

378
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,080
If even someone like me...

379
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,050
...could go around truly helping
people like that...

380
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,590
...I think that would be...

381
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,220
...truly wonderful.

382
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,310
“Soreja matane” tte te wo futte
I say “See you later” and wave my hand

383
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:04,940
Murini waratte samishiku natte...
I force myself to smile but I feel sad

384
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:20,200
Kousaten, shingou, tookuno kurakushon
Crossroads, traffic signals, horns from far away...

385
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:27,210
Shiranai darekano waraiau koe
And laughter of people I don't know

386
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,430
Kyou wa hitoride aruku kayoi nareta machi
When walking alone in the town where I’ve walked many times

387
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:44,980
Demo itsumo yori mo nanndaka jibun ga chotto chiisaku omoeruyo
But I feel that I am smaller than usual

388
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,030
“Soreja matane” tte te wo futte
I say “See you later” and wave my hand

389
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,280
Egao tsukutte samishiku natte...
I fake a smile and I feel sad

390
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,750
Honto wa mada hanashi tarinai kedo
To be honest, I wanted to talk with you more

391
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,620
“Soreja matane” tte kotoba de
I would say “See you later”

392
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,000
Mata aerutte uso wo tsuite
I lied when I told you I'd see you again

393
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:16,380
Itsumo dourino egao de iuyo
I will tell you that with the usual smile on my face

394
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,760
“Mata ashita”
“See you tomorrow”

395
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,100
I only pretend to be cool.
I'm really pushing myself hard.

396
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,400
Even when I'm scared, or hurting,
there's no one I can talk to.

397
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,690
All I can do is cry on my own.

398
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,530
It isn't a good thing... to be a magical girl.

399
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,120
EPISODE 3: I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING ANYMORE

400
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.
