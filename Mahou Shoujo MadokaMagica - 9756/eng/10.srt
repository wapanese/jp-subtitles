1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,210
Now, then!

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,790
Why don't you tell your
classmates about yourself?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,130
U-um...

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,630
M-m-my name is Homura Akemi.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,800
P-p-pleased to meet you...

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,310
Miss Akemi has been in the hospital
for a while due to a heart condition.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,310
HOMURA AKEMI

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,350
Since it's been some time since
she's been in school,

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,440
she may be a bit behind on a few things.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,440
I want all of you to help her out, okay?

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,570
So, Miss Akemi...

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,030
What school did you come from?

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,530
Did you do any club activities
at your old school?

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,030
How about sports? Or cultural activities?

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,200
Your hair is so long!

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,290
That must take a lot of time
to braid every morning!

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,540
U-um...

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,290
I... I...

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,290
Miss Akemi?

20
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,340
You have to go to the Nurse's
Office, don't you?

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,460
Do you know where it is?

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,300
Huh? Um, no...

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,430
Then I'll take you there. I'm the
Nurse's Aide in our class.

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,300
Sorry, everyone,

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,350
but Miss Akemi is supposed
to take her medicine...

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,680
during break times at the Nurse's Office.

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,690
Oh, really?

28
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,850
Sorry for keeping you, then.

29
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,360
We'll talk again later, Miss Akemi!

30
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,650
Sorry about that.

31
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,700
They don't mean any harm.

32
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,240
They just got excited because we
don't get many transfer students.

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,660
No, it's...

34
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,290
Thank you very much.

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,330
You don't have to be so nervous.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,330
We're classmates, after all!

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm Madoka Kaname.

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
But just call me Madoka.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,710
B-but...

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,090
It's fine, really. So, is it okay
if I call you Homura, too?

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,890
I-I don't really get called by
my first name very much...

42
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,690
I-I mean, it's such a weird name, so...

43
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,270
Huh? No, it's not!

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,730
It means "flame," so it's like you're
supposed to flare up passionately!

45
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,740
I think it sounds cool!

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
I guess I don't live up to my name...

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,240
But that's such a waste!

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,160
Since you were blessed with
such a great name,

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,500
you should become cool to match it!

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,010
All right, why don't you try solving this one?

51
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh, you were out sick for
a while, weren't you?

52
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,060
Why don't you ask a friend
to let you copy their notes?

53
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,020
She got light-headed just
from doing warm-ups...

54
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,520
That's so lame!

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,400
Well, she's been bedridden for half a year.

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,820
Guess it can't be helped, huh?

57
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,530
You should become cool to match it!

58
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,120
That's impossible.

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,910
I... can't do anything right...

60
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,670
All I ever do is make trouble for others...
and embarrass myself...

61
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,380
Why?

62
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,550
Will I always...

63
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,800
...just be like this...forever?

64
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,810
Then maybe it'd be better
if you just died right now.

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Maybe it would be better to just die...

66
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,100
That's right. You should just die now...

67
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,190
I should just... die...

68
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,950
Wh-what is this place?!

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,040
Wh-what?

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,960
What's going on here?

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,670
No... Ah!

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,780
That was a close one!

73
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,980
You're safe now...

74
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,360
...Homura.

75
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,990
Y-you're...!

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,370
They're magical girls.

77
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,370
They hunt witches.

78
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,750
I guess you've discovered our little secret.

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,290
Don't tell anyone else in class, okay?

80
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,890
MAMI TOMOE

81
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,720
Miss Kaname...

82
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,680
Do you always fight those things...?

83
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,150
Always? Hmm... Mami's
the real veteran but...

84
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,030
I actually just made my contract
with Kyubey last week.

85
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,320
But your performance today is a big
improvement from before, Kaname.

86
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,530
You're really okay with it?

87
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,580
You don't... get scared?

88
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,080
It's not that it doesn't bother me,

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,120
and of course, I get scared too.

90
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,170
But the more witches we slay,
the more people we can save.

91
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,130
So it's worth the effort, right?

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,140
I would like you to get fully-trained
and ready...

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,010
before Walpurgisnacht gets here.

94
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,610
...I'd better go now.

95
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,980
But...

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,780
But Miss Tomoe...

97
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,570
...just got killed.

98
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,360
That's why I have to go.

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm the only one left who can
stop Walpurgisnacht.

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,790
But it's impossible! No one could
beat that thing alone!

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,170
You'll just be killed, too!

102
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,000
Even then, I'm a magical girl.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,130
I have to protect everyone.

104
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,720
Listen...

105
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,890
Let's just run away...

106
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,760
There's nothing we can do, so...

107
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,560
No one will blame you.

108
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,020
Homura...

109
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,060
I'm really glad I became friends with you.

110
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,900
Even now, the fact that we were in
time to save you from that witch...

111
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,660
It's one of my proudest accomplishments.

112
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:16,080
That's why, I'm really glad in the end that
I chose to become a magical girl.

113
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,830
Miss Kaname...

114
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,130
Good-bye, Homura.

115
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,880
Take care.

116
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,380
No! Don't go! Miss Kaname!!

117
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,850
Why...?

118
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
You knew...

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,600
...you were going to get killed...

120
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,110
I'd rather you had lived...

121
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,360
than saved someone like me...!

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,070
Do you really mean that, Homura Akemi?

123
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,370
Would you put your soul
at stake for that wish?

124
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,330
If there is something you want badly
enough to accept a destiny of battle...

125
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,840
...then I can be of help to you.

126
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,220
If I make a contract with you,

127
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,340
can you really grant me any wish I want?

128
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,550
That's right.

129
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,100
It seems that you have
enough potential for it.

130
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,350
So tell me--

131
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,850
What is the wish that will make
your Soul Gem shine?

132
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,440
I...

133
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,990
I want to redo my meeting
with Miss Kaname.

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,870
But this time, instead of
her protecting me...

135
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,620
...I want to become strong
enough to protect her!

136
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,050
The contract has been made.

137
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,770
Your wish has prevailed over entropy.

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,600
So, go now... unleash your new power!

139
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,920
This is--

140
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,970
I...

141
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,970
NEW STUDENT GUIDE

142
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm still in the hospital?

143
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,440
This isn't a dream?!

144
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,230
Now, then!

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,070
Why don't you tell your
classmates about yourself?

146
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,860
My name is Homura Akemi! I'm
very pleased to meet you!

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,620
Miss Akemi has been in
the hospital for a while--

148
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,750
Miss Kaname! I've become
a magical girl too!!

149
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,540
So let's do our best together from now on!

150
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,880
Uh... um...

151
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
Okay, here I go!

152
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,790
What do you think, Mami?

153
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
Hmm...

154
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,540
Time magic. I see...

155
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,040
It's incredible, but it's tricky
to learn how to fight with it.

156
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,210
Right...

157
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,850
HOW TO MAKE A BOMB

158
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,530
Mami! Now!

159
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,040
Okay!

160
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,500
Akemi! Go for it!

161
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,670
R-right!

162
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,580
I did it...

163
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,000
I did it...!

164
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,870
You did it!!

165
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,750
Well done!

166
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,960
You were amazing, Homura!

167
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,430
What's wrong?

168
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,640
Miss Kaname! Hold on!!

169
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,520
W-why...?

170
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,950
...What?

171
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,080
Why...?

172
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,080
How? How could that...?

173
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,470
I have to tell them!

174
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,220
Kyubey's tricking all of you!

175
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,220
Okay, look...

176
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,520
What could Kyubey possibly gain
by telling us such a huge lie?

177
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,230
Well, um...

178
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,190
I bet you're just saying that to get
us all to turn against each other!

179
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,690
In fact, you're probably working with
that Kyoko girl, aren't you?!

180
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,360
N-no, I'm not!

181
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,570
Sayaka, you're the one who's
turning against people here.

182
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,620
Whatever.

183
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,990
Personally, I'm against teaming
up with this girl.

184
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,410
You and Mami are fine since
you use long-range weapons.

185
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,540
But I fight right in the thick of things,

186
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,170
and having bombs go off in my face
is something I can live without.

187
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,250
I've almost been caught in the
blast multiple times now!

188
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,760
Are there any weapons you
can use besides bombs?

189
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,680
...I'll think of something.

190
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,920
What the heck are you?!

191
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,500
What have you done to Sayaka?

192
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,460
Sayaka, stop! Please, remember!

193
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,380
I know you never wanted
to hurt anyone, Sayaka!

194
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm sorry... Miss Miki...

195
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,460
Sayaka...

196
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,420
Damn it...

197
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,630
How could this happen...?

198
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,340
It's too horrible...

199
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,970
This isn't right!

200
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,020
Miss Tomoe?!

201
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,900
If Soul Gems give birth to witches...

202
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,940
...then we have no choice
but to die, do we?!

203
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,900
Both you...

204
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,110
...and me!!

205
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,530
S-stop...!

206
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,790
I don't want this...

207
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,960
I can't take any more... of this...!

208
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,590
It's okay...

209
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,930
The two of us will keep going by ourselves.

210
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,270
We'll beat Walpurgisnacht,
just the two of us!

211
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,560
Okay...

212
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,200
I guess... this is the end for us too...

213
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,700
You don't have any more Grief Seeds...?

214
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,250
I see...

215
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,170
Listen...

216
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,670
How about the two of us
become monsters...

217
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,890
and really mess up this whole,
awful world, huh?

218
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,350
Until there's no more evil, no more
sadness, nothing left at all...

219
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,310
Let's just break, break,
break it all to dust...!

220
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,320
Don't you think... that would be great?

221
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,990
I lied earlier.

222
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,500
I had just this one left.

223
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,670
No! Why would you--? On me?!

224
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,710
Because I want to ask you to do
something that only you can do.

225
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,510
Homura... you can go back in time, right?

226
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,720
You can change history, so that
it won't end like this, right?

227
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,770
Yeah...

228
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,890
Then would you...

229
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,730
go back and save stupid me before
I get tricked by Kyubey?

230
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,690
I swear it!

231
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,530
I promise I'll save you!

232
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,990
No matter how many times
I have to go back and try!

233
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,990
I swear, I will protect you!!

234
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,620
Thank you...

235
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,380
Can I ask you... one more thing...?

236
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,930
I... I don't want to become a witch...

237
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,020
There are awful... sad things
in this world, but...

238
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,350
...there are lots... of things...

239
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,020
...worth protecting too...

240
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,440
Madoka!

241
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,400
Homura, you... finally called
me... by my first name...

242
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,120
I'm... happy...

243
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,890
No one will believe me about the future.

244
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,350
No one will accept the
truth about the future.

245
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,770
Then, I...

246
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,530
Wh-who's there?!

247
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,150
Madoka...

248
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,700
If someone comes to you offering a
miracle in exchange for something...

249
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
...you absolutely must not listen to him!

250
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,160
Huh? Um...

251
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,420
I won't rely on anyone anymore!

252
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,010
I don't need anyone to understand
me, either!

253
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,980
I won't let Madoka fight anymore.

254
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,280
I will finish every last witch myself...

255
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,200
And finally, this time...

256
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,750
...I shall defeat Walpurgisnacht...
with my own hands!

257
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,350
That's horrible...!

258
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,810
There's no helping it.

259
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,940
This was too much for her to handle alone.

260
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,570
But... that's too much! This can't be right!

261
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,950
Madoka! Don't listen to anything he says!!

262
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,620
If she gives up, it's over.

263
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,790
But you have the power
to change fate itself...

264
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,130
All this inevitable destruction
and tragedy...

265
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,800
You can change it, if you want.

266
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,340
The power to do so lies within you.

267
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Can I really?

268
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,350
Don't let him trick you! You're
falling right into his trap!!

269
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,020
Can I really do something to help?

270
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,230
Could I really change this ending?

271
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,270
Of course you could.

272
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,650
So make a contract with me...

273
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,990
...and become a magical girl!

274
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,700
Nooooooo!!

275
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,300
She really was amazing when
she transformed, wasn't she?

276
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,050
That Madoka...

277
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,220
I estimated that she would become the
most powerful magical girl in the world...

278
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,930
...but to think she would take down
Walpurgisnacht with a single shot...!

279
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,400
And did you know what would
happen to her as a result?

280
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,400
Be it sooner or later, there is only
one ending for you magical girls.

281
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,160
As the strongest of all magical girls,
she took down her greatest enemy.

282
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,870
Naturally, after that,

283
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,780
all that was left for her was to turn
into the wickedest of all witches...

284
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,700
As she is now,

285
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,580
I imagine it will only take Madoka about
10 days to destroy this entire planet.

286
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Oh, well. What happens next is
mankind's problem, not ours.

287
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,010
We've got all the energy we need
now. Our quota is almost met.

288
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,930
Aren't you going to fight her?

289
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
No.

290
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,560
My battlefield lies elsewhere.

291
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,020
Homura Akemi...

292
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,110
...you're--!!

293
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,150
I'll do it over...

294
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,450
As many times as it takes,
I'll keep going back...

295
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
I'll relive the same time over and over...

296
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,040
I'll find the one way out...

297
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,340
I'll find the one road that will save
you from a destiny of despair...

298
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,060
Madoka...

299
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,820
My only friend...

300
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,280
Homura...?

301
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,200
If it's...

302
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,080
If it's for you...

303
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,540
I don't care if I have to stay locked
in this endless maze...

304
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,630
...forever!

305
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,720
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

306
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,010
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

307
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,930
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

308
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,730
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

309
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,820
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

310
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,960
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

311
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,790
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

312
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,880
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

313
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,010
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

314
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,930
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

315
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,230
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

316
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,570
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

317
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,990
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

318
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,280

319
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,700
Mirai wo egaku tame

Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo

321
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,550

The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

322
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,880

Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

324
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,380
EPISODE 10: I WON'T RELY ON ANYONE ANYMORE

325
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,930
After all the time you spent
watching over those girls...

326
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,390
Do you really feel nothing for them at all?

327
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,440
Did you never try to understand
how much they were suffering?

328
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,070
EPISODE 11: THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT TO GUIDE ME

329
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,940
The only thing I have left to guide me.
