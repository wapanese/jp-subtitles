1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,580
Homura... I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm going to become a magical girl.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,630
Madoka...

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,510
No...

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,890
I finally figured it out.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,390
I found a wish I truly want granted.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,640
So I'm going to use my life for it, okay?

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,770
Don't!

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,190
Because then...

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,690
Because then, what have I...

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,110
...been fighting for...?

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm sorry. I’m so sorry.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,200
But I believe it's because you've
protected me for so, so long,

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,750
that I am the person I am now.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,790
I really am sorry.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,050
Won't you believe in the answer...

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,630
that the one you've protected
all this time has found?

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,510
I swear I won't waste everything that
you've done for me, Homura.

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,100
Madoka...

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,110
Since you're now the central
point of karmic destiny...

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,440
from numerous different timelines...

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,530
...no matter how enormous the wish, you
will likely be able to make it come true.

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,990
It's true, right?

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,740
Now, Madoka Kaname...

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,830
What is the wish that you will pay for...

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,540
...with your soul?

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,330
I wish...

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,840
I wish to erase all witches
before they are born...

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,220
All the witches in all the universes,
both past and future...

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,640
With my own hands!

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,310
That prayer...

32
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,320
If a prayer like that were granted, it could
unravel the fabric of time itself!

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,990
It would go against the very
force of karmic destiny!

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,620
Do you truly intend to become a god?!

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,740
I don't care what I become.

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,200
All those who have fought against witches,

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,460
who believed in hope as magical girls...

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,460
...I don't want to see them cry.

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,500
I want them to be smiling to the very end...

40
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,340
If any rule or law stands
in the way of that...

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,670
I will destroy it. I will rewrite it.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,010
That is my prayer... That is my wish.

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,050
Now!

44
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,390
Grant my wish...

45
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,640
...Incubator!!

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,740
FINAL EPISODE: MY VERY BEST FRIEND

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,670
Kaname... do you truly understand
how fearsome a wish that was?

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,460
I think so.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,680
It means that for all the past and future,
and throughout all of time,

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,720
you will have to continue fighting forever.

51
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,770
In doing so, you will certainly wind up
losing all traces of your individual self.

52
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,690
Simply dying would be a kinder fate.

53
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,690
For all eternity,

54
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,610
you would continue merely as a concept--

55
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,110
a principle that destroys witches.

56
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,360
That's fine. That's what I intend to do.

57
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,410
If someone says it's wrong to have hope,

58
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,790
then I'll tell them they're wrong,
every single time.

59
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,540
And I know I'll always tell them so.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,670
Then it's fine, isn't it?

61
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,300
If you think you can do it, then
you've just gotta do it!

62
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,630
I mean, you've found your
reason to fight, right?

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,050
You've decided yourself
not to run away, right?

64
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,970
Then there's no problem! All that's
left is to run full steam ahead!

65
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,390
Right... Thank you, Kyoko.

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,060
Then there's something I
should give back to you.

67
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,480
Here you go.

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,070
You aren't just granting us hope.

69
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,120
You're becoming hope, itself.

70
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,450
...The hope of us all.

71
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,950
I won't let your prayers end in despair.

72
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,000
None of you have to hate anyone,
or curse anyone...

73
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,430
I will bear all of that cursed destiny
for you. So, please...

74
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,390
To the very end, keep believing
in yourselves!

75
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,620
It's okay. It's all right now.

76
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,290
You don't have to hate anyone anymore.

77
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,000
You don't have to curse anyone anymore.

78
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,090
I’ll go back, before you turned into
this, and take the burden of yours.

79
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,540
Where am I...?

80
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,670
The universe is in the process
of reordering itself...

81
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,790
based on Madoka's new laws.

82
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,840
That's right...

83
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,720
You are able to control
time-crossing magic.

84
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,050
Well, then, let us witness together...

85
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,680
what kind of end the existence called
Madoka Kaname will meet...

86
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,770
That is the Soul Gem her prayer created.

87
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
That...?!

88
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,150
Can you see all the cursed destinies
she took unto herself,

89
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,320
as the price for making such
an enormous wish?

90
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,450
She was able to bring forth enough hope
to give birth to an entire universe.

91
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,080
Which is to say,

92
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,370
it will also become enough despair
to end the entire universe as well.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,250
It's only natural, right?

94
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,620
No, it's all right.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,290
My wish was to erase all witches...

96
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,380
And if that prayer really comes true...

97
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,300
...then even I...

98
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,300
should have no reason to despair...

99
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
...ever!

100
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,950
Madoka...

101
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,210
With this, your life has ceased to
have either a beginning or end.

102
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,460
No trace of your life on Earth,

103
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,760
nor a single memory of you
will remain anywhere.

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,130
Your existence has shifted
onto a higher plane,

105
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,840
and all that will be left of
you here is a concept.

106
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,220
No one will ever be aware
of your presence again,

107
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,970
and you will never be able
to interact with anyone.

108
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,600
You have ceased to exist in this universe.

109
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,520
What are you saying?

110
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,610
That Madoka wished for such an ending?!

111
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,610
You think this is a fair reward
for everything she's done?!

112
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,570
Don't be ridiculous!

113
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,990
This... is even worse...

114
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,950
than death would have been...!

115
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,080
No, you're wrong, Homura.

116
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,670
As I am now, I can see everything
that ever has or will happen.

117
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,420
Both the universes that could have been...

118
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,100
...and the universes that might
one day be. All of them...

119
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,060
Madoka...

120
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,970
And that's why, I finally know...

121
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,360
...just how much you've done for me,
in all those different timelines.

122
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,570
All of it.

123
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,530
How many times you cried,

124
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,530
how often you ended up
covered in injuries...

125
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,490
...and yet, kept going for my sake...

126
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,830
I'm sorry I never knew until now...

127
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,330
I'm so sorry.

128
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,920
It wasn't until I became this way that
I could truly know who you are.

129
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,680
To think that I had such a precious
friend with me all this time...!

130
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,010
I'm so glad I know now.

131
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,520
Homura... thank you!

132
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,150
You really have been my very
best friend, haven't you?

133
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,990
But still, as you are now...

134
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,650
...you no longer have a
place to go home to,

135
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,570
and you'll be separated from
everyone you love...

136
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,790
...to live trapped all alone in
a place like this forever?!

137
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,660
But I'm not alone.

138
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,630
All of you will always be with me.

139
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,130
Because I will be everywhere at
every moment from now on.

140
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,010
So even if you can't see me or hear me,
know that I'll be by your side, Homura.

141
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,390
Are you... really all right
with that, Madoka?

142
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,520
Even though I'll forget you?

143
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,270
Even though I'll never even be
able to sense you again?

144
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,150
It's too soon to give up yet.

145
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,690
After all, you managed to follow me
all the way out here, didn't you?

146
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,570
So even when you go back to your world...

147
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,160
...maybe you'll still be able
to remember me.

148
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,840
It'll be all right. I know it'll be all right.

149
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,090
Let's believe.

150
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,210
Madoka...

151
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,890
After all, magical girls make hopes
and dreams come true!

152
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,140
And I'm sure that if it's just a little one,
real miracles really can happen.

153
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,520
Don't you think?

154
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,770
Madoka! Don't go!

155
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm sorry... I've got to go
meet all the others.

156
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,950
I'll see you again one day, Homura.

157
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,040
So for just a little while until
then, I'll say good-bye.

158
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,870
Madoka!!!!

159
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,310
Number 25. Kyosuke Kamijo.

160
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,440
I will be performing "Ave Maria."

161
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,700
Looks like...

162
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I ended up causing you a lot of trouble.

163
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,580
No. I'm the one who should apologize.

164
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,130
In order to save you, I had to leave
things as if nothing has happened.

165
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,840
As a result, this future would
have to disappear as well.

166
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,850
But, I thought it probably wasn't
exactly what you wanted...

167
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,690
I think your wish and all the hard work
you did for it were truly precious.

168
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,240
It absolutely wasn't meaningless.

169
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,700
So...

170
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,160
Yeah.

171
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,450
This is fine.

172
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,660
Really.

173
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,880
All I really wanted was to hear
him play one more time...

174
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,760
I wanted more and more people
to be able to hear him play.

175
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,470
Just remembering that again
is enough for me.

176
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,510
Now I really don't have any regrets.

177
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,350
Well, I guess there is one
thing that bothers me....

178
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,940
But it's Hitomi, after all.

179
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,440
Kyosuke doesn't deserve such a great girl.

180
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,570
I'm sure they'll be very happy...

181
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,190
...won't they?

182
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,030
Yeah.

183
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,240
Should we get going?

184
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,990
Yeah...

185
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,360
...Sayaka?

186
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,200
Where's Sayaka?

187
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,910
Hey! What happened to Sayaka?!

188
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,710
She's gone. Led away by the
indelible Law of the Cycle...

189
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,670
Miki used up all her remaining
power in that last attack.

190
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,800
That idiot!

191
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,430
She didn't have to let herself vanish
just for some boy she liked...!

192
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,560
Idiot... just when we were finally
getting to be friends...

193
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,350
That is the fate of all magical girls.

194
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,980
You've known that since you first
gained this power, surely.

195
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,400
Before the hope we wished for summons
an equivalent amount of misfortune,

196
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,820
we have no choice but to
vanish from this world.

197
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,330
Madoka...!

198
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,170
Akemi?

199
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,210
"Madoka"...?

200
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,760
Who's that?

201
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,770
Madoka! Madoka!

202
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,610
That's right. It looks just like her.

203
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,660
No, Tatsuya. That's not nice.

204
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,410
You don't pull a girl's hair, okay?

205
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,250
Madoka, Madoka!

206
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

207
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm fine. Excuse me for intruding.

208
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,090
"Madoka"... right?

209
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,760
Yeah!

210
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,510
Here I come!

211
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,770
Okay, come on over!

212
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,980
So that's...

213
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,690
...some kind of imaginary friend my
son sees when he plays alone?

214
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,820
I guess that's not unusual
for small children.

215
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,650
Yes. I used to do that, too.

216
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,620
So who is "Madoka"? Do you know her?

217
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,580
Is she some kind of anime
character or something?

218
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Maybe so...

219
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,000
It feels like a name I've both
heard and haven't heard...

220
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,340
I see... Yeah, maybe I've seen her
somewhere with Tatsuya, too...

221
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,380
Sometimes...

222
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,260
...it seems to have such
a nostalgic ring to it...

223
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,510
"Madoka"...

224
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,890
I see...

225
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,810
That is such a cute ribbon!

226
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,900
And exactly the sort of thing I would
like--almost shockingly so!

227
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,070
Allow me to give it to you.

228
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,530
It wouldn't suit an old lady like me.

229
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,540
Well, if I had a daughter, maybe
I would've made her wear it...

230
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,880
I see.

231
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,970
Theoretically, I suppose the system
you described could have worked.

232
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,430
It isn't theoretical. It was real.

233
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,310
Even so, we have no way of proving it.

234
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,230
If the laws of the universe really changed
the way you say they did,

235
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,610
there's no method we could
use to verify that.

236
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,030
And since you are the only one
who remembers that world...

237
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,790
there's no way to tell if your memories are
real or a fairytale you just imagined.

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,410
Well, it is true...

239
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,960
that we can't explain why Soul Gems
shatter when they become too sullied.

240
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,680
But that "witch" concept you mentioned
in your story is quite interesting.

241
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,930
As a means of collecting human
emotional energy,

242
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,470
it certainly has its appeal!

243
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,020
If such a lucrative means of harvesting
energy had been available to us...

244
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,480
...we Incubators might have employed a
very different strategy for all of this...

245
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,980
Of course. That's the sort of
creatures you are, after all...

246
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,950
But in that witch world
you were describing,

247
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,240
there weren't any wraiths like
the ones we fight here, right?

248
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
So collecting curses must have
been a much faster process!

249
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,830
It wasn't that simple.

250
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,670
And our relationship with you
was fairly rocky as well.

251
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,130
I guess it really is impossible to
understand human values.

252
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,810
Just because witches are no
longer born into this world...

253
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,060
...it doesn't mean the curses of
mankind have ceased to exist.

254
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,060
The distortions of this world
have merely changed form,

255
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,070
and now attack people from the
depths of the darkness...

256
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,700
The miasma is pretty thick tonight.

257
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,830
Honestly, these wraiths
just keep on coming!

258
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,040
No matter how many we beat,
there's no end to it.

259
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Your complaining isn’t going to help.

260
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,580
Come on, let's go.

261
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,380
Though this irredeemable world...

262
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,470
continues repeating its
hatred and tragedies...

263
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,810
...this is still the place that
she once tried to protect...

264
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,570
I remember that.

265
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,900
And I will never forget it.

266
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,360
That is why...

267
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,950
I will keep fighting.

268
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,660
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

269
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,960
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

270
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,870
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

271
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,670
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

272
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,770
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

273
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:02,900
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

274
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,740
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

275
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,820
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

276
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,950
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

277
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,870
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

278
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,170
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

279
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,510
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

280
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:34,930
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

281
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,230
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

282
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,650
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

283
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,780
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

284
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,490
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

285
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,820
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

286
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,410
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

287
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,110
Do your best...
