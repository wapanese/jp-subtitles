1
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,180
You tricked us, didn't you?

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,060
I told you precisely what
I wanted from the start:

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,850
For you to become magical girls.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,320
I just didn't explain exactly what
form you'd be taking to do that.

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,900
Why didn't you ever tell us?!

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,860
Because you never asked.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,870
Even though you didn't know, there
wouldn't have been any inconvenience.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,410
In fact, even Mami never
noticed to the very end.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,340
After all, you humans don't physically
sense your souls to begin with.

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,840
Actually, all they really are is
a little cluster of neurons.

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,890
Just a nerve center with functions
similar to a circulatory organ.

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,640
For all that, if they stop functioning,

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,390
even your conscious minds seem
to crumble along with them.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,810
So to help prevent that,

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,150
I put your souls in a form that's easier
to keep track of and protect.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,070
That makes it as safe as possible
for you to battle witches. Right?

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,030
Well, no one asked for your "help"
with something so ridiculous!

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,290
You still don't fully understand
what it is to do battle, do you?

19
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,040
For instance, say that you've
been impaled with a spear.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,170
How much pain do you think you could
take before you simply went into shock?

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
This is what real "pain" feels like.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,640
See? You could be totally incapacitated
with just one hit.

23
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,990
You only managed to finish
the fight with Kyoko...

24
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,530
...because you were spared the
full extent of your body's pain.

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,700
It was only possible because your mind
and body weren't directly connected.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,450
And as a result, you were able
to live through that fight.

27
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,130
Once you get better at it,

28
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,470
you can even detach yourself enough
to block out all sense of pain.

29
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,840
That said...

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,720
It causes your body to respond slower
when you command it to move,

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,470
so I don't recommend it.

32
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,140
Why...? Why would you do
such a thing to us...?!

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,350
Before you took on this destiny
of battling witches,

34
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,480
wasn't there a wish you wanted granted?

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,480
That wish has really has
come true, hasn't it?

36
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,740
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

37
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,030
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

38
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,950
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,750
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

40
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,850
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

41
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,980
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

42
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,820
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,900
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

44
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,030
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

45
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,950
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

46
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,250
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,590
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,010
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

49
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,300
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,720
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

51
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,850
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

52
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,570
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

53
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,900
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,490
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

55
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,410
EPISODE 7: CAN YOU FACE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS?

56
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,290
Stand.

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,750
Bow.

58
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,400
Homura... Did you know?

59
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,070
Then why didnâ€™t you tell us?

60
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,990
I've tried telling others in the past.

61
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,410
Not a single one has ever believed me.

62
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,410
Why would Kyubey do something
so cruel to us?

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Because it doesn't think of it as cruel.

64
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,670
It is a life form that cannot comprehend
human values.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,300
It would probably insist that it is simply
fair payment for the miracles it grants.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,550
But it's not a fair exchange at all!

67
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,510
To have that done to her body...

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,600
when all Sayaka wanted was to heal
the wounds of the boy she loved!

69
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,610
That doesn't change the fact
that it was a miracle.

70
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,820
Because it made something
impossible possible.

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,860
Even if Sayaka Miki had spent
her entire life caring for him,

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,370
that boy never would have regained
the ability to perform.

73
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,750
In truth, the value of a miracle is far
greater than that of an entire human life.

74
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,580
And it is that which that creature sells.

75
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,590
So Sayaka will never be able
to go back to her old life?

76
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,840
I told you once before, didn't I?

77
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,130
You should give up on Sayaka Miki.

78
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,850
But Sayaka saved my life!

79
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,480
If she hadn't become a magical girl then,

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,100
both Hitomi and I would have died!

81
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,150
Don't confuse gratitude with responsibility.

82
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,990
You have no ability to save Sayaka Miki.

83
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,910
If you hope to repay her in order to
alleviate your own sense of guilt, don't.

84
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,490
There is no need for such presumption.

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,420
Homura, why are you always so cold?

86
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,500
Perhaps...

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,420
...it is because I, too, am
no longer human...

88
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,510
Now that I've got a body like this...

89
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,720
...how can I possibly face Kyosuke again?

90
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,560
How long are you planning to sit
up there moping, blockhead?

91
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,160
Can you come out for a sec?

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,070
I wanna talk.

93
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,460
Guess you're really regretting it, huh?

94
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,210
This whole zombie thing...

95
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,680
As for me, I guess I'm okay with it.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,880
I mean, whatever the details,

97
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,300
it was only after I got this power that
I was able to live like I wanted.

98
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,720
So I guess it's not so bad that I'd regret it.

99
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,270
It's all just "you get what you
pay for" to you, isn't it?

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,770
Exactly! "You get what you
pay for" - that's how I live.

101
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,270
And if you live only to benefit yourself,

102
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,780
you've got to pay for your
own mistakes too.

103
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,110
So I don't hold this against anyone,
and I don't regret anything.

104
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,780
If you think like that, you can take most
anything without getting down.

105
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,100
What did you bring me all
the way out here for?

106
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,730
It's gonna be kind of a long talk.

107
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,480
Want one?

108
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,330
Don't ever waste food. I'll kill you if you do.

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,520
See... this was my dad's church.

110
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,530
He was an overly kind and earnest man.

111
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,570
Like, the type who cries reading the
morning paper every morning...

112
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,160
and seriously thinks about
how to make things better.

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,450
He thought that in order to
save a new generation,

114
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,910
we needed to have a new religion.

115
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,080
That's what he always said.

116
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,960
That's why, one day,

117
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,460
he started preaching stuff that wasn't
in the Bible to his parishioners.

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,010
Naturally, people stopped
coming to his sermons.

119
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,430
Then he got excommunicated
by the church...

120
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,600
...and no one would listen
to his words anymore.

121
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,430
I guess it was only natural, huh?

122
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,390
From the outside, he probably looked
like some raving cultist.

123
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,520
No matter how right he was,

124
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,900
no matter how logical the
things he said were,

125
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,230
the world only saw him
as some crazy outcast.

126
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,280
It got to the point where our entire family
didn't even have food to eat.

127
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,160
I just couldn't understand it.

128
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,410
My dad wasn't saying anything
that was wrong.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,210
It was just different from what
people were used to hearing.

130
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,420
If they would've given him just 5 minutes
to hear what he had to say,

131
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,130
anyone would've agreed that he was right.

132
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,680
But no one would listen.

133
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,850
I got angry.

134
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,270
I couldn't accept it.

135
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,940
I couldn't stand that nobody would
give my dad a chance...

136
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,480
...and understand what he was saying.

137
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,570
So I asked Kyubey...

138
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,780
...to make everyone listen seriously
to what my dad said.

139
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,910
The next morning, the church was
packed full of people again.

140
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,170
Every day, they came in bigger and bigger
crowds to hear my dad speak.

141
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,090
And as for me, I happily began
my work as a magical girl.

142
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,260
After all, even if my dad was
preaching truth to the world,

143
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,800
someone still had to take
care of the witches.

144
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,010
And so...

145
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,520
...like an idiot, I thought of it as my role,
and threw myself into witch-hunting.

146
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,810
I thought that my dad and me--

147
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,890
one from the front, one from the shadows--

148
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,150
were going to save this world together.

149
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,820
But one day, my dad found out about me.

150
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,950
When he heard that all the
people were there...

151
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,610
because I'd used magic
to make them come,

152
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,080
and not because they really
believed, he flipped out.

153
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,040
He called me - his own daughter - a
witch who tainted people's hearts.

154
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,040
Isn't that hilarious?

155
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,550
After I'd been out hunting
real witches every night!

156
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,430
After that, my dad had a breakdown.

157
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,220
He was miserable in the end.

158
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,930
He wasted away with drink, got
messed up in the head...

159
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,480
...then finally killed my whole family
and committed suicide.

160
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,440
Leaving only me behind...

161
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,030
My wish destroyed my whole family.

162
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
Because I went and made
a wish for someone else...

163
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
...without really knowing what he wanted,

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,790
I ended up bringing everyone misfortune.

165
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:59,300
Right then, I vowed in my heart never to
use magic to help anyone else again.

166
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
I would use this power up...

167
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,050
...for my sake and mine alone.

168
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,770
Miracles aren't free, you know.

169
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,890
If you wish for hope,

170
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,020
an equal amount of despair will
be rained down upon you, too.

171
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,730
That's how everything
stays in equilibrium...

172
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,980
...and the world's balance
doesn't get disturbed.

173
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,990
Why are you telling me all of this?

174
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,030
'Cause you should just quit caring
and do whatever you want, too.

175
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,740
"You get what you pay for," right?

176
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,910
Now, that's odd.

177
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,250
Since you only live for your own benefit,

178
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,750
why are you worrying about
me, all of sudden?

179
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,010
'Cause you started off with
the same mistake as me.

180
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,510
You shouldn't keep living the kind of life
that's gonna bring you more regrets.

181
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,020
I mean, you've already paid your dues
- and paid way too high a price.

182
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,270
So now, you should just think about
how to get your money's worth.

183
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,980
Like you do?

184
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,650
Yep.

185
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,570
I've already figured out how
things really stand,

186
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,780
but you're continuing on
with the wrong idea.

187
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,530
I couldn't watch you go on like that.

188
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,000
I was really wrong about you.

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I apologize for that, really.

190
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,630
But even then, I don't regret making
my wish for someone else's sake.

191
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,840
To make sure the feelings I made that
wish with never become a lie,

192
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,930
I've decided I'll never regret anything. Ever.

193
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,930
Why are you--

194
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,930
Actually,

195
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,430
I don't think I paid too high a price.

196
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,440
Because, depending on how we use it, this
magic can be used for wonderful things.

197
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,280
Which reminds me...

198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,490
Those apples...

199
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,400
How did you get them?

200
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,740
Where did you get the money
to pay for them?

201
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,750
You can't answer me, can you?

202
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,790
In that case, I can't eat those apples.

203
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,670
And I can't be happy about
receiving them either.

204
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
You jerk!

205
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,880
We're magical girls!

206
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,430
There's no one else who
can do what we do!

207
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,550
I'll do things my own way...

208
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,180
...and continue my own fight.

209
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,100
If that interferes with your life,

210
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,150
you're welcome to come
and try to kill me again.

211
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,270
I won't lose to you.

212
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,610
Nor will I resent you or anyone else.

213
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,470
Sayaka! Good morning!

214
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,680
Good morning, Sayaka.

215
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,310
H-hey!

216
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,310
Good morning!

217
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,110
Where were you yesterday?

218
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,530
Oh, I was just feeling a little sick...

219
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,070
Sayaka...

220
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,870
It's okay. I feel all right now.

221
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,950
You don't have to worry.

222
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,710
Well, then! Let's do our best today--

223
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,840
Oh!

224
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,130
Has Kamijo already been released
from the hospital?

225
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,140
Kamijo, are you really okay
to come to school already?

226
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,310
Yeah.

227
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,440
If I just sat bundled up at home,

228
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,900
it wouldn't help my leg
rehab much anyway.

229
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,610
I'm aiming to walk without crutches
again by next week.

230
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm so glad for Kamijo.

231
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,610
Yeah...

232
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,990
You should go say hi to him, Sayaka.

233
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,370
You haven't talked to him yet, right?

234
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,410
I'm... fine here.

235
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,050
So...

236
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,010
What did you want to talk about?

237
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,010
About love.

238
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,850
I have a secret that I've been keeping
from both you and Madoka.

239
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,440
Huh? Um, okay...

240
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,400
For a long time now, I...

241
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,320
...have been in love with Kyosuke Kamijo.

242
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,030
O-oh, really?

243
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,920
I never would've guessed, Hitomi!

244
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,130
Kyosuke, the lucky guy--

245
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,880
Sayaka, you were a childhood friend
of Kamijo's, weren't you?

246
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:57,390
Y-yeah, or, um, maybe more of
a tag-along or something...

247
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,390
Was it really only that?

248
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,730
I've decided not to lie to myself any longer.

249
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,440
How about you?

250
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,900
Sayaka, can you face your true feelings?

251
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,530
W-what are you talking about?

252
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,160
You are a precious friend to me.

253
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,080
That's why I don't want to cut in
or steal him out of your hands.

254
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,040
The amount of time you spend looking
at him surpasses even mine.

255
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,090
So I think you have the right
to try for him before me.

256
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,050
Hitomi...

257
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,100
I will confess my love to Kamijo
after school tomorrow.

258
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,100
I will wait one full day for you.

259
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,850
So please decide what to do so
you won't have regrets, Sayaka.

260
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,520
Decide whether you want to confess
your feelings to Kamijo, or not...

261
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,820
I-I...

262
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,930
Madoka...

263
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,010
Is it okay if I come along?

264
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,690
I don't want you to be all alone,
Sayaka. So please...

265
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,810
You... Why...?

266
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,320
Why are you so nice?

267
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,900
I don't deserve such kindness...

268
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,160
What?

269
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,910
I had a moment today, where
I almost regretted something.

270
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,830
For just a split-second, I thought,

271
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,250
"If only I hadn't saved Hitomi that time..."

272
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,420
I completely fail at being an ally of justice.

273
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,340
How will I ever face Mami?

274
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,480
I'm going to lose Kyosuke to Hitomi...!

275
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,360
And there's nothing I can do...

276
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,030
Because I'm already dead...

277
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,780
Because I'm a zombie...!

278
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,160
I can't ask him to hold me when
I have a body like this!

279
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,240
I can't ever ask him to kiss me!

280
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,390
Thank you...

281
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,010
Sayaka...

283
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,850
I'm okay now.

284
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,810
I got it all out.

285
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,480
Now, let's go.

286
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,820
We've got some more witches
to beat up today!

287
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay.

288
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,340
It's not like you to just
sit quietly and watch.

289
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,050
She's battling a witch today, not a familiar.

290
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,470
It's sure to drop a Grief Seed.

291
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,140
So it isn't a waste this time.

292
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,600
But I'm surprised that you're handing
over your prey for such a reason.

293
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,190
That idiot! How long does
it take her to finish it!?

294
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,270
Sayaka!

295
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,490
For Pete's sake! I just can't watch this!

296
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,990
Just get back for now.

297
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,750
I'll show you how it's done!

298
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Hey!

299
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,540
Stay out of my way. I can do this alone!

300
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,590
Sayaka!

301
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,680
You... you're not...?

302
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,990
It's really true!

303
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,780
If I just detach myself...

304
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,750
...I really donâ€™t feel any pain!

305
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,710
Stop...

306
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,840
Please, just stop...

307
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,730
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

308
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,480
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

309
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,360
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

310
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,400
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

311
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,070
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

312
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,870
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

313
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,500
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

314
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,460
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

315
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,460
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

316
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,130
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

317
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,970
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

318
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,810
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

319
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,650
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

320
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,480
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

321
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,360
Taorareta hana no yuuki

322
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,200
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

323
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:45,880
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

324
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,310
I'm going to be a different kind
of magical girl from all of you...

325
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,180
That's what I've decided...

326
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,940
I don't need thanks or recompense.

327
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,690
I'll be the one magical girl who won't
use her magic for herself.

328
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,070
EPISODE 8: I WAS STUPID... SO STUPID

329
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,740
I was stupid... so stupid.
