1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,470
Hi...

2
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,440
Here. For you.

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,740
Really, thank you so much for all of this.

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,700
You're really some kind genius
at finding rare CDs, aren't you?

5
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,950
Nah!

6
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,620
I just get lucky, that's all.

7
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,870
This soloist's interpretations
are really incredible.

8
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,160
Do you want to try listening
to it too, Sayaka?

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,080
I-if you don't mind...

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,000
I wish I could play this on a speaker for
you, but we are in a hospital, after all...

11
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,630
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

12
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,920
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,630
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,730
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

16
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,860
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

17
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,790
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

19
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,920
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,840
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,140
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

22
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,470
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

23
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,900
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

24
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,190
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

25
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,610
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

26
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,740
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

27
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,450
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

28
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,790
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

29
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,380
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,380
EPISODE 3: I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING ANYMORE

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,890
Tiro Finale!!

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
Maaan, you are so cool, Mami!

33
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,150
This isn't a magic show, you know.

34
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,200
Don't forget that what we're doing
here is very dangerous.

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,120
Right on!

36
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,000
It didn't drop a Grief Seed this time.

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,880
It's because that was only a witch's
familiar - not a witch itself.

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Familiars don't carry Grief Seeds.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,590
So that wasn’t a witch...

40
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,920
It seems like we've only been
fighting duds lately.

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,090
Yes, but we can't leave familiars
to do as they please.

42
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,600
If allowed to develop,

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,180
familiars become the same kind
of witch they broke off from.

44
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,560
Well, shall we go?

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,520
So have you figured out what to wish for?

46
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,150
Nah... How about you, Madoka?

47
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,440
Uh-uh...

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,820
That's how it goes, once someone tells
you to think hard about something.

49
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,910
What did you wish for, Mami?

50
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,750
Oh! I don't mean to pry if you
don't want to answer--

51
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,830
In my case...

52
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,800
...I didn't have the luxury
of thinking about it first.

53
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,850
It's not that I have any regrets.

54
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,140
I think the life I currently live...

55
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,360
...is far better than dying in that
place would have been.

56
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,020
But...

57
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,780
I'd like those who do have the chance
to think carefully before deciding.

58
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,240
I want them to have the
choice I didn't have.

59
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,700
Hey, Mami...

60
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,290
If you make a wish, does it
have to be for yourself?

61
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:54,910
Huh?

62
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,460
For example - and this is really
just an example, okay?

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,130
Say there was someone who was having
a way tougher time than I am,

64
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,630
and I wanted to make my wish to help him.

65
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,380
Are you talking about Kamijo?

66
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,470
I said this was just an example!!

67
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,980
There's no requirement that the wish's
beneficiary be the contractee herself.

68
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,890
There's even precedent for it already.

69
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,020
But it may not be the best idea.

70
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,070
If you want to use your wish
to grant someone else's,

71
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,360
then you must make doubly sure you
know what you're wishing for.

72
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,070
Miki, do you truly wish for
his dream to come true?

73
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,870
Or do you actually wish to grant his dream
so that he will be grateful to you?

74
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,290
Mami...!

75
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,500
They sound similar, but they're completely
different at the core.

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,330
You know?

77
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,420
...That's a little harsh, isn't it?

78
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,010
But this really needs to be said
now, before it's too late.

80
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,260
Because if you go ahead with
it without making certain first,

81
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,430
you're sure to regret it later.

82
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,600
...You're right.

83
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,310
I guess my idea was a little naïve.

84
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,060
Sorry.

85
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,150
It really is a hard decision, isn't it?

86
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,860
There's no need to rush into it.

87
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,950
Though for me, the sooner
you decide, the better.

88
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,160
That's no good, Kyubey.

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,040
Nobody likes a boy who pressures
girls to do things.

90
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,630
It really isn't an easy decision, is it?

91
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,550
And considering my position, I can't
rush you into deciding either.

92
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,880
Suggesting wishes would
also be against the rules.

93
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,140
So I guess just wishing to become
a magical girl wouldn't work, huh?

94
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,680
Is power for its own sake what
you desire, Madoka?

95
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,060
It isn't that.

96
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,770
...Or... Maybe it IS that...

97
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,400
I mean, I'm not very smart, and
I don’t really have any talents.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,700
So if I could become someone as
cool and wonderful as Mami...

99
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,410
...I'd be more than happy with just that.

100
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,490
If you became a magical girl, Madoka,

101
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,660
you'd be much more powerful than Mami.

102
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,410
Huh?

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,250
Though, of course, part of that depends
on what kind of wish you make.

104
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,220
Even I can't completely gauge how large
the Soul Gem you'd create would be.

105
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,680
I've never met another girl with such
enormous potential as you.

106
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,220
Oh, come on!

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,310
You're just teasing me, right?

108
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,180
No...

109
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,020
Madoka? Are you awake?

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,940
Yes. What's wrong?

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,530
Oh, not again.

112
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,990
Oh, Mom...

113
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,120
W-water...

114
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,540
...that balding old coot...!

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,750
If he wants a drink so badly, he can
damn well pour it himself...!

116
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,710
Thanks.

117
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,880
Shall I make us some hot chocolate?

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,510
Yes, please!

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,140
I wonder why she loves to work so much.

120
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,270
I mean, it wasn't always her dream
to work for that company, was it?

121
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,430
Hmm...

122
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,020
It isn't so much that Mom
enjoys her work...

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,770
What she really likes is trying
her best at something.

124
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,110
Even though she encounters lots
of trying and unpleasant things...

125
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,950
...the satisfaction she gets from
overcoming those challenges...

126
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,450
...is what she treasures most in this world.

127
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,200
So even though working at a company
wasn't necessarily her dream...

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,920
...the way she is living her life
is absolutely ideal to her.

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,630
It's possible to achieve your dreams
in that way as well, you know.

130
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,420
So the way she lives her
life was her dream?

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,970
Different people might have
different opinions of that...

132
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,390
But as for me, that's something
I really love about her.

133
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,640
I respect the way she leads her
life and am very proud of her.

134
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,520
She truly is amazing, isn't she?

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,600
Yeah.

136
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
You do understand, don’t you?

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,410
That you're leading innocent
bystanders into real danger?

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,670
They were chosen by Kyubey.

139
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,340
They're not innocent
bystanders anymore.

140
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,340
You're trying to lead them so that
they want to be magical girls.

141
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,050
And you don't like that, I take it?

142
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,640
No. It's a problem.

143
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,890
...Particularly in the case
of Madoka Kaname.

144
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,980
I see. So you've noticed
it as well, have you?

145
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,890
That she has incredible potential.

146
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,270
She is the one person I absolutely cannot
allow to make the contract.

147
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,820
Afraid that a magical girl stronger
than you will get in your way?

148
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,700
That's the way a bullied child thinks.

149
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,830
I have no wish to fight you, but...

150
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,620
Then take care to ensure that our
paths will never cross again.

151
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,370
Tonight will probably be the last time...

152
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,040
...that we will be able to speak
without coming to blows.

153
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,560
Hey. Sorry for the wait.

154
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,350
Huh? Weren't you able
to see Kamijo today?

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,400
Apparently, he couldn't be inconvenienced
to see me today or something.

156
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,110
Seriously, after I took all the trouble
to come here. How rude!

157
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,910
What's wrong?

158
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,910
There's... something over there.

159
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,790
A Grief Seed!

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,620
It's about to hatch!

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,170
No way! Why here of all places...?

162
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,130
This isn't good. We have to get out of here!

163
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,840
A Labyrinth is about to open up here!

164
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,130
You mean one of those crazy mazes?!

165
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,300
Madoka, do you have Mami's
phone number on you?

166
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,760
N-no...

167
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,260
This isn't good...

168
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,680
Madoka, find Mami and bring her here.

169
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,270
I'll stay here and keep an eye on that thing.

170
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,650
No!

171
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,810
That's too dangerous.

172
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,110
Though there's still time before
the witch emerges,

173
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,940
once the labyrinth pulls you inside,
you won't be able to leave it.

174
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,700
There's no guarantee that Mami
will get here in time to save you.

175
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,660
But once the labyrinth opens, we'll
lose track of the witch, won't we?

176
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,960
I can't afford to let that happen. Not here...

177
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,170
Madoka, you go on ahead.

178
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,300
I'll stay here with Sayaka.

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Huh?

180
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,220
Once Mami gets here, she'll be able
to track my position using telepathy.

181
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,140
So if I stay and watch the
Grief Seed with Sayaka,

182
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,390
I'll be able to guide Mami...

183
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,140
...down the shortest path to us.

184
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
Thank you, Kyubey!

185
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,610
Then, I'll find Mami and bring
her here as fast as I can!

186
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,670
Are you frightened, Sayaka?

187
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,220
Well, yeah... that kind of
goes without saying.

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,010
If you were just to decide upon a wish...

189
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,770
...I could turn you into a magical
girl right here and now.

190
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,890
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

191
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,730
Right.

192
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,940
If things get bad enough,
I may ask you to do that.

193
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,730
But I'll hold off for now.

194
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,570
Because this is such an important
decision to me...

195
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,780
...I don't want to make it rashly if possible.

196
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,830
Here, right?

197
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,710
Kyubey, what's the situation?

198
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,300
We're still okay.

199
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,590
It looks like the witch isn't
going to hatch just yet.

200
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,340
Sayaka, are you okay?

201
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,680
Totally fine.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,010
I'm so bored I'm about to doze off in here!

203
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,260
Right now,

204
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,060
it'd be better not to use any large amounts
of magic that might disturb the egg.

205
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,350
There's no need to hurry,

206
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,400
so come to us as quietly as you can.

207
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,480
Got it.

208
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,910
Thank goodness we made it in time.

209
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,000
Though Sayaka took such a huge
risk that I'm actually a bit angry...

210
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,340
But in this one case, it was a good,
clear-headed call on her part.

211
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,130
This way, we won't have to worry
about the witch getting a--

212
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,800
I thought I told you I didn't
want to see you again.

213
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,180
I shall hunt this prey.

214
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,890
The two of you should leave here.

215
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,770
I don't think so.

216
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,480
Miki and Kyubey are waiting
for us in there.

217
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,730
I shall guarantee their safety.

218
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,980
And you think we could trust you?

219
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,780
F-fool!

220
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,320
This isn't the time for--

221
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,370
I don't want to hurt you, of course.

222
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,750
But if you insist on struggling,
the cords will only tighten.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,670
This witch is not like the others!

224
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,300
Behave and I will release you unharmed
after I finish up here.

225
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,840
Let's go, Kaname.

226
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,220
O-okay.

227
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,430
Wai--!

228
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,250
Um... Mami?

229
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,620
What is it?

230
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,250
I've been thinking really hard about
all sorts of different wishes, but...

231
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,460
Did you decide on one?

232
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,340
Yes.

233
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,260
But, I think it might be the naïve kind
of wish that would make you mad...

234
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,430
So what is this dream you want granted?

235
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,270
Well, I've never been good at school,

236
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,690
and I don’t have any kind of talent
that I could take pride in...

237
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,980
And I'm sure I'll continue on like this,

238
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,530
being no use to anyone and having
to bother others for help...

239
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,700
Thinking about that makes me
feel so awful, I can't stand it.

240
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,290
But then I met you, Mami.

241
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,830
And you showed me what it's like...

242
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,090
...to fight to save people.

243
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,670
And then...

244
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,550
...when I heard that even I might
be able to do the same thing...

245
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,930
...it was the happiest thing I'd
ever experienced in my life.

246
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,810
That's why, I think that just becoming
a magical girl would fulfill my dreams.

247
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:47,150
If someone like me can help people
and live my life with pride...

248
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,280
That would be my greatest dream.

249
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,240
It won't be easy, you know?

250
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,120
You'll get injured,

251
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,160
and you won't have time to go on
dates or have fun with friends.

252
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,500
Even so, after watching the way
you keep doing your very best...

253
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,580
...I really look up to you, Mami.

254
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,540
I'm really not worth looking up to.

255
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,670
Huh?

256
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,170
I only push myself and pretend to be cool.

257
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,760
Even when I'm scared, or hurting,
there's no one I can talk to.

258
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,050
All I can do is cry on my own.

259
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,520
It isn't a good thing...

260
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,060
to be a magical girl.

261
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,020
But you're not alone any more, Mami.

262
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,070
You're right...

263
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm not alone anymore, am I?

264
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,370
Will you really stand and fight
with me from now on?

265
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,290
Will you really stay with me?

266
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes. If someone like me will do.

267
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,920
Oh, goodness!

268
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,630
Some role model I'm supposed to be.

269
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,050
I'm really no good at this, am I?

270
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,550
Mami...

271
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,640
Still, it's not every day you
can have a wish granted.

272
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,180
So try to think of something you want.

273
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,230
Yeah, it is a special chance, isn't it?

274
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,690
You're still making a contract, after all,

275
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,110
so you may as well get something out of it.

276
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,860
You could wish to become a billionaire,
or maybe to have a perfect boyfriend.

277
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,780
Anything you want.

278
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,070
Um, but...

279
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,360
Okay, then how about this?

280
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,160
If you can't decide on a wish by
the time I finish off this witch...

281
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,660
...we'll ask Kyubey to give us a huge
feast with a fabulous cake!

282
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,080
C-cake?!

283
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,370
Yep!

284
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,540
The biggest and most
extravagant cake ever!

285
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,920
And with it, we'll have a
big party for everyone--

286
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,800
To celebrate the two of us becoming
a magical girl duo!

287
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,390
But I can't become a magical
girl for a cake!

288
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,930
No? Then decide on a wish
you really do want.

289
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,890
Mami!

290
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,770
The Grief Seed's moving!

291
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,900
It's going to hatch! Hurry!

292
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,490
Okay! I've got it.

293
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,070
Today's a special day,
so I'll finish it off fast!

294
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,120
Wah! B-but--

295
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,820
I feel so light today.

296
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,820
This is the first time I've felt
so happy during a fight.

297
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,450
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

298
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,870
Because... I'm not alone anymore!

299
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,760
Sorry for the wait!

300
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,720
You're just in time!

301
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,600
Be careful. It's coming!

302
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,530
Sorry to rain on your parade.

303
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,990
But I'm going to finish you right here!

304
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,780
Got you!

305
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,540
You did it!

306
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,420
TIRO--

307
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,920
FINALE!!

308
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,570
It can't be...

309
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,000
You two! Make a contract
with me right now!!

310
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,210
Madoka! Sayaka!

311
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,460
Decide on a wish! Hurry!

312
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,920
That won't be necessary.

313
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,350
I shall be the one to slay it.

314
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,860
A moment later and you
would have been dead.

315
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Burn this sight into your minds.

316
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,870
This is what it means to be a magical girl.

317
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,100
...Give it back.

318
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,980
Give it back! That--

319
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,690
That belongs to Mami...!

320
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,610
I said to give it back! Back to Mami!

321
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,780
That's right. This belongs
only to magical girls.

322
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,700
Neither of you has any right to touch it.

323
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,690
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

324
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,440
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

325
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,310
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

326
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,360
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

327
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,030
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

328
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,820
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

329
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,450
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

330
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,420
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

331
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

332
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,090
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

333
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,930
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

334
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,770
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

335
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,600
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

336
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

337
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,320
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

338
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,160
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

339
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:45,840
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

340
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,430
