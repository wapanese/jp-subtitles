1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,300
You can really grant any wish, right?

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,930
Don't worry.

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,470
Your wish is absolutely grantable.

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,430
So... Ready?

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,190
Yes. Do it.

6
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,090
Now...

7
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,090
Open yourself and accept it.

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
This is your destiny.

9
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,600
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

11
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,810
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

12
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,610
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,710
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

14
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,840
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,680
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,760
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,890
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

18
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,810
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

19
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,110
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,450
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

21
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,870
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

22
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,170
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

23
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,590
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

24
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,720
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,430
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

26
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,770
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

27
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,350
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,350
EPISODE 5: THERE'S NO WAY I'LL EVER REGRET IT

29
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,450
Oh, how crass of me.

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,160
Please excuse me.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,660
What's the matter, Hitomi?
Didn't get enough sleep?

32
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,080
Yes, I was kept up so late dealing with
the police and the hospital last night.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,250
Huh? Did something happen?

34
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,420
Apparently, I went sleepwalking
or some such thing...

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,630
Oddly enough, there were many other
people who did the same thing.

36
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,010
When we woke up, we were all collapsed
in the same place together.

37
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,180
Huh? What was that about?

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,510
The doctor said we'd had a mass
hallucination or something of the sort.

39
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,770
In fact, I have to go back in for
more tests after school today.

40
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,480
Ohh, what a bother.

41
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,440
After all that, you should've
just stayed home today.

42
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,940
Oh, I couldn't do that.

43
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,650
If I had stayed home, it would
really seem like I was sick.

44
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,570
And my family would just get
more and more worried.

45
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,160
That's our little overachiever! Good for you.

46
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,960
It's been a while since I've felt this good.

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm totally refreshed!

48
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,010
Sayaka... Aren't you scared at all?

49
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,220
Huh?

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,850
Well, I am a little.

51
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,520
But I was able to beat that witch
yesterday pretty easily.

52
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,480
And when I think of how I might've
lost both of my best friends...

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
...that scares me a lot more.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,860
Which is why...

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,200
I don’t really know what to call
it. Self-confidence, maybe?

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,870
Or relief?

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,330
I guess I'm a little bit proud
of myself right now, too.

58
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,460
Anyway!

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,830
I'm really getting fired up for this now.

60
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,380
From here on, I - Magical Girl Sayaka -

61
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,840
will keep Mitakihara City super-duper
safe and sound!

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,260
You really don't have any regrets at all?

63
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,770
Well... If I have any regret...

64
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,230
...it's probably that I hesitated for so long.

65
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,020
Since I ended up doing it anyway,

66
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,020
I feel like I should have made
up my mind sooner.

67
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,240
If I had been there to fight
that witch with Mami,

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,820
then maybe she wouldn't have had to die.

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,030
I...

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,470
Come on, you're not thinking
something silly, are you?

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,430
I... I should've...

72
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,550
It's easy for me to say so only because
I have become one already.

73
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,520
The important thing is that
I've made my decision.

74
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,390
Honestly, I really do think I was
meant to be a magical girl.

75
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,270
Sayaka...

76
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,190
After all, I found something
I truly wished for.

77
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,200
Something that I wouldn't mind having
to risk my life fighting for.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Having a wish that strong
gives me reason enough.

79
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,280
I guess the one frustrating thing...

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,790
...is how long it took me to realize
how much it meant to me.

81
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,630
Which is to say, you have
no reason to feel guilty.

82
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,130
This just means there's no problem if you
don't want to become a magical girl.

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,600
Anyhow! It's about time I got going.

84
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,980
Do you have something
to do this afternoon?

85
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,390
Yeah, sort of.

86
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,150
I see. So they're not discharging you yet?

87
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,280
I've still got to finish my leg rehabilitation.

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,320
After all, I can't do much anything
until I can walk again.

89
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,500
Plus, we still have no idea why my
hand suddenly healed like that.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,880
So the doctors want me to stay
to run a few more tests on it.

91
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,250
And how do you feel, Kyosuke?

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,590
Does any part of your body
feel strange at all?

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,260
No. In fact, I feel so fine
that it's a little scary.

94
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,100
The accident almost feels
like a bad dream now.

95
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,600
So much so that I sometimes wonder
what I'm doing in this bed.

96
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,600
It's just like you said, Sayaka...

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
It's a miracle.

98
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,400
What's the matter?

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,870
I... said some really awful
things to you, Sayaka.

100
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,030
Just because I was depressed,
it doesn't excuse--

101
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,700
Oh, forget about stuff like that!

102
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Right now, you should be completely
over-the-moon happy about your hand.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,420
So don't make a face like that.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Right...

105
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,920
Though it still hasn't really sunk in.

106
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,550
Well, that's no surprise.

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,760
Ah, it's about time.

108
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,140
Kyosuke, why don't we
go out for some air?

109
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,270
What are we going to the roof for?

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,940
You'll see.

111
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,500
Why are all of you...?

112
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,590
We'll have the real party after you get
released from the hospital, but...

113
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,010
Since your hand healed already...

114
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,010
Is that...?

115
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,680
You told me to get rid of it, but...

116
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,100
I just couldn't bear to throw it away.

117
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
I...

118
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,240
Go on, give it a try.

119
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,830
Don't be afraid.

120
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,160
Mami...

121
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,830
My wish has been granted.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,130
There's no way I'll ever regret it.

123
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,170
This is the happiest moment of my life.

124
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,330
So that's the city's new magical girl, huh?

125
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,300
Are you really going to
pick a fight with her?

126
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,340
Sure, seems like an easy win to me.

127
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,550
She won't even know what hit her.

128
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,180
Or, what?

129
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,640
You got a problem with that?

130
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,310
It may not all work out
the way you imagine.

131
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,690
There is another magical girl in this city.

132
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,650
Huh? Who is it?

133
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,150
I'm not really sure myself.

134
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,700
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

135
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,200
If she's a magical girl, she must've
made a contract with you, right?

136
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,910
You could say yes. You could also say no.

137
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,750
She's quite the "irregularity."

138
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,000
Even I can't guess when
or where she'll strike.

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,920
Hmm... Sounds good to me!

140
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,760
Gettin’ kinda boring around here, anyway.

141
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,800
Gotta shake things up once
in a while after all!

142
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,480
You said you wanted to talk?

143
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,360
Um, well... It's about Sayaka...

144
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,570
S-she gets offended easily,

145
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,490
and she's stubborn, and she's quick
to start arguments sometimes, but...

146
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,870
But she's really a wonderful person!

147
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,960
She's kind-hearted and brave,

148
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,750
and if she thinks someone needs help,
she'll try really hard for them...

149
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,340
All fatal flaws for a magical girl.

150
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,720
R-really?

151
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,140
Unchecked kindness grows into naïveté,

152
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,850
and brash courage often leads
one to be caught off guard.

153
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,850
Further, no matter how hard you try,
there is no thanks or recompense.

154
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,600
Those who cannot comprehend that
are not fit to be magical girls.

155
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,820
That is why Mami Tomoe lost her life.

156
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,610
Don't talk about Mami that way!

157
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,830
Anyway... Sayaka says she'll
be all right by herself.

158
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,910
But...

159
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,960
When I think about how what happened
to Mami might happen to her...

160
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,460
I just don't know what to do.

161
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,710
You're worried about Sayaka Miki, then?

162
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,430
I can't do anything to help
her myself, so I...

163
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,640
I was hoping that I could
ask you, Homura...

164
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,020
Please become friends with Sayaka.

165
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,900
And please don't fight with
her like you did with Mami.

166
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,820
Because if all of us work together
when we go to fight witches...

167
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,070
...it's sure to be a lot safer for everyone.

168
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,580
I don't like to tell lies.

169
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,750
And I don't make promises
I can't keep, either.

170
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,630
Which is why I'm telling you to
give up on Sayaka Miki now.

171
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,840
But why...?

172
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,630
She should not have made the contract.

173
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,430
I admit it was an oversight on my part.

174
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,720
I should have kept a close watch
on her, as I did on you.

175
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,270
Then -

176
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,440
But as I acknowledge my responsibility,
you must understand as well.

177
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,530
This is a mistake from which
she can never be recovered.

178
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,950
Just as the dead don't return to
life, consider her fate sealed.

179
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,870
Once you become a magical girl,
you have no hope of salvation.

180
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,080
When we make our contracts,

181
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,540
we give up everything in exchange
for a single wish.

182
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,800
Does that mean you've
given up too, Homura?

183
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,930
Both on yourself and on all the other girls?

184
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,220
Yes.

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,060
I won't make excuses for myself.

186
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,940
No matter what sins I bear,
I must continue my fight.

187
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,440
It seems I've wasted your time.

188
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,110
I apologize.

189
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,300
Are you nervous?

190
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah, kind of.

191
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,300
After all, one mistake and I'm done for.

192
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,180
Madoka?

193
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,140
Sayaka... Are you going to...?

194
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,770
Yep! Time to patrol for wicked witches!

195
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,980
After all, that's a duty of any ally of justice!

196
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,320
Will you really be all right on your own?

197
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,070
I'll be just fine.

198
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,070
Mami always did this on her own too.

199
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,070
As her successor, I can
do that much, at least!

200
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,000
Um... I know I can't do anything to help,

201
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,870
and I'll probably just get in your way...

202
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,580
But -

203
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,630
As long as I'm not being a bother -

204
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,170
For as far as you can take me...

205
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,010
Please let me come with you?

206
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,390
Aren't you trying a little too hard?

207
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,390
I-I'm sorry...

208
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,350
I'm asking too much. I
knew I'd be a bother...

209
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,850
No - I'm really happy you asked!

210
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,770
You could tell, couldn't you?

211
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,520
That my hands were shaking?

212
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,280
They haven't stopped this whole time.

213
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,030
Pathetic, aren't I?

214
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,070
Even though I've become a
full-fledged magical girl,

215
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,240
I get so scared when I'm alone...

216
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,160
Sayaka...

217
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,080
You wouldn't be a bother.
I'd really like you to come.

218
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,920
Just knowing I'll have someone with
me makes me feel incredibly brave!

219
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,330
I feel like I could beat up 100 bad guys!

220
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,670
I...

221
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,000
I swear I'll keep you safe.

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,840
So come with me, and don't
worry about a thing.

223
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,090
Let's go hunt witches together,
just like we used to.

224
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay.

225
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,720
You understand how dangerous
this is, right?

226
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,770
I'm kind of an idiot,

227
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,480
so if I went alone, I'd probably do all sorts
of reckless things and get killed.

228
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,110
But with Madoka there, I'll think harder
about my actions and focus better.

229
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,320
I see.

230
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,570
Well, as long as you've thought
it through, it's fine with me.

231
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,570
Kyubey...

232
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,160
After all, you've thought up your own
plan too, haven't you, Madoka?

233
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,910
I understand your desire
to protect Sayaka.

234
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,130
Actually, just by coming with us,

235
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,670
you'll give us a trump card that we
can play if things really get bad.

236
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,300
I...

237
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,720
You don't have to say anything
about it now.

238
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,100
Sayaka is sure to be against it, after all.

239
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,930
But if ever the time comes when
you decide upon a wish...

240
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,940
...I will always be ready for you.

241
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,940
Okay.

242
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,120
This is it.

243
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,120
This labyrinth was probably made
by a familiar, not a witch.

244
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,830
It'd be nice if I can beat it easily.

245
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,630
I'm still new at this, after all.

246
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,500
Getting caught off guard could be fatal.

247
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,010
I know.

248
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,350
Is that it?!

249
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,060
It's getting away!

250
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,890
Leave it to me!

251
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,010
Hey, hold on now.

252
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,550
What do you think you're doing?

253
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,180
Wha...?

254
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,300
It's getting away!

255
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
Can't you tell just by looking at it?
That was a familiar, not a witch.

256
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,770
You weren't gonna get any Grief
Seeds off of that one.

257
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,770
But -

258
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,320
If we just leave it alone, it might
go off and kill someone!

259
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,070
I'm telling you.

260
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,120
You should wait for it to eat 4 or 5
people and become a real witch.

261
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,540
That way, you'll be sure to get
a Grief Seed when you kill it.

262
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,540
Seriously, what were you thinking killing
the goose before it laid its golden eggs?

263
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,330
What...?

264
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,880
What about the people it'll attack?

265
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,090
Are you just going to sit back
and let them get killed?

266
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,920
Listen, kid - you've got this whole
thing all wrong from the get-go.

267
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,090
Ever heard of the food chain?

268
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,680
They taught you about it in school, right?

269
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,970
Witches eat weak humans.

270
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,480
And in turn, we eat those witches.

271
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,940
It's the basic rule of this world.

272
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,190
The weak have to give way to the strong.

273
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
Oh no...

274
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,490
You...

275
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Don't tell me...

276
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,120
...you actually believe in all that "saving
people" and "justice" crap?

277
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,710
You didn't actually make the contract
over that load of bull, did you?

278
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,380
And what if I did?

279
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,340
Come on. Give it up already.

280
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,530
The way you're butting into this
and acting like it's a game...

281
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,570
It kinda ticks me off.

282
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,580
Sayaka!

283
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Hmph! What an amateur...

284
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,580
Go cool your head for a while.

285
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,340
Strange...

286
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,840
That should've put you out of commission
for at least 3 months.

287
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,510
Is Sayaka really okay?

288
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,480
It's because she made her contract
wishing for someone to be healed.

289
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,560
She heals twice as fast as a regular
human being does now.

290
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,070
Who... would lose to you?

291
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,110
It's because of magical girls
like you that Mami...

292
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,610
That pisses me off.

293
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,570
That REALLY pisses me off.

294
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,160
But seriously - you sure
have a mouth on you.

295
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
That's not how you're supposed
to speak to your elders.

296
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,330
Shut up!

297
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,300
This ain't the time to be jumping
around, dummy!

298
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,970
Sayaka...!

299
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,890
Madoka, it's dangerous for
you to get any closer!

300
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,400
You don't get it when I try to explain.

301
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,190
You don't get it when I beat it into you.

302
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,650
Guess there's no choice but
to kill an idiot like you!

303
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,450
I won't lose...

304
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,920
I won't lose to you!

305
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,760
Why...?

306
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,690
Why is this happening? She's not a witch.

307
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,600
Why are the two of them fighting
when they should be allies?

308
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,440
It can't be helped.

309
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,480
Neither of them is willing to back
down from the other now.

310
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,780
Please, Kyubey... Make them stop!

311
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,070
This can't be right!

312
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,990
I don't have the ability to stop them.

313
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,830
But...

314
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,710
If you're determined to stop them, even
if it means using force, there IS a way...

315
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,340
Only another magical girl could
get between them now.

316
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,130
But you have the qualifications
to become one, after all.

317
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,840
If you truly wish it, that is.

318
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,800
That's right...

319
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,220
I can make the contract...

320
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,020
It's over!

321
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,150
I...

322
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,900
There's no need for that.

323
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,640
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

324
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

325
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,270
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

326
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,320
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

327
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,990
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

328
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,780
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

329
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,410
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

330
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,370
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

331
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,380
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

332
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,050
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

333
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,890
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

334
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,730
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

335
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,560
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

336
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,400
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

337
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,280
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

338
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,120
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

339
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:45,790
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

340
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,770
Sayaka, you became a magical girl in
