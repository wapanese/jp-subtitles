1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,170
For as much happiness as
you wish on one person,

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,550
you cannot help cursing someone else.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,430
That's how it works for us magical girls.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,890
I was so stupid... so stupid.

5
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,740
Sayaka!

6
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,670
What is this?!

7
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,630
What the heck are you?!

8
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,170
What have you done to Sayaka?

9
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,430
Get back.

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,390
Take my hand.

11
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,310
What are you--

12
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,440
Just do it!

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,200
That's...

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,660
If you let go of my hand, time
will stop for you as well.

15
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,990
Be careful.

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,500
What the heck is going on here?!

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,660
Where did that witch come from?

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,290
That is what used to be Sayaka Miki.

19
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,330
You saw it happen yourself, didn't you?

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,340
Are we just gonna run away?

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,760
If you want to fight it, drop
that needless baggage...

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,800
...and we'll turn around to kill it right now.

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,220
Can you do that?

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,550
Like hell!

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,050
You're only dragging us down like this.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,850
We need to withdraw for now.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,660
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,950
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,870
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

30
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,670
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,760
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,900
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,730
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

34
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,820
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,950
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

36
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,870
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

37
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,170
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,510
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,930
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

40
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,220
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,640
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,770
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

43
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:18,490
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,820
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

45
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,410
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

46
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,410
EPISODE 09: I'D NEVER ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,390
Sayaka?

48
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,650
Sayaka! What happened?

49
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,860
Where's her Soul Gem?

50
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,610
What happened to Sayaka?

51
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,240
Her Soul Gem transformed
into a Grief Seed...

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,820
...and was obliterated after
it hatched a new witch.

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,620
You're... joking, right?

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,670
It's the truth.

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,880
That is the final secret of the Soul Gems.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,090
When these gems grow tainted
and turn completely black,

57
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,300
they change into Grief Seeds...

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,140
...and we are reborn as witches.

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,730
That is the inescapable fate of
all who become magical girls.

60
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,940
That's not true.

61
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,060
It can't be true.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,900
Right?

63
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,030
But... how can that be?

64
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Sayaka said she wanted to protect
people from witches.

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,620
She wanted to fight for justice.

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,040
That's why she became a magical girl.

67
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,880
So why...?

68
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,420
It could only last until she had suffered...

69
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,840
an amount equal to the good
she had wished for.

70
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,430
From here on, for every person she
has saved, she will curse another.

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,700
You... What is your problem?

72
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,200
Are we supposed to be impressed
that you know so much?

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,490
How can you stand there and talk
like you're so smart right now?!

74
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,040
She was Sayaka's...

75
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,960
...Sayaka's best friend...!

76
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,790
You understand now, don't you?

77
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,630
What this thing you so wanted to become...

78
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,760
...is truly like.

79
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,300
This corpse you've brought along--try
not to be seen with it.

80
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,060
Take care how you dispose of it,
or you'll run into trouble later.

81
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,190
How do you even call yourself human?!

82
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,520
I don't, of course.

83
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,900
And neither should you.

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,420
Can I come in? I'd like to talk with you.

85
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,210
So you're alive after all.

86
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,800
Was what Homura said true?

87
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,350
True enough that I can't protest it.

88
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,850
So you've been turning us into magical
girls just so we'll become witches?

89
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,060
Please don't misunderstand.

90
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,400
We don't do this out of ill will
toward the human race.

91
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,200
Everything we've done is for the sake
of prolonging the life of the universe.

92
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,410
Madoka, do you know what
the word "entropy" means?

93
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,200
To give a simple example...

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,330
the amount of heat energy
a bonfire gives off...

95
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,170
is not equal to the energy it took
to grow the wood it's made of.

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,460
In short, when energy changes
form, some of it gets lost.

97
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,800
As a result, the amount of usable energy
in the universe is decreasing.

98
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,930
So we began searching...

99
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,720
for a form of energy that wasn't bound
by the laws of thermodynamics.

100
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,770
And what we found...

101
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,980
...was the power of the magical girls.

102
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,150
What... are you?

103
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,230
Our civilization created technology...

104
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,070
that could convert the emotions of
a sentient lifeform into raw energy.

105
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,870
Unfortunately...

106
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,330
Our species do not possess the
capacity to experience emotion.

107
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,120
So we studied various species
throughout the universe...

108
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,960
until, finally, we found you humans.

109
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,720
With the size of your population
and the rate of reproduction...

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,470
the amount of emotional energy
produced by a single human...

111
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,850
is greater than the amount used
between its birth and growth.

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,230
Human souls truly are the energy source
that could counter entropy!

113
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,070
And the most effective of all are girls in
the second stage of development...

114
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,070
...who experience the greatest fluctuations
between hope and despair.

115
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,200
In the moment when your Soul Gems
flare out and turn into Grief Seeds,

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,410
enormous energy is created.

117
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,080
It is the job of us Incubators
to collect that energy.

118
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,420
Are we just disposable energy
supplies for you, then?

119
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,760
Are you saying we should die for you?

120
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,300
Do you know how many
civilizations fill this universe,

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,890
and how much energy they
use in a single moment?

122
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,890
And someday,

123
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,560
even you humans will be able to leave
your planet and come join all of us.

124
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,350
When that day comes,

125
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,520
you wouldn’t want to find the universe
empty and desolate, would you?

126
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,860
If you look at it in the long run,

127
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,200
this should be a good deal
for your benefit as well.

128
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,620
Don't be ridiculous...

129
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,370
How can you say it was okay for Mami
to die and Sayaka to suffer like that...

130
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,620
...just because of some
crazy reason like that?

131
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,330
That isn't right. It's too cruel!

132
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,300
But we always ask and receive your
consent before making the contract.

133
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,340
Doesn't that alone show our good will?

134
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
But you do it by tricking all of us!

135
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,930
We aren't able to comprehend
what you mean by "tricking."

136
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,650
Why is it that when humans regret a
decision based on a misunderstanding...

137
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,360
...they feel resentment toward
the other party?

138
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,570
I can't follow what you're saying.

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,900
I don't understand you at all.

140
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,660
It's we who've had such a hard time...

141
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,200
understanding humans and
your values system.

142
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,080
With a current population of 6.9 billion...

143
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,170
that is increasing by a rate of
10 per every 4 seconds...

144
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,710
...why should you care so much about
the loss of a tiny handful?

145
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,090
If that's how you think, then
you really are our enemy.

146
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,720
Despite that, I did come here to
try to explain ourselves to you.

147
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,180
I was hoping you'd understand...

148
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,520
...what incredible good your sacrifices
have done for this universe.

149
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,230
But I guess not.

150
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,940
Of course not.

151
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,690
Madoka,

152
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,820
I still believe that one day,

153
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,940
you will become the greatest
of all magical girls,

154
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,610
and then the wickedest of all witches.

155
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,570
When that happens, we will surely obtain
an incomparable amount of energy.

156
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,410
So if you ever feel like dying for the sake
of the universe, please call me anytime.

157
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,460
I'll be waiting for you!

158
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,770
What do you hope to achieve,
expending so much energy...

159
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,150
to keep that body fresh?

160
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,030
Is there a way to get her Soul Gem back?

161
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,280
None, as far as I know anyway.

162
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,750
So there's stuff even you don't know, huh?

163
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,460
The existence of magical
girls defies logic as it is.

164
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,500
So I wouldn’t be surprised no matter
what kinds of impossible feats...

165
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,880
you manage to accomplish.

166
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,630
So it's possible?

167
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,840
There's no precedent for it.

168
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,350
That's why I don't know
how it might be done.

169
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,600
Unfortunately, I can't offer
any guidance this time.

170
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,350
Like I'd want it.

171
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,610
Who would listen to your advice now?

172
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,950
Madoka, you're looking a
bit unwell this morning.

173
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,910
Are you quite all right?

174
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,040
Yeah... I just didn't get enough sleep.

175
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,050
Speaking of which, it looks as if Sayaka
is staying home again today.

176
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,220
Perhaps we should go to see her later.

177
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,640
Though she may not welcome me...

178
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,680
Things are a bit awkward
between us right now...

179
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,480
Hitomi... There's something--

180
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,770
After yesterday...

181
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,940
Is now really the time to go to school?

182
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,740
Madoka?

183
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,530
We need to talk.
Will you come with me?

184
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm sorry, Hitomi...

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,000
I think I'm going to stay home today too.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,670
Huh?

187
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,090
But-- Madoka, wait!

188
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,470
Um... You wanted to talk?

189
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,810
Don't you want to save Sayaka Miki?

190
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,100
Is there a way to save her?

191
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,520
If there weren't, were you just
going to leave her like that?

192
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,820
Sorry, that came out wrong.

193
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Maybe you'll think I'm an idiot, but...

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,530
Until we know for sure whether
she can be saved or not...

195
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,580
...I don't want to give up.

196
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,670
Even if she's a witch now,

197
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,340
she may at least remember
the voices of her friends.

198
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,180
So if you call out to her, maybe she'll get
back her memories of being human.

199
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,180
And probably, the only who could
do that... would be you.

200
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,350
Do you really think it'll work?

201
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,810
How am I supposed to know?

202
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,520
It's because I don't know
that I want to try it.

203
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,400
I mean,

204
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,360
maybe when I slice that witch in half,

205
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,330
instead of a Grief Seed, Sayaka's
Soul Gem will pop out.

206
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,330
Wouldn't that be something?

207
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,580
It'd be like one of those stories where
love and courage triumph over all.

208
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,380
Actually...

209
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,920
I probably became a magical
girl to begin with...

210
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,340
because I used to love stories like that.

211
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,930
I'd totally forgotten that.

212
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,470
It was Sayaka who reminded me again.

213
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,930
If you don't wanna come, I won't force you.

214
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,850
It's gonna be pretty dangerous, after all.

215
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,650
And I can't guarantee that
I'll be able to protect you.

216
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,950
I'll help.

217
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,280
I want to help.

218
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,910
I'm Madoka Kaname.

219
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,460
Aw, man...

220
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,380
You're so gonna cramp my style.

221
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,670
Huh?

222
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,760
Kyoko Sakura. Pleased to meet ya.

223
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,840
UNMAI BO
(TASTY BAR)

224
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,980
Excuse me.

225
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,690
I'm not feeling well. May I
go to the Nurse's Office?

226
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,780
Hm? Who's the Nurse's Aide in this class?

227
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,070
Kaname is, but she's not here today.

228
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,660
In that case, let's have the
Class President escort--

229
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,750
I wonder if Homura would help us...

230
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,130
Nah. She's not that kind of person.

231
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,420
Aren't you two friends?

232
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,340
Not really.

233
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,760
I guess you could say we've
got goals in common.

234
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,810
We kinda teamed up to beat enemies
we couldn't take on alone.

235
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,270
A few days from now, "Walpurgisnacht"
is coming to this town.

236
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,280
Walpurgis...?

237
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,030
It's this insanely huge and powerful witch.

238
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,950
Probably neither of us
could beat it alone.

239
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,700
That's why we decided to team up.

240
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,830
That's basically how it is.

241
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,670
This is it.

242
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,350
Are you sure it's really Sayaka?

243
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,270
And not some other witch?

244
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,860
The magic patterns are
the same as yesterday.

245
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,780
No doubt about it, it's her, all right.

246
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,340
Okay, let me ask you again.

247
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,090
You sure you're ready for this?

248
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,220
I've gotten kind of used to this, actually.

249
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,340
Although... all I ever do is
trail along behind others.

250
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,350
I've never been able to help at all...

251
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,100
But please, take me along.

252
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,440
You really are a strange one, aren't you?

253
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,530
Hey, Kyoko?

254
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,320
Hm?

255
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,620
Since I've always made others do the
fighting and never tried to do it myself...

256
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,830
I guess I'm a coward, huh?

257
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,670
Why would you ever become
a magical girl?

258
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,750
"Why"...?

259
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,340
Don't underestimate it--this isn't
a job just anyone can do.

260
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,050
But...

261
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,680
If you get to eat good food every day and
live a happy life with your family...

262
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,980
...why would you give it all up to become
a magical girl on some stupid whim?

263
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,020
I'd never allow that to happen.

264
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,320
I'd pound your face in first.

265
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,370
I mean, putting your life in danger...

266
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,950
Only people who've got no other
choice should do that.

267
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,370
Anyone else who sticks their nose
in it is just playing around.

268
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,460
It's beyond moronic.

269
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,460
I wonder...

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
But maybe a time will come...

271
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,260
...when you'll have no choice
but to risk your life and fight.

272
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,220
You should wait until then to think about it.

273
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,720
Okay.

274
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,480
So, Kyoko why did you--

275
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,150
She knows we're here!
She's coming!

276
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,210
Ready?

277
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,510
Do it just like we planned.

278
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,710
Right.

279
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,430
Sayaka, it's me. It's Madoka.

280
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,390
Can you hear me?
Do you recognize my voice?

281
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,400
Don't be scared.

282
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,060
Keep calling to her!

283
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,940
Sayaka, stop!

284
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,070
Please, remember!

285
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,990
I know you never wanted
to hurt anyone, Sayaka!

286
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,080
You always wanted to fight
for justice, didn't you?

287
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,790
Please, Sayaka, go back to your old self!

288
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,800
There's a limit to how stubborn
you should be...

289
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,880
...Sayaka!

290
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,600
Kyoko!

291
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,810
I'm fine.

292
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm not even breaking a sweat yet.

293
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,270
You just keep calling out... to Sayaka.

294
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,530
Stop!

295
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,400
Please, just stop!

296
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,200
Sayaka!

297
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,990
Please recognize us!

298
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,210
Oh, I get it...
This is payback, isn't it?

299
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,000
How funny...

300
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,090
...we started off trying to kill
each other too, didn't we?

301
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,380
I thought you'd be a wuss.

302
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,260
But no matter how much I beat you
up, you kept standing back up.

303
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,300
You are mad, aren't you?

304
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,350
Is it just too hard to let go right now?

305
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,890
I get it.

306
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,770
But once you've had enough,
come back, okay?

307
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,830
Sayaka... P-please...

308
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,710
Sayaka!

309
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,920
Didn't you tell me you believed?

310
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,430
That you could use this power
to make people happy?

311
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,190
Please, God...

312
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,530
Look at the life I've lived.

313
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,490
Please, let me have a happy
dream, for once in my life.

314
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,580
Kyoko!

315
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,590
Hey...

316
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,460
You--

317
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,130
Take care of her for me...

318
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,510
I was an idiot for dragging her into this.

319
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,470
You said you wouldn't fight when weighed
down with a burden, right?

320
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,100
That's fine. And you're right.

321
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,730
You've gotta focus...

322
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,150
on the one thing that means most
to you, and protect it to the end.

323
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,700
It's funny... All this time...

324
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,740
...that's what I thought I was doing.

325
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,790
Go.

326
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,750
I'll take care of her.

327
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,550
Don't worry, Sayaka.

328
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,220
I know you don't want to be alone.

329
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,470
It's okay. I'll be here with you.

330
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,220
...Sayaka.

331
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,080
Kyoko...

332
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,250
HOMURA

333
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,390
Was there really any chance for Kyoko
Sakura to save Sayaka Miki?

334
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,220
Of course not. She should have
known that was impossible.

335
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,560
Then why didn't you stop her?

336
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,110
Naturally, I would have stopped her
if her death had been needless.

337
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,820
But getting her out of the picture
served a very important purpose.

338
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,530
Because now, there is no one left
but you to battle Walpurgisnacht.

339
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,080
And of course, you stand no chance
of beating her alone.

340
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,620
In order to protect this city,

341
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,130
there is no choice but for Madoka
to become a magical girl.

342
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,960
I won't let that happen. I swear it!

343
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,800
HOMURA

344
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,240
Sabitsuita kokoro
With rusted heart in this soundless world,

345
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,540
Oto mo nai sekai nani wo miteruno?
What is it you are looking at?

346
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,500
Matane wo ieru
I look for a face

347
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,960
Kao wo sagasuyo
I can say "see you again" to,

348
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,760
Sore wo kurikaesu dake
Over and over again

349
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,050
Kizukeba
I suddenly realized

350
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,630
Sokoni wa
someone was standing there,

351
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,930
Hitori kiri de naku ushiro sugata
Crying all alone with her back to me

352
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,520
Tsurai youna, sabishii youna, basho
Such a painful place, such a lonely place

353
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,310
Te wo tsunaide itainda
I want to keep holding your hand

354
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,440
Nando demo namae wo yobuyo
I call your name as many times as I must

355
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,030
Futashikana mirai demo
The future is uncertain,

356
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,200
Hanase nai mono
But my heart still aches

357
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,910
Omou dake kokoro ga itaiyo
When I think of the one I can't let go

358
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,790
Kokoni iruyo, kokoni iruyo
I am here. I am here.

359
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,460
Kaeru basho wa
And this is the place

360
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,840
Koko dayo?
you can come home to, you know?

361
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,010
Itsudatte kawaranai
I'll preserve these feelings

362
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,930
Omoi wo nokosuno
That will never change

363
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,020
No one believes me about the future.

364
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,400
No one can accept the truth about the future.

365
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,080
EPISODE 10: I WON'T RELY ON ANYONE ANYMORE

366
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,910
I won't rely on anyone anymore.
