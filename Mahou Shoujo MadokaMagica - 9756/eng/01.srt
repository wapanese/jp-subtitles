1
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,080
That's horrible...!

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,500
There's no helping it.

3
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,460
This was too much for her to handle alone.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,170
But she came here knowing that.

5
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,770
But... that's too much!
This can't be right!

6
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,690
If she gives up, it's over.

7
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,530
But you have the power
to change fate itself...

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,080
All this inevitable destruction
and tragedy...

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,040
You can change it, if you want.

10
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,550
The power to do so lies within you.

11
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,430
Can I really?

12
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,060
Can I really do something to help?

13
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,020
Could I really change this ending?

14
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,480
Of course you could.

15
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,690
So make a contract with me...

16
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,650
...and become a magical girl!

17
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,210
It was all just a dream?

18
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,630
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

19
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,930
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

20
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,850
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

21
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,640
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

22
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,740
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

23
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,870
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

24
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

25
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,800
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,920
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

27
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,850
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

28
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,140
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

29
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,480
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

30
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,900
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

31
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,200
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

32
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,620
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

33
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,750
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

34
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,460
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

35
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,800
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

36
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,390
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

37
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,430
EPISODE 1: I FIRST MET HER IN A DREAM... OR SOMETHING

38
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,770
Good morning, Dad!

39
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,440
Good morning, Madoka.

40
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,650
Is Mom up?

41
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,270
Tatsuya's waking her up right now.

42
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,570
Go help him, will you?

43
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,110
Okay!

44
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,070
Mommy! Mommy!

45
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,950
Morning! Morning!

46
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,160
Wake up! Mommy! Mommy!

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,090
RISE AND SHINE!

48
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,260
Huh?

49
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,340
Mommy woke up!

50
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,220
So what's been going on lately?

51
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,770
Hitomi got another love letter.

52
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,020
That's the second one this month.

53
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,570
Boys who don't even have the guts to
confess their love in person are no good.

54
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,450
And how's Kazuko doing?

55
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,030
It seems like Ms. Saotome's new
relationship is going well.

56
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,450
She gushes about him
all during homeroom.

57
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,040
It'll be their 3-month anniversary this
week, so I guess that's a new record.

58
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,290
Hmm, I guess we'll see.

59
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,670
They're reaching a crucial
juncture right now.

60
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,920
They are?

61
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,640
If it's not the real thing,

62
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,550
it's around this point in the relationship
that things start falling apart.

63
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,640
Well, if they make it past 3 months, they're
probably good a year at least.

64
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,650
Perfect!

65
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,320
Which ribbon should I wear?

66
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,030
Huh? But isn't this too flashy?

67
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,160
That's at LEAST as flashy as you should be!

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,870
A woman's appearance is the one thing
she can't afford to get looked down at.

69
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,380
Excellent!

70
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,760
That should make all your secret
admirers melt in adoration.

71
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,050
I don't have any secret admirers!

72
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,300
But you should go about as though you do.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,770
That's the secret behind every
pretty girl's success!

74
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,150
Uh-oh!

75
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,070
Safe!

76
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,400
There, eat it all up now, okay?

77
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,700
Okay!

78
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,530
More coffee, honey?

79
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,450
Hmm, better not.

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,010
All right! I'm off then.

81
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,510
Have a nice day!

82
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,350
Now then, you'd better hurry too, Madoka.

83
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,270
Huh?! Oh, right!

84
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm heading out!

85
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,940
Have a nice day, sweetie!

86
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,150
Have nice daaaay!

87
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,370
Good morning!

88
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,670
Good morning.

89
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,460
Madoka, you're late!

90
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,130
Oh! Cute ribbons!

91
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,710
You think so? They're not too flashy?

92
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,220
I think they look lovely.

93
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,020
So my mom said...

94
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,610
A boy who confesses his love with a letter
instead of in person is no good.

95
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,610
Your mom is just too cool, Madoka!

96
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,610
I mean, she's gorgeous and a successful
businesswoman besides!

97
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,620
If only I could make up my mind
to reject a boy so easily.

98
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,700
What an enviable problem to have!

99
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,410
It really is! I wish I could get a
love letter from someone too.

100
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,290
Just once!

101
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,630
Oh-ho!

102
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,670
So you want to become a beautiful,
popular girl like Hitomi, Madoka?

103
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,840
And you've decided to start changing your
image with these hair ribbons, huh?

104
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,760
You've got it wrong! My mom made me--

105
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,600
I see! You even got your mom to tell
you the secret to becoming popular!

106
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,640
How shameless!

107
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
Let me show you what happens
to bad girls like you!

108
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,440
No! Hey! Stop it! Stop!

109
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,190
My, such a cute girl!

110
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,690
But I won't allow you to go off and
become popular with the boys.

111
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,150
You must be my bride, Madoka!!

112
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,360
Noooo!

113
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,830
Ahem!

114
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,960
Now, I have something very important
to discuss with you today, class.

115
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,210
I want you all to listen very closely!

116
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,250
When frying an egg, should it be fried
sunny side-up or over hard?!

117
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,460
Mr. Nakazawa--what do you think?!

118
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,300
Huh?! U-um, well--

119
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,590
Th-they can be fried either way, can't they?

120
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,260
Precisely!

121
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,970
They can be fried either way!

122
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,720
And it should go without saying...

123
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,390
...that judging a woman's attractiveness...

124
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,980
...by the way she fries her eggs
is the gravest of mistakes!

125
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,770
Now, girls--

126
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,520
I want you to remember...

127
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,070
...that you must never date men who insist
they can't eat fried eggs done over hard.

128
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,570
Guess it didn’t work out.

129
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,740
Yeah, guess it didn't.

130
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,440
And boys--

131
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,950
You'd better not grow up so petty as to
fuss over how your eggs are done, okay?

132
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,620
Well, then!

133
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,040
Now that that's out of the way, let's
welcome our new transfer student!

134
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,330
Hey, shouldn't that have come first?

135
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,250
Come on in, Miss Akemi!

136
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,220
Wow, she's gorgeous!

137
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,340
Huh?

138
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,470
No way... It couldn't be...

139
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,640
Now, then! Why don't you tell your
classmates about yourself?

140
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,150
My name is Homura Akemi.
Pleased to meet you.

141
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,910
HOMURA AKEMI

142
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,260
Uh... Miss Akemi?

143
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,680
So, Miss Akemi...

144
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
What school did you come from?

145
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,270
A Catholic school in Tokyo.

146
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,230
Did you do any club activities
at your old school?

147
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,020
How about sports? Or cultural activities?

148
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,190
I didn't participate in activities.

149
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,280
Your hair is so beautiful!

150
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,240
What kind of shampoo do you use?

151
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,320
She has a mysterious air
to her, doesn't she?

152
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,990
Hey, Madoka, do you know that girl?

153
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,710
Maybe it was just me, but it seemed
like she was glaring at you earlier.

154
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,250
Well... Um...

155
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,830
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,250
I think today's been a
little stressful for me.

157
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,750
I'm not feeling very well.

158
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,920
Would you allow me to excuse
myself to the Nurse's Office?

159
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,510
Oh! Then let me show you the way there.

160
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,350
I'll come too!

161
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,100
No, you needn't trouble yourselves.

162
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,470
I'll ask the Nurse's Aide to take me.

163
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,440
Miss Madoka Kaname.

164
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,530
You are the Nurse's Aide for
this class, are you not?

165
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,700
Huh? Um, well...

166
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
May I ask you to accompany me?

167
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,450
To the Nurse's Office, that is.

168
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,840
U-um, I, uh...

169
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,840
How did you know I was the Nurse's Aide?

170
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,640
Ms. Saotome told me.

171
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,220
Oh, I see.

172
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,350
Oh, um, the Nurse's Office is...

173
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,640
This way, isn't it?

174
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes, that's right.

175
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,110
Um, but... um...

176
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,610
It seems like you already
know how to get there...

177
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,660
Um... Miss Akemi?

178
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,580
You can call me Homura.

179
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,630
Homura...?

180
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,500
What is it?

181
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,130
Oh, um...

182
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,670
That's kind of an unusual name, isn't it?

183
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,840
O-oh!

184
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,890
But not in a bad way! I-I was just
thinking it sounded kind of cool--

185
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,730
Madoka Kaname.

186
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,150
Do you treasure the life you currently live?

187
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,110
Do you consider your family
and friends precious?

188
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,450
W-well... I... Yes, I do.

189
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,080
Both my family and my friends--

190
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,290
I love all of them, and consider
them very precious!

191
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you really?

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,460
Yes, really! I couldn't lie about that.

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,760
I see.

194
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,340
If that's really the case,

195
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,640
then you wouldn't try to change the person
you currently are, would you?

196
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,940
Because if you do, you will end
up losing all of those things.

197
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,140
...Huh?

198
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,730
You should stay as you
are, Madoka Kaname.

199
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,650
Stay as you are, and as
you always shall be.

200
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,690
D-did she just break the
prefecture-wide record...?

201
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,400
You were so amazing!

202
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,010
Huh?! She said WHAT?!

203
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,890
It doesn't make any sense, does it?

204
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,430
Just when I was thinking she was someone
gifted with both brains and beauty...

205
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,140
...it turns out she's a crazy
New Age weirdo!

206
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,770
Exactly how far was she going to keep
up that weirdo character act?

207
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,070
Is that what gets her MOE?! How
the heck is that even exciting?!

208
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,570
Madoka, are you sure you've never
met Miss Akemi before?

209
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,360
Hmm... Well, the sensible
answer is, "yes," but...

210
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,280
What's that supposed to mean?

211
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,580
That you have met her before
in some "insensible" way?

212
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,410
Well...

213
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,830
Last night... I first met her... in a dream...

214
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,120
Or something.

215
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,710
Awesome! You’re acting like you’re
a anime character, too!

216
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,840
That's mean! This is really bugging me!

217
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,340
Well, it's all obvious now!

218
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,220
You must have known each
other in a previous life,

219
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,720
and were brought by fate across time
and space to meet once again!

220
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,680
You said you met in a dream.
What kind of dream was it?

221
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,560
It was... To be honest, I can't
really remember anymore.

222
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,190
I do know that it was a really
strange dream, though...

223
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,200
Then maybe you actually have met
Miss Akemi somewhere before.

224
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,200
Huh?!

225
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Though you may not
consciously remember,

226
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
your subconscious could
have taken note of her...

227
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,460
...and later brought her
image out in a dream.

228
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,830
Isn't that a little far-fetched? I mean,
that's some coincidence!

229
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,380
I suppose.

230
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,010
Oh! It's already this late?

231
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,670
I'm sorry, I'd better go.

232
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,800
Piano lessons, right? Or is it Japanese
classical dance today?

233
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Tea Ceremony lessons.

234
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,970
Even though Entrance Exams
are right around the corner.

235
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,390
I wonder how long Mother intends
to make me continue with them.

236
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,270
Whew! Makes me glad I wasn't born rich.

237
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,690
Should we get going too?

238
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,530
Madoka, do you mind if we stopped at
the music store on the way home?

239
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,780
That's fine. Buying another CD for Kamijo?

240
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,320
Sort of.

241
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,990
Well, see you later.

242
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,160
- Later!
- Bye-bye!

243
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,320
Help me...

244
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,330
Help me... Madoka...

245
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,750
Huh? What?!

246
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,790
Please... save me...

247
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,510
Who's there? Who is it?

248
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,130
THIS FLOOR IS CLOSED
DUE TO REMODELING

249
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,970
Save me...

250
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,070
Where are you?

251
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,360
Who are you?

252
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,700
Save me...

253
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,260
Is that you?

254
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,340
Save... me...

255
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,350
Homura...?

256
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,890
Get away from that thing.

257
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,560
B-but... he's hurt!

258
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,030
No! Please, don't do something cruel!

259
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,570
This has nothing to do with you.

260
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,950
But he was calling me!

261
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,330
I could hear him begging me to save him!

262
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,160
...I see.

263
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,430
Madoka! This way!

264
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Sayaka!

265
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,830
Now, of all times...!

266
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,000
Wh-what is with that girl?!

267
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,170
Now she's attacking people in cosplay?!

268
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,590
And what is that thing?

269
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,590
It's not a stuffed animal, is it? It's alive?

270
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,130
I don't know.

271
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,260
I don't know what any of this
is. But we have to save him!

272
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,810
Huh?! Where'd the exit go?
What is this place?!

273
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,100
There's something wrong with this place.

274
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,360
The path keeps changing!

275
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,280
What is going on here?!

276
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,410
There's something over there!

277
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,850
This has got to be a joke, right?

278
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,180
I mean, I must be dreaming, right?

279
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,190
Right?! Madoka?

280
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,080
H-huh?!

281
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
What is...?

282
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,950
That was close!

283
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,540
But you're safe now.

284
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,420
Oh! You rescued Kyubey
for me, didn't you?

285
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,140
Thank you. He's a dear friend of mine.

286
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,760
I-I was called to him.

287
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,640
I heard his voice inside my head.

288
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,770
Ahh, I see.

289
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,020
Those uniforms...

290
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,690
You must be students at Mitakihara
Middle School too.

291
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,690
Are you second-years?

292
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,150
Who are you?

293
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,610
That's right, I haven't introduced
myself yet.

294
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,990
But before all that...

295
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,300
...mind if I wrap up a bit of work?

296
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,580
A-amazing...!

297
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,340
W-we're back...!

298
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,100
The witch escaped.

299
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,730
If you want to finish it off, you'd
better go after it right now.

300
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,650
I'll let you take it this time.

301
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,060
I have business here.

302
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,480
You don't read between the
lines very well, do you?

303
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm telling you I'll overlook
what you did this time.

304
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,540
Don't you think it would be better for both
of us not to court needless trouble?

305
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,820
Thank you, Mami!

306
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,150
You're a lifesaver.

307
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,190
If you want to thank anyone,
it should be these two.

308
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,280
I was just passing by.

309
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,610
Thank you very much.

310
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,200
My name is Kyubey.

311
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,040
Were you the one who was calling me?

312
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,290
Yes, I was, Madoka Kaname.

313
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,040
And you, Sayaka Miki.

314
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,000
How do you know our names?

315
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,590
I came here because I have
a request for you two.

316
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,800
A... a request?

317
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,970
I want you to make contracts with
me and become magical girls!

318
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,270
“Soreja matane” tte te wo futte
I say “See you later” and wave my hand

319
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,900
Murini waratte samishiku natte...
I force myself to smile but I feel sad

320
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:20,160
Kousaten, shingou, tookuno kurakushon
Crossroads, traffic signals, horns from far away...

321
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:27,170
Shiranai darekano waraiau koe
And laughter of people I don't know

322
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:34,380
Kyou wa hitoride aruku kayoi nareta machi
When walking alone in the town where I’ve walked many times

323
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:44,940
Demo itsumo yori mo nanndaka jibun ga chotto chiisaku omoeruyo
But I feel that I am smaller than usual

324
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,980
“Soreja matane” tte te wo futte
I say “See you later” and wave my hand

325
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,240
Egao tsukutte samishiku natte...
I fake a smile and I feel sad

326
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,700
Honto wa mada hanashi tarinai kedo
To be honest, I wanted to talk with you more

327
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,580
“Soreja matane” tte kotoba de
I would say “See you later”

328
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,960
Mata aerutte uso wo tsuite
I lied when I told you I'd see you again

329
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,340
Itsumo dourino egao de iuyo
I will tell you that with the usual smile on my face

330
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,720
“Mata ashita”
“See you tomorrow”

331
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,980
I will grant you one wish--any
wish you desire!

332
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,070
Huh? Really?!

333
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,230
What kind of wish?

334
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,690
Anything you want.

335
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,030
I can grant you even the most
impossible of miracles!

336
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,200
EPISODE 2: THAT WOULD BE TRULY WONDERFUL

337
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,950
That would be truly wonderful.
