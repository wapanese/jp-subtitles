1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,920
Time-traveler, Homura Akemi...

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,880
By turning back time and
changing past events,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,210
you have traversed numerous
different timelines...

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,760
...and relived this past month over and
over, seeking the outcome you desire.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,930
Your existence has answered
at least one great mystery:

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,770
Why is Madoka Kaname's potential as
a magical girl so abnormally vast?

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,690
Now, at last, I have a theory
that explains it.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,860
You see, a magical girl's potential...

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,280
is based on the weight of the
karmic destiny she bears.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,490
I could've understood if she had been
the queen or savior of a country.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,790
But Madoka was only living an ordinary
life, so I couldn't understand why...

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,460
...so many threads of fate should all
be gathered so tightly around her.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,920
But now I think... Say, Homura...

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,050
Couldn't it be...

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,420
that Madoka has been made into
such a powerful magical girl...

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,220
because you kept turning back time?

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,930
I thought so. You were the cause of it.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,360
Or to be more precise, a side effect
of your magic was the cause of it.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,520
What do you mean?

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,320
All this time reversal you did was
all for one purpose, wasn't it?

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,900
To save Madoka Kaname?

22
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,370
By turning back time over and over
for the same purpose and reason...

23
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,250
...you inadvertently caused multiple
timelines to converge together...

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,960
...and centered them all on the
existence of Madoka Kaname.

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,210
If Madoka's threads of fate from each
of those separate timelines...

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,010
...all ended up linking to the Madoka
in this current timeline...

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,600
...it would explain why her magical
potential appears so impossibly huge.

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,890
All that karmic destiny you set spinning
in all those different timelines...

29
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,520
...eventually attached to Madoka Kaname.

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,520
After all, she was the main
culprit of every event.

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,490
Excellent work, Homura.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,860
You've made Madoka into the most
powerful witch we've ever seen.

33
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,620
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,910
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,830
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,630
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,730
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

38
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,860
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,700
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,780
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,910
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

42
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,830
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

43
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,130
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,470
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

45
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,890
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

46
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,190
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,610
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,730
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

49
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,450
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,780
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,370
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,370
EPISODE 11: THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT TO GUIDE ME

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,460
SAYAKA MIKI FUNERAL SERVICE

54
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,380
The body of Mitakihara Public Middle
School 2nd-year student,

55
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,090
Sayaka Miki, who had been missing
since the 12th of this month,

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,010
was discovered today in a room
at a downtown hotel.

57
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,060
As there were no signs of violence
present at the scene of the crime,

58
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,060
both murder and accidental death are
being considered by the police.

59
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,610
Up next, the weather forecast.

60
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,240
Tonight, expect moderate winds
from the northwest and rain.

61
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,070
Welcome home.

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,960
Hey, Madoka...

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
About Sayaka's case...

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,130
Are you sure you don't know
anything about it?

65
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,960
Yeah.

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,810
Both Sayaka and Kyoko are dead...

67
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,900
It wasn't exactly an unexpected outcome.

68
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
The signs had been there
for quite some time.

69
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,780
So you're saying you don't care, then?

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,320
Even though you're somewhat
to blame for their deaths?

71
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,540
Then, for example, do you feel responsible
for the deaths of livestock?

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,500
Do you ever think about the process by
which they become foodstuffs for you?

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,420
Stop it!

74
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,720
That's not a rational reaction.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,640
If you think these scenes are cruel,

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,140
then you're missing the
big picture completely.

77
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,350
Because they are slated to
become food for humans,

78
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,310
livestock are fed and provided
for all their lives...

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,860
...and given equal chance to reproduce
free from natural selection.

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,150
Cows, pigs and even chickens...

81
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,610
have an overwhelmingly higher rate of
survival in captivity than in the wild.

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,450
So isn't it actually...

83
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,990
a rather ideal, mutually beneficial
relationship for you both?

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,660
Are you saying it's the same
between you and us?

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,660
On the contrary,

86
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,580
our treatment of humankind...

87
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,420
is much more respectful than
your treatment of livestock.

88
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,590
Perhaps it isn't perfect,

89
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,920
but we do acknowledge your species as
sentient and try to deal fairly with you.

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,340
You can't believe that?

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
Then shall I show it to you?

92
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,890
Shall I show you the history spent together
by mankind and Incubators?

93
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,570
We have intervened in your civilization's
development since prehistoric times.

94
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,200
Countless girls throughout time have
made contracts with Incubators,

95
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,460
had their wishes granted...

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,420
...and then ultimately succumbed
to despair.

97
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,050
Beginning in hope and then
ending in a curse...

98
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,130
...that is the cycle that countless magical
girls have repeated to this day.

99
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,050
There are some who have wrought
revolutions that changed history...

100
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,810
...or elevated human society to
new stages of development.

101
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,560
Please, stop!!

102
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,980
They all trusted you.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,730
They all trusted you, and
you betrayed them?

104
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,490
It wasn't we who betrayed them,
but their own prayers that did.

105
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,490
All hopes are wishes for something other
than the current reality, after all.

106
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,290
And anything that doesn't match reality
is bound to create a distortion.

107
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,080
So why is it surprising that these
things always end in disaster?

108
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,670
If they considered such a natural
outcome to be a "betrayal,"

109
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,050
they were wrong to have
made wishes at all.

110
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,720
Not that I am calling them foolish.

111
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,050
After all, it was thanks to their sacrifices...

112
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,220
that human society has
developed as far as it has.

113
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,980
All the tears shed throughout history...

114
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,650
have laid the foundations
of the life you have now.

115
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,910
If you understand now,

116
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,870
why are you still holding the fates of
a few individuals to be so precious?

117
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,750
After all the time you spent
watching over those girls...

118
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,170
do you really feel nothing for them at all?

119
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,420
Did you never try to understand
how much they were suffering?

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,180
If we had the capacity to
comprehend such things,

121
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,390
we wouldn't have had to come to
your planet in the first place.

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,930
In our society,

123
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,850
the phenomenon known as "emotion"
is only considered a mental disease.

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,400
That's why, when we discovered
humankind, we were quite surprised.

125
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,480
We never imagined a world could exist...

126
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,400
in which every individual had
its own set of emotions...

127
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,490
...and still somehow managed
to coexist with others!

128
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,910
If you... had never come to Earth, then...

129
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,620
Most likely, you would all still
be living naked in caves.

130
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
You know what...

131
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,970
...it really does hurt, losing one
of my own students this way...

132
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,680
Yeah...

133
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,850
We still don't even know what
really happened to her...

134
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,640
Now, I'm hearing that one of the third-year
students is missing as well...

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,810
Everyone was in an uproar
at the last staff meeting.

136
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,060
No one knew anything, I'm guessing?

137
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,110
It seems that Sayaka was quarreling
with a friend over a boy.

138
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,030
She's taking all of this pretty hard too.

139
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
This kind of thing...

140
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,620
should've just passed with some
heartache and bittersweet memories.

141
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,120
But since it ended this way...

142
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,460
The police are going to rule
it accidental death...

143
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,290
exacerbated by mental stress after
running away from home.

144
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,630
They don't have any leads to go on.

145
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,970
How is Madoka taking it?

146
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,720
I don't know.

147
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,260
My gut tells me she knows
something about all this.

148
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,390
But she doesn't seem like
she's lying to me either.

149
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,650
This is the first time...

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,980
that I haven't been able to
tell what she's thinking.

151
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,400
Pathetic, isn't it? She's my own daughter...

152
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,400
It's rare to see you so at
a loss over what to do...

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,910
Lately, something has seemed
a little off about her.

154
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,870
I can tell something's weighing
on her mind,

155
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,460
but she hasn't come to talk
to me about it like usual.

156
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,750
I thought she would always know
she could rely on me...

157
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,550
It's hard with kids that age...

158
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,840
You turn around one day, and
suddenly, they're all grown up.

159
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,300
It must be a pretty big shock to a parent.

160
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,720
I guess you're right...

161
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,270
At that point, we've got no
choice but to trust them.

162
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,930
What Madoka probably
needs most right now...

163
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,310
is a little time to get a handle
on her feelings.

164
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,060
Just give her some time.

165
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,400
It's so hard not being able to do anything.

166
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,450
You never were good at just sitting
by and waiting, were you, Junko?

167
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,080
HOMURA AKEMI

168
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,790
Can I come in?

169
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,090
Is that...

170
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,720
...Walpurgisnacht?

171
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,930
Kyoko told me about it.

172
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,770
She said it was a witch so strong that
one person couldn't beat it alone,

173
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,230
so the two of you were teaming up.

174
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,310
So you've been preparing for
that all this time here?

175
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,980
Will the city be in danger?

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,740
Unlike the other witches you've seen,

177
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,830
this one is powerful enough that it doesn't
need to hide in a Labyrinth.

178
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,330
If it manifests even once,
thousands will die.

179
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,170
Since ordinary humans can't see it,

180
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,920
they'll think the destruction was caused by
an earthquake, tornado, or other disaster.

181
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,630
Then it absolutely has
to be defeated, right?

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,390
Now that Kyoko's... dead too...

183
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,270
you're the only magical
girl left who can fight it.

184
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,980
So maybe I--

185
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,100
I can do it on my own.

186
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,400
While Kyoko Sakura couldn't have defeat
Walpurgisnacht on her own, I can.

187
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,530
I actually never needed her help.

188
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,070
I just agreed so that she
wouldn't lose face.

189
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,370
...Honestly?

190
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,660
I don't know why, but...

191
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,880
...I really want to believe in you, Homura.

192
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,670
I don't want to think that you'd lie to me.

193
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,630
And yet, I just can't believe you're
really going to be all right.

194
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,930
I just can't believe what
you're saying is true.

195
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,680
How can I tell you what Iâ€™m really feeling?

196
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,730
Homura...?

197
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,230
After all... I'm...

198
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,070
I'm not...

199
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,570
even living in the same time
that you are, Madoka!

200
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,010
You see, I... I come from the future.

201
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,890
I've met you over and over,

202
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,150
and each and every time,
I've had to watch you die.

203
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,320
What do I have to do to save you?

204
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,820
What do I have to do to change your fate?

205
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,950
Searching just for that answer,
I've kept redoing this month.

206
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,700
What do--

207
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm sorry... I'm not making
any sense, right?

208
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,370
I must seem horribly creepy, right?

209
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,170
After all, to you...

210
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,470
I'm just some transfer student you've
barely known for a month.

211
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,180
But to me...

212
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,930
To me, you are...

213
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,900
The more times I redo all this, the further
in time we drift from one another.

214
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,730
Our feelings drift further apart, and my
words don't even reach you anymore.

215
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,240
The truth is, I think I've been
lost for a very long time now.

216
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,620
Homura...

217
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,410
I will save you.

218
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,160
That was the feeling that
I started all of this with.

219
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,000
And now, it is the only thing
I have left to guide me.

220
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,250
It's okay if you don't understand.

221
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,970
It's okay if my words don't reach you.

222
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,470
But, please...

223
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,970
Please... just let me protect you.

224
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,640
HOMURA AKEMI

225
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,950
These thunderclouds are spreading and
rotating at unbelievable speeds.

226
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,990
There's no doubt about it,
a supercell is forming!

227
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,500
Issue an evacuation order immediately!

228
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,500
Starting at 7AM this morning...

229
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,460
...an evacuation order is being issued
due to extreme weather conditions.

230
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:48,010
All residents must immediately
evacuate to the nearest shelter.

231
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,680
This is a public service announcement
for Mitakihara City.

232
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,810
It's here.

233
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,120
Are we going to camp tonight?

234
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,410
That's right!

235
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,290
Tonight, we're camping
here with everyone!

236
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,330
- Yay, camping! We barbeque?
- Homura...

237
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,590
This time...

238
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,100
...I'll put an end to you.

239
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,420
What's wrong, Madoka?

240
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,170
Oh, I'm just going to the bathroom.

241
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,890
Was Homura telling the truth about
being able to win by herself?

242
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,390
Even if I tell you no, would
you believe me anyway?

243
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,650
At this point, explanations are pointless.

244
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,020
You should go and see for yourself.

245
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,400
See how well Homura Akemi is
faring against Walpurgisnacht.

246
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,950
Why does she push herself
that hard to fight?

247
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,790
Because she still hasn't given up hope.

248
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,500
If things go badly, she'll probably just
negate this timeline and try again.

249
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
She'll stubbornly continue her battle,

250
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,460
restarting this meaningless chain
of events over and over.

251
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,340
Because at this point,

252
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,590
it is no longer possible for
her to stop or give up.

253
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,230
The moment she acknowledges that
everything she has done is pointless,

254
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,150
and your fate is impossible to change,

255
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,150
Homura Akemi will fall into despair
and turn into a Grief Seed.

256
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,990
She knows that as well.

257
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,370
And that's why she has no choice.

258
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,620
Whether she has any hope of winning or
not, Homura must continue to fight.

259
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,830
So you're saying that as long as she
continues to hope, she can't be saved?

260
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,130
That's right.

261
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,960
It's just as it was for all the other
magical girls in the past.

262
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,470
Madoka, you saw it all as well, didn't you?

263
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,190
But...

264
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,100
But...!

265
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,560
But...!!

266
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,410
Where do you think you're going?

267
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,870
Mom?

268
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,950
I have to go to save a friend.

269
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,450
Leave it to the firefighters.

270
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,620
Civilians need to stay here.

271
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,120
It has to be me!

272
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,460
You don't live your life just for
yourself, understand?!

273
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,590
Did you even think about how much
we would worry if you went off--

274
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,640
I know.

275
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,800
I understand very well how you feel.

276
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,730
Because I love you and dad that much too.

277
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,810
So I understand how much
you both care about me...

278
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,900
...and I know that I need to take care
of myself for your sakes too.

279
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,360
But this is different.

280
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,570
It's because I treasure all of
you that I must protect you.

281
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,830
To do that, there's someplace
I need to go right now!

282
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,210
And you can't tell me what this is about?

283
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,250
Then I'm going with you.

284
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,300
No.

285
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,090
You have to stay with dad and Tatsuya
and make sure they're safe.

286
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,810
Mom, you told me you had raised me well.

287
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,100
I don't tell lies. I don't do bad things.

288
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,480
Will you believe in me now?

289
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,650
Will you trust that I'll do what's right?

290
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,160
Are you sure you're not making a mistake?

291
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,370
That you're not being misled
by anyone's lies?

292
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,370
Yes.

293
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,500
Thank you, mom.

294
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,860
If I let it get any further...

295
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,320
...the shelter will be attacked.

296
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,490
Whatever happens, I have
to stop it right here!

297
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
No...!

298
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,930
Why...?

299
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,730
Why?! No matter how many times I try...

300
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,480
...why can't I win?

301
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,820
If I go back again...

302
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,280
I'll only make Madoka's destiny worse...

303
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,950
Then in the end...

304
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,660
Everything I've done...

305
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,780
That's enough.

306
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,320
You've done enough, Homura.

307
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,570
Madoka...

308
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,840
Madoka... You didn't...!

309
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,220
Homura... I'm sorry.

310
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,480
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

311
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

312
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,110
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

313
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,160
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

314
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,830
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

315
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,620
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

316
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,250
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

317
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,210
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

318
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,220
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

319
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,890
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

320
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,730
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

321
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,570
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

322
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,400
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

323
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,240
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

324
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,120
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

325
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,960
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

326
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:15,630
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

327
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,190
If someone says it's wrong to have hope...

328
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,440
...then I'll tell them they're
wrong, every single time.

329
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
And I know I'll always tell them so.

330
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,120
FINAL EPISODE: MY VERY BEST FRIEND

331
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,370
My very best friend...
