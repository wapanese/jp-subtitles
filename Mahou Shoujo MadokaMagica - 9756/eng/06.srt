1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,290
It's over!

2
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,560
Homura...?

3
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,690
You!

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,570
Wha--

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,610
What the hell did you do?

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,780
Wha--

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,660
Oh, I see. You're that "irregularity",
aren't you?

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,910
What the heck kind of
magic are you using?

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,160
Stay out of our way!

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,670
Sayaka!

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,430
She's all right. She's only unconscious.

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,470
Who the hell are you?

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,850
Whose side are you on, anyway?

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,100
I am on the side of those
who think rationally,

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,140
and an enemy to those who
engage in needless conflict.

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,890
Which are you...

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,650
...Kyoko Sakura?

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,780
Have we met somewhere before?

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,490
Perhaps. Who knows?

20
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,170
Since I don't know anything about you...

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,880
Well, I'll be taking my leave for today.

22
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,290
That's wise of you.

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,300
You... saved us?

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,810
How many times must I warn you?

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,270
How foolish can you possibly be?

26
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,900
You should not become involved in this.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,650
I've told you many times already.

28
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,490
But I...

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,700
If reasoning with a fool won't work, I
will turn to more drastic measures.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,460
Homura... Why...?

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,050
In any case, it's certain that
she's planning something.

32
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,880
We'll have to be more careful than ever.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,180
Homura Akemi... Could it be that you're...?

34
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,640
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,940
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,850
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

37
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,650
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,750
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

39
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,880
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,720
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,930
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

43
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,860
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,150
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,490
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

46
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,910
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,210
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,630
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

49
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,760
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,470
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,810
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,400
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,390
EPISODE 6: THIS JUST CAN'T BE RIGHT

54
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,560
MIKI

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,820
There, you should be all right for a while.

56
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,660
Ugh, it's pitch black!

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,620
And it's dangerous now.

58
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,700
If it absorbs any more impurity,
a witch could hatch from it.

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,790
Huh?!

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,540
Don't worry. Give it to me.

61
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,180
Now it's safe again.

62
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,220
You ate it?

63
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,970
That's another one of my duties.

64
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,190
But before it comes time to
purify your Soul Gem again,

65
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,860
we'd better hurry and find
another Grief Seed.

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,650
Is it that important to keep
my Soul Gem clean?

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,030
Kyoko Sakura was powerful, wasn't she?

68
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,530
If you have extra Grief Seeds
to clean your Soul Gem with,

69
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,160
you could let loose and waste as much
magic as you want in any fight.

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,580
That's what makes Kyoko so strong.

71
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,750
But I can't let innocent people get hurt
just so I can find more Grief Seeds!

72
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,550
The more you use your magic, the more
polluted your Soul Gem will become.

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,720
Sakyaka, you'll never stand a
chance of defeating Kyoko...

74
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,810
unless you can gather more Grief Seeds.

75
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,850
Hmm... You really think so?

76
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,610
But Mami never had enough Grief Seeds
to keep her Soul Gem clean either.

77
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,740
But she was still able to fight just fine.

78
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,700
Was she just more talented than me?

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Well, there's certainly that.

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,240
Aw, come on!

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,450
That's totally not fair!

82
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,710
That's one thing that really can't be helped.

83
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,460
Kyoko has great inborn talent,
plus plenty of experience.

84
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,880
That said, there's someone with
absolutely no experience...

85
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,590
...whose natural talent would
far exceed Kyoko's...

86
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,260
And who's that?

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,970
Madoka Kaname.

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,390
Madoka? Are you serious?

89
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,970
Yes.

90
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,560
Meaning, if you ultimately can't get
strong enough to defeat Kyoko,

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,900
you also have the option of
asking Madoka to do it.

92
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,360
That is, if she makes a contract with me!

93
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,610
No, that's no good.

94
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,110
This... is my fight, after all.

95
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,990
I won't let her get dragged into it.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,290
CAUTION: NO FOOD OR DRINK ALLOWED.
NO SOLICITATIONS OR LOITERING.

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,640
Yo! So what do you want now?

98
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,190
I want to put this city in your charge.

99
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,610
And why the sudden change of heart?

100
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,400
Girls like you are most suited
to be magical girls.

101
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,990
Sayaka Miki is not qualified.

102
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,320
Hmph!

103
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,620
Well, that's what I was planning
from the start anyway.

104
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,660
So what about that Sayaka girl?

105
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,700
If I leave her alone, she'll probably
come bug me again.

106
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,460
I want that settled as peaceably
as possible.

107
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,710
You keep out of it.

108
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,080
I will handle her myself.

109
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,210
You haven't told me the most
important thing, though.

110
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,680
Who the heck are you?

111
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,930
What's in all of this for you?

112
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,940
Two weeks from now, "Walpurgisnacht"
will descend upon this city.

113
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,690
How do you know that?

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,900
That is a secret.

115
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,320
In any case, if we are able to defeat it,

116
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,320
I will leave this city, and you will be
free to do with it what you please.

117
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,450
"Walpurgisnacht," huh?

118
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,540
Guess it would be pretty tough
to beat it by yourself.

119
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,830
But if we double-teamed it,
we could probably win.

120
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,050
Want some?

121
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,890
It's no use. Too much time has passed.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,150
It looks like we've got no way to trace
the familiar from last night.

123
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,690
I see...

124
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,030
Hey... Sayaka?

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,360
If we keep hunting witches like this,

126
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,820
won't we eventually run into that
girl from yesterday again?

127
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,790
Yeah... it seems pretty likely.

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,370
In that case,

129
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,790
maybe you should look for her ahead
of time and try talking with her first.

130
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,550
Otherwise you might end up
fighting again like yesterday.

131
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,340
"Fighting", you say?

132
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Is that what last night looked
like to you? "Fighting"?

133
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,690
That was an honest-to-goodness
fight to the death.

134
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,230
It was only the first few blows
that weren't lethal.

135
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,270
After that,

136
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,820
both she and I were sincerely trying to kill
each other with every blow we struck.

137
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,280
But that's...!

138
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,860
That's even worse, then!

139
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,740
And you are telling me to talk with
her? That is completely insane!

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
She's willing to let people
become witch food...

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,700
...just so she can collect more Grief Seeds!

142
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,580
How could I ever be civil
with someone like that?!

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,670
Sayaka, you became a magical girl in
order to fight witches, didn't you?

144
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,720
That girl isn't a witch. She's
a magical girl just like you.

145
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,560
If you give her a chance, I’m sure you'll
find a way to become friends.

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,100
Even if your methods are different,

147
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,680
you both feel the same way about wanting
to hunt witches, don’t you?

148
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,060
I'm sure she does...

149
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,770
...and Homura, too.

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,940
I'm sure if Mami hadn't gotten into
a fight with her, she and Homura--

151
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,780
There's absolutely no way!

152
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,110
You saw her, didn't you, Madoka?!

153
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,490
She just waited...

154
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,040
...until that witch had murdered
Mami before she came to help.

155
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,500
Just because she wanted a Grief Seed,
she sat back and let Mami get killed!

156
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,420
No... that's not--

157
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,920
That transfer student and that Kyoko
girl... they're both the same.

158
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
They don't think about anything
but their own benefit!

159
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,890
I understand it now...

160
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,510
Mami was the one exception.

161
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,770
All the rest of the magical girls
are just like those two!

162
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,560
N-no...

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,400
That familiar from last night
might've been small,

164
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,940
but it could still kill someone.

165
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,360
And who knows, maybe its next
target will be your dad or mom.

166
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,200
It might even be little Tatsuya.

167
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,070
Would you be okay with it then, Madoka?

168
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,830
Could you forgive those who stood
by and let them get killed?

169
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,620
I didn't wish for this power just
so I could fight witches.

170
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,130
I wanted the strength to
protect those I love.

171
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,790
Which is why...

172
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,800
If there are humans who are worse than
witches out there, I'll fight them too.

173
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,760
Even if they happen to be magical girls!

174
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,510
Sayaka...

175
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,770
Kyubey, say something...

176
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,940
The only thing I could say to that
is that she's being too reckless.

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,610
As she is now,

178
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,780
Sayaka has no hope of defeating either
Homura Akemi or Kyoko Sakura.

179
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,610
But...

180
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,450
I'm sure Sayaka won't listen to me...

181
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,990
WELCOME HOME.
THERE'S SOME POTATO
SALAD IN THE FRIDGE.
-TOMO

182
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,410
Can't sleep?

183
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,080
No... Can we talk?

184
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,140
One of my friends... is in a lot of trouble.

185
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,140
I don't think anything she's doing
or saying is wrong, but...

186
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,850
Even though she keeps trying so hard to
do the right thing, the more she tries,

187
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,400
the worse things get for her...

188
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,900
That happens quite a bit.

189
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,030
It's sad to say,

190
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,990
but just because you keep
trying to do what's right...

191
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,530
doesn't mean you're guaranteed
a happy ending.

192
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,120
In fact, sometimes people are so sure...

193
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,790
that their way is right that
they become obstinate.

194
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,120
The more they get like that, the
further from happiness they go.

195
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,130
But not ending up happy despite
not doing anything wrong...

196
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,750
That's awful.

197
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,130
It is.

198
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,130
What do you think I should do?

199
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,140
In a case like this,

200
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,180
no one else can bring about
a neat and tidy end to it.

201
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,730
But would you still want to help resolve it,

202
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,150
even if it wasn't a neat and tidy resolution?

203
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,900
Yes.

204
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,650
Then you should make a mistake for her.

205
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,200
Your friend is trying so hard to do right...

206
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,450
...that someone's got to make
some mistakes for her.

207
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,330
Make mistakes...?

208
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,330
Sometimes you tell an awful lie, or
run away from something scary...

209
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,790
...and then later look back...

210
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,500
...and realize that that was actually
precisely the right thing to do, right?

211
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,670
If you can see there's no way for your
friend's problem to end but in disaster...

212
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,720
...it'd be better for her to crash and
burn sooner rather than later.

213
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,220
But do you think she'll understand
that I'm doing it for her own good?

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,810
Sometimes they do, sometimes
they don't - especially at first.

215
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,520
But I warned you it wouldn't
be a pretty ending.

216
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,240
So what seems better to you?

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,110
To give up on your friend, or to
be misunderstood by her?

218
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,830
Madoka... you've grown up
to be a very good girl.

219
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,330
You don't tell lies or do bad things.

220
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,170
You always try your best
to do the right thing.

221
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,000
You've already passed your
childhood with flying colors.

222
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,460
Which is why it may be good for you...

223
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,430
...before you become an adult
- to learn how to mess up, too.

224
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,890
Learn how to mess up?

225
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
After all, wounds heal faster
when you're young.

226
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,480
If you learn how to fall well now,
I'm sure it'll help you later in life.

227
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,690
When you grow up, you see,

228
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,730
the consequences for messing
up get bigger and bigger.

229
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,780
The more responsibilities
you start shouldering,

230
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,780
the more important it gets not
to make a wrong move.

231
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,700
But isn't that... really painful?

232
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,330
Oh, us adults are always in pain.

233
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,170
That's why we're allowed to drink alcohol!

234
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,670
I wish I could hurry up and drink
alcohol with you too, Mom.

235
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,130
Then grow up super-fast, my dear.

236
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,680
For adults, it's only as fun as it hurts!

237
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,110
Oh!

238
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,120
If you're looking for Mr. Kamijo,
he was discharged yesterday.

239
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,040
He was doing so well with
his physical therapy...

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
...that they moved up his discharge date.

241
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,790
O-oh, I see.

242
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,240
Going home without even seeing him?

243
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,950
After you spent the whole day
running around chasing him?

244
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,160
You...

245
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,280
I know who you're after.

246
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,290
The little rich boy who lives here, right?

247
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,460
The one you made the contract
with Kyubey for...?

248
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,120
Jeez!

249
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
You wasted your once-in-a-lifetime
miracle on something that stupid?

250
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,670
What would you know?!

251
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,220
Apparently, a lot more than you, dummy!

252
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,140
Magic is only supposed to be used
to grant wishes for yourself.

253
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,600
If you use it for somebody else,
it always ends up going bad.

254
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,440
Didn't Mami Tomoe even
teach you that much?

255
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,690
If all you wanted was to possess
the boy you love,

256
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,030
aren't there a lot of better ways to do it?

257
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,740
After all, you've got all that magic now...

258
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,490
What?

259
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,200
You should bust in there right now...

260
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,700
...and break his arms and legs so bad
he'll never be able to use them again.

261
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,080
Make him so helpless he won't be
able to do anything without you.

262
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,590
Do that, and this time, he really
will be yours and yours alone.

263
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,130
Both his body and heart will be all yours...

264
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,470
If you don't have the guts to do it, I
wouldn't mind busting him up for you.

265
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,350
You know, as a favor to
my fellow magical girl?

266
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,230
It'd be so easy to do, too...

267
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,400
No way...

268
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,980
You are the one person I'll never forgive!

269
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,650
This time, it ends!

270
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,610
Let's take this some place else.

271
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,650
We're bound to attract attention here.

272
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,830
Your friend is trying so hard to do right...

273
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,460
...that someone's got to make
some mistakes for her.

274
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,670
But how could I ever...?

275
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,790
Madoka...

276
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,130
Madoka!

277
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,260
Hurry! Sayaka's in trouble!

278
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Come with me!

279
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
We won't have to hold back up here.

280
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,150
So gimme your best shot!

281
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,290
Wait! Sayaka!

282
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,000
Madoka...!

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,210
Don't get in my way! You
don't even belong here!

284
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,590
You can't do this! This just can't be right!

285
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,180
Hmph! Annoying jerks sure
attract annoying friends.

286
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,180
Then what kind of friends would
you have, I wonder?

287
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
This isn't what we agreed on.

288
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,940
I thought I told you to leave
Sayaka Miki alone.

289
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,020
Well your way would've been too soft!

290
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,820
Besides, it's not like she's backing down...

291
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,030
I'll take her on, then. Stay out of it.

292
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,530
You got until I finish eating this then.

293
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,490
That's all I'll need.

294
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,030
Don't underestimate me!

295
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,120
Sayaka!

296
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,290
I'm sorry!

297
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,470
Madoka! How could you...?!

298
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,300
Because if I hadn't--

299
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Sayaka?

300
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,930
That wasn't good, Madoka...

301
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,770
No matter how mad you are,

302
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,360
you shouldn't throw your own
friend away like that.

303
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,860
What?

304
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
What did you say?

305
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
No, stop!

306
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,280
What the heck is this?!

307
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,580
She's dead!

308
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,250
Sayaka?

309
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,840
Hey, Sayaka...?

310
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,880
Wake up! Hey!

311
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,470
Come on... What's wrong?

312
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,350
I don't want this... Sayaka...!

313
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,480
What the hell is going on here?

314
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,480
Hey!

315
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,480
It's because the furthest you magical
girls can control your bodies...

316
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,610
...would be within about
a 100 meter radius.

317
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,740
100 meters? What are you talking about?

318
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,620
What do you mean?!

319
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,950
You rarely have this sort of accident...

320
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,080
...because you usually carry
it with you all the time...

321
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,710
What are you saying, Kyubey?!

322
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,960
You have to help her!

323
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Don't let Sayaka die...!

324
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,670
Madoka, that isn't Sayaka.
It's just an empty shell.

325
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,630
Huh?

326
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,390
Sayaka is what you just threw
away a moment ago.

327
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,470
What... did you say?

328
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,850
Did you really think you
could fight witches...

329
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,400
...with the same fragile bodies
that humans possess?

330
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
It's unthinkable.

331
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,110
For magical girls,

332
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,910
those so-called "bodies" that you possess
are really just exterior hardware.

333
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,620
Your real bodies are your souls,

334
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,080
and in order to make them able
to use magic more efficiently,

335
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,710
we put them in these compact,
easy-to-protect forms instead.

336
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,550
To complete the contract to
become a magical girl...

337
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,930
...what I do is rip your souls out of your
bodies and turn them into Soul Gems.

338
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,010
Bastard... What have you done...?!

339
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,760
You've gotta be kidding me!

340
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,180
So now you've made us into
zombies or something?!

341
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,520
But isn't it handy this way?

342
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,690
Even if your body's heart gets crushed,

343
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,900
or you bleed out your very
last drop of blood...

344
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,490
...you can just heal your bodies with
magic and get right back up!

345
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,530
So long as your Soul Gem
remains unharmed...

346
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,030
...you're basically invincible!

347
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,000
Isn't that a lot better for battle than
those breakable human bodies?

348
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,920
That's horrible...

349
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,460
Too horrible for words...

350
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,760
You humans always react this way.

351
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
Whenever I try to tell you the simple facts,

352
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,550
you inevitably have this same reaction...

353
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,260
I just don't get it.

354
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,350
Why are humans so touchy about
the placement of their souls?

355
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,960
What?

356
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,510
What is it?

357
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,690
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

358
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,440

Toki wo koete

00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,360
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo

361
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,030

362
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,820

What do you wish for

363
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,450
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?

364
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,420

365
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,420

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,090

Using an ancient magic

367
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,930
Inishie no mahou no youni

00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,770

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Obieru kono te no naka niwa

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,320

372
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,160
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

373
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:45,840
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

374
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,390
Before you took on this destiny
of battling witches,

375
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,140
wasn't there a wish you wanted granted?

376
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,940
That wish has really has
come true, hasn't it?

377
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,110
EPISODE 7: CAN YOU FACE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS?

378
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,030
That wish has really has
come true, hasn't it?
