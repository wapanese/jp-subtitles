1
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,020
Oh, are you here to see Kamijo?

2
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,850
Y-yes.

3
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,230
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,570
His examination schedule got moved up,
so he's in Physical Therapy right now.

5
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,690
Oh, I see.

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,860
Thank you.

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,530
She comes to see him quite
often, doesn't she?

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,830
It's a big help.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,540
He's a difficult case, that boy.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,540
I really hope she'll become the
encouragement he needs to get better.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,550
Before the accident, he was a child
prodigy, wasn't he? On the violin?

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,260
Even if he's able to walk
again, his fingers...

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,390
...will probably never recover
enough to play again...

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,850
Why did it have to be Kyosuke?

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,820
My fingers work perfectly,
but what good are they?

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,320
Why couldn't it have been
me instead of Kyosuke?

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,540
If I were to use my wish to heal his body...

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,790
...what would Kyosuke think about that?

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,840
Would he just say, "thank you" and
that would be the end of it?

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,010
Or am I hoping he'll say something more?

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm...

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,720
...such a horrible person...

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,060
Now that I think about it, I really didn't
understand anything back then.

24
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,980
Neither what it meant
to pray for a miracle...

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,560
...nor the price of one.

26
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,440
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,740
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,660
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,450
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,550
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

31
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,680
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,610
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

34
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,730
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,660
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

36
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,950
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,290
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

38
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,720
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,010
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

40
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,430
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

41
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,560
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,270
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

43
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,610
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

44
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,200
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,200
EPISODE 4: MIRACLES AND MAGIC ARE REAL

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,090
Madoka!

47
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,890
If you don't hurry and eat,
you'll be late for school.

48
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,180
Oh... right...

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,610
Sis, wat's wong?

50
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,610
D-does it taste bad, honey?

51
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,830
No... It tastes good.

52
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,080
Really, really good...

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm alive... And your cooking...
tastes so good, Dad...

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,630
So I was like, "Jeez, Yuka!"

55
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,260
"You still don’t get it even after all that?!"

56
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,380
And she was like,

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,640
"Huh? Did I say something weird
again?" and got all weepy.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,720
I wanted to laugh so bad!

59
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,770
Sayaka... About yesterday...

60
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,230
Sorry, but can we talk about it later?

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,740
While a woman's prime age for childbirth
is indeed based in medical fact...

62
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,990
...counting backwards from there...

63
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,040
...to determine whether she
is of a marriageable age...

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,960
...is an extremely grave mistake!

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,790
In other words...

66
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,790
...of course women over the age of 30...

67
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,750
...still have a chance of marrying
for love. Therefore...

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,010
...we would use the present progressive
tense here instead of the past perfect--

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,320
It... feels like we're in a foreign
country or something.

70
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,820
Even though nothing about school or
Hitomi has changed since yesterday...

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,120
Somehow, it feels like I'm surrounded
by strangers...

72
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
It's because no one knows.

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,670
No one knows about witches... or Mami...

74
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,130
It's because we know,
and no one else does.

75
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,180
It's like we're seeing and living in an
entirely different world from them.

76
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,600
Sayaka?

77
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,520
But our world had already
changed long before this.

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,520
We should have realized that sooner.

79
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,950
Madoka, do you still want to
be a magical girl, even now?

80
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,290
Yeah, I know.

81
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,830
Well, I can't blame you.

82
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,790
I know it's unfair...

83
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,170
I know it's way too selfish of
me to back out now, but...

84
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,260
But I just can't.

85
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,680
Just thinking about the way she died...

86
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,140
Even now, it gets so hard to breathe...

87
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm scared... I don't want that...!

88
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,320
Mami was truly a kind-hearted person.

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,490
To make us really understand...

90
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,450
...what kind of resolve we'd
need in order to fight, she...

91
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,210
Hey, Kyubey... What's going
to happen to this town?

92
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,420
Who's going to fight to protect everyone
from the witches from now on?

93
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,840
This town has been Mami's
territory for a long time.

94
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,510
But once the other magical girls realize
she's gone, they won't stay back for long.

95
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm sure one of them will arrive
here soon to hunt witches.

96
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,390
But all they care about are
finding Grief Seeds, right?

97
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,020
Just like that transfer student.

98
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,570
It's true that magical girls
like Mami are rare.

99
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,400
Most do approach witch-hunting
with their own benefit in mind.

100
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,360
But it's natural for people to want
to be rewarded for their work.

101
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,410
Then--

102
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,870
But I think the only ones who have
a right to judge their actions...

103
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,750
...are their fellow magical girls, who
bear the same destiny they do.

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,210
All right, I understand.

105
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,340
It really is an awful shame, but
I can't force you, after all.

106
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,550
I guess this is good-bye then.

107
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,720
I'd better go search for girls with greater
need to make a contract with me.

108
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,060
I'm sorry, Kyubey.

109
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,770
No, I should apologize for getting
you mixed up in all this.

110
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,730
Though we weren't together for long,
thank you, Madoka. It was fun.

111
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
I'm sorry...

112
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,160
MAMI TOMOE

113
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,410
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,330
For being so weak...

115
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm sorry...

116
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,300
Homura...

117
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,190
You're blaming yourself too much
for this, Madoka Kaname.

118
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,350
Huh?

119
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,900
No one could criticize you
for anything you've done.

120
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,820
And even if they did, I wouldn't permit it.

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,910
It seems you've taken my warning to heart.

122
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,330
Yeah...

123
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,920
If I had only listened to you earlier...

124
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,340
It wouldn't have changed
Mami Tomoe's fate.

125
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,550
But I was able to change yours.

126
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,510
I'm glad I was able to save
at least one person.

127
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,310
S-say, Homura...

128
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,320
You seem like you're a veteran too. Though
in a different way from Mami...

129
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,530
Perhaps. I won't deny it, at least.

130
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,330
Have you seen a lot of people
die like yesterday?

131
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,750
Yes.

132
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,670
How many?

133
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,880
Too many to try keeping count of anymore.

134
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,510
I wonder if Mami's apartment
will just stay like that.

135
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,140
Mami Tomoe had no close relations.

136
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,940
It will be a long time before a missing
person's report will even be filed for her.

137
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,060
Then, no one will even know
that Mami is dead?

138
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,900
It can't be helped.

139
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,280
If someone dies on the other side,
there won't be a body left behind.

140
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,910
In this world, she will simply remain
a missing person forever.

141
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,950
That is the end that all magical girls meet.

142
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,050
That's horrible!

143
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,390
She fought to protect everyone
for so long on her own!

144
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,400
To think that no one will even
realize she's dead...

145
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,940
...that's just too sad!

146
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,700
That is the nature of the contract
that grants us the power we hold.

147
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,320
And we don't fight to protect people.

148
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,580
We fight for the sake of our own wishes.

149
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,000
If our deaths go unnoticed by others...

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and we are ultimately forgotten
by this world...

151
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,460
I suppose that cannot be helped.

152
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,920
I won't forget...

153
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,970
I'll never forget about Mami!

154
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,760
Never!

155
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,850
I see.

156
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,730
I'm sure with that alone, Mami
Tomoe must truly be happy.

157
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,980
I envy her.

158
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,360
You too, Homura!

159
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,360
You too--

160
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,980
I swear I'll never forget you either!

161
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,360
I'll never forget...

162
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,650
...the way you saved us yesterday!

163
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
Homura...?

164
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,540
You're too kind for your own good.

165
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,370
Huh?

166
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,290
Remember this...

167
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,420
That kindness may bring about
an even greater tragedy.

168
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,900
What are you listening to?

169
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,660
"The Girl With the Flaxen Hair."

170
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,780
Ah, by Debussy, right?

171
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,410
It's such a beautiful song!

172
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:22,210
I-I guess I don't strike people as the type
who would listen to classical music.

173
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,970
Sometimes, people get so surprised
when I can name a piece like that.

174
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,430
I guess it's so unexpected, people
sometimes get impressed with me.

175
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,640
It's only because you taught
me about all this.

176
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,810
If not for you, I may never have given
classical music a real chance.

177
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,940
Maybe not for my whole life, even.

178
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,610
Hey, Sayaka...

179
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,700
What is it?

180
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,200
Are you torturing me?

181
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,830
Why are you still making
me listen to music?

182
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,460
Are you trying to cause me more pain?

183
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,420
But I thought you loved music, Kyosuke...

184
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,510
I don't want to hear it anymore!

185
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,380
I don't want to hear these songs
that I can't ever play again--

186
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,260
That I can only ever listen to anymore!

187
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,470
I just... I just...

188
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,230
I can't move it...

189
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,490
I can't even feel the pain anymore!

190
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,910
What use is a hand like this...?

191
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,280
It's going to be okay.

192
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,990
I'm sure someday, somehow...

193
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,620
Just don't give up hope,
and I'm sure someday--

194
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,370
But they've already told me to give up.

195
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,380
They said I had no chance
of ever performing again.

196
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,170
The doctor came and told me himself.

197
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,380
He said that with current medicine,
it just wasn't possible.

198
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,930
My hand will never move again.

199
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,680
Not until the day miracles or magic
start existing in this world.

200
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,810
They do exist.

201
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,020
Miracles... and magic... are real!

202
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,660
Homura...

203
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,750
When I actually tried talking with her, it
seemed like we could really be friends.

204
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,960
So why did she end up fighting with Mami?

205
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,590
Huh?

206
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,050
Hitomi?

207
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,550
Hitomi!

208
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,380
Don't you have your lessons to--

209
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,930
Huh? It's the same as that woman's--

210
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,730
Hitomi!

211
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,940
Hey! Hitomi, come on!

212
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,900
Ah, Kaname! Good evening.

213
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,110
What's happened to you?

214
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,490
Where are you going?

215
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,070
Where am I going, you ask?

216
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,530
I'm going somewhere
far better than here...

217
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,410
Hitomi...

218
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,290
Oh, yes. You simply must come along!

219
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,380
Yes, indeed. It would be so wonderful!

220
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,130
What should I do?

221
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,220
This couldn't be...?

222
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,230
If only I could contact Homura...

223
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,240
Oh, but I don't have her cell phone number!

224
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,990
It's true... I'm completely... worthless...

225
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,040
I couldn't even keep such
a tiny factory running...

226
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,000
In an era like this one...

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,260
...there's just no place
for someone like me...

228
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,390
Listen closely, Madoka.

229
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,900
Don't ever mistake this one for the
other, or the results could be fatal.

230
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Our entire family could end up dead.

231
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,650
Make sure you never mix up these bottles.

232
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Stop!

233
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,110
You can't use those!

234
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,200
You mustn't interfere.

235
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
This is a sacred ceremony.

236
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,710
But those chemicals! They're dangerous!

237
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,330
Everyone here will die!

238
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,590
That's right.

239
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,760
All of us are going to journey to a
magnificent new world together.

240
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,470
Don't you see how wonderful that will be?

241
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,100
These physical bodies would
simply get in our way.

242
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,270
Kaname, I'm sure you'll
understand very soon...

243
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,320
Let go of me!

244
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,150
W-what should I do?! What should I do?!

245
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,160
No!! No...

246
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,290
This can't...

247
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,090
No! Someone help me!

248
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,710
I wonder if this...

249
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,920
...is my punishment.

250
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,550
For being...

251
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,300
...a coward...

252
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,670
...and a liar.

253
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,380
I guess this...

254
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,390
...is a fitting punishment.

255
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,120
Sayaka?!

256
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,550
This is the end for you!!

257
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Hey, sorry about that!

258
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,610
I cut it pretty darn close, didn't I?

259
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,990
Sayaka...

260
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,280
Those clothes...

261
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160
Huh? Oh...

262
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,080
Uh, well. Guess I had a change of heart.

263
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh, I'll be fine!

264
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,630
After all, I did pretty well for
my first time out, didn't I?

265
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
But...

266
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,010
You...

267
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,230
Aren't you pretty late, Transfer Student?

268
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,300
I didn’t think you would come...

269
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,010
I heard ol' Mami had bought it.

270
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,810
So I came all this way.

271
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,520
But what's the deal?!

272
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,560
Sure looks like the story's changed
from what you told me.

273
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,230
Sorry, but this territory has already been
taken over by another magical girl.

274
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,400
Though she only just made the
contract a short while ago.

275
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,570
What?!

276
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,690
That really pisses me off!

277
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,450
But y'know...

278
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,990
I find the idea...

279
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,530
...of handing such prime territory
over to some rookie hatchling...

280
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,370
...to be pretty annoying.

281
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,750
What do you intend to do, Kyoko?

282
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,210
There's only one thing to do.

283
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,460
I'll put the new girl out of commission.

284
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,050
Permanently.

285
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,440
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

286
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,190

You will turn on in your eyes

287
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,060

Someday will go beyond time

288
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,110
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

289
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,780

That is rushing towards destruction

290
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,570

What do you wish for

291
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,200
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

292
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,170
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

293
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,170
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

294
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,840
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

295
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,680
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

296
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,520
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

297
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,350

And see you smiling

298
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,190
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

299
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,070
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

300
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,910
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

301
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:45,590
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

302
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,060
I'm really getting fired up for this now.

303
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,650
From here on, I - Magical Girl Sayaka -

304
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,360
will keep Mitakihara City super-duper
safe and sound!

305
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,860
EPISODE 5: THERE'S NO WAY I'LL EVER REGRET IT

306
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,530
There's no way I'll ever regret it.
