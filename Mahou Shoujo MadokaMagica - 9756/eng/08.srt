1
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,560
It's easy once you know how to do it.

2
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,980
I’m sure I'll never lose this way.

3
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,460
It's yours.

4
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,420
That's what you're after, isn't it?

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,920
Hey...

6
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,420
I don't want to be in your debt.

7
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Now we're even, got it?

8
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,300
Come on, let's go, Madoka.

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,720
Sayaka...

10
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,070
Ah... Sorry...

11
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm just... a little tired...

12
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,570
Don't push yourself. Lean on me.

13
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,410
That idiot...

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,670
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

15
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,960
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,880
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,680
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

18
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,780
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,910
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

20
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,740
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

21
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,830
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

22
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,960
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

23
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,880
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,180
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

25
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,520
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,940
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,230
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

28
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,650
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

29
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,780
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

30
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,500
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,830
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

32
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,420
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

33
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,380
EPISODE 8: I WAS STUPID... SO STUPID

34
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,020
Sayaka...

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
That way of fighting... it's no good...

36
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,660
You say it doesn't hurt, but you're lying.

37
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,450
I can tell just by looking at you.

38
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,710
Just because you don't feel it, it doesn't
mean it's okay to get hurt.

39
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,420
If I don't fight like that, I can't win.

40
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,090
Because I don’t have any natural talent.

41
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,510
Even if you can use that method to win,

42
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,010
it doesn't mean it's good for you, Sayaka.

43
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,520
What's "good for me?"

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
With my body this way, what could
ever be "good for me?"

45
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,030
Sayaka...

46
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,080
All I can do now is kill witches...

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,830
That's the only worth I
have left in this world.

48
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,790
I'm just a walking, talking corpse,
pretending it's still alive.

49
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,420
What kind of "good" could anyone
possibly do for me now?

50
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,840
It's stupid to even think about it.

51
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,300
But I just want to make you
happy again, Sayaka...

52
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,930
Then you fight them.

53
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,770
I heard from Kyubey that you've got
more natural talent than anyone.

54
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,700
Without even suffering the way I do,
you could finish off any witch easily.

55
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,320
I...

56
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,200
I just...

57
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,330
If you really want to do something for me,

58
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,660
you should experience what
I've experienced first.

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,920
You can't, can you? Of course not.

60
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,960
You can't give up being human just
out of a little pity, can you?!

61
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,710
Pity...?! That's not...

62
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,890
In place of you, who could accomplish
anything but won't--

63
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,350
I am suffering in your stead!

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,480
So don't talk like you care, when you've
conveniently overlooked that!

65
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,980
Sayaka...

66
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,980
Don't follow me!

67
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,210
I'm so stupid...!

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,960
Why did I say all that to her?

69
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,630
I'm beyond saving...

70
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,300
HOMURA

71
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,190
Walpurgisnacht's descent will
occur within this area...

72
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,530
How do you know?

73
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,530
Statistics.

74
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,570
Statistics?

75
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,370
I've never heard that Walpurgisnacht
appeared in this town before.

76
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,120
So what "statistics" are
you estimating with?

77
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,800
Look, I'm not saying we should
trust each other or anything,

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
but can't you show me your
hand just a little bit more?

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
I'd certainly like to ask the same...

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,930
...Homura Akemi.

81
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,390
You've got some nerve showing
your face here!

82
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,270
My, my. I take it I'm an
uninvited guest here?

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,480
And here I came all this way just to give
you some important information...

84
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,530
Sayaka Miki's deterioration is happening
far quicker than I expected.

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
It isn't just all the magic she's using...

86
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,740
She, herself, has begun to curse the world.

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,950
And who's fault do you think that is, huh?

88
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,410
At this rate,

89
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,660
she'll be causing you some trouble...

90
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,120
...before Walpurgisnacht descends.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,670
You'd best be on your guard.

92
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,960
What? What's that supposed to mean?

93
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,210
Perhaps you should ask her instead of me.

94
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,380
I'm sure you already know what I'm
talking about, Homura Akemi.

95
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,810
I thought so.

96
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,390
Just where did you learn
such interesting things?

97
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,390
I'm very, very curious to know...

98
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,230
Are you by chance...

99
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I've heard all I care to hear from you.

100
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,820
Begone.

101
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,450
You're just letting him go?

102
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,540
There's no point in killing that creature.

103
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,620
More importantly, what's
up with Sayaka Miki?

104
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,040
What's this "trouble" that fuzz
ball was talking about?

105
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,800
Her Soul Gem has become too tainted.

106
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,970
If it is not purified soon, there will
be no coming back for her...

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,810
HOMURA

108
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,770
The auxiliary verb, "must," basically means
that et cetera has to be done...

109
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,520
ABSENT

110
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,990
I should have gone after her then...

111
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,710
But Shizuki...

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,840
I never realized that your house
was in this direction.

113
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,130
I feel like I've never seen you walking
home this way before...

114
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,800
You're right.

115
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,300
To be honest, I live in exactly
the opposite direction.

116
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,180
Huh? Then why did you
walk this way today?

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,060
Because, Kamijo...

118
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,900
I have something I need to tell you.

119
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,900
What?

120
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,820
She hasn't been home?

121
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,900
Not since yesterday? That's...

122
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,240
Yes, um...

123
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,240
I understand.

124
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,160
Okay.

125
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,790
Thank you very much.

126
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,300
Sayaka...

127
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,800
I've got to find her!

128
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,070
Why can't you understand?

129
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,490
You don't have the luxury
of killing familiars.

130
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,240
You should target only witches.

131
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,870
Shut up...! I don't need your advice...

132
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,950
Your Soul Gem must be at its limit.

133
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,620
You need to purify it now.

134
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,830
Use this.

135
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,380
What are you planning this time?

136
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,760
Don't be a fool.

137
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,850
You're in no position to be questioning
anyone's help right now.

138
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,720
Or do you simply hate being
rescued that much?

139
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm going to be a different kind
of magical girl from all of you...

140
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,020
That's what I've decided.

141
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,030
I won't forsake anyone, or use anyone...

142
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,860
And I won't associate with
those who do, either.

143
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,030
I don't need thanks or recompense.

144
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,580
I'll be the one magical girl who won't
use her magic for own gain.

145
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,830
You...

146
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,790
...are going to die.

147
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,790
So what if I die?

148
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,580
It just means I won't be able
to kill witches anymore.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,960
It'll mean I won't be of use anymore.

150
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,380
That's fine with me.

151
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,930
Someone like me who can't even defeat
witches... the world doesn't need me.

152
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,600
Why?

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,810
All I want is to save you.

154
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,810
Why can't you trust me?

155
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,150
Why can't I trust you...?

156
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,690
I'm not sure. I just know somehow...

157
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,440
...that you're a liar.

158
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,490
By looking at your eyes, I can tell
you've given up on everything.

159
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
You always recite hollow words.

160
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,410
You're even doing it now.

161
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,710
You say you want to help me, but I know
that's not what you're really thinking.

162
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,920
You're not fooling me.

163
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,210
You do realize that you're just making
Madoka suffer more and more?

164
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,920
Madoka...?

165
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,930
This has nothing to do with her.

166
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,510
You're wrong.

167
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,430
Everything has to do with her.

168
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,190
You're very perceptive.

169
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,650
You're absolutely right.

170
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,860
I have no desire at all to save you.

171
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,240
I just don't want Madoka to have
to watch you destroy yourself.

172
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,490
If you refuse my help here, there
is no recourse for you but to die.

173
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,580
If you will make Madoka grieve
more than she has...

174
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,170
...then I...

175
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,210
...will kill you...

176
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,170
...here and now.

177
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,840
Sayaka Miki...

178
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,760
Hey!

179
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,800
Hurry up and run!

180
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,110
Are you insane?!

181
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,190
Weren't you coming here to save her?

182
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,150
Let go of me...

183
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,280
Oh, I see.

184
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,160
If I keep a grip on you like this,

185
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
you can't use that weird technique
of yours, can you?

186
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,990
What?!

187
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,420
Crap!

188
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,720
No way, man, you can't let the
dumb slut make any excuses.

189
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,100
Gotta get her to fork over all the
money she makes, no shit.

190
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,690
Cuz women are complete morons.

191
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,980
They get money in their hands and
they blow it all on stupid crap.

192
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,360
Yeah, seriously, man...

193
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,110
You just can't treat women
like rational human beings.

194
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,620
You gotta treat'em like they're
stupid dogs or something.

195
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,030
But you know, my stupid hoe would
probably be happy with that!

196
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,700
All I gotta say is, "I'm gonna bust up
your face!" and she shuts right up!

197
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,460
You give'em an inch and they're all over
you, whining to get married and shit.

198
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,170
You just can't let up on them.

199
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,880
I'm like,

200
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,050
"You think a shit-for-brains hostess like
you will still be around in 10 years?"

201
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,220
That hoe body ain't gonna
last forever, y'know!

202
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,100
God, they're so annoying when
it comes time to dump them.

203
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,020
You are really good at dumpin'
hoes, though, Sho. I envy you!

204
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,350
Dude, I gotta learn from you.

205
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,270
Hey, tell me more about her.

206
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,400
Um, what?

207
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,980
The woman you were talking
about just now.

208
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,150
Tell me more about her.

209
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,740
Are you a middle schooler, kid?
You shouldn't be out this late.

210
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,120
That woman... she probably loves you
and tries hard to make you happy.

211
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,210
I bet you know that too, don't you?

212
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,380
And yet you call her a dog? Have
you never told her, "thank you?"

213
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,380
Are you really going to dump her
once she stops being useful?

214
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,800
What the... Do you know this kid?

215
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,380
No...

216
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,430
Hey... is this world even worth protecting?

217
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,300
What have I been fighting for all this time?

218
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,680
Tell me.

219
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,020
You, right now. Tell me.

220
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
Or else, I'll...

221
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,530
Sayaka... Where are you?

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,620
Are you upset with me, too?

223
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,710
If I was, would you turn Sayaka back?

224
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,510
I can't. It's beyond my power to do that.

225
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,470
Hey...

226
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,480
You once told me that I could become
an incredibly powerful magical girl.

227
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,770
Was that true?

228
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,520
"Incredible" doesn't even
begin to describe it.

229
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,320
Your power would be almost
incomprehensible!

230
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,610
You'd probably be the strongest
being in this world!

231
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,490
If I had made the contract with you...

232
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,740
...would Sayaka not have had
to become a magical girl?

233
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,830
Sayaka had her own wish as well.

234
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,870
You really had nothing to
do with her decision.

235
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,670
Why me, though?

236
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,380
I have no idea, either.

237
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,510
Truth be told,

238
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,800
your latent potential is on a scale that
theoretically shouldn't even be possible.

239
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,760
I want someone to come explain
it as much as you do.

240
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,510
Really?

241
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,980
If you were to release your power,

242
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,440
the miracle you could unleash might
twist the very fabric of the universe.

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,030
Why you alone should carry
such unthinkable power...

244
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,650
I can't guess the reason right now.

245
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,650
I...

246
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,660
I always thought there was
nothing special about me.

247
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,580
That I would just kind of
stumble through life,

248
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,830
never being able to help anyone
or be of any use at all.

249
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,920
It was really frustrating and kind
of lonesome to think about.

250
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,050
But I figured there was no helping it.

251
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,220
Though the reality is quite different.

252
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,060
Madoka, if you wished it...

253
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,020
...you could even become
the god of this world.

254
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,650
Then...

255
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,820
Would I be able to do things that
even you can't do, Kyubey?

256
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,980
What do you mean?

257
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,320
If I made a contract with you, would I be
able to turn Sayaka human again?

258
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,620
That would be child's play for you.

259
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,410
Would that be worth trading
your soul for, then?

260
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,000
For Sayaka, yes.

261
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,330
I'll do it.

262
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,920
Make me into a mag--

263
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,110
Th-that's horrible...

264
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,860
You didn't have to kill him--

265
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,190
You--

266
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,740
Why must you always try to
sacrifice yourself like that?

267
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,450
Huh?

268
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,580
Calling yourself useless,
and meaningless...

269
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,410
Don't treat yourself like you don't matter!

270
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,920
Think about all the people who
consider you precious!

271
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,540
Stop being such a fool!

272
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,090
There are so many people who
would grieve if you died.

273
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,010
Why can't you understand that?!

274
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,090
What about the people who are
trying so hard to protect you?!

275
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,270
Homura...!

276
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,480
Have the two of us...

277
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,150
Have the two of us...
met somewhere before...?

278
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,650
That's...

279
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,200
I've got to go find Sayaka.

281
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,700
Wait!

282
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,120
Sayaka Miki is already...

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,500
Wait!

285
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,050
Madoka!

286
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,350
You knew there was no point in doing that.

287
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,390
You just don't learn, do you?

288
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,770
I have countless spares, of course,

289
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,520
but making me use them up
for no reason like this...

290
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,940
It's a waste.

291
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,250
That's the second time you've killed me.

292
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,790
But thanks to that, I was finally able to
see what your magical specialty is.

293
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,170
That was Time Magic, wasn't it?

294
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,800
That's what I thought.

295
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,930
I had suspected as much already, but...

296
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,810
You're not from this timeline, are you?

297
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,100
I know what you really are
and what you're planning.

298
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,520
I see.

299
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,820
So that's why you've been trying so
hard to keep interfering with me.

300
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,650
Do you want to change Madoka
Kaname's fate that badly?

301
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
Yes.

302
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,660
I won't let things go according
to your plans, Kyubey.

303
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,830
Or should I say...

304
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,830
..."Incubator?"

305
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,260
Found you at last!

306
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,390
How long were you planning to
go on being stubborn like this?

307
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,770
I'm sorry for making you look for me.

308
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,520
What?

309
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,610
That doesn't sound like you.

310
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,860
It's because I just can't care
about anything anymore.

311
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,780
I can't even remember what I thought was
so important, so worth protecting...

312
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,870
None of it makes sense anymore.

313
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,330
Hey...

314
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,550
Hope and despair balance
back out to zero...

315
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,010
You told me that once, didn't you?

316
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,010
Now I get what you meant.

317
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,640
It's true that I've saved a few people.

318
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,520
But in equal measure, my heart became
filled with resentment and hatred.

319
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,940
So much so that I even
hurt my dearest friend.

320
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,360
Sayaka! You didn't--?

321
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,900
For as much happiness as
we wish on one person,

322
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,450
we can't help but curse someone else.

323
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,910
That's how it works for us magical girls.

324
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,000
I was stupid... so stupid.

325
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,570
Sayakaaaa!!

326
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,370
In this country, half-grown women
are called "girls," right?

327
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,000
In that case,

328
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
it's appropriate that you, who will
one day grow into witches,

329
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,790
should be called "magical girls."

330
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,770
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

331
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,520
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

332
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,400
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

333
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

334
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,110
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

335
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,910
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

336
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,540
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

337
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,500
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

338
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

339
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,180
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

340
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,010
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

341
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,850
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

342
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,690
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

343
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,530
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

344
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,400
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

345
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,240
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

346
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:45,920
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

347
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,850
Maybe I'm being a fool...

348
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,060
But until I know for sure whether
she can or can't be saved,

349
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,860
I don't want to give up.

350
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,150
EPISODE 9: I'D NEVER ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN

351
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,490
I'd never allow that to happen.
